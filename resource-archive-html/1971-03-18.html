<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>SPECIALIST TEACHERS FOR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED CHILDREN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Availability of)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Education  how  many teachers have been  specially

trained  to teach physically handicapped children,

and   whether  more  of  such  teachers  will   be

available  to voluntary organisations  established

to care for handicapped children.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  to  date ten  teachers  have  been

specially  trained to teach physically handicapped

children. Two specially trained teachers have just

been  appointed and another teacher  has  returned

with  specialist training. Arrangements have  been

made  to  post these three specialist teachers  to

the relevant voluntary organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two more teachers are at present undergoing

training  in overseas institutions, and  they  are

expected to complete their training some time this

year.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

does the Minister of State consider the number  of

available teachers adequate for the needs  of  the

institutions which care for physically handicapped

children?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in his

original  question the Member for Katong has  only

asked  for those who have been specially  trained.

However,  I  am able to say that, in  addition  to

this number, there are some 22 other teachers  who

have  also  been  seconded  to  various  voluntary

organisations.

<div align="center"><b>EMPLOYMENT OF PERSONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FROM SOCIAL WELFARE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>INSTITUTIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Social Affairs what efforts have been made to find

employment  for  persons who have been  discharged

from  approved  schools and homes  of  the  Social

Welfare Department or who are under probation.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the Social Welfare

Department  operates 12 residential  institutions.

However,  as  the Member's question  is  concerned

with employment, consideration need not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



given  to  three  of  these institutions,  namely,

Perak House, the Welfare School for Boys at Keppel

Road, and Woodlands Home, as the residents therein

are either too young or too old for employment. Of

the   remaining  nine  institutions,  one  is   an

approved  school (Gimson School)  for  young  male

offenders  up  to 19 years old; three  (Toa  Payoh

Girls'  Home, the Muslim Women's Welfare Home  and

Mount  Emily Girls' Home) are approved  homes  and

places  of  safety for women and girls  up  to  21

years  old; three (Bukit Batok Boys' Hostel, Pasir

Panjang  Boys'  Hostel  and  Canning  Rise  Girls'

Hostel) are hostels for youths who have no  proper

home  to  go  to  after they are  discharged  from

Social Welfare institutions or placed on probation

by  the  Courts;  and two (Bushey  Park  Home  and

Woodstock Home) are homes for destitute persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Social Welfare Department employs three

Aftercare  Officers and other ancillary  staff  to

look  after  the welfare of discharged  residents.

During  the  past  five years,  some  611  persons

discharged  from Social Welfare homes were  placed

in  gainful employment. The number of such persons

who found employment has increased each year, from

96  in 1966, 101 in 1967, 112 in 1968, 146 in 1969

to 156 in 1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the youths and boys, the main type of work

found  for  them  is manual work,  which  includes

casual    labourers,   shop   assistants,   hawker

assistants,  petrol  kiosk  attendants,  sweepers,

lorry  attendants, factory operatives, etc. A  few

have  been  placed in semi-skilled  jobs  such  as

welders, greasers and motor mechanics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the women and girls, the two main types of

work  found for them are domestic help and factory

operatives.  Other types of work  found  for  them

include  seamstresses, clinic assistants, building

labourers, eating-stall assistants, clerks, police

trainees,   telephone  operatives,  petrol   kiosk

attendants, hotel and cafe waitresses, salesgirls,

book-binders, etc.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the destitute adults, our officers have

encountered  difficulties  in  placing   them   in

employment  because  of their  poor  physical  and

mental  condition.  Many of them  are  also  quite

indifferent or unwilling to work, and  the  Social

Welfare Department is doing everything possible to

motivate them and to get them accustomed  to  work

by organising them into work squads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second part of the question on

the  employment of those under probation, the care

and  supervision  of juvenile and adult  offenders

placed    on    probation   are   the    statutory

responsibilities  of the Probation  and  Aftercare

Department  of  my  Ministry.  The  Probation   of

Offenders  Ordinance provides the Courts  with  an

alternative  method of dealing with offenders  who

might  otherwise  have  to  be  committed   to   a

corrective  or  penal  institution.  This   method

involves  the conditional suspension of punishment

while the offender is released under the care  and

supervision of a probation officer. The  probation

system  has  over  the  years  proved  to  be   an

effective   method   of  rehabilitating   selected

offenders of both sexes and of all age groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to say that at any one time at least

80   per  cent  of  the  adult  probationers   are

gainfully  employed. In respect of the  employment

of  juvenile probationers, the employment rate  is

very  much lower, at about 40 per cent. More often

than  not,  the juvenile probationer is too  young

for  employment.  In such cases every  attempt  is

made  by  the  probation  officer  to  secure  the

probationer's  connection  with  youth  clubs  and

generally in useful pre-occupations.

<div align="center"><b>PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PERSONS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Training and employment)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Social  Affairs  (a)  whether adequate  facilities

exist   for  physically  handicapped  persons   to

receive  such training as will fit them  for  some

type of employment; (b) what help is given to such

persons towards obtaining employment; and  (c)  if

he will consider



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>



introducing the necessary legislation  to  provide

employment     opportunities    for     physically

handicapped  persons who have received appropriate

training.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government  has  a  scheme to assist  persons  who

become disabled through accident or disease.  This

scheme,  which is administered by the Ministry  of

Labour, provides training for disabled persons  in

order  to  enable  them to regain  their  economic

independence.  Training is normally  given  for  a

period  of six months initially, and this  may  be

extended  for  a further three months.  A  monthly

subsistence allowance of $30 to $50 is payable  to

each  trainee. Tuition fees and cost of  materials

are   provided,  where  necessary.  In  1970,   31

disabled persons benefited from this scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many voluntary organisations are engaged in

welfare  work  among  the  physically  handicapped

groups,  such as the blind, the deaf, the spastic,

the  paraplegics,  and so on.  The  services  they

provide  are mainly educational, although some  of

these  organisations also have vocational training

facilities   for   those  physically   handicapped

persons who are in the employable age group. These

organisations  run training centres and  sheltered

workshops.  However,  these training  centres  and

workshops  are still in the process of development

and   consequently   the  number   of   physically

handicapped persons they can cope with is limited.

In  1970, approximately 950 physically handicapped

children and 100 adults received special education

and  training at some 15 schools, training centres

and    sheltered    workshops.    The    voluntary

organisations are doing a good job in this field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to say whether the existing

training facilities are adequate or otherwise,  as

statistics are still being compiled on the  number

of physically handicapped persons who require such

training. The Social Welfare Department has set up

a Rehabilitation Unit to liaise with the voluntary

organisations,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>



to help in the compilation of such statistics, and

to   consider  the  need  for  expanding  existing

training facilities. The unit is in the process of

compiling   a   central  register  of  handicapped

persons  in  order  to obtain  relevant  data  for

planning purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rehabilitation Unit of the Social Welfare

Department is presently exploring ways  and  means

by  which physically handicapped persons could  be

rehabilitated. Every encouragement and  assistance

is  being  given  by the Department  to  voluntary

organisations  to  enable  them  to  expand  their

training  facilities. In 1970, a sum  of  $622,057

was   expended  in  assisting  voluntary   welfare

organisations. This sum comprised $341,457 in  the

form  of  grants  and  $280,600  in  the  form  of

salaries  for 32 teachers and nine instructors  in

voluntary  institutions catering  for  handicapped

groups. The unit is also introducing an employment

placement   service  for  physically   handicapped

persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the second part of the question, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, a number of Government  departments

and  voluntary  welfare  organisations  are  doing

whatever  they can to help physically  handicapped

persons  find suitable employment. However,  their

efforts in this direction have not been altogether

successful.  There  are a number  of  reasons  for

this,  one  of which is the prejudice  among  many

employers  who,  for  one  reason  or  other,  are

reluctant   to   employ   physically   handicapped

persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the next few months I hope to

make  a series of visits to factories with a  view

to  seeing what opportunities exist and what could

further   be   done  to  secure   employment   for

handicapped persons in industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the last part of the question, Sir,

it  is  not possible to say at this stage  whether

the    Government   will   consider    introducing

legislation   to   provide  for   the   compulsory

employment  of physically handicapped persons  who

have  received the appropriate training.  Once  we

know  the  extent of this problem, and  if  it  is

found  that,  on a voluntary basis, it  cannot  be

resolved, legislation may be considered, as has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>



been  introduced in many countries. It  is  hoped,

however,  that  even without compulsion  employers

will themselves offer employment opportunities  to

the less fortunate among us.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Sir, in view of

the   fact  that  about  800  industrial   workers

annually  become  disabled because  of  industrial

injuries  will  the  Minister for  Social  Affairs

consider expanding the rehabilitation centres  for

such  persons and, when it is completed,  transfer

such responsibilities to the Ministry of Labour?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Wok:</b> Sir, as I have said at the

beginning  of  my  answer, this  comes  under  the

portfolio  of  my  colleague,  the  Minister   for

Labour. Perhaps he can explain to the Member.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Rajaratnam, would you like to

explain?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

not aware of what the question is!



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> In view of the fact that

about  800 industrial workers have become disabled

because  of industrial injuries, will the Minister

for   Foreign  Affairs  and  Minister  for  Labour

consider expanding the rehabilitation centres  for

such  persons with a view to obtaining  employment

for them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are prepared

to consider anything, but I cannot tell the Member

at the moment what the result will be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for consideration in Committee of

Supply [1st Allotted Day].



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>2.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Estimates of Expenditure of

Singapore for the financial year 1st April,  1971,

to 31st March, 1972, contained in Paper Cmd. 3 of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



1971. I intend taking the total for each head of

expenditure as it appears in the last column of

the Abstract of Estimated Expenditure on pages 51

and 52 of the Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal first with the heads of expenditure

in respect of which amendments stand on the Order

Paper Supplement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0104 -



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Ramaswamy (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated

for Head 0104 be reduced by $10 in respect of

subhead 2006.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am moving this amendment in order to bring to

the  notice of this House that the toilet adjacent

to  the  Stamp Office on the ground floor  of  the

Supreme Court building is dirty and also smells. I

understand  it  is  being used by  the  public.  I

notice  that the Government is prosecuting private

firms and the public for not keeping their toilets

clean. But the courts which impose a fine on these

people are themselves not keeping their toilets in

the  building  clean. They appear to be  breaching

the law. I wonder who will prosecute those who are

responsible  for  maintaining  this  building.  To

remedy  this situation, I suggest that the  toilet

be  looked  after by an attendant and a charge  be

levied if it is a public toilet.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you will

have  noticed that a new feature in this  House  -

whether desirable or undesirable I do not  know  -

is  the  increasing interest shown by some Members

in toilet attendants and toilet conditions. May  1

say  at this stage that I am not in charge of  the

courts. There are two toilets in the Supreme Court

building, one on the first floor and the other  on

the  ground floor. These two toilets are used  not

only  by  litigants but also by numerous witnesses

to cases in court and by members of the public. It

is,  therefore, difficult to prevent these persons

from  dirtying the toilets, short of  employing  a

full-time attendant. But even an attendant will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



be of little use unless be follows these persons

into, the toilets. I understand that the present

cleaning contractor cleans these toilets twice

daily, once in the morning and once in the

afternoon. Arrangements have since been made to

have the toilets cleaned three times a day. I hope

that satisfies the Member for Potong Pasir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I think the courts will not accept

this kind of excuse if it is offered by offending

members of the public. However, I beg leave to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $2,261,400 for Head 0104 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0107 -



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move, That the sum to be allocated

for Head 0107 be reduced by $10 in respect of

subhead 2003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very concerned about the drastic reduction

in the provision of bursaries and other assistance

for  students of higher institutions by  $521,500.

In  the Memorandum on the Estimates of Revenue and

Expenditure,  it is explained that this  reduction

is  partially offset by provision for  "industrial

development      scholarships",     "scholarships,

fellowships and .training courses" and "printing",

though   I   cannot  imagine  how   printing   can

substitute  for  bursaries!  The  Memorandum  also

mentions  study loans. I would like to know,  Sir,

how  much is being made available for study  loans

and the terms and conditions for the award of such

loans.  I would think that some provision is  also

necessary  for special loans to students  to  help

them   support  their  families  while  they   are

studying.  One comes across too many  cases,  Sir,

where  bright students have had to give  up  their

studies  even  though  they have  scholarships  or

bursaries, because their families rely on them for

financial support. I speak with some authority  on

the  subject, Sir, because I very nearly became  a

casualty my.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



self.  Fortunately, when I went to  study  for  my

Ph.D, under  a  fellowship,  I  was   given   an

additional amount to help support my family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at a time when our economy is booming, it would seem to me to be unwarranted to reduce expenditure on such essential things as bursaries and scholarships. We should not only be increasing the number of awards available but also actively consider new schemes to enable people

from poor families to obtain better education. The

handicaps   to  the  poor  students  are   already

tremendous,  if  one  thinks of  the  over-crowded

living  conditions  and the  cultural  poverty  of

their   homes,   in  addition  to  the   financial

hardships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every bit of talent that we can salvage will be

an  asset  to  Singapore. We can  hold  our  heads

proudly when we can truly say that no one is  poor

because   of  undeveloped  talents  or   lack   of

opportunity.  I  would  like  to  see,  therefore,

greater  efforts  being made in  future  years  to

ensure  the  greatest  possible  scope  for  human

development. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Sir, there has been a change

in  the  system of awarding bursaries  since  some

three years ago. Until then the award of bursaries

was partly based on merit - the performance of the

students  --and  partly  based  on  the  financial

circumstances  of their families. The  result  was

quite  unsatisfactory  because  the  two  do   not

necessarily  go together. The present position  is

to  award bursaries strictly on the performance of

the students, that is, on merit. The bursaries are

awarded  to  the value of anything  from  $750  to

$1,500  or  $2,000 a year. On the other  hand,  we

have taken into account that there may be students

who  are  not  of  outstanding  ability  but  who,

nevertheless, can perform reasonably well  in  the

universities  and  whose  families   may   be   in

straitened  circumstances. For  such  students  we

offer loans. Over the last three years. There have

been  something like a hundred loans offered under

the scheme to the value of around $500 a year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether one should take into account the putative

loss  of  earnings to the family by  reason  of  a

student's  going  to  the  university  instead  of

finding a job is, I think, a new principle.  I  do

not  know  which country compensates families  for

this kind of loss of possible earnings. I doubt if

there are any. I myself do not think that this  is

warranted under the circumstances for two reasons.

First,  I  do not believe that in Singapore  there

has been a loss of brain power of high calibre  by

reason  of  the  poverty  of  the  families.   The

bursaries,  the  wide range of  Colombo  Plan  and

other  scholarships to universities abroad, ensure

that  any outstanding students will have the  best

opportunities  to  get the most suitable  form  of

university  education. I  have  made  a  point  of

inquiring into the background of scholars who have

returned from overseas courses on Colombo Plan  or

other  scholarships. I have also made  the  point,

when   interviewing  young  administrative   cadet

officers  and other Government personnel on  their

entry  into  the  service, to inquire  into  their

family background. It is astonishing that the vast

majority, of these young men and women  who  have

performed extremely well in the university here in

Singapore came from very humble family background.

For  the  most  part, their fathers  would  be  in

occupations  such'  as  cooks,  taxi  drivers   or

mechanics.  Those  with more affluent  occupations

would  be  minor contractors and Chinese  medicine

men.  This  provides strong evidence that  in  our

society  no  school boy need be  deprived  of  the

highest educational opportunities because  of  the

poverty of his family. Of course, now that we have

national  service  and  now  that  Higher   School

Certificate boys have to do two and a half  years'

service  in  the  army,  if  the  family   is   in

straitened  circumstances, one very  good  way  of

getting  a  university education  and  earning  an

income at the same time would be to take a regular

commission, when the boy can do his degree  course

in the University while holding a commission as  a

Lieutenant or Second Lieutenant earning  something

like $500 or $600 a month

I  hope  that we will dare to take first steps  in

new  directions  which other  countries  have  not

hitherto taken. But in view of the fact that there

is hope for the future, I beg leave to withdraw my

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,523,430 for Head 0107 ordered to

Head 0108 -



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0108 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1028.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the estimate is for Office Boys

(Supernumerary).  The  Concise  Oxford  Dictionary

that   I   referred  to  gives  the   meaning   of

supernumerary as "in excess of the normal number".

In the estimates for 1969-70, the number of office

boys asked for under this category was one person.

In  the estimates for 1970-71, the request was for

five   supernumerary  office   boys.   The   Audit

Department has also requested this year for  seven

supernumerary general clerical assistants. In each

and  every instance, a token vote of $10 has  been

asked for and granted up to now, last year and the

year before last. Sir, it seems strange to me that

year after year the number of office boys required

has  been progressively increased. If there  is  a

real  and  increasing need for office boys,  there

should  have been some systematic arrangement  for

recruiting office boys as such. I do not seriously

think  that there is a shortage of applicants  for

jobs  as office boys. But if there is no real need

for  office  boys,  it  is  rather  misleading  to

provide  for an increasing number of supernumerary

office boys under a token vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question is whether it is necessary to

increase  the number of supernumerary office  boys

under   a   token  vote  and  what  is  the   real

significance, if any, in such increase in number?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Sir, the answer to the Member's

question is national service. This is one  of  the

side  effects of national service and  this  token

provision  of $10 is merely to meet the  need  for

the  employment  of  office  boys  temporarily  to

replace  those permanently recruited  office  boys

who may be required to do their national service.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, as I have said, the

number of office boys required has increased  from

one  to  five to seven from one year to the  next,

and the Department is asking for only $l0. How can

they  ever  replace these office boys who  go  for

national  service with a $10 token vote?  Do  they

want the office boys or do they not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> This is a token vote of $10. But it

does  not mean that all we need is one office boy.

Hence  the token vote. We cannot pay $10  for  one

office boy. That is not enough. We need much  more

money.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I think the point has

been  made  and  I  beg  leave  to  withdraw   the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Hwang Soo Jin.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to

speak  on  general  matters  pertaining  to  audit

against  this particular subhead which relates  to

the  salary of the Deputy Auditor-General, because

the   Auditor-General's   salary   is.   I   think

appropriately, not a subject for question by  this

House.  The freedom that he requires for the  kind

of   proper  scrutiny  that  is  involved  in  the

exercise  of his functions is something  that  the

House must indeed value. I merely wish to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



note  gladly  that an increase of  $153,850  under

personal  emoluments will be for the provision  of

20  new posts to cope with additional audit,  such

as the People's Association audit and the Economic

Development Board audit, and so on. It  is  highly

probable  that the Auditor-General is taking  over

the  audit  of these institutions as a  matter  of

convenience. I do not know. But I would also  like

to  express  the hope that this should presage  an

acceptance  of the principle of surveillance  that

the   Auditor-General  should  exercise  over  the

accounts  of  statutory  institutions  and   other

enterprises which wholly make use of public funds.

It   is   possible  that  the  staff  requirements

necessary for an extension of the functions of the

Auditor-General's Department may be  difficult  to

come by. I hope that every effort will be made  to

overcome  any difficulties that may stand  in  the

way of the Auditor-General's exercising his proper

functions as completely and as freely as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I would just like to seek clarification on a small

point.   According  to  the  Memorandum   on   the

Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure. It is stated

that  one reason that accounts for the bigger vote

required  is  that "the Department would  like  to

conduct  special investigation which would examine

such  problems as wastage and effectiveness." Sir,

problems  such  as  wastage and  effectiveness,  I

should  have  thought,  are already  being  looked

after  by  the Organisation and Methods Branch  of

the  Treasury and duplication of the same  service

surely  will  only  result  in  wastage.  Can  the

Minister please clarify?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee (for the Prime Minister):</b> The

Member for Katong wants to know whether the powers

of  the Auditor-General should not be extended  to

all  statutory  authorities  and  all  enterprises

wholly  owned  by  the Government.  In  regard  to

statutory  authorities,  it  may  or  may  not  be

appropriate for the Auditor-General to audit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



the  accounts. This is usually provided for in the

Ordinance establishing the particular authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards enterprises wholly owned by the

Government  such as the Neptune Orient  Lines  and

Chartered  Industries,  they  are  run  purely  on

commercial  lines  and I do  not  think  that  the

Auditor-General  can  do  a  better  job  than   a

professional firm of auditors. The Auditor-General

does not employ qualified accountants, and his job

is not to see whether departments or the authority

is  run  on  proper  commercial  lines.  His  main

function is to ensure that public funds are  spent

with  proper  covering approval and in  accordance

with  procedures  laid down. For  instance,  if  a

particular department spends $5 million on flowers

and  flower  pots, it is not the business  of  the

Auditor-General to observe that this is a waste of

public   funds  if  that  particular   expenditure

appears in the estimates and has been approved  by

Members. All he has to see is that the expenditure

has  the covering approval in the estimates passed

by  Parliament  and the method of purchase  is  in

accordance with financial procedures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a company auditor doing the

accounts  of  Neptune Orient  Lines  or  Chartered

Industries,  he  has to make  sure  as  well  that

expenditures  are  properly  incurred  which  will

increase  the profitability or efficiency  of  the

business.  There  are  two  separate  concepts  of

auditing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the inquiry by the Member for Ulu

Pandan -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Member for Jalan Kayu!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I am sorry. He is the Member

for   Jalan   Kayu.  Sir,  Parliament   meets   so

infrequently that it is quite a task  to  remember

which constituency belongs to which Member.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auditor-General will take into account waste

incurred, for instance, in disposal of stores  and

whether  the disposal of surplus stores  has  been

done  properly. He observes. He takes note whether

waste is incurred in this sense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibility of the Organisation and

Methods  Branch  is  rather different.  They  will

consider whether the staff is adequate or  surplus

to the requirements of a department or a Ministry.

They  will see whether responsibilities and duties

are   fairly   shared  among   officers   in   the

department. They look into questions like the most

suitable  type  of equipment, typewriters,  adding

machines  or whatever is requested by a department

or  Ministry. By and large, they are not concerned

with  waste  incurred in the day-to-day accounting

or   day-to-day   running   of   departments   and

Ministries.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Amendment No. (4) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0201 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3011.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the creation of an Anti-Pollution Unit is a

timely  and wise move. The fact that this unit  is

placed  under the direct supervision of the  Prime

Minister  reflects the importance of the pollution

problem.  This is especially so when Singapore  is

now   undergoing  a  transformation  through   the

process  of  industrialisation  and  urbanisation.

Although the environmental problems in our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



island  state  have  not yet reached  a  state  of

gravity, it is, of course, very logical for us  to

tackle  the problems early if we are to avoid  the

environmental   crises   that   other    developed

countries  have to face. Sir, in this  connection,

Members  of the House would like to know from  the

Prime Minister about all the necessary measures he

will  take  to deal with the problem of pollution,

and  whether he will send abroad a senior official

of  the  Anti-Pollution Unit to study  the  latest

technique of dealing with this matter. Sir, I  beg

to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, while I welcome the

setting  up  of the Anti-Pollution  Unit,  I  must

express  some dissatisfaction with the  manner  in

which  the  implementation of  our  Anti-Pollution

Campaign has been carried out this far. It  is  my

hope  that  the proposed unit will help to  remove

the  cause of my dissatisfaction. I have, however,

to seek further clarification about the unit as  I

have  noted  that  the sum of  $164,230  has  been

allocated  for  the  17  staff  in  the  unit.  My

questions are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Has this unit been set up yet? If so, where

does it operate from?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What are the functions of the unit?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Which department will be the enforcing

authority  of  the  anti-pollution   measures

taken by the Government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we notice that several Ministries or

departments, such as the Ministry of  Health,  the

Police Force of the Ministry of Home Affairs,  the

Registry  of  Vehicles, and the  statutory  boards

such  as  the  Port  of  Singapore  Authority  are

responsible  for the enforcement of various  anti-pollution  measures. Is it possible for the  Anti-

Pollution  Unit to be made the sole authority  for

the  enforcement  of  the  various  anti-pollution

measures?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee (for the Prime Minister):</b> Sir,

the  Member for Mountbatten has voiced what  seems

to me to be a popular misconception of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



sources   of   pollution.   He   links   it   with

industrialisation. I assume he is referring to air

pollution.  Possibly more than  three-quarters  of

air  pollution  is caused by motorcars  and  motor

vehicles,  and  even by those  without  smoke.  We

cannot  eliminate  this kind  of  pollution  until

motorcar  manufacturers come out  with  an  engine

that  does  not emit so much poisonous  substances

into   the   air.  As  for  industrial  pollution,

possibly  the  most  serious would  be  the  power

stations. We use fuel oil with a very high sulphur

content. It is quite an easy method to reduce  air

pollution  in this respect, but it does mean  that

it will cost much more to generate electricity and

we  will  have  to charge the consumers  more  for

their light and power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah wants to know

whether the Anti-Pollution Unit does exist and, if

so,  where it is. The unit does exist. Its office,

I  believe,  is  in  the Public Works  Department.

Their  present  team of scientists  of  very  high

calibre -, all three of them - have gone abroad to

study  air  pollution problems; one to  Australia,

the  second  to America, and the third to  Europe.

Their  functions  are  not  those  of  enforcement

agencies.  They  have  to study  the  problem  and

establish  monitoring stations of  which  quite  a

number  have been set up in Singapore.  They  will

then  make  recommendations to the Prime  Minister

and advise him on measures, including legislation,

and  the  policy  best suited  to  our  situation.

Enforcement   authorities  will  depend   on   the

legislation.   For  instance,  the   P.W.D, will

probably   be   called  in  to  enforce   measures

connected  with drains, sewers, etc. The  Ministry

of Health will certainly be called upon to enforce

standards  of  hygiene and so on.  The  matter  is

still at a very preliminary stage of study and  in

the  years  to come we shall no doubt  see  action

developing in this field.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> The pollution caused by

industrialisation  is  not only  confined  to  air

pollution  caused by emission of smoke, etc.  What

about  the  pollution of water  wastes  and  solid

wastes? Do all these come under, the study of  the

Anti-Pollution Unit?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Indeed. The pollution of water

wastes is a very serious subject, because we  want

to ensure the largest possible sources of good and

clean water for our own domestic use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0201 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that under this subhead there was a

provision  of  $24,000 for the year  1970-71,  but

that  it  has  been  reduced to  $20,000  for  the

ensuing financial year. I wish to know whether the

facilities has been reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall also be obliged if the Minister can give

us  details  of how many Members are  using  these

facilities,  and what are the languages  they  are

learning. I understand that it is difficult to get

Hokkien  teachers. I wish to know whether this  is

true.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member was kind enough to

let  me  know what he intends to raise under  this

subhead, and I am therefore able to give him  some

details   of  the  extent  to  which  Members   of

Parliament  are  making  use  of  this  vote   for

language training. In 1968 there were 14 M.P.s. In

1969-70,  the  number increased to 16.  This  year

there are 17 M.P.s studying the various languages.

I  regret  to say that most of them are Ministers.

Backbenchers  do  not seem to be very  anxious  to

equip themselves with a knowledge of languages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the difficulty of getting Hokkien

teachers, I do not see why this should be  so.  My

colleague,   the   Minister   for   Science    and

Technology,  is  studying  Hokkien.  So   are   my

colleagues,  the  Minister for Education  and  the

Minister  of  State for Finance, as  well  as  the

surely  delight the Member for Whampoa. The reason

is  not  that  the Prime Minister is reading  more

books.  The  reason  is  that  certain  heads   of

free  by the Government Printer, now have  to  pay

for  them. So we are applying principles of market

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>



doing  so, I am in full sympathy with him for  not

having a Permanent Secretary to assist him in  his

duties.  The Minister is performing the  important

task  of  promoting  science  and  technology  and

tapping   the   resources   of   scientists    and

technologists   to  help  our  republic   in   its

industrialisation and development  programmes.  He

is now already in his fourth year of office as the

Minister for Science and Technology, and yet today

he  is  still  without a Permanent Secretary.  The

need  is  even  more  obvious and  great  at  this

juncture,  especially when he is also concurrently

the   Vice-Chancellor   of   the   University   of

Singapore. It may be construed from this state  of

affairs  that his Ministry is a baby uncared  for,

or  that  his  Ministry is discriminated  against.

Obviously  there must be some reasons. Members  of

from the Minister whether he will have a Permanent

second  reason, of course, is that as the Minister

I  am very much conscious of Parkinson's law,  and

therefore  I do not want to create the  impression

that  the moment we start a Ministry, we must have

a  Permanent  Secretary. However, the Ministry  of

Science and Technology is being looked after by  a

Principal    Assistant    Secretary,    and     my

recommendation to the Ministry of Finance is  that

since my Ministry has now shown that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



it  has been functioning for the last 24 years and

that the work is developing in volume, my Ministry

would need to have at least a Deputy Secretary.  I

hope that satisfies the Member for Mountbatten.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I am satisfied with the

answer  given, and I hope that in the near  future

he  will have a Permanent Secretary to assist him.

I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this subhead I notice that there is a

provision of $63,120 for temporary staff  for  the

previous financial year and a provision of $47,580

for the ensuing financial year. I wish to know why

temporary  staff  have  to be  employed  for  this

Ministry. If the Ministry needs additional  staff,

why not employ permanent staff who are known to be

loyal and are able to do a better job?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

temporary  staff as provided for in  subhead  3001

are  required to start the Metrication Board which

has been set up recently. It is not envisaged that

the Metrication Board will continue as a permanent

feature in my Ministry because at some future date

it  will be dissolved when the major task  of  the

Board has been performed and Singapore is well  on

its  way towards metrication. Therefore, the staff

which  are now being gathered to assist the  Board

in  its  functions need only be temporary as  they

will   not  form  a  permanent  feature   of   the

establishment. This is the reason for listing this

subhead as "Temporary Staff".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enlighten the Member for Potong Pasir a little

further,  I  must say that, besides the  temporary

staff provided for under this subhead, two members

of  the  staff from my Ministry are also assisting

the Board full-time. One is acting as Secretary to

the Board, and the other is the Deputy Chairman of

the Board. So



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>



the  duties of the Board are well covered both  by

executives and by appointees to the Board itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Metrication Board was formed in December 1970

with   representatives  from   the   Chambers   of

Commerce,     the    Manufacturers    Association,

interested   Ministries  such  as  Education   and

Finance, and interested bodies like S.I.S.I.R., as

well  as  the  relevant professional  bodies.  The

Board has had several meetings and a plan has been

drawn up to introduce metrication to Singapore  as

early as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Sir, I am satisfied with the

explanation, and I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to seek clarification on the Popular

Science  Centre. During the last budget  debate  I

said that the vote of $70,000 for the staff of the

Science Centre and the vote of $1 million for  the

establishment of the Centre were insufficient



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Govindasamy, you are talking

about the Science Centre?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Yes, Sir, as it comes under

the same subhead 3004. Sir, during the last budget

debate  estimates for the Popular  Science  Centre

were  provided under the Ministry of  Science  and

Technology.  At  the  moment, the  Science  Centre

still comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry

of  Science  and  Technology.  And  if  I  may  be

permitted  to  continue,  Sir,  is  the   Minister

prepared to clarify?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You may continue, Mr Govindasamy.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, the vote of $1 million

in  the  Development  Estimates  for  the  Science

Centre will not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



be  sufficient  if it is to achieve the  objective

for  which  it  is set up. The Minister  concurred

with  me  and in his reply he mentioned  that  the

proposed  Popular Science Centre might  eventually

cost more than $5 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from the Memorandum on the Estimates of

Revenue  and Expenditure for Singapore, it appears

that  no  provision  is made  for  the  staff  and

expenditure   of   the  Popular  Science   Centre.

Instead,  a  Science Centre Board has been  formed

and  a  separate  provision of $201,150  is  being

asked  for  the Board under subhead 2104  of  Head

1303  (Contributions  and Charitable  Allowances).

Further,  in the Development Estimates, a  sum  of

$1750,000  is  asked  for  as  "Contributions   to

Science  Centre Board". We are also  told  in  the

Memorandum on the Development Estimates  that  the

proposed  Science Centre is estimated to  cost  $9

million.  Apparently  from  both  Memoranda,   the

Science  Centre  is going to be the responsibility

of  the Science Centre Board. If that is the case,

I   wish   to  ask  the  Minister  what   is   the

relationship,  if any, between the Science  Centre

Board  and the Ministry of Science and Technology.

If  the Science Centre Board has been set up,  can

the  Minister tell us who are the members  of  the

Board?  And other than the responsibility for  the

Popular  Science Centre, has the Board  any  other

responsibilities?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, as I mentioned in the last budget

session, the Popular Science Centre has my fullest

support.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I feel that

my  Ministry  is partly responsible for  confusing

the  Member for Telok Blangah by listing the  vote

for  the Popular Science Centre under subhead 3004

of  Head  0301  in the Estimates. Originally  when

this  vote  was inserted in the 1970-71 Estimates,

it  was  intended  to  pay  for  local  costs  for

visiting  experts  who  would  advise  us  on  the

setting  up of the Science Centre. Since then  two

reports  have been submitted by them, and  I  have

mentioned this to Parliament. And for the  1971-72

estimates  there is a $10 token vote against  this

subhead.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position at this moment is that the Science

Centre  Board has been appointed with Mr Wee  Cho

Yaw  as  Chairman,  as everybody  knows,  and  Mr

Ronald  Sng  as  Deputy  Chairman.  Several  other

persons have also been appointed as members of the

Board.   Although  the  Board   is   now   working

independently   of  my  Ministry,   there   is   a

representative  of my Ministry on the  Board.  The

Science  Centre  Board is now  in  the  transition

stage  and  until it has been properly  built,  it

will  continue to operate within the precincts  of

the National Museum and to enlist the services  of

the staff of the Museum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when the Science Centre is open for

operations, the Ministry of Science and Technology

will  dissolve the National Museum, and the  staff

thereof  will be distributed between  the  Science

Centre  itself and other departments of the  civil

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the Board is looking into the

following  aspects regarding the establishment  of

the Science Centre. First, a 16-acre site fronting

Jurong Lake has been earmarked for the centre, and

negotiations  are going on between the  Board  and

the Jurong Town Corporation for leasing this area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with regard to the building itself, the

Board  has  been fortunate in securing  assistance

from the Asia Foundation which recently sent out a

two-man  team  of  architects and  consultants  to

advise  the  Board on drawing up a brief  for  the

building.  It is the intention of the  Board  that

the  erection  of  the building will  be  open  to

competition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Board is actively looking for a

suitable person for appointment as Director of the

Science  Centre. This is a difficult task,  as  we

need   to  find  a  person  who  knows  what   the

philosophy  of the Science Centre and its  purpose

are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that under Head 1303, Contributions

and  Charitable Allowances, a sum of $201,150  has

been allocated for the workings of the Science



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



Centre Board, but part of this money will be spent

on paying architects' fees and the salaries of the

Director  and other staff whom the Science  Centre

Board may feel it necessary to recruit. I hope  my

explanation  will  satisfy the  Member  for  Telok

Blangah.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $615,090 for Head 0301 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0302 -



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



That  the  sum  to be allocated for Head  0302  be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2012.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I notice an increase of $2,000 for

transport.  I  would like to  find  out  from  the

Minister  for  Science  and  Technology  why   his

chemists have to travel so much.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the bulk of

the  provision  for transport and travelling  goes

towards reimbursing transport claims made  by  the

Assistant  Inspectors of Dangerous  and  Hazardous

Materials.   These  inspectors  are   engaged   in

performing statutory testing and inspection duties

on  tankers and ships under the provisions of  the

Petroleum  Ordinance. Before 1968, most  of  these

n1spections  were  carried  out  in  shipyards  at

Keppel, Kallang and Tanjong Rhu. But since October

1969  the  number  of  inspections  performed   at

shipyards has increased because new shipyards  are

being built in the Jurong industrial estate.  Also

from  1969  these  inspections have  included  the

Sembawang Shipyard as well. As more shipyards  are

established  in Singapore, there is  greater  need

for these inspectors to travel to these places  to

perform their task, and because of the distance of

Jurong  and  Sembawang  the  cost  of  travel  has

concurrently been raised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coming year, the Chemistry Department is

also  playing an active role in helping industries

by engaging themselves in research and development

projects   and  consultative  work  for  industry.

Hence,   the  chemists  have  to  pay  visits   to

factories,  and  again their travel  expenses  are

chargeable to the departmental vote. It is because

of  these  many  reasons that the vote  of  $2,800

provided for last year has been proved inadequate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the

Minister for his kind reply. I beg leave to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $647,330 for Head 0302 ordered to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0401 -



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1004 (The same

amendment also stood in the name of Mr Hwang Soo Jin.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to use this subhead as a convenient

peg  to  hang an inquiry on, and that  is  whether

there   are  any  rules,  written  or  understood,

relating  to the appearance and behaviour  of  our

Armed Forces personnel in public when they are  in

uniform. To be fair, I have not heard of too  many

complaints  of  servicemen appearing  unkempt  and

bedraggled.   But   I  have  noticed   a   certain

carelessness in the way some servicemen dress. Are

there  no  regulations which  stipulate  how  they

should  wear  their  uniform,  whether  they   are

allowed to leave buttons unbuttoned, whether  they

have  to  slip their slacks into their boots,  and

whether they are allowed to keep their hair  long?

Some of them have hair cuts which the Minister for

Home  Affairs  might consider as  belonging  to  a

category   of  people  who  are  not  allowed   in

Singapore.  I  hope I do not sound  too  petty  in

bringing  up  these domestic issues. There  is  no

doubt about the tremendous achievements which  the

Ministry of Defence must be credited



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>



with    in    building   an   impressive   defence

establishment. I am asking such questions  because

I  feel  it is important, now that we have reached

an  obviously  viable stage in the development  of

our Armed Forces, that the image of the serviceman

in  the  eyes of the public should be  that  of  a

gentleman as well as of a dependable fighter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to the point about the general

behaviour  of our servicemen and not merely  their

appearance. I think that sometimes in  small  ways

the  behaviour  of  our men in  uniform  leaves  a

little more to be desired. They cling on grimly to

their  seats  in buses. Even when they  travel  in

military transport, I have seen them sometimes cat-calling  and wolf-whistling. They rush  for  buses

when  they should be queueing up. They rush across

the road when a pedestrian crossing or an overhead

bridge is only about a hundred metres away. I have

come  across  these incidents  because  I  pass  a

transport unit encampment every day when I  return

home.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have read frequently of reports regarding

gotong  royong  projects  in  which  Armed  Forces

personnel are engaged in order to link their units

more  closely with the community. I think this  is

an  excellent contribution, of course, but perhaps

attempts  should be made to see that our  soldiers

in the ordinary areas of contact with civilians do

not  behave in such a way as to rub them the wrong

way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I refer to drivers in uniform

driving  civilian  cars.  I  wish  to  take   this

opportunity  to congratulate the Minister  on  the

very   fine   improvement  in  the   standard   of

responsibility  exercised by drivers  of  military

vehicles. But I am now talking about soldiers  who

drive  their  own  cars but who happen  to  be  in

uniform. I think perhaps something should be  done

to  see that the wearing of uniform does not  make

them  too  exuberant drivers on the road.  I  have

noticed  that there is a certain tendency in  this

direction.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should

like  to  take  the  opportunity  of  asking   the

Minister  how thorough is the medical  examination

of  recruits  inducted into national service,  and

whether  they  are  examined not  only  for  their

physical but also their mental fitness. I ask this

question  because  I  recently  came  across   two

individuals  who  were clearly mentally  defective

and yet they were able to pass the examination and

subsequently  called  up  for  national   service.

[Laughter]  Sir, this is no laughing  matter.  The

families  of  these two individuals  were  put  to

quite considerable inconvenience. One of these two

persons was in fact called up for national service

on  a  part-time basis, and after a  few  training

sessions he found them too difficult to follow. He

did  not understand what was going on, so he  just

absconded.  I  would  like an assurance  from  the

Minister  that the medical examination of recruits

will  be more stringent so that there will  be  no

similar repetition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise two

questions.  We  know that soldiers  should  always

maintain good discipline so that they will leave a

good   impression  on  the  people.  But  1   have

sometimes seen soldiers and even officers  of  our

army  appearing in public places, for example,  in

restaurants,  coffee-shops and such other  places,

taking  their  meals. I am not sure whether  there

are  any rules and regulations which require  them

to  have permission to appear in public places  in

uniform  and  take their meals. I would  like  the

Minister to clarify this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also witnessed some other unfortunate

events in certain places. Some of our soldiers and

officers display a rather unbecoming attitude. For

example, they are sometimes arrogant. They  behave

as  if  they are in some ways different and  quite

apart  from the ordinary people. In this  respect,

we  have to instruct our officers and soldiers not

to  be  arrogant and not to adopt such an attitude

in  public  places. I would like the  Minister  to

clarify these two points.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, on the question by the  Member  for

Katong on uniforms. Soldiers, whether they are  in

camp or outside camp must be properly dressed, and

if  they  are  not  properly  dressed,  they  have

committed  an  offence. The trouble  is  that  you

cannot  have regimental police everywhere to  make

sure that all offenders are brought to book.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards hair cuts, I think the Member is

slightly exaggerating the position. We try  to  be

as  accommodating as we can, but there are  limits

and, we  have not gone as far as other armies  in

the world who allow shoulder-length hair-dos.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disorderly conduct of our servicemen

mentioned by the Member for Katong and the  Member

for  Sembawang is quite regrettable.  Every  flock

has  its black sheep. I think that, on the  whole,

our  army maintains itself very well in public and

the  cases they mention are the exceptions  rather

than the rule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards eating in public, of course, soldiers

must eat in public. They are human beings. It will

be  a  sad day if we prohibit them from eating  in

public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

worse.

he   will  be  discharged.  Actually  the  medical

examination  is  quite thorough. They  go  through

eye, urine, and blood tests. They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



are    x-rayed.   Height,   weight,   and   bodily

measurements  are taken. They are given  a  dental

<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker.

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1007.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise to speak in the hope of obtaining

clarification   of  certain  provisions   in   the

National  Servicemen Employment) Rules, 1970,  and

the   National  Servicemen  (Employment)  (Private

Employers and Statutory Bodies) Order. 1970,  made

by the Minister of Defence in pursuance of section

11  and  section 5 (1) of the National  Servicemen

(Employment)  Act.  1970. The two  instruments  in

question have already been gazetted and have  come

into operation with effect from 2nd January. 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is amply clear that the purpose of the

instruments  is  to fulfil the  assurance  of  the

Government    to   provide   adequate   employment

opportunities   to   national   servicemen   after

completion of their tour of duty. No one,  whether

inside or outside this House who considers himself

to  be  a  true  and responsible  citizen  of  the

republic, can deny that the provision of  adequate

employment  opportunities for our  young  citizens

who  have undergone national service is the  least

that  the  republic  can  do  by  way  of  showing

gratitude to them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relative novelty and wide scope of the

provisions  of the two instruments, however,  have

given  rise  to much misgivings and anxiety  among

workers  who  have  not been national  servicemen.

Certain  of  the  provisions,  which  I  will   be

referring  to in a little while, can do with  some

necessary  amplification  and  clarification,  not

only  in  the  provisions themselves but  also  in

their  underlying purpose. Until an  authoritative

statement  is made to such effect, undue confusion

and worry is bound to exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point of clarification which I am

seeking is in relation to rule 7 (2) of the  Rules

and  section 3 of the Order. Under rule 7 (2) , the

Director  is empowered to ref use to issue  a  new

employment card to a registered person  unless  he

is    satisfied    that   there   is    sufficient

justification  to warrant a change of  employment.

Such  a provision can in itself result in a  great

amount of dissatisfaction being generated among ex-national  servicemen, as judgment  may  vary  from

Director  to  Director. It is  patently  desirable

that  the  range  of  opinions among  the  various

incumbents of the post of Director in the years to

come  is  narrowed  down to  within  ascertainable

limits by Ministerial guidance or otherwise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of knowing what will constitute

satisfaction to the Director can perhaps  be  best

illustrated  by  this  hypothetical   example.   A

registered  person may wish to have  a  change  of

employment by reason of what he considers to be in

his  own best interest. He intends to effect  such

change of employment by giving up his current  job

for  a  lower-paid position but with  much  better

prospects.  It  would be tragic if  he  is  to  be

prevented from changing his employment because the

Director  is  not satisfied with  his  reason.  It

would be more tragic if eventually he is forced to

resign  his job out of unhappiness but  after  the

five-year period when he is no longer entitled  to

any preferential treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, there does not seem to be any

safeguard  against the Director making an  adverse

decision  against  a  registered  person   through

becoming



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



unduly  susceptible  to the persuasive  charms  of

employers,  who may be plagued by a high  turnover

of  the labour force, if such charms are exercised

in   circumstances  completely   devoid   of   any

suggestion  of corruption or graft.  It  may  seem

that  a  provision  for  appeal  by  the  employee

concerned against a decision of the Director under

Part   V  of  the  Rules  may  be  necessary   and

reasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To return to my point, Sir, the provision of

section  3  of the Order, while seeking to  assure

employment   opportunities  for  former   national

servicemen seems to be tantamount to an "overkill"

provision  in restricting the scope of  all  other

persons   for  changing  employment   or   finding

alternative employment. In our dynamic society, it

is  inevitable and healthy that there should be  a

reasonable degree of turnover of labour. Moreover,

employers  are  not  averse  to  exercising  their

powers to hire and fire practically at will  under

our  present  laws. Doubts have  therefore  arisen

whether unions can now persuade employers  to  re-engage   workers  who  have  been  retrenched   or

dismissed  in circumstances where no reinstatement

by   the   Minister   for  Labour   is   possible.

Theoretically, employers can apply  for  exemption

under  the Rules. But from trade union experience,

I  think it is more likely that the employers will

use  the  exemption provision as an added argument

against re-engagement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point of clarification which I wish to

seek  is  in  relation  to Part  V  of  the  Rules

governing  the Appeals Board. Is it the  intention

of   the   Government  that  the  Appeals  Board's

decisions are not to be treated as precedents  and

that  the  decisions are relevant to  and  binding

upon  the  respective employers who appear  before

the  Board, somewhat similar to the awards of  the

Industrial   Arbitration  Court?  There   may   be

compelling    arguments   on   the   grounds    of

consistency,  and certainly the decisions  of  the

Appeals  Board  should be made to apply  to  other

cases of a similar nature.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, however, more concerned with the absence of

provisions   for  trade  unions  or  the   workers

concerned  to  institute or to be  represented  at

proceedings before the Board. The very  fact  that

there   is  provision  for  the  N.T.U.C, to   be

represented   at  every  session  of   the   Board

indubitably indicates that the matter of exemption

does  not  concern  only  the  employers  and  the

Director.  Trade unions and workers are interested

in   the  fair  and  equitable  operation  of  the

exemption  provision in so far as it  pertains  to

the  right of a person to work. While the N.T.U.C.

nominees  on  the  Board can be expected  to  look

after  the  interest  of  workers,  it  would   be

illogical  and unreasonable to expect an  N.T.U.C.

nominee  on  the Board to do full justice  to  the

interest  of  labour  in any deliberation  of  the

Board   if   all  the  facts  pertaining   to   an

application  for exemption are not adduced  before

the  Board and he does not know the facts himself.

A  provision,  therefore, should be  made  for  an

individual  trade  union or  worker  who  is  more

conversant  with  such  facts  to  be  represented

before  the Board either in support of or  against

any application for exemption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar provision should also be made for an

individual  union  or  group  of  workers  to   be

permitted to make an application for exemption  in

respect of any category or class of workers in the

absence of non-availability of registered persons.

As  the  two instruments stand at present, coupled

with the employer's right to hire, as enshrined in

the Industrial Relations Ordinance, if an employee

in  such a situation chooses to refuse to make  an

application  for exemption or appeal  against  the

refusal  of the Director in respect of prospective

employees who are ex-union members or likely to be

union  members, there is nothing the trade  unions

or  the Minister for Labour can do. The end result

would  be  that the trade union position would  be

further weakened in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some further points that I would like

to  ask  the Minister. What is the purpose of  the

two instruments?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



Apparently  an inducement for citizens  to  accept

national  service  willingly and  enthusiastically

and penalise those citizens who shirk or refuse or

begrudge  national service. If that is  the  case,

then  many  citizens are being unfairly penalised.

For example, (a) those in age groups not called up

for  national service; (b) those who are genuinely

debarred  from  national  service  on  grounds  of

medical  or physical infirmity; and (c) those  who

are unfortunate to be female citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No consideration and credit are given to persons

who  are  not eligible for registration under  the

National   Service  (Employment)   Act   but   who

voluntarily offer their services in military, para-military  and civic organisations in the republic.

Such   persons   should  also   be   entitled   to

preferential  treatment if that is the  policy  of

the  Government. For their civic consciousness and

devotion to their civic obligations, such  persons

are  as  deserving  as,  if  not  more  than,  the

national  servicemen  of  the  gratitude  of   the

republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the categories of employees expressly

exempted  under the Order from the  ambit  of  the

National  Service (Employment) Act are  managerial

and  executive personnel in receipt of  a  monthly

salary  of not less than $1,920. The question  is,

why  exemption  on  the basis of  salary  and  not

skill?  It  is likely for more national servicemen

to  be  competent to hold managerial and executive

positions  than to become highly skilled artisans,

such  as welders or mechanics. The suspicion  that

the  two instruments are designed to cope with the

problem of the high rate of turnover of labour  is

further  strengthened, for highly skilled artisans

are  very  much  in demand and very  difficult  to

replace.   Managerial  and  executive   personnel,

unless they are technical and experienced are  not

all  that indispensable. A further point  is  that

fixing a limit of $1,920 will be an added argument

for   foreign   firms  to  bring   in   expatriate

personnel.  Since  they  can  only  freely  employ

executives at such higher salary, they may as well



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



obtain what they consider to be the real McCoys.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In enacting these two instruments, Government is

restricting the right of the employer to hire.  At

the  time of enacting the Employment Act in  1968,

one  of the reasons put forward by Government  for

the need to give employers an unfettered right  to

hire  and  fire  is the urgency of  maintaining  a

congenial  atmosphere  for foreign  investment.  A

valid conclusion, therefore, is that the need  for

foreign  investment is not so urgent, which  seems

probable    in    the   light   of    governmental

pronouncements  about the spate of new  employment

opportunities  over  the next few  years.  Against

this,  despite the ostensible purpose of  the  two

instruments, the general impression created by the

absolute  and blanket character of the  provisions

of  the  two  instruments is  that  of  panic  and

anxiety on the part of Government that it may  not

be  able  to find jobs for its national servicemen

on their return to civilian life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another conclusion could be restriction of the

employer's  right to hire does not  prejudice  the

climate  for  foreign investment as  long  as  the

scope  for profit-making is not affected. It  then

seems  more probable since there can be  no  doubt

about   the  employers'  right  being  drastically

curtailed. In that case, where does it  leave  the

trade    union   movement   which   unquestionably

supported  the Government's employment legislation

in 1968 on the grounds advanced by the Government?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, the establishment of a

national  labour exchange will be a means,  though

more  expensive  and intricate, of  achieving  the

purpose of the two instruments.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Actually the reasons for the

policy  of why the Director should have the  right

to  issue, or refuse to issue, employment cards to

those  looking for new jobs are quite simple.  You

have  to make sure that these national servicemen,

who have this special privilege of preferential



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



employment,  are  people of good  character,  that

they  have not committed crimes and generally have

not  been slack in their work. We do not want this

pool   of   national   service   registrants    to

deteriorate  in  quality and  thereby  affect  the

employability of national service reservists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the Appeals Board, may I explain that

this  is  an  appeal  from employers  against  the

decision  of  the  Director to  disallow  them  to

employ  any  other  source  of  recruitment   than

national  servicemen, in other words, the Director

will  say that a certain employer can recruit only

national servicemen for a particular job unless he

gets  exemption, and if he does not get exemption,

the  employer appeals to the Appeals Board. As  of

now, this is purely an academic issue because  all

requests  by  employers for  exemption  have  been

granted by the Director. In fact, in two months of

operation, the Director has granted exemptions  to

no  less  than 14,000 cases. I do not see on  what

grounds  individual  unions  have  the  right   to

request  that  exemption should or should  not  be

granted in any occupation. There is no such  thing

as  "closed shop" legislation in Singapore, and  I

hope  there  never will be. The  purpose  of  this

legislation is simple. These are your citizens who

have  given two and a half to three years of their

lives  serving as full-time soldiers in the  army.

It  is not a very easy job to be a soldier in  the

army.  We  train  them to very rigorous  standards

and,  in  recognition of their services,  we  give

them  this opportunity of preferential employment.

To  say  that  there are others who  are  just  as

patriotic  and  just as civic conscious  and  that

sort  of thing, that may well be so; but you  tell

me,  how  can  you identify such people?  Everyone

will  say that he is most patriotic when it  comes

to  getting preferences, but how do you know  that

this  person is patriotic and not that person?  So

the proposal of the Member is quite impractical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limit of $1,920 a month is a purely arbitrary

limit. You have to fix



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



a  limit somewhere, without fixing it on the  high

side.   Members   must  remember   that   national

servicemen  will be 20 to 21 years or  thereabouts

when they leave the army. It is unlikely that they

will  be  eligible  for jobs  anywhere  near  this

salary limit.

of the Minister's reply, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1046.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment is moved in order to seek

clarification from the Minister as to the  general

position  and  functions  of  the  30-odd   police

officers,  ranging  from subheads  1046  to  1052.

These  police  officers are now  listed  as  being

attached to the Ministry of Defence. We have often

been  given  to  understand that  there  is  great

difficulty  in recruiting sufficient and  suitable

personnel to man the Police Force. The Ministry of

Home   Affairs   is   now  responsible   for   the

administration  of  the  Police  Force.  Can   the

Minister  inform  the  House  what  these   police

officers  are  doing in the Ministry  of  Defence,

which   is   no   longer   responsible   for   the

administration of the Police Force?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> When the army was first formed

five  or  six years ago, we had to rely on  police

officers  to  do  a great deal of  the  staff  and

training  work. Most of the police  officers  have

been returned to the police force. There are still

a  few  left.  Some  are  in  miscellaneous  staff

positions.  These will be returned as soon  as  we

can  find replacements from regular officers,  but

the  great  bulk  of policemen  remaining  in  the

Ministry   of   Defence  are   those   that   were

transferred from the Special Branch and  they  are

required   to   continue  work  in  the   Security

Department  of  the Ministry of the  Interior  and

Defence.

(*The same amendment also stood in the name of MrConceicao.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with this amendment, I wish to seek

clarification from the Minister on the purpose  of

setting up the Science and Management Group in the

Ministry  of  Defence, and  what  its  duties  and

functions are.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 1 was about to

ask  the  same question, and, in addition, perhaps

what the rationale is to put the Scientific Branch

and  the Management Branch together under the same

subhead.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The setting up of a unit of

the  defence  force, particularly those  connected

with  modern weapons systems, is a highly  complex

undertaking.   It  requires  expertise   of   many

varieties.   It   requires  very   intricate   co-ordinating  programmes  from  departments  of  the

Ministry -- Logistics, Manpower and General Staff.

They have to be closely intermeshed to ensure that

this  particular unit is formed in various  stages

in  time  and  with the minimum  waste  of  money,

manpower  and  stocks  of  equipment.  Take,   for

instance, the Bloodhound Squadron which we are now

raising.  It  will cost us close on  $100  million

when  the  Squadron  becomes  operational  and  we

require  a  wide  variety of  skills  at  artisan,

technician,  engineer  and scientific  levels.  It

will be the main responsibility of the Science and

Management  Group to monitor and  co-ordinate  the

progress in the introduction of the various  types

of   weapons  systems  into  the  Singapore  Armed

Forces, such as the Bloodhound and several others.

The  personnel of this group consist of the ablest

engineers that we have sent abroad. They all  have

very   distinguished  academic   achievements   in

universities   in  Britain,  Australia,   America,

Canada  and  elsewhere. Their disciplines  include

chemical engineering, electrical engineering, electronic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



engineering, civil engineering and others.

In  other  words, we may say they  are  the  "whiz

kids" of the Ministry of the interior and Defence,

and this is the work they do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2005.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can the Minister of Defence inform this

House  why  no  such provision was made  for  this

subhead  last  year  and why is  it  necessary  to

provide  more than a quarter of a million  dollars

for employing daily-rated staff this year? Who are

the prospective daily-rated staff to be employed?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, these are the staff of

various  logistics and maintenance bases. We  have

bases  to  repair army trucks and  vehicles,  army

signal equipment and that kind of thing. When  you

get  national servicemen who have been trained for

a  few months, you get the type of manpower - what

people  call first echelon maintenance - that  can

do  very simple types of maintenance. But the more

complex  maintenance and repair work will have  to

be  done  by artisans, mechanics and fitters  with

many  years  of experience. We find it  easier  to

recruit  these  people  in as  civilians  than  to

require  them  to  join as army personnel  and  go

through  various  army training courses  and  work

under  military discipline. Most of them  will  he

fitters,  mechanics, turners and  workers  in  the

vehicle  repair  base,  electronic  repair   base,

weapons repair base, that sort of thing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, will the

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Most certainly, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  There is a great demand for skilled  workers

of  all grades in the Singapore Armed Forces.  Any

civilian employee in any skilled occupation in the

British  services  should find  no  difficulty  in

getting  well-paid  jobs. In fact,  we  have  been

advertising for several months over the radio  and

on T.V, for these people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0501 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our foreign policy has reaped very good

results in recent years. We have appeared  in  the

international arena as a non-aligned  nation,  and

have   made  friends  with  many  countries.  This

position  is important to the survival and  growth

of  our  country. But at the same time  we  should

also   appreciate   that   developments   in   the

international  field keep changing all  the  time.

Therefore,  in  the  best  interest  of  our   own

country, I think the Minister for Foreign  Affairs

will  agree  with me that we should adopt  a  very

flexible foreign policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this broad guideline, I would like to raise

two points with the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in the new fiscal year, will the

Government  establish  more  foreign  missions  in

order  to  promote friendship and better relations

with other countries? Secondly, Britain's decision

to  sell  arms to South Africa has sparked  off  a

great  controversy  in  the  international  field,

particularly  during  the  Commonwealth  Heads  of

Government Conference held in Singapore early this

year.  At this conference this subject was  keenly

debated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



by  many  African  countries. In  spite  of  this,

Britain  has gone ahead with the sale of  arms  to

South Africa. I would, therefore, like to ask  the

Minister  what  is  Singapore's attitude  on  this

matter.  Have  we taken any appropriate  steps  in

this field?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

first of all, I thank the Member for Sembawang for

suggesting  that  we  should be  flexible  in  our

foreign policy. In fact, some people think that we

are too flexible, with the result that they do not

know what our stand is. This is not a bad position

for  a  country  to be in in these very  difficult

days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to his question whether we intend to

set  up  more foreign missions, the policy of  the

Government has always been to establish a  foreign

mission  only when there is considerable financial

and  political justification for it. I  think  the

only foreign mission we might establish this year,

in  addition to the 13 or 14 missions that we have

now  will be in the Soviet Union, in view  of  the

fact that the Soviet Union is going to be a factor

in this part of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member that it is

possible  to  have friendly relations  with  other

countries without having foreign missions. In some

instances  you  are  more  likely  to  have   less

friendly   relations  with  countries  by   having

foreign  missions there. The Member might know  of

this  if  he had read the recent history  of  this

part  of  the  world where foreign  missions  were

burnt down. Therefore, it is not necessary to have

foreign  missions  just for  the  sake  of  having

friendly  relations with the countries  concerned.

You   should  only  have  foreign  missions   when

substantial interest is involved. In regard to the

British  arms sale to South Africa, of  course  we

are   opposed  in  principle  to  it  because   it

infringes  the United Nations resolution  on  this

matter.  We ourselves have condemned it especially

when  the  arms  are used for the  furtherance  of

apartheid.  But  if  Britain and  other  countries

which also supply arms to South



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



Africa are intent on supplying arms, I do not  see

what  we  can  do about it except to express  very

strong moral opposition to their action.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  of  course  if  we want  to  establish  more

foreign missions, they must he of benefit  to  us.

There  is  no doubt about it. I feel the  Minister

should  know  this better than I do.  He  has,  in

fact, given this House a very satisfactory answer,

and I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I bee, to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1095.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I merely wish to seek some clarification.

From  the  Memorandum on the Estimates of  Revenue

and  Expenditure we find that the reduction in the

Special Make-up Allowance of 5239,070 has resulted

from  experience  of  past expenditure  trends.  I

would  like  to  know  the reason  for  the  large

reduction  of  nearly  a  quarter  of  a   million

dollars;  from a provision of $260,400 to  $21,330

for  the ensuing year. Moreover, what has been the

basis of these estimates in the past?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Special

Make-up  Allowance was introduced in  August  last

year  with  the object of compensating  home-based

officers  whose wives were working  in  Singapore.

Therefore,  when  they were posted  overseas  they

lost  that portion of the remuneration which their

wives   were  enjoying.  This  necessitated   more

allocation of funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time the Special Make-up Allowance was

created, we were not quite sure how much would  be

involved.  And my Ministry, being rather  cautious

about  these  things,  did what  the  Ministry  of

Finance   generally  disapproves  of.   We   over-estimated  the  amount required by a  considerable

figure.  We  have  learnt from  bitter  experience

since  the  implementation of the  allowance  last

year, and it is now possible for us to make a more

accurate  estimate of the amount  required.  Hence

the provision of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



$21,000-odd for the ensuing year. In fact, at  the

moment  we  have  only two officers  drawing  this

Special  Make-up Allowance, and this explains  the

drastic drop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am just taking the opportunity of seeking

some  information.  Will the Minister  inform  the

House when an overseas mission will be established

in Moscow, and who will be the first Ambassador?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, as regards when the mission

will   be   established,  I  can  give  a   fairly

reassuring  answer  to  the  Member.  We  hope  to

establish it some time before June. As to  who  is

likely  to  be the Ambassador, I think  that  must

remain a top secret. It is the convention that the

receiving  country should first be told about  who

is  going to be the Ambassador, because if they do

reject   our   appointee,   there   will   be   no

embarrassment caused all round. So I would suggest

to the Member that some time before June he should

read the newspapers very carefully, and I am quite

sure the secret will be disclosed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the risk of being accused of playing the

same old record, I would like to harp on the

subject of workmen's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



compensation once again.  During  the  past

month  the Minister of State for Labour has on  at

least  two  occasions mentioned that the  benefits

under the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance will be

revised.  May  I know when and to what  extent  it

will be revised?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take the opportunity of

asking  the Minister of State for Labour  when  he

will  be  introducing  new sets  of  safety  rules

applicable to building construction. The number of

accidents  at building sites is going up,  and  at

quite  a  fantastic rate too. Therefore,  I  think

this area deserves his earliest attention.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have indicated

before,  the  Workmen's Compensation Ordinance  is

under  review. At this moment I can only say  that

it is in a very advanced stage of preparation, and

it  is very likely that a revised version will  be

ready  for  presentation at the  next  sitting  of

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the increasing number of accidents at

building  sites, we are aware of it. In fact,  the

Factories Ordinance is being revised to spell  out

control in greater detail. The new set of Building

Operations    and   Works   and   of   Engineering

Construction  Regulations, 1971, has already  been

printed  in  draft  form and when  it  is  finally

printed   it  will  be  presented  to  Parliament.

Members will see that detailed control of building

construction  and engineering works  is  contained

therein.

the present rate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> The workmen's compensation will

certainly  be  increased. I do not  know  what  he

meant by `informed sources". But we have not

published the figures yet. As I have said earlier,

a  review  has  been made and we  have  definitely

taken  a decision on it. When it is ready, Members

will be informed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Since the matter has reached

will be announced?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> No, Sir. Although we have

finished the paper work in the Ministry of Labour,

it  has  still  to  go  to the  Attorney-General's

to  go to the Government Printer. I cannot say how

long they will all take.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> I think the Minister of State

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1006.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under this subhead 1 wish to talk about industrial accidents. There has been a considerable increase in the number of industrial accidents over the past one year. According to statistics released by the Ministry of Labour, the number of accidents which occurred last year was

more  than  that in the previous year. Undoubtedly

this  is  a grave situation which warrants  proper

attention. The victims and their families  deserve

our  sympathy and help. Their welfare is at stake.

We should therefore consider their plight. Many of

the  victims' wives have become widows  and  their

children  have become orphans. I urge the Minister

for Labour to take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



positive and effective steps to reduce the  number

of industrial accidents. He should ensure that our

workers  are  able to work in safer circumstances.

However,  in spite of my appeal, it is regrettable

that  the  Ministry of Labour has  not  taken  any

steps  to  improve the situation and to solve  the

problems  arising out of industrial accidents.  At

the  very best, the Ministry has only set up  some

so-called  committees  to  look  into  the  matter

superficially.  They  even go  to  the  extent  of

organising industrial seminars just to  put  up  a

show. They have invited so-called experts to  talk

"hell of a lot" at such seminars and nothing else.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think "hell of a lot" is

unparliamentary language.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> It is the translation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We will excuse the Member. Please

carry on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If you think I

have   used   an  unparliamentary  expression,   I

withdraw it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is worse is that their recommendations and

proposals  are  very  high  sounding  but   rather

impractical. In my view, the seminars are  just  a

waste  of time. They have not contributed anything

that will actually solve the problem of industrial

accidents.  If we wish to do something about  this

grave  situation, we must invite  those  who  have

practical  experience in the industrial  field  to

study the problems and to make recommendations for

their solution. For example, we can invite factory

managers,  engineers  or  even  foremen  to   come

forward  with  suggestions on  how  to  solve  the

problem.  It is these people who know  the  actual

situation and are capable of recommending measures

to  reduce the number of accidents. I am sure they

will   be  able  to  contribute  useful  and  more

practical   proposals  than  those  expounded   at

seminars by the so-called experts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employers of factories should also take

greater  responsibility to see that the number  of

industrial  accidents  is  reduced.  They   should

ensure that over-age



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



machinery  is replaced in time  in  order  to

safeguard  the  lives of the workers.  I  remember

that in the last fiscal year, during the debate on

the  budget,  the Parliamentary Secretary  to  the

Minister  for  Labour  told this  House  that  the

greatest problem confronting the Industrial Safety

Unit  was the shortage of factory inspectors.  The

reason  was  that  the  allocation  of  funds  was

inadequate  for  the increased number  of  factory

inspectors required. If that is the case, I  think

the  problem is rather simple. When we  have  more

factory  inspectors, we will be able  to  increase

industrial  safety. We can spend a  bit  more.  We

should be prepared to allocate more funds for this

purpose. We should take immediate remedial  action

in  this field. I wish to ask the Minister whether

the number of factory inspectors will be increased

this  year. There are more factories in  Singapore

now  and the number of workers is ever increasing.

We should, therefore, have more factory inspectors

to go round to ensure that the safety measures are

properly  observed. They should go round  and  see

that  the factory employers themselves have proper

safety measures in their factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to

another  point.  Can he inform  this  I-louse  why

there  has  been  an increase  in  the  number  of

industrial   accidents?  What   are   the   causes

contributing to such accidents? Is the Ministry of

Labour  making  any  comprehensive  study  of  the

matter? If we have the reasons, and a proper study

is  made, we will be able to reduce the number  of

accidents.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will first

enlighten the Member for Sembawang. I think he has

asked the right question - What are the causes for

the  rise  in the number of industrial  accidents?

The first reason is the number of factories, which

has increased from 3,963 in 1969 to some 4,050  in

1970.  The  number of machines, steam boilers  and

other    machines    involved   has,    therefore,

correspondingly  increased. So  has  the  work  of

industrial employees. I think the figures  I  have

been given



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>







indicate that there has been an increase of 22,700

industrial  workers  during  the  past  year.  The

frequency  of the rates of accidents is about  the

same. But the fact is that because a larger number

of  workers are involved, the number of  accidents

in   the  factories  has  tended  to  increase  as

compared with 1969. In the year before last  there

were  1,270 industrial accidents, and in 1970  the

number  was  1,525. The number of fatal  accidents

increased  from 29 to 36. I agree with the  Member

for  Sembawang  that preventive  measures  can  be

taken  by  the Government. But one shortcoming  in

previous years was the lack of sufficient  factory

inspectors.  However, this year the  Ministry  has

made  good this shortcoming and some 27 additional

posts   have   been   created   in   the   Factory

Inspectorate  Section.  These  new   posts,   when

filled, will enable the Ministry to carry out more

frequent and thorough factory inspections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason for the increased number of

industrial  accidents is that both  the  employers

and the workers themselves have not taken care  to

observe  the factory safety regulations  that  now

exist.  I  have  forgotten  the  figures,  but   a

majority of the accidents were due to the  workers

themselves neglecting to observe the safety  rules

that  they  were  supposed  to  observe.  As   the

Minister  of State has just indicated, fundamental

amendments  are  going to be made to  the  Factory

Ordinance. The Bill is practically ready.  As  far

as I know, it has gone to the Attorney-General and

once  he  has  vetted  the legal  aspects  of  the

amended  Factory  Ordinance, it will  come  before

this House. I cannot give Members the details, but

the  amendments will provide for stiffer fines for

any  infringement  of  the required  standards  of

safety. The amendments will also introduce  higher

standards  of  health and welfare required  to  be

provided by employers. Personally, I think one  of

the areas where high rates of accidents take place

is in the construction trade, primarily because of

the rapid expansion of this sector of our economy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang does not believe in

experts.  But  I fortunately do, because  I  would

rather  trust experts than one who claims that  he

is not an expert. Anyway, a group of people - I do

not know whether the Member would consider them as

experts but they, I believe, do know about  safety

regulations   -  from  the  National  Productivity

Centre,  the  National Safety First  Council,  the

National  Trades  Union  Congress,  the  Singapore

Employers'      Federation,     the      Singapore

Manufacturers' Association, the Singapore  Medical

Association, the Society of Occupational  Medicine

and  the  University  of  Singapore  (Faculty   of

Engineering),  have considered  this  problem  and

submitted  a report largely at the behest  of  the

former  Minister for Finance, now the Minister  of

Defence.  They have suggested the formation  of  a

council  of industrial safety and health.  On  the

whole,  I think, in so far as is humanly possible,

their  recommendations  would  probably  halt  and

reduce  the  alarming rate of growth of industrial

accidents  in  Singapore. These are  some  of  the

measures  that the Government are taking.  In  the

past,  the  problems of industrial accidents  were

rather  neglected  in the Labour  Ministry's  work

largely  because industrial expansion  was  rather

slow  and we were able to cope with these problems

in  a  somewhat leisurely fashion. But  since  the

last  four  or five years, the very rapid  growth,

plus the level of skills that our workers are  now

acquiring,  makes it more imperative that  greater

attention  and  seriousness  should  be  given  to

preserving the health and safety of our workers in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  would like to clarify a point. I  do  not

treat  experts  with  contempt.  I  have  no  such

intention. If I should treat them with contempt, I

would  not call them experts at all. What I  tried

to  say  was that the recommendations of a seminar

or a meeting should be more practical and feasible

for  adoption.  If at the end of a  seminar  or  a

meeting, there is no follow-up and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



that  is the end of it, then, in my view,  such  a

meeting or seminar will be quite a waste of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, I must thank the Minister for being

very  patient  with  me and  for  enumerating  the

number  of  measures  that  he  has  taken,  I  am

satisfied  with  his  answer.  I  beg   leave   to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0601 (contd.) -



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head (601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1015.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is just one point that I would like to

make  in  relation to the Higher Executive Officer

(Employment Exchange Manager). Why is it  that  it

sometimes takes as long as three or four years for

people  who  have  registered  at  the  Employment

Exchange  to  be notified of possible  employment?

Apart from that, I do not see any other reason why

the  gentleman's  salary should  be  reduced  from

$15,000 to $11,000 a year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I do not know why the salary has

been  reduced.  Probably  the  incumbent  has  not

reached  the  appropriate scale or perhaps  a  new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>



person  has  taken over. That notwithstanding,  we

are satisfied that there is no complaint..



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's primary question why

there is a long delay in informing people who have

been  registered  with  the  Employment  Exchange,

unless  I know of~ specific examples, it might  be

so.  But it is not generally true that there is  a

long delay, especially in view of the considerable

shortages   in  various  fields  of  skills.   For

example,    I   understand   domestic    servants,

chauffeurs  and  persons  with  this  category  of

skills are snapped up the moment they register.  I

am told that these are the categories of vacancies

which are provided jobs, if not on the spot,  then

almost  within  a  day or two:  firemen,  turners,

carpenters,  masons,  dispatch  riders,   drivers,

welders,  fitters, pressmen, gardeners, mechanics,

boilermakers and so on. But it is true that  there

is  one category of people for whom there is delay

simply  because nobody wants them. These  are  the

white-collar   jobs,   especially   the   clerical

section, where there are too many registrants  and

too few jobs. According to the statistics provided

to me, as of 31st December, 1970, there were 8,854

persons registered for white-collar jobs, while in

the whole of that year only 182 such vacancies had

been notified to the Exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reason might be that very often people

are  offered jobs but the applicants have  refused

them  for  a variety of reasons. Some of them  say

that  the  place  of work is too  far  from  their

homes, or the nature of `the work is not to  their

liking,  or the salary offered by the employer  is

not  enough. These people have therefore  rejected

offers of jobs or have told the Exchange, "Look, I

am   still  on  the  register  but  I  would  like

something  that meets my conditions  of  service."

Therefore,  they  may  take that  as  insufficient

attention being paid by the Employment Exchange to

their particular needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason might be that there Is no law to

compel  employers  to make use of  the  Employment

Exchange    when   vacancies   occur   in    their

establishments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>



As  a  result, employers prefer to find their  own

candidates,   and  not  necessarily  through   the

Employment  Exchange. So since  the  beginning  of

this  year, we have amended the law in  regard  to

national servicemen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, I would say that, as far as I can

gather, if applicants have the skills and  if  the

jobs  are there, there is no delay and the  people

are  immediately found jobs. But in  the  case  of

white-collar  workers, I agree - it  is  a  lesson

that white-collar workers should take very much to

heart  --  that there is less demand for them.  If

they go to the Employment Exchange and if they are

offered  jobs as factory operatives, suggest  very

strongly  that  while they are  still  young  they

should take these jobs which are offered to them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, it is quite often that

the    Employment    Exchange   officers    accept

applications  for  all  categories  of  work  like

hospital  servants, school servants, cleaners  and

sweepers  although there are practically  no  such

vacancies.   This  gives  rise  to   ~i   lot   of

misunderstanding between the registrants  and  the

Employment  Exchange. In most cases, these  people

go  to  their M.P.s and complain. I wonder whether

it  would not be desirable for the officers in the

Employment   Exchange  to  give  at   least   some

indication to people who go there for registration

as  to  how  long  they have to wait  for  certain

categories of jobs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I do not know whether that is a

feasible or wise suggestion. I am quite sure  that

some M.P.s will get up next time and ask me why is

it  that somebody wanted to register for a job  as

an amah and the application was turned down and  a

week  later there was a vacancy for an amah's job.

We   cannot   plan  these  things.  Everybody   is

registered. You never know. There might  or  might

not be a job for a white-collar worker. In fact, I

am not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



quite   sure   about  amahs.   According   to   my

information, there is a great demand for amahs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Hospital amahs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> That is one of the cushier jobs

which  everybody  wants, besides  being  a  school

attendant  or  a  school sweeper. These  are  very

popular  jobs.  But unfortunately  there  are  not

enough  schools  or hospitals to accommodate  them

all.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore suggest that the best thing is

that   the   M.P, concerned  should  advise   his

constituents   on  the  employment   opportunities

available  in  Singapore  rather  than  that   the

officers in the Ministry of Labour should do this,

because  it would be misunderstood that  they  are

uncooperative.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I wish to thank the Minister and I

beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

N. Govindasamy -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1101*.

(*The same  amendment also stood in the names  of Mr  Low Guan  Onn, Mr Conceicao and Mr Hwang  Soo Jin.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My intention in moving this amendment is to make

a  little suggestion to the Minister for Labour to

set up a Branch Factory Inspectorate in Jurong  as

the  majority  of our industries  are  located  in

Jurong  Town. If this is done, it will  facilitate

the  work  of  carrying  out  routine  checks   on

factories.  It  will  also be  convenient  to  the

factory owners



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>



who   may  wish  to  consult  the  Branch  Factory

Inspectorate  from time to time on  their  factory

problems.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Guan Onn -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Guan Onn (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I am happy to note that in the Estimates  for

the fiscal year 1971-72, provisions have been made

for  the  increase  of two more Inspectors,  eight

more  Technical  Officers, and 16  Technicians  to

strengthen  the Factory Inspectorate.  This  is  a

long overdue provision. In this connection, I wish

to  take  this opportunity to commend the  present

Chief Inspector of Factories and his assistants on

performing  their  job, under stress  and  strain,

with  dedication  and loyalty. Despite  the  rapid

increase  in the number of factories, the  Factory

Inspectorate has not had any increase in staff for

so long. Taking their professional experience into

consideration,  their conduct bears  testimony  to

their selfless devotion to their work and duty and

to the nation, without looking for new pastures to

better their prospects. Many a man would have done

so a long time ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I seek to clarify from the Minister the

nature  and  duty  of the Technical  Officers  and

Technicians  respectively.  What  kind  of   paper

qualifications and practical experience must  they

have? I am also glad to hear from the Minister  of

State  for Labour just now, in reply to the Member

for  Jalan  Kayu, that in line with our industrial

growth,  the  Government has, at long last,  taken

steps  to revise the Factories Ordinance  and  the

Workmen's Compensation Ordinance. I wish to remind

the  Minister  that  the  new  provisions  in  the

Factories  Ordinance  should  contain  safety  and

health regulations which must be observed by  both

parties,  that is employers as well as  employees,

and  not  a one-sided affair to apply to employers

only.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in this House

yesterday,  it was mentioned that in the  case  of

industrial accidents a large measure of the  fault

was due to the workers themselves. May I take this

opportunity  of  asking the Minister  whether  his

Factory  Inspectorate can bear this out with  some

data, that indeed a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



large measure of the responsibility for industrial

accidents rests with the workers rather than  with

the employers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> First, in answer to the Member

for  Mountbatten. The Factory Inspectorate at  the

moment  have only 20 staff. Of these,  a  few  are

office   boys,   messengers  and  process   notice

servers, posts like that, so the establishment  is

very  much  under  strength.  Although  there   is

provision for 45 staff in the Inspectorate,  I  am

afraid  at  the moment there are, as I have  said,

only  20  staff. The Public Service Commission  is

still doing some recruitment exercises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the qualifications required of these

people, I cannot say offhand what they are for the

various   grades  of  staff,  but   the   job   of

recruitment  is left with the P.S.C.  As  soon  as

they can get the candidates, the Inspectorate  can

function. Until the Inspectorate has reached  such

a  stage that it feels there is the need to set up

a  branch in Jurong, I do not think steps will  be

taken to that effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong talks about the cases of

accidents  and  the responsibility  involved.  For

1970,  out  of a total of 9,682 cases,  81.14  per

cent  of the accidents, that is 7,856 cases,  were

due  to  the  negligence  of  the  workers.  These

figures    are   compiled   from   the   Workmen's

Compensation  Claims. A total of  81.14  per  cent

were due to the negligence of the workers; and 271

cases,  that is 2.8 per cent, could be  attributed

to the negligence of the employers. But there were

1,555  cases  which  were,  I  would  call,   real

accidents,  where nobody was really at  fault.  So

you  can  see from these comparative figures  that

the  workers themselves were largely to blame  for

the accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to safety measures, I have indicated earlier

on  that  the  new set of Building Operations  and

Works and of Engineering Construction Regulations,

1971,  will  be  ready shortly,  and  it  will  be

obligatory on the part of employers and  employees

to  observe  the regulations set out. Members  may

not be aware that the Inspectorate publishes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



a    cyclostyled    newsletter   called    "Safety

Inspectorates" every six months. A thousand copies

of  this  newsletter are printed  and  distributed

free  to  the  larger factories. Every  aspect  of

safety  is  dealt with therein. I think this  also

contributes  to  the education of both  management

and workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a matter of

clarification. If the statistics mentioned by  the

Minister of State for Labour are right - and I  do

not  doubt  his words - could the large number  of

accidents  attributed  to the  negligence  of  the

workers  be due to the lack of safety devices  and

not  the  result  of  direct  negligence?  Is  the

Factory Inspectorate at this juncture sufficiently

large  to  check the factories for the possibility

of  introducing safety devices? Perhaps the  large

number   of  accidents  which  the  Minister   has

attributed to the negligence of the workers  could

be because of the lack of safety devices.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> No, Sir,If that is the case,

the  fault will lie with the employer, because  it

is  the  duty  of the employer to see that  safety

devices  are there. If they are not provided  for,

certainly the fault lies with the employer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> It seems that the Minister has

acknowledged   that   it   would   also   be   the

responsibility of the Factory Inspectorate to help

in  the  education  of  workers,  because  he  has

mentioned   that   circulars,   especially    that

newsletter called "Safety Inspectorates", are sent

out.  He mentions that this constituted a form  of

education. This is the third time in the last  few

days that it has been mentioned in this House that

you  can  educate people by sending out circulars.

Will  it  not  be  possible for the  Inspector  of

Factories   to  think  of  some  more  substantial

devices  to  help in the education of  workers  in

this respect?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> As Members are aware, there is

the   training  within  industry  set  up  in  the

Ministry  of Labour. As the Government Whip,  some

months  back I arranged for Members of  Parliament

to visit the Ministry of Labour to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



see  this training within industry. More  than  20

Members  attended the morning talk  given  by  the

training  officer.  There is a  special  room  set

aside  for  this purpose and the training  officer

conducts courses on the safety measures. In  fact,

in  this year's estimates, there is provision  for

an  assistant  training  officer.  This  assistant

training  officer will spend most of his  time  on

factory  safety measures. You can see  that  every

effort    is   being   made   to   create   safety

consciousness among the people involved.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  commenting on what the Minister of  State  has

just said regarding the efforts of the Ministry of

Labour  to promote safety consciousness,  I  think

the   room   where  he  invited  the  Members   of

Parliament, including myself, is too small to  try

to   promote   safety  consciousness   among   the

thousands  of workers in Singapore. I  think  that

room  could  take in only about 20  persons  at  a

time.  Such  being  the case, how  long  will  the

Ministry  take to reach the thousands of  workers?

The question here is not so much the education  to

be given at the shop steward level, the managerial

level   or  the  representative  level,   as   the

promotion  of safety consciousness at  the  ground

level,  I think that is more important than having

the  Factory Inspectorate operate in a small  room

trying to inculcate safety consciousness among the

workers.  I think that probably accounts  for  the

big number of industrial accidents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I think the Member for Moulmein

has misunderstood me. The training within industry

is  mainly for managerial personnel supervisors on

the  factory floor. As the Member says  we  cannot

expect to train the thousands of workers on safety

measures,  but we only hope to reach  the  factory

floor supervisors and the executive people in  the

factories  so  that they will be able  to  educate

their  own  workers. We cannot expect  the  Labour

Ministry to educate all the workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Mui Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Mui Kok (Bukit Ho Swee):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  may  I suggest to the Minister of State  for

Labour that in order to educate the workers on the

importance of prevention of accidents, it will  be

a good idea for the Ministry of Labour to get some

good  films,  especially  those  showing  how   to

prevent  accidents  and how  to  handle  machinery

safely  and  so on. Such film shows  will  impress

them better. They will have a better idea of these

safety measures and be more conscious of the  need

to  prevent  industrial accidents. Of  course,  in

addition   to  these  film  shows,  pamphlets   or

circulars on this subject will help too, but  film

shows are just as important.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, the Members who visited the

Ministry of Labour to see training within industry

were  also  shown  some films  on  factory  safety

measures.  These same films are available  to  any

factory supervisors who, having attended a  safety

course in the Ministry, would like to show them to

their  workers. They are at liberty to borrow  the

equipment and the films.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, I was one of those Members

who  were  present at the film show. If I  may  be

permitted to make this remark, Sir, the film  that

I  saw  on safety was a very hoary one indeed!  In

the film, the workers were wearing baggy pants  of

the  post-war era, and I do not know whether  this

film  will  have  any impact on  our  more  modern

workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, is the Minister of State

for Labour in a position to let us know the number

of  employers  in Singapore who have utilised  the

facilities  provided  by  the  Ministry,  such  as

borrowing  the  films? At the same time,  has  the

executive  staff been asked to attend the  courses

organised by the Ministry in respect of industrial

health and safety?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, offhand I cannot give the

figures involved, but the training officer in  the

Ministry  conducts courses all the  time  and  the

people concerned are invited to attend. Perhaps



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



this debate is a good opportunity for the press to

give  more  publicity to this  health  and  safety

course.  However,  I can say that  facilities  are

available  in  the  Ministry of Labour  for  those

people  who  are  concerned with  factory  safety,

especially   in   the   manufacturing   and   non-manufacturing establishments. I would ask them  to

make good and full use of these facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the films, I am afraid we can only screen

or lend whatever is available. Although the Member

for  Katong may be quite right in saying that  the

films were made quite some years back, the purpose

of  the films is to show the danger of wearing the

wrong type of apparel on the factory floor, and to

get   across  the  idea  that  certain  types   of

clothing,  even  the  long  hair  worn  by  female

workers in factories, could be a source of  danger

to themselves. I think that is the whole idea, and

not  so  much  the kind of pants a factory  worker

puts on today.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, has the Minister of

State  any plans to mount a campaign on industrial

safety as vigorously as the "Keep Singapore Clean"

campaign mounted by the Ministry of Health, or the

campaign to stop smoking, which is mounted by  the

Ministry of Culture?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, lately the N.T.U.C, has

been  organising  many seminars  and  meetings  on

safety  measures, and I think that the Member  for

Kallang  was  instrumental in  calling  a  meeting

immediately after Dr Goh had made a speech at one

of  the  seminars. That was followed by some  more

meetings  at the N.T.U.C., and quite a  number  of

them  were  reported  in the press.  I  think  the

N.T.U.C, would be the appropriate body -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Pass the buck.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> -to educate the workers, in the

sense  that they are their leaders. The  Ministry

of  Labour  is more concerned really with  labour

legislation  and control, and to assist  wherever

necessary. In this respect, as I have  said,  the

most important thing is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



new  building regulations. They will help because,

at  the moment as the people concerned do not take

the  Factories Ordinance seriously,  some  of  the

items  in the new regulations have been listed  in

great  detail. I do not want to waste the time  of

the  House by quoting some of the regulations, but

I  hope  that  Members will have a copy  in  their

hands soon.



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr L. P. Rodrigo):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   actually  I  am  befuddled  by  all   these

questions  asked by the Backbenchers.  I  too  was

present on the occasion when the films were shown,

and  I  thought  that the Minister  of  State  had

answered quite well all the queries raised at that

time, as well as those which have been raised here

this  afternoon. I do also remember that  on  that

occasion tea and cakes were served!



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not think

that little room in the Ministry of Labour is  the

same as Parliament House!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Sir, coming back to what the

Minister of State has mentioned about the N.T.U.C.

taking   the   responsibility   for   courses   on

industrial safety, I think that is a wrong step to

take.  This  cannot be the sole responsibility  of

the  N.T.U.C, and, as he himself has  stated,  the

N.T.U.C, has done its share. I would have  thought

that  the safety and welfare of the workers should

be  a  tripartite affair. So as the  N.T.U.C, has

done  its  part, as the Minister of State  has  so

kindly  indicated, my question is:  what  has  the

Ministry done about the whole thing?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> The Ministry of Labour will be

glad  to  assist and to participate in any  safety

measures  that the N.T.U.C, can think of.  Anyway,

in the revised Factories Ordinance, the setting up

of  an  Advisory  Council on  Safety  Measures  is

contemplated, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



that  will  involve the workers,  management,  and

Government  - a tripartite affair, as  the  Member

has  said.  We  are all obviously  aware  that  no

single  individual or body can really tackle  this

problem,  as it needs the co-operation of everyone

concerned, including the N.T.U.C.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1251*.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs. Ng Yeow Chong, P. Govindaswamy, Sim Boon Woo, N. Govindasamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this question of citizenship is a painful

one  when  I talk about the way it is dealt  with.

Sir, you will remember that in every budget debate

over   the   last  few  years  this  question   of

citizenship  always  came up for  discussion.  The

reason  why  we are concerned with this particular

subject  is  that  we, as representatives  of  the

people,  often  come  in close  contact  with  the

people  and therefore have talked with them  about

citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizenship is concerned with the livelihood of

our   people.  If  an  applicant  is   not   given

citizenship,  it  will give  rise  to  many  other

problems. First of all, he will not be able to get

a job. Because of this, his family will suffer and

his  wife and children will suffer too. This is  a

very  serious topic. I hope Members opposite  will

not joke about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully realise that in the last few years the Government was very strict about granting citizenship. The reason is that out country was faced with serious economic problems then and therefore we had to adopt a very strict policy and not grant citizenship readily. But I

wish  to say that there were some aspects  of  the

policy which were incorrect or inappropriate.  Let

me  take, for example, the case of a family in  my

constituency.   The  parents   are   citizens   of

Singapore. Of their five children, four were  born

in Singapore, and only one was born outside Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



In  other  words,  in  a  family  of  seven

members, six are citizens of Singapore, and one is

a non-citizen. Sir, this non-citizen member of the

family  has reached the age when he can apply  for

citizenship.   He  has  already  submitted   three

applications  to the Registry of Citizenship,  but

every   one  has  been  rejected.  He  has   since

submitted  his  application for the  fourth  time.

This  young boy normally is full of life and zeal,

but  because  time after time his application  has

been   rejected,  he  has  become  very  dejected,

depressed and pessimistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the circumstances of this case are

not  isolated.  There are many people  in  similar

circumstances. Therefore, we have to consider this

question very seriously. If most of the members of

a  family  are citizens, where could a non-citizen

member turn to for a living? He must find a  means

of  livelihood in Singapore so that he can  settle

down  and  have  his  own  family.  I  think  this

question  should  be seriously considered  by  the

Minister and he should instruct his department  to

treat  such cases with sympathy and not to  reject

all applications.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is this. Our Minister has often

said  that,  as more people are given citizenship,

our burden becomes heavier. I quite agree with him

on  this point. I think some of the applicants for

citizenship need not impose an added burden on the

Government.  For  example,  some  traders  have  a

monthly  income  of $500 to $600. Sometimes  their

monthly income is $300 to $400. This is sufficient

for  them to support their own families. There are

some  applicants  who  are hawkers  and  if  their

business   is   fair,   their   income   will   be

considerable.  They  will,  therefore,  be  in   a

position  to support their own families.  However,

applicants  who  are in this situation  have  also

been rejected. I think perhaps the Government  has

been  too  strict. Since these  people  are  in  a

position  to support their families and  will  not

impose  an added burden on the Government, why  do

we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



not approve their applications for citizenship  so

that  they  can  be loyal citizens and  contribute

their  bit  to  the country? On  behalf  of  these

people,  I  would  like to  ask  our  Minister  to

consider their situation sympathetically and solve

their difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point I wish to raise. This

concerns  our  policy of foreign  investors.  What

attitude  do  we  take in granting citizenship  to

them?  We  offer  them  facilities  to  stay  here

because they are useful to the development of  our

economy. This is as it should be.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member has one minute left.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Our Government

has  given these people preferential treatment.  I

wish  to  know how many of them have been  granted

citizenship in the last few years. How many  years

have they been resident in Singapore? What is  the

position  of their investment? How much have  they

invested?  I  wish to know also  how  many  people

applied for citizenship last year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

concerned  about those who were born in  Singapore

before  and during the Japanese Occupation  period

and  whose births were not reported and registered

by their parents. They had no documentary evidence

and  were  therefore  not  issued  with  the  pink

laminated identity cards during the last  exercise

in  1966  to  replace  the paper  identity  cards.

Instead they were issued with blue identity  cards

and  were,  therefore, regarded  as  non-citizens.

Consequently,  they had to make  applications  for

registration as Singapore citizens just  as  those

who    had    migrated   from   other   countries.

Unfortunately,   more  often   than   not,   their

applications   were   not   given   any    special

consideration,  even  if  they   had   the   birth

certificates  of  their brothers  and  sisters  to

support their cases. Most of these people are  now

married  and have raised their children here.  Yet

they  are still non-citizens. There are many  such

cases  in  my  constituency. I believe  there  are

quite a lot of similar cases in other constituencies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to  appeal  to

the  Minister for Labour to give these people  the

benefit   of   the   doubt   and   approve   their

applications for citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Does the Minister wish to reply to

the  first two speakers or does he like the others

to carry on before he replies?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I will wait until they have

finished speaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wish  to  bring  up  the chronic  problem  of  the

granting  of  citizenship. At last  year's  budget

sitting,  the  Minister for Labour stated  clearly

that  the granting of citizenship was a matter  of

privilege  and  not of right.  He  said  that  the

criterion  for  the  granting of  citizenship  was

whether the applicant was going to be an asset  to

our country. While I fully agree with the Minister

on  this,  I wish to point out that this principle

applies  more  appropriately to  people  who  have

money  to  invest  in Singapore or  who  have  the

special  skills  required in  Singapore's  growing

industries. However, there are some people who  do

not  fall  within  these two  categories,  and  to

refuse  them  citizenship would cause hardship  to

them,  especially as they are, in  fact,  eligible

for citizenship. In this respect, Sir, allow me to

cite the case of a Singapore citizen who has died,

leaving  behind a widow with several children  who

were  all  born in Singapore. She has applied  for

citizenship. If she is not granted citizenship, it

will  be  difficult for her to get a job.  If  she

cannot get a job, how is she going to support  her

children who were born in Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another case I wish to quote is that of a girl

who  was  born in Malaysia. Soon after her  birth,

her  mother died and she was brought to  Singapore

and  taken  care of by her grandfather  who  is  a

Singapore  citizen. She is now 24 years  old.  All

these  years she has had her education  here,  and

has never left Singapore even for a short holiday.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not suggesting that the Minister should open the door and allow all and sundry who wish to work in Singapore to be given citizenship. But I would like to know whether the Minister will give due consideration to deserving cases.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question

of  applications for citizenship has been  brought

up  in this House every year, like the playing  of

an old record. The reason why it is being taken up

every  year  is that citizenship is  of  paramount

importance  to everyone who has been  residing  in

the  republic for many years. Sir, this House  has

heard many grouses and suggestions even at today's

sitting.  Sir, if you will recall,  in  answer  to

Members of this House last year, that the Minister

of  State  for  Labour stated that the  policy  of

granting  citizenship would be reviewed from  time

to  time.  My  question is this: can the  Minister

tell  Members  of this House what is  the  present

policy? In his budget statement, the Minister  for

Finance  has stated that our economy is improving,

the  industries are going very well,  and  we  are

short  of  workers. Sir, if that is  the  case,  I

wonder  whether  citizenship will  be  granted  to

those  who  really want to stay  in  the  republic

throughout all their lives and who want to be  the

sons of the soil in this place.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, as the Member for Changi

has  pointed out, the Citizenship Registry and the

Government's  policy  on  citizenship  came  under

heavy criticism during the last budget debate.  In

view  of  and subsequent to the various criticisms

levelled at the Government during the last  budget

debate,   has  there  been  any  change   in   the

Government's policy on citizenship?  From  my  own

experience,   I   notice   that   applicants   for

citizenship  have  to wait much longer  than  ever

before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been no apparent improvement at all in

the processing of applications by the Registry  of

Citizenship.  The  only improvement  that  can  be

credited to the Registry is the prompt response to

an inquiry by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



Members of Parliament about applications which may

be  pending  for  two  years  or  even  more.  The

Registry, undoubtedly, is of the view that it  has

conscientiously  discharged its duty  by  promptly

informing  us that the application is still  under

active consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members who have spoken previously have

mentioned particular cases. Sir, may I also  point

out  a particular case where the prompt reply from

the  Registry  would make all  and  sundry  laugh,

especially  at the manner in which the  reply  was

given.  The parents, brothers and sisters of  this

applicant  for  citizenship are all citizens.  The

parents  applied  for  minor citizenship  for  the

person concerned when she was almost 18 years old.

Next  month  this applicant would  have  become  a

major, that is, she would have passed 21 years  of

age,  and when an appeal was made, because in  one

month's  time  her  minor citizenship  application

would be invalidated because she would be 21 years

old,   the  usual  cyclostyled  reply  was,  "Your

application is under active consideration."  There

need not be any consideration, Sir, because in one

and a half month's time the application would have

become  invalidated. That was the immediate reply.

Nobody ever sees the appeal made on behalf of  any

applicant. This particular applicant is in one  of

the  tertiary institutions receiving remission  of

tuition fees because her parents are citizens  and

because  this applicant is a minor at the  moment.

When  the next term in the university begins,  she

is  not  going to receive a remission  of  tuition

fees  because,  in her own right,  she  becomes  a

major and, as a result, loses this remission. This

afternoon  we  have  heard  that  the  number   of

bursaries is to be limited. Hardship cases of this

nature should receive at least some consideration,

or  the  grounds  for appeal should  at  least  be

looked  into. No. Sir, it was just a prompt  reply

from the Registry of Citizenship. That is all that

happened.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should have thought that instead of just

replying promptly, the Registry would need further

reactivation.  I hope the Minister  can  enlighten

Members on the following points:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) What is the total number of (a) applications

for    citizenship    received;    and    (b)

applications  approved; and (c)  applications

rejected during the year 1970?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Is the prolongation of the processing period

for   citizenship  applications  due   to   a

conscious  and  deliberate  policy   of   the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministry or the inability of the Registry to

cope with the volume of work?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) What is the longest period for citizenship

applications to be considered? Is it possible

to speed up the procedure for the issue of  a

citizenship certificate to a minor  applicant

who  is  the only non-citizen in a family  of

citizens?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am also

concerned  with certain categories  of  applicants

for   citizenship  whose  applications  have  been

rejected. I wish to explain the categories that  I

have  in  mind.  I  shall explain  by  quoting  an

example.  The parents, brothers and sisters  of  a

certain  applicant are all Singapore  citizens  by

birth.  This  particular  applicant  was  born  in

Malaysia  by  accident. By accident, I  mean  this

particular  applicant was born  when  the  parents

were  living temporarily for three months in Kuala

Lumpur   because   the  applicant's   father   was

transferred  there  for about three  months  only.

Since  then, this applicant has never been out  of

Singapore and has always been here, educated  here

and lived here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, in replying to queries made last year, said that citizenship would not be granted to those who were a burden to Singapore. This person whom I have mentioned cannot go anywhere and will be a burden to Singapore, whether he is granted Singapore citizenship or not. I appeal to

the Minister to consider this case and similar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



cases  sympathetically.  This  person  cannot   go

anywhere,  cannot  get any other citizenship,  and

his   future  is  also  affected.  He  cannot  get

employment. Where can he go?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to associate myself with the view

aired  by  the  Member  for  Telok  Blangah   that

decisions  on  applications be  made  as  soon  as

possible and the applicants be notified as quickly

as possible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I crave

your  indulgence and the indulgence of this  House

to  relate  another pathetic example  of  a  minor

citizen  who, as a result of his failure  to  take

the  oath  of  allegiance, has had his citizenship

withdrawn.  I  think this was unnecessary  if  the

Registrar   of   Citizens   had   exercised   some

discretion in the implementation of the policy  on

the  granting  of citizenship. May  I  relate  the

ridiculous  situation  in  which  this  particular

person  faced?  He  was granted minor  citizenship

and,  in  many other cases, on the certificate  of

the  minor citizenship there is a reminder to  the

effect  that  he must take the oath of  allegiance

when  he  reaches  the age  of  21.  But  in  this

particular  case, somehow or other,  there  was  a

clerical  error  or there was an omission  on  the

part  of the staff of the Registry of Citizenship,

and  this  was not done. So there was really  very

good  reason  for  the  person  concerned  to   be

ignorant of the fact that he had to take the  oath

of  allegiance when he reaches the age of  21.  We

must  not expect every citizen to have the law  at

his  finger-tips.  At the same time,  this  person

received a scholarship from the Teachers' Training

College to be a technical teacher. He went for the

teacher-training   course    on    a    Government

scholarship  which stipulates that  only  citizens

can  be  granted that scholarship. When he applied

for  the scholarship, his age was 19 plus. He  got

the   scholarship  because  he  was  a   Singapore

citizen.   Before  he  completed   the   training,

however,  his  citizenship was withdrawn  because,

when  he  passed  the age of 21, the  Registry  of

Citizenship discovered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



that  he had not taken the oath of allegiance  and

so  withdrew his minor citizenship. This person is

now  in a predicament. I wrote to the Ministry  of

Education  and  enquired about  his  position  and

whether  he  was going to continue  receiving  the

scholarship  in  the Teachers'  Training  College.

Sir,  when  there is a shortage of teachers  these

days,  nobody can deny the fact that  anybody  who

takes  up teacher training, in technical education

is making a contribution to the country. Up to now

I  have neither received a reply from the Ministry

of  Education  nor a reply from  the  Ministry  of

Labour as to whether immediate consideration would

be  given  to this particular case in  giving  him

citizenship.  This  was  a  clear   case   of   an

unfortunate incident in which the person concerned

should  not be entirely blamed because, as I  have

said, in other cases there is a reminder that  the

person  must take the oath of allegiance  when  he

reaches  the  age of 21. In this particular  case,

the reminder was not there. This is one example in

my  constituency. There are many more examples  to

show  that the Ministry of Labour is going  a  bit

too   far   when   they  decide   on   citizenship

applications.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is one of

those  items in the budget where I have to  repeat

what I said during the last two years. I am quite-reconciled to this ritual because I do not think I

am  going to convince Members of my point of view.

There  is  no doubt that I will remain unconvinced

as regards their points of view.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, let me say that we are well aware that

the rigid application of our citizenship laws does

cause hardships. But there are many laws and a law

is   a   general  principle  applied  to  specific

situations  and  invariably there  are  individual

cases which do not fit into the general structure.

Ask  any  lawyer, and he will tell you that  there

are no other ways of formulating laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of citizenship laws, we have to

balance one principle against the other. If I  may

repeat what I have repeatedly said, Singapore is a

small island and we have serious economic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



problems  affecting two million people, and  until

we  are quite convinced that we can cope with  and

satisfy  and protect the interests of our citizens

first,  we  are  not going to open  our  doors  to

citizenship for whatever reasons (some of them are

no  doubt  cogent) for -- I cannot give the  exact

figures  - but probably they are in the region  of

20,000 to 30,000 cases. This problem will cease to

exist  as  the  years go on,  because  this  is  a

problem  which  resulted from our separation  from

Malaysia, and is one of the consequences  we  have

to  accept.  The principle always is  that  if  we

grant  citizenship to a non-citizen,  the  primary

consideration must be and will be: is  it  in  the

interest of Singapore? Will he constitute a burden

to  Singapore? Because if you make an exception in

the  case of one, you must be prepared to make  an

exception for the others. It is an unfortunate and

difficult  matter. But it is a choice we  have  to

make.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that the policy has never changed. We

never  said  that  we  were going  to  change  the

policy.  But in the implementation of the  policy,

as  far as is possible, we do make adjustments and

exercise discretion, but it must not infringe  the

basic  principle  that  we  enunciate,  that   the

applicant  for citizenship does not  constitute  a

burden to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it was the Member for Mountbatten who

said that in case of doubt, give the applicant the

benefit  of  the doubt and therefore  create  more

citizens. We are not prepared to treat citizenship

in  such a light-hearted fashion where we give the

benefit of the doubt to not one or two but tens of

thousands.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I said that

we  give  the benefit of the doubt to those  cases

who  can  support  their applications  with  birth

certificates of their brothers and sisters who are

citizens.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> A point that has repeatedly been

made  is that if a person is a non-citizen, he  is

starving.   I   say  that  any  non-citizen,   and

especially those who hold blue identity cards, can

get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



work  permits  to work in Singapore today.  Unless

the  man is incapable of work or cannot contribute

in   any   way  to  the  economic  well-being   of

Singapore,  he  can get work. Therefore,  to  that

extent, even if he is a non-citizen, he can earn a

living if he is prepared to take the kind of  work

that  is  offered  to him. Therefore,  that  point

raised  is  not  a cogent reason for  opening  the

doors  to  citizenship. If it were only to  a  few

hundred cases, we would have said, "Open the doors

and  change our policy." But it involves  tens  of

thousands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the specific cases that have been

mentioned  -  there were so many of them  -  I  am

always  loath  to  make judgments  purely  on  the

presentation  of the case from one  side.  I  have

been  a newspaper man. I know how to write stories

which  are  factually correct but  which  are  not

true.  So a case may be right, or it may be wrong.

I  would  not like to make a pronouncement  unless

and   until  those  Members  who  have  given  the

instances  refer them to me or to the Minister  of

State for Labour, and we will look into them.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be that the Members are right, in which

event  we will give these cases consideration.  It

may  be  that most of the stories related in  this

House   are  not  correct,  in  which   case   the

applications will have to be rejected. A number of

the cases no doubt conform to the principle of our

policy,  that where all members of the family  are

Singapore citizens but one who, for one reason  or

other,  missed  the boat but who  will  not  be  a

burden to Singapore, his application will be given

sympathetic    consideration.   The    over-riding

principle is whether he will be an economic burden

to  Singapore. If today a man is a hawker  and  is

just  able to provide for himself and his  family,

that  does not mean that a year from now  he  will

not  constitute an economic burden to  the  state.

But  if we are convinced that this man will, on  a

reasonable  assumption, continue  to  provide  for

himself, and all members of his family are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>



Singapore   citizens,  then  his  case   will   be

sympathetically considered. I know of a number  of

cases where favourable consideration was given  to

one  member  of the family who for one  reason  or

other could not be a Singapore citizen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the Member for Telok Blangah who

wants   to   know   how  many   applications   for

citizenship  have  been approved  or  rejected,  I

cannot  say offhand, but if he will write  in,  we

can  provide the necessary statistics. May I  give

Members  the advice that I give to members  of  my

constituency? I get lots of people  who,  for  one

reason or other, come to see me about citizenship.

I  give them one very sound piece of advice  which

has been referred to as criticism of the Ministry.

Lots of people have made applications and they get

this ritualistic reply saying, "It is under active

consideration." The people come to me  saying,  "I

have  been  under consideration for the  last  two

years." I tell them, "I can give you a note to the

Registrar of Citizens asking him to look into your

case, but the chances are that if you press him to

make  a decision now, he must reject it under  the

existing  policy.  The  fact  that  it  is   under

consideration means that if, at some future  time,

for  a variety of reasons, we find that we can let

in more non-citizens, then, if you are still under

consideration, maybe you will be among  those  who

will  be  able  to g-et in. So if  you  press  the

Registrar  to make a decision now, you  do  it  at

your own risk." Some of them never believed me and

sure  enough when they pressed for a reply  -  the

officer had to make a decision - he was forced  to

make  a decision and under existing policy it must

be  "no". So this is the advice I give and Members

should  give to their constituents, that where  no

decision has been made, it is best to let sleeping

dogs  lie and do not force the officials concerned

at  the moment because the policy is a clear  one.

But  if  the applicant is going to be an  economic

liability, the answer is no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> No news is good news!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, no news is good news. This

briefly  sets out the Government policy in  regard

to  the granting of citizenship. There has been no

change in policy and we are not going to change it

until we are satisfied that during the next one or

two   years,  the  British  withdrawal  and  other

factors  are not going to create serious  economic

difficulties  which  will  involve  our   citizens

first.  Once  we  are  sure of  that,  we  may  be

prepared  to make some adjustments to our  current

policy in regard to citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Can I just make a small point?

On  those  cases  which  are  still  under  active

consideration, I hope the Minister will direct the

staff that whenever they are approached by members

of  the  public, they should explain to them  that

there  is  no  point in wasting their time  coming

back.   There  have  been  occasions  where   such

applicants  were  referred  by  the  officials  to

Members of Parliament. This is wasting everybody's

time. It is an easy way out for a civil servant to

say,  "Well, if you want something to be done,  go

and   see  your  M.P."  This  attitude  is   wrong

basically.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I will take note of what the

Member  says and tell the officials to say, "Well,

don't see your M.P.!"



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> The policy is already very

clearly  laid  down and surely the directive  that

civil  servants should not pass the  buck  to  the

M.P.s should go down the line. This is wasting the

time  of the applicants, not just the time of  the

M.P.s,  which is less important than that  of  the

public.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  have heard the explanation given  by  the

Minister   and  I  am  prepared  to  withdraw   my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1351*.

(*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs. S. Ramaswamym, P. Govindaswamy and Ho Kah Leong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this subhead I would like to raise some

points  regarding work permits. I have received  a

number  of complaints from factory employers  that

their  applications  for work  permits  have  been

unduly  delayed, in some cases,  for  as  long  as

three  to  four months without a reply. It  is  my

view   that  this  delay  is  causing  unnecessary

difficulty to the factories involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember that during the budget debate last year the Minister for Labour stated that the rules relating to the applications for work permits would be relaxed to some extent. In fact today he himself has stated that non-citizens are also eligible to apply for work permits which will be given on sympathetic

grounds. This is a very welcome piece of  news  to

many  people.  We all know that our factories  are

short  of  workers, particularly skilled  workers.

Manual workers are also in acute shortage in  some

places. Therefore, the Work Permits Office  should

assist   the   factories  involved   by   speedier

processing of their applications for work  permits

and  granting them quickly. The work in  the  Work

Permits  Office  should  be  spread  out.  I  have

received  many  complaints from various  factories

about unnecessary delays. I do not know the actual

reason  for  the  delay. It is my  hope  that  the

Minister  will look into the matter and  find  out

whether  there is any good reason at all  for  the

delay.  If there is, it should be explained.  Does

the delay mean that the relaxation of the rules in

respect of work permits is being reconsidered?  If

not,  it is probably the failure of the Government

servants concerned to speed up their work.  It  is

my  hope  that  the Minister will  supervise  more

closely the work of the civil servants involved so

as  to  improve the efficiency of the Work Permits

Office.  In  this way, it will also contribute  to

our industrial development.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next query I wish to ask is this: over the

past one year, how many cases of applications  for

work  permits  have been received, how  many  have

been  granted,  and how many have  been  rejected?

What  are  the  main reasons for  rejecting  these

applications?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to take

this  opportunity to appeal to the Minister to  be

liberal in issuing work permits to people who work

as  drivers of cars or construction workers. It is

a   well-known  fact  that  although  construction

workers   are  in  great  demand,  they  are   not

available.  Now  and then we hear of  workers  who

have  lost their lives in the construction  field.

If  we  enquire who the persons are, we will  know

that  they  are from Malaysia. Likewise, motor-car

drivers are not at all available in Singapore now.

There are hundreds of vacancies for drivers in the

Government itself, but these have not been  filled

for  years.  The Minister of State for  Labour  is

personally  aware of this fact. I have also  heard

that in the army, there are thousands of vacancies

for  drivers  of  army vehicles.  A  lot  of  army

vehicles  are not being used because  drivers  are

not  available.  As such, will the  Government  do

something  to  relieve this shortage by  liberally

issuing  work permits to those who can be employed

as drivers and construction workers?



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Government  has  often  said  that,  in  order  to

sustain the rapid growth of Singapore's industries

and  in  view  of the shortage of certain  skilled

labour,  it  is prepared to relax its  immigration

laws  to  allow  skilled  labourers  to  work   in

Singapore. I wish to seek clarification  from  the

Minister as to what constitutes skilled labour. As

an example, if a restaurant advertises for a cook,

and if no suitable applicant is available, can the

proprietor employ a cook from overseas?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho Kah Leong? He is not here.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, to deal with the last

question first. The Member for Anson talked  about

the  specific case of a skilled cook. I should say

that  if  there  is no skilled cook  available  in

Singapore and if he can find one somewhere else, I

am sure a work permit will be given to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Potong Pasir who talked

about drivers and construction workers, I think it

is  an exaggeration to say that there are hundreds

of  such  vacancies in Government. I do not  think

there  are that many. There are probably 40 or  50

vacancies in the Government service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for his question on construction workers, I

think  he  has not been reading the newspapers  in

the last few months. If you will remember, Sir,  a

couple of months back there was a hue and cry from

contractors regarding the shortage of construction

workers.  So  a  meeting  was  held  between   the

Ministry  of Labour and the Singapore Contractors'

Association to simplify the procedure of  applying

for  and  issuing of work permits,  and  this  was

implemented.  I  should, therefore,  imagine  that

there has been no difficulty so far.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> If the Minister of State will give

way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Sir, I am aware of this fact. But

apparently  construction  workers  are  still  not

available.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, if construction workers are

not  available, that has nothing to  do  with  the

Work  Permits Office. It only issues work  permits

when  contractors can find the workers. We do  not

find workers for them. The Member for Potong Pasir

must  not  confuse the issue. In fact, I  can  say

that  up  to  the end of February this  year.  243

contractors had submitted block



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



applications for work permits. And -at this moment

I  think  there are 5,527 non-citizen construction

workers being employed by the contractors. So  you

can  see how quickly applications for work permits

are dealt with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang talked about factories

having  to  wait three or four months before  they

could get work permits for their workers. This  is

rather  surprising to me. But if he will  give  me

the  particular instances in writing, I can assure

him  that I will look into them. I just cannot see

any  reason for applications to be hanging  around

in the office for three or four months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked for figures relating to the number

of  applications approved, rejected, and so on.  I

am afraid I cannot give them to him now, but if he

will  put  the  question in  a  separate  item  of

business, I shall be glad to answer him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Sir, I have not yet got an answer

to  my  question  whether the Government  will  be

liberal in issuing work permits to drivers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, for any category of workers

that  are  in short supply, work permits  will  be

given.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Sir, I think the Minister

of  State for Labour has missed one very important

point. There are two procedures for processing  an

application for a work permit. If the applicant is

a  holder  of a Singapore blue identity  card,  he

goes through the usual process and his application

is  dealt  with expeditiously. But for  those  who

come  from  Malaysia or elsewhere, in addition  to

submitting   applications  to  the  Work   Permits

Office,  they also have to submit applications  to

the  Immigration  Department for visit  passes.  I

believe this is where the delay is caused.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, I am afraid I cannot speak

for  the Immigration Department. But as far as the

Work Permits Office is concerned, we deal with the

applications  in  the normal way.  And  for  those

people  who are resident outside Singapore,  their

cases   must,  of  course,  be  referred  to   the

Immigration Department.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the

forms for the application of a work permit as well

as  for  a  visa are issued, by the  Work  Permits

Office,  surely there must be some liaison between

these two departments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Normally if a type of skilled

labour   is   in  very  short  supply, temporary

permission  to  work  can be  given  by  the  Work

Permits   Office.   But  until   the   Immigration

Department  gives  the clearance,  of  course  the

worker will only be given temporary permission  to

work, but not a proper work permit. A proper  work

permit  for  six  months, a year,  or  for  stated

periods  will  only  be  issued  when  the   whole

administrative process has been completed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Minister  of  State  has  given  me   a

satisfactory answer, and I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I merely want to seek information regarding these

claims under the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance.

Am I right in presuming that this provision is for

claims against the Ministry of Labour? If so,  can

the Minister let us know how many claims were made

during  the  last  financial year,  what  was  the

extent  of these claims, and how serious were  the

injuries caused? Further, can the Minister  inform

me  whether  the proportion of responsibility  for

the  fault either resting with the workers or with

the management is the same as that outlined by his

Minister of State?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the Member for Katong is

correct in assuming that the vote of $27,000 under

this  subhead  is  in respect  of  claims  against

various  Government departments. I  am  not  quite

sure  whether I can give any details of the nature

of these accidents or who was at fault, because  I

do  not have the data with me. But I can say  that

altogether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



some   36   claims   were  made  against   various

Government departments and about $31,000 was  paid

as compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take this opportunity to

enlighten  the  House  on  the  question  of   the

revision  of the Workmen's Compensation  Ordinance

which  was raised earlier. The revision is  almost

completely  processed, and  is  just  waiting  for

certain  formalities. It is the intention  of  the

Government  to revise the compensation  upward  by

roughly  three  times  the  present  amount.   For

example, in the case of an injured worker below 40

years  of  age,  the  present  maximum  lump   sum

compensation of $7,200 will, I think, be raised to

well  over  $21,000.  So if  Government  employees

continue   to  get  involved  in  accidents,   the

provision of $27,000 may be much more at the  next

budget session.

<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, to follow up,

may  I  ask  the Minister whether his Ministry  is

responsible  for  all claims  for  accidents  that

occur   in   the   various  departments   of   the

Government?  If  that  is  so,  then  perhaps  the

Ministry  of  Labour should take steps  to  ensure

that  there are maximum safety conditions of  work

in  the  various Government departments so  as  to

minimise the possibility of accidents. In this way

we  might  not  have  to pay so much  compensation

later on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, as far as I can gather,

compensation is paid out of this vote. It seems to

me   that   the  accidents  are  not  particularly

serious.  The amounts of claims vary between  $100

and  $200.  Except for one claim  of  $6,000,  the

others  are small amounts. I suppose the standards

of   precaution  in  Government  departments   are

considerably higher than those found elsewhere.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, may I thank the Minister, and

beg leave to withdraw?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have talked about Training. Within-Industry, but perhaps the Minister for Labour or

his  Minister of State can enlighten  us  on  what

this vote of $1,500 is for.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Sir, T.W.I., or Training-Within-Industry, is a scheme organised by the Ministry of

Labour  to  render service to industry,  commerce,

and  the Government departments concerned. Its aim

is   to   increase  efficiency  through  effective

supervision training. This point has been  touched

on  by the Member for Katong some months back. The

provision  asked  for is to get an  assistant.  In

fact,  as  I  have said earlier on,  an  Assistant

Training Officer will be appointed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> This provision that I am talking

about  comes  under  O.C.A.R.,  and  not  Personal

Emoluments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> This O.C.A.R, vote is to meet incidental expenses. For example, we may need to hand out cyclostyled material.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Coffee and cakes!



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> There is also a need for

stationery,    training   equipment   accessories,

duplicating materials such as stencils,  ink,  and

items  like  that. That is why the amount  is  not

large.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, going back to

the  occasion  of  the visit to  the  Ministry  of

Labour which the Minister of State has touched  on

earlier,  I  think I can say that those  who  went

there   were  impressed  indeed  by  the   service

provided, apart from the film that I referred  to.

May  I  ask  if  this excellent service  is  being

adequately  distributed among  industry,  and,  if

not, could it be spread out a little bit more than

it is at present?



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I think enough publicity is

being   given  at  present  through  the  training

facilities  provided by the Ministry. The  various

employer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



agencies do make use of these training facilities.

When  the  courses are organised, all  the  people

concerned  are informed in advance and  they  send

their people to attend them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg leave to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2013.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I am seeking information regarding the

scheme which requires cases of industrial diseases

to  be reported. Apparently, payment is being made

for  such reports. However, the-vote is only  $10.

Presumably  we do not know the number  of  reports

which  will come in. Can I be enlightened a little

further on this matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the

Factories  Ordinance,  every  registered   medical

practitioner who is called to visit a patient who,

in   his  opinion,  may  be  suffering  from   any

industrial  disease is required to report  to  the

Chief  Inspector of Factories. He must  state  the

particulars about the ailment which the patient is

suffering from. He is entitled to a fee of $5  for

each notice, payable from public funds. Since  the

number  of  these reports cannot be projected,  we

have  only a token sum of $10. If we do  not  have

enough funds, as was the case last year when there

were  13  such notices of industrial diseases,  we

can find the money elsewhere. We have just put  in

a  token amount here so that we can vary it as the

circumstances demand.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg leave to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2016.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an item on rehabilitation and retraining

of  disabled  persons. The amount allocated  under

this  subhead  has  been reduced  from  $9,500  to

$8,000.  I  do hope that this is not an indication

by the Minister that he is placing less importance

on  the  rehabilitation and retraining of disabled

persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the greater number of industrial

accidents,  it is fair to presume that the  number

of  disabled  persons will increase from  year  to

year. As I see it, there is a need to increase the

facilities  for the rehabilitation and  retraining

of  disabled persons. However, in view of the very

small  provision of $8,000, I do  not  really  see

what  kind of facilities can be offered. I  should

appreciate  it  if the Minister  could  give  some

information on the facilities at present available

in his Ministry.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I think the Minister for Social

Affairs  has earlier on answered his question  and

he   has   given   some  details  regarding   this

particular  item.  Therefore, I  do  not  wish  to

repeat it again. The reason for fixing the sum  at

$8,000 this year is that last year we spent  about

$4,800   of  the  provision.  This  is  only   the

allowance  given to disabled persons and  not  the

cost   of   training  facilities.  These  disabled

persons   are   sent  to  various   factories   or

establishments  which give them the  training.  We

only  give  them a monthly subsistence  allowance,

that  is,  money for transport and other expenses.

The  sum involved in each particular case  is  not

very big.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3001.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> As a result of a previous

misunderstanding of the purpose of this vote, I am

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $2,354,320 for Head 0601 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



Head 0701 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I merely wish to take the opportunity of

asking  the  Minister about the implementation  of

the  Wilson Bus Study. I believe the Minister  has

publicly  announced  that  he  has  accepted  this

report in principle. I do not know whether he will

follow   strictly  the  recommendations  contained

therein,  or  whether there will be  a  subsequent

revision.  As the report stands at the moment,  it

looks  as  if  the  people in my constituency  are

going to be left with much less bus services  than

they  have at present. For instance, route numbers

5  and 6, which I think are known to the Minister,

will be withdrawn and the total number of buses in

service will also be substantially reduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I would ask the Minister to

consider  is  that  the minimum  fare  for  school

children should remain at five cents and  not  ten

cents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

answer the Member for Jalan Kayu in respect of the

implementation  of the Wilson Bus  Study.  It  was

clearly  stated  that  the  recommendations   were

accepted in principle, with or without amendments.

The  basic  principles have been  accepted.  There

will  be re-routing and re-allocating of the  120-odd  bus routes which before were operated  by  11

bus  companies  but which will be re-allocated  to

four  bus  companies. The implementation date  has

been  fixed  for 11th April, which is  only  about

three weeks from now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases of reorganisation, one must

anticipate  difficulties during  the  transitional

period. A massive operation like this is bound  to

create  certain  difficulties.  It  must  not   be

assumed  that  the previous routes allocated  were

ideal  routes. They were put up before the Omnibus

Services  Licensing Authority  for  approval.  But

under  the  new  Bus Services Licensing  Authority

Act, which was passed in this House recently and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



which  is now in operation, it is the Bus Services

Licensing  Authority which decides on the  routes.

It  may  happen that there will be alterations  to

the bus routes that used to run from Jalan Kayu to

various parts of Singapore. I can only plead  that

the  bus users try to accept the changes and allow

a period of six months for the system to work. The

newly constituted Bus Services Licensing Authority

will  look into all the difficulties that  may  be

encountered and amendments may have to be made.  I

think  it is only fair that some time should  pass

before  a  proper  study  can  be  made  and   the

implications  felt before further changes  can  be

made. If we go round the city, we can see that new

bus  poles  have been erected. The number  is  not

small.  As  many  as 2,500 poles will  be  erected

along  the main routes of Singapore. We cannot  be

chopping  and  changing  the  routes  with   every

request made for consideration. We have officially

stated that all the requests will be considered in

due  time.  But the 130 routes which have  already

been  approved for the four bus companies will  go

into operation on Sunday, 11th April.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the suggestion by the Member for Jalan

Kayu  to  continue with the minimum fare  of  five

cents for school children, I am afraid that he has

stressed  only  one aspect of  the  new  bus  fare

structure   and   has  forgotten  completely   the

reductions  in bus fares where they are applicable

to  long  distances. In the past, 10 bus companies

were  entitled  to  charge a maximum  fare  of  80

cents.  This has been reduced to 50 cents. And  we

have  the usual silent majority! When there  is  a

benefit, nobody talks about it. But when  a  five-cent minimum rate is raised to 10 cents, everybody

talks  about  it.  The  five-cent  rate  is   only

applicable for the first mile for school  children

when travelling in S.T.C, buses today.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the 10 other companies. It is five

cents for the first two miles and it goes right up

to  40 cents. But when we want to introduce a flat

rate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>



of  10 cents, Members pick on the increase of five

cents  and  say that there has been a  very  heavy

increase  in  bus fares. For adults,  the  minimum

fare being charged by the S.T.C, is 10 cents. But,

of  course, the Chinese bus companies are charging

five  cents  for the first mile. I am afraid  this

minimum   fare  of  five  cents  is  not  strictly

correct, but even if it is correct -



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my point is

that   the   minimum  of  five  cents  should   be

applicable to school children and not to adults.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I am glad to say that

there has been no change in the bus fare structure

for  the last 20 years. When one thinks about  the

increase  in  prices, not only of commodities  but

other  things  -  I  think  there  is  practically

nothing  that has not increased in price over  the

last  20  years - if we think along  those  lines,

then  an increase of five cents should be, if  not

well  received,  then at least with understanding.

Besides,  if  we  are  to ask  for  a  better  and

improved  bus  service, surely  we  will  have  to

accept  a  slight increase in bus fares, although,

unfortunately,  the  increase  may  affect  school

children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also take into consideration the fact

that  nothing is for free in Singapore.  There  is

always a price to be paid for the service that  we

get.  The  best  example is water. It  is  raining

outside  this House at this moment. The  water  is

free.  It comes from the sky in torrents. But  the

water  from  the  sky  has  to  be  collected   in

reservoirs  which  cost  millions  of  dollars  to

build. The water has to be purified. Pipes have to

be  laid  and again they cost millions of dollars.

Even free water has to be paid for. So I regret to

say  that,  despite some agitation, the  bus  fare

structure  has  been decided and  will  come  into

operation in three weeks' time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for

the  explanation  and  beg leave  to  withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $418,720 for Head 0701 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0703 -



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1171.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, subhead 1171 refers to airport hostesses.

Whenever  I go to Paya Lebar Airport, I listen  to

the Tamil announcements of arrivals and departures

made  by  airport hostesses employed by the  Civil

Aviation Department, and I begin to wonder whether

the  announcements are, in fact, made in the Tamil

language,  as  it  does not sound  Tamil.  Airport

hostesses  proficient in Tamil should be  employed

because  the  airport is a place where  foreigners

arrive    and   when   they   listen   to    these

announcements, they might think that  our  airport

hostesses are not qualified in languages  or  that

our Government is employing incompetent people  to

these posts.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I also

wanted to raise this matter which has already been

raised by the Member for Potong Pasir. We went  to

the   airport  several  times  but  we  could  not

understand   the  announcements   in   the   Tamil

language. They are not properly made and the Tamil-speaking

people at the airport find it  difficult

to understand them. Therefore, the Minister should

instruct  the  Civil  Aviation  Department   that,

before  recruiting any Tamil announcer, applicants

should  be tested in fluency in Tamil. I hope  the

Minister can look into this matter because we have

received several complaints about this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, are you going to speak

in the Tamil language?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have

something  to  add  to what the two  Members  have

mentioned.  Recently,  I found  that  the  airport

hostesses made announcements in only two languages

-  Malay  and English. It seems Tamil and  Chinese

were  omitted. I hope the Minister can  look  into

this matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is that in the plane only Malay

and  English  are used. I feel that it  is  rather

inconvenient  to  the passengers because  some  of

them  may not understand English or Malay. In  the

past, announcements were made not only in the four

official languages but also in the various Chinese

dialects.  But  nowadays this  is  no  longer  the

practice.  I hope the Minister can also look  into

this matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to

notice the great interest taken by Members of this

House   in   our  airport  hostesses   and   their

activities.  I  am afraid I am in no  position  to

judge  whether  the Tamil which is spoken  by  the

Tamil-speaking  airport hostesses  is  correct.  I

accept  the  verdict of the two  Members  on  this

score.  But  may I say that airport hostesses  are

supposed  to have the qualifications of  a  School

Certificate  and they have to pass  a  voice  test

conducted by our Broadcasting Department. At least

three  of them are supposed to be able to converse

in  English,  Malay  and Tamil.  In  view  of  the

criticisms  that  have been levelled  by  the  two

Members, I will have to request the Tamil Division

of  the Broadcasting -Department to interview them

and  see  whether  they are up  to  the  mark,  or

request that in future they should conduct a  very

stringent  voice test so that what they  speak  is

intelligible Tamil and not unintelligible Tamil. I

just  cannot make out whether it is Tamil  or  not

Tamil.  These are the requirements and I can  only

ask   the   parties  that  are  supposed   to   be

responsible  for the test to pay due attention  to

this question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang says that, in his view,

announcements at the airport seem to be made  only

in  English  and  Malay and not in Chinese.  There

again-  I beg to differ. According to our records,

there  are at least eight of the airport hostesses

who  are  supposed  to be conversant  in  Chinese,

English and Malay. It may be that at the time  the

Member  was at the airport, the plane that arrived

was  probably  a B.O.A.C, or a Qantas  plane'  and

therefore the airport hostess used English. But if

it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



were  a  China Airlines aircraft that came in,  it

was  likely that the airport hostess on duty might

have  used Mandarin. I think it would be difficult

to   use   Hokkien,  Cantonese  or  other  Chinese

dialect. One of the official languages is Mandarin

and  I think we will have to stick to that. We  do

what  we  can. I do not think we should use  other

Chinese dialects in our airport.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, perhaps

the Minister can implement the policy of using the

four   official  languages  in  the  airport.   In

recruiting  airport hostesses, the Civil  Aviation

Department  should see to it that they  can  speak

the four official languages fluently. The Minister

has  said that eight of the airport hostesses  can

speak  at least three official languages. If  that

is  the case, they should meet the requirements of

our people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we will try.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Sir, I am satisfied with the reply

given  by  the  Minister.  Before  I  withdraw  my

amendment,  I wish to explain to the Minister  why

the   Tamil  announcements  made  by  the  airport

hostesses do not sound like Tamil. They  may  have

Senior Cambridge and paper qualifications for  the

Tamil  language, but their pronunciation  may  not

sound Tamil. However, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $9,035,280 for Head 0703 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0705 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0705 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

(*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs. P.  Govindaswamy and N. Govindasamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vote is about the expenditure for the

Postmaster-General. In the past our postal service

had a good reputation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



because  it  was  efficient. Mails were  delivered

quite  fast. Normally when a letter was  sent,  it

could  be received the following day. But recently

I  have  received complaints regarding  delays  in

delivery  of letters. I personally also have  this

experience. Sometimes it would take two  or  three

days  before  I received a letter. Even  a  letter

sent  by Parliament was received after three days.

Therefore, this does not speak well for the postal

services.  I  understand that  as  the  population

increases,  the  volume of mails  also  increased.

However, we have to maintain the efficiency of our

postal  services. Maybe we need  to  increase  the

number  of  staff. This can be a  solution.  If  a

letter is delayed too long, especially when it  is

urgent,  it  may cause a great deal of trouble.  I

hope  the  Minister can take steps to remedy  this

abnormal situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point I would like to raise is about

the  wrong  delivery of letters. For  instance,  a

letter  was addressed to "A", but it was delivered

to  "B".  Even  I  myself have had  this  sort  of

experience.  Letters were wrongly delivered.  This

will  also affect people in certain ways,  because

if  a person has not received his letter there may

be  some delay or inconvenience at his end. I hope

in  this  respect the Postmaster-General  and  his

senior  officers  will supervise the  staff  under

them and build up a more efficient postal service.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a very

long  time ago I raised the question of our postal

services, and again I am going to speak about  the

postmen and postal clerks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past the Postal Department of our republic

appeared  to be an efficient department  but  from

recent  complaints in the newspapers about delayed

delivery of mails, this does not appear to be  so.

I  understand  the postmen are heavily  overloaded

and  are under pressure. In spite of the assurance

from  the  Minister  for  Finance  in  his  budget

statement  that  there will be an increase  of  19

postmen  for the current year, I still  feel  that

this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



increase is inadequate, because there has  been  a

significant  increase  in  our  population.   Many

places in our republic have inadequate postmen  to

deliver  the mail. I will be happy if the Minister

accepts  my  suggestion and set up a committee  to

investigate  the  postmen's  grievances.  I   have

raised  this question many times but the  problems

are still the same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also noted that apart from the delivery of

ordinary  letters the postmen are also responsible

for   the  delivery  of  registered  letters   and

parcels. However, at times when the heavily-loaded

parcels  are  too  bulky  to  be  carried  on  the

bicycle,  it  will be appreciated if the  Minister

will  advise the Postal Department to arrange  for

such heavy mails to be delivered by postal vans.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I would like to bring to the

attention  of  the  Minister is  the  insufficient

number of bicycles in our Postal Department. There

seems  to  be no replacement of bicycles  whenever

there  is a break-down. In order to cope with  the

current   shortage  of  bicycles  in  the   Postal

Department, I would suggest that it purchase  more

locally-assembled bicycles instead of buying  them

from foreign countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is the motor-cycle service. This

service  in our postal department is used only  to

make distant deliveries. However, it is my opinion

and  belief that if more motor-cycles are used for

delivery  of mails, there will be less  complaints

from the general public because the mails will  be

delivered faster.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was told that some postmen are not only working

beyond their official duties, but are also pressed

by   their   immediate  superiors.  At  the   last

Parliamentary  sitting I put  a  question  to  the

Minister  regarding this problem. I  had  a  reply

from  the  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for  Communications saying that  no  such  problem

existed.  Therefore I would ask the  Minister  for

Communications to form a committee to  investigate

what is happening in the Postal Department. May  I

know if the Minister will look into and regularise

the conditions of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



service  of  the  postmen. It is known  that  many

postmen  left their jobs because of this. How  did

they leave? They absented themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like the Minister to reply

to is that I notice the post of Chief Inspector of

Postmen  has  been left vacant for  the  past  two

years.  If  the  Minister cannot  get  a  suitable

candidate  for  this post, he can get  whoever  is

suitable from another grade. Why let the  post  be

vacant? The incumbent is acting all the time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I notice in the Estimates that

there  are  increases in Postal Clerical Assistant

appointments  and  a reduction in  the  number  of

Postal    Clerks,   Timescale,   in   the   Postal

Department. I presume all Government offices  will

in   future  reduce  and  eventually  abolish  the

Timescale clerks. That is the reason why they have

increased  the number of Clerical Assistant  posts

now.  I  personally feel that more  Postal  Higher

Clerical Officer posts should be created in  order

to  enhance  the future prospects of the  Clerical

Assistants in the Postal Department. Personally, I

observe  that  the  recruiting of  Postal  Clerks,

Timescale,  is very scarce. I think  the  Minister

should  go through this more carefully. I  do  not

want  to speak again about the postal services  at

the next budget sitting!



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, recently

there  has been much criticism, as the Member  for

Sembawang has pointed out, in the papers  as  well

by  persons  whom  I personally  know,  about  the

slowness of our postal services. There were  cases

where the delivery of local letters took more than

two days. A lapse of two or even more days between

posting and delivery is not uncommon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson, my namesake, talks about

buying more bicycles to make postal deliveries.  I

notice under "Other Charges, Special Expenditure",

the  Ministry  has  asked for more  money  to  buy

bicycles. I am just wondering if the Minister will

consider  buying scooters instead of  bicycles  in

keeping with the times so that there will be  more

expeditious delivery of mails.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, as the Memorandum on the Estimates of

Revenue  and Expenditure of Singapore points  out,

the provision has been increased by 10.3 per cent.

The   amount  asked  for  is  to  fill  98  posts,

comprising  35  Postal  Clerical  Assistants,   49

postmen and 14 supernumerary posts, to accommodate

replacements   of  staff  enlisted  for   national

service. The memorandum goes on to state  that  it

"is expected that with these additional posts, the

accumulated staff shortage in the Postal  Services

will  be  remedied."  The increase  in  the  staff

requested for this year is only in replacement  of

vacant  positions. I wonder if the small  increase

in  staff  requested by the Minister will  improve

our postal services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also told that the turnover of postmen and

other  postal employees has been very high in  the

past two years or so. Is the Department taking any

steps  to  arrest  the turnover  of  postmen,  for

example, through resignations, so that we will not

be  recruiting  new  postmen  all  the  time?  New

postmen  means training, familiarisation with  the

work,  etc.  This  will  not  improve  our  postal

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been announced that the Post Office

Savings Bank will become a corporation soon. As  a

result,  39 officers from the Post Office  Savings

Bank  will  revert to the postal services  proper.

Will  the  Minister confirm that all the employees

who  are  now  engaged in the Post Office  Savings

Bank   work  will  be  absorbed  into  the  postal

services proper when the Post Office Savings  Bank

becomes a corporation? Although the Postal  Clerks

and  the  Junior Postal Clerks are recruited  into

the   Government   service  as  General   Clerical

Officers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



and Clerical Assistants, once, they are posted  to

the  Post Office they virtually remain in the Post

Office  until their retirement or death. If  there

are requests from the clerks in the postal offices

for  transfer  to other departments of  the  civil

service,   will  the  Government  entertain   such

requests? At one time the postal services used  to

be  considered a closed service, but  recently  we

have noticed that senior civil servants from other

departments have been transferred to senior  posts

in  the Postal Department. Can the officers in the

Postal  Department also similarly  be  transferred

out  of the postal services into other departments

if they request such transfers?
