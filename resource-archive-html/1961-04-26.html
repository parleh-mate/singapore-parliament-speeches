<div align="center"><b>DEATH OF MEMBER</b></div>

<br><br><div align="center"><b>Announcement by Mr Speaker</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It was with profound shock and deep

sorrow  that I, and, I am sure, Honourable Members

heard  the  news  of the death of  the  Honourable

Member  for  Anson, Inche Baharuddin  bin  Mohamed

Ariff,   on  Thursday,  20th  April,   1961.   In

accordance  with  the Law, I have duly  acquainted

His  Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara of  the

resultant vacancy in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I desire, on behalf of the House, to record with

regret  an expression of our sense of the loss  we

have  sustained  and  our deep  sympathy  for  the

family of the Member.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>OBITUARY SPEECHES</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):

Mr Speaker, no one can speak of sorrow unless  he

has  felt the anguish of sorrow. No one can  write

of  pain unless he has suffered the pangs of pain.

And  if  those in sorrow and pain ask us  for  the

answer  to the eternal question of life and death,

who  can blame us if we can give no answer? We can

only  give consolation. And if an epitaph were  to

be  written, I can find no better phrase than this

simple verse from the Rubaiyat:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Then said another, "Surely not in vain



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My substance from the common earth was taken



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he who subtly wrought me into shape



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should send me back to common earth again."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we lived in an age of despair, then

little else could be said. But today we live in an

age of faith and hope, faith



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>



in  ourselves  and  hope for  the  future  of  the

Malayan  nation and our country. And  it  is  with

faith  and  hope that the late Member  for  Anson,

Inche Baharuddin, came forward to take part in the

leadership of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sacrificed security in his old position as a

journalist in the Utusan Melayu to face insecurity

as  a  leader of the people. Inche Baharuddin  had

served  the people in the City Council and in  the

Legislative Assembly. He was rare as a leader.  He

was  broadminded  and tolerant in accordance  with

the  tenets of his Islamic faith. He was loyal  to

the  people whom he represented, and on  the  very

evening  of  his death he was with them  in  Anson

listening to their complaints and trying  to  find

an answer to their questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I speak not as a partisan, not because Inche

Baharuddin was a member of the P.A.P., but I speak

in  respect  of  his virtues and  qualities  as  a

leader  among  the people, as a representative  of

the  people who had sat among us in this  Chamber.

There  was so much to hope in a man so young,  and

can  you blame us if we are bitter that that  hope

is knocked out without any warning?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people today have a great need for leaders

who  are  prepared to be self-sacrificing.  If  we

hope  to  build our budding nation, if we hope  to

succeed  in  our  quest for  building  our  united

Malayan  nation,  then it is absolutely  necessary

that   leaders  from  all  communities  must  work

together   to   achieve   this   purpose.    Inche

Baharuddin, young as he was, had the faith that  a

Malayan  nation could be built. He had  the  hope,

although he did not live to see his faith and hope

fulfilled,  that the time will come when  we  will

all  be marching from strength to strength in  our

task of nation-building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you have been in this Chamber for the last six years. You have witnessed stormy

scenes.  You  have  heard words flung  across  the

Floor of this Chamber in anger, in bitterness,  in

acrimony. But, Sir, all anger, all bitterness, all

pain, are finally dissolved in death.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

those whom the gods love die young. And so we lost

a  very  good  friend, Inche Baharuddin,  who  was

taken  away much too young. He had many  years  of

service  before him, and therefore  his  death  is

indeed a loss to all of us and to the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to associate myself with all the

words  of  sorrow expressed by the Leader  of  the

House.  But  I would just like to add  one  little

bit - to  say that the loss which has been  suffered

by  his  family  and  by the  country  is  also  a

personal  loss to me, because he has been  a  very

good and personal friend of mine.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As a mark of respect to the late

Member, I propose to suspend this sitting. I shall

take this Chair again at ten minutes to three.

<div align="center"><b>(Revenue and Expenditure)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Deputy

Prime Minister what was the total expenditure  out

of  Government  funds on the recent  International

Air Show at the Singapore Airport and what was the

total Government revenue derived from the Show.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the final

checking  of  all  bills and  the  calculation  of

revenue  have not yet been completed.  On  present

calculations, it appears that the total Government

expenditure  on  the  Air  Show  will  approximate

$55,000,  and that the total revenue derived  will

approximate  $60,000. Other expenses  of  a  minor

nature  may  have to be met. But it is anticipated

that  the Air Show will have been held with little

or no cost to the Singapore Government.

the   Minister  responsible  say  when  the   full

statement  of accounts can be made known  to  this

Assembly?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I expect the accounts to be

fully  rendered and audited within  a  month,  Mr

Speaker. When they are fully accounted for, if the

Member for Kampong Kembangan wishes to see them, I

will be only too happy to show them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO MALAY CITIZENS OF SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Minister

for  Finance whether the Government has any  plans

for   giving  economic  assistance  to  the  Malay

citizens of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I go

into  the  details of what the Government  is  now

doing   and  what  it  intends  to  do  to  assist

Singapore  Malays, I wish to outline some  of  the

principal features of the economic position of the

Malays in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any plan for economic assistance must be based on

a  correct appraisal of the present situation  and

present  needs.  The  1957 census  gives  us  some

indications. Unfortunately, the census figures  do

not distinguish between Malays and Indonesians  in

the  statistics on occupation. But this is only  a

minor  disadvantage as the broad picture is  clear

enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1957 there were 57,300 Malays and Indonesians

working. There were 3,800 stated to be unemployed.

Of  the  57,300 persons working, a great  majority

worked  as  employees.  The  number  of  employees

amounted to 51,400. These are the people who  work

for  a  wage  or  a salary. There  were  also,  in

addition,  some 5,900 who were self-employed,  and

most  of  these  are fishermen, hawkers  and  such

like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first feature about the economic status of

the  Malays in Singapore is that a great  majority

of  them  are paid employees. In this regard,  the

Malays in Singapore differ fundamentally from  the

Malays in the Federation where a great



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>



majority  are  not employees but are  farmers  and

fishermen - people who work on their own account.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, of the 51,400 employees, no less than

26,900  are employed by the Government,  statutory

corporations,  the City Council  and  the  British

Defence  Departments. Some  11,300  work  for  the

Government  and the City Council, and some  11,800

work  for  the  British Defence Departments.  From

this  fact,  it therefore follows that  employment

opportunities in the public service are matters of

great   importance  to  the  Malay   citizens   in

Singapore. More detailed and up-to-date figures in

respect   of   Central  Government   monthly-rated

employees  are available. On 31st December,  1959,

of  22,966 employees in the Central Government, no

less than 6,908 are Malays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the general standard of living of the

Malay  population, not much by way of a scientific

study  has  been  made,  although  this  does  not

prevent  people from hazarding all kinds of  loose

generalisations.  When I was a  civil  servant,  I

carried out a study of incomes in Singapore  among

the urban working-class population. In 1953/54,  I

conducted an extensive social survey in  the  City

of  Singapore to find out the conditions of  those

families depending on earners whose incomes do not

exceed  $400 per month each. Some 83 per  cent  of

Singapore families living in the city fall  within

this  income  bracket.  Within  the  survey  group

which,  by  and  large,  represents  what  we  may

loosely term the working class, the average income

of  a  Malay family compares well with the others.

Malay  families earn an average of $160 per  month

as  against  $148  of the general average.  Within

this selected group, that is to say, among

working-class  families,  it can be said that  the  notion

that  Malays  are worse off than others  does  not

hold   true.  But  this  proposition   cannot   be

generalised  over the whole strata of society.  If

we  include all persons - rich, the well-to-do,  and

the poor together - we find that the proportion  of

Malays  whose incomes are high enough  to  exclude

them from the survey is a small



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>



one.  Only  6  per  cent of  Malay  families  have

earners  receiving an income of $400  a  month  or

more  as  against the general average  of  17  per

cent.  This means that in the urban Malay  society

the    number   of   middle-class   persons   with

professional occupations is much smaller than  the

general  average of all communities. It is  likely

that  if  the  people  in  the  rural  areas   are

included,  the picture will not be much different.

It  is  against this background that  we  have  to

consider what action can be taken to maintain  and

improve  the  economic welfare of the Malays.  The

first  must  be that employment opportunities  for

Malays  in the Government service and in statutory

authorities  generally should be  maintained,  and

this  is  vital since more than half of the  Malay

population  are depending on their  livelihood  on

this occupation-

Expenditure for 1961 (Paper Cmd. 13 of 1961).  The

summary is at page 6.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an amendment on Head 36, Inland Revenue,

at  page 2, standing in the name of the Member for

Kampong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>



Kembangan   in   relation   to   the   New

sub-head - Temporary Staff. Inche Mohd. Ali.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 36 be

reduced  by  $10  in respect of the  new  sub-head

(Temporary Staff).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in my opinion, the amount of $66,000 allocated for Temporary Staff should not be

limited  to  that  sum alone. What  has  become  a

question  mark to me is why that amount  is  voted

for  Temporary Staff in order to take charge of  a

new  department in the interests of the  State  of

Singapore.  Would  it not be better  if  permanent

staff were recruited, and not initially temporary?

If  permanent staff were recruited,  it  would  be

made  through  the Public Service  Commission  and

then  there would be no doubt in the minds of  the

Opposition   Members.  If,  on  the  other   hand,

temporary staff were to be engaged - I do not  know

whether the Minister concerned could enlighten  us

as  to the reason why - would the temporary staff be

drawn  from  members of the Work Brigade  or  from

such members as were favourably considered by  the

Government?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

underlying  note of the two remarks of the  Member

for Kampong Kembangan is that somebody is going to

do  a fiddle over temporary staff. He thought that

a  far better arrangement would be to get this new

department staffed by permanent officers  so  that

their  appointments could be decided by the Public

Service Commission, thereby giving no room for any

possibility  of  fiddling appointments.  Now,  the

Member is under a misapprehension. It is not  true

that  only  permanent appointments are decided  by

the  Public  Service Commission. Any  appointment,

temporary or otherwise, for a period of two months

or  more  must  be approved by the Public  Service

Commission.   The   Public   Service    Commission

Ordinance is explicit on that score and, in  fact,

this  is  the  practice which  the  Government  is

observing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the Member that the reason why we

are recruiting temporary staff is not that we have

any  intention to fiddle appointments - that is  not

the   way  the  P.A.P.  Government  conducts   its

business - but  there  is a more simple  explanation

and  it  is  this.  The operation  of  registering

businesses will probably begin sometime about  the

middle  of  the  year.  The Bill  introducing  the

Business  Registration Tax will be passed  in  the

Assembly  before  long, but  until  that  Bill  is

passed, no work can start. Therefore, in the first

year  of operation, this new department will  have

about  six  months or less to do  a  whole  year's

work.  It is therefore necessary to engage  people

temporarily  to tide over this rush. That  is  the

reason why we have decided to ask the Assembly for

this  vote to enable us to engage more staff on  a

temporary basis than would be required on a

long-term basis by this department.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  understood the Minister to say that this  staff

would  be required to register businesses in order

to  extract  tax. As I appreciate  the  situation,

there  is  already  an  organisation  whereby  all

persons  carrying on businesses in  Singapore  are

required    to   register   under   the   Business

Registration Ordinance. If that is so,  what  then

is  the need to employ all this temporary staff to

effect that registration, because the registration

should already have been effected?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the present

Business  Registration Ordinance  provides  for  a

once  and for all registration. Once you register,

that  is the end. That department has no more work

to  do  as  far  as relations with that  firm  are

concerned.  But  in this case, it is  a  different

matter.  You have to keep in touch with them  year

by  year.  Every  year, you  have  to  inform  the

Registry that they are in existence and that  they

should  pay  their tax. Therefore, the  volume  of

work will be much larger than the work handled  by

the present Registry of Business Names.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

there  are  thousands of unemployed, I am  sure  a

good  many  would be disappointed  and  frustrated

unless  they  know in advance on  what  basis  the

selection for this temporary staff will  be  made.

Could we be enlightened, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the number

of staff we intend to engage is as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clerks ... 20

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typists ... 8

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Office Boy ... 1



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that that is going to raise much

hope in the thousands and thousands of unemployed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Perhaps, Sir, we are now involved in

the  mechanics  of  tax  collection.  Now,  as   I

understand   it,   there  is  a   Business   Names

Ordinance - this Ordinance has been in  force  since

1940 - under which anyone who carries on a  business

in  Singapore must register. Having registered, he

must  also notify the Registrar of Business  Names

of  the change in partners and that sort of thing.

So  there  is  in  existence now a skeleton  staff

anyway which knows who are the persons carrying on

a  business,  what are the businesses  registered,

and  where they are situated. Having reached  that

point, the next point I take it will be to extract

tax  from these businesses every year. Now,  I  do

not  know what the new Ordinance is going to  say,

Mr Speaker, Sir, but it seems to me that possibly

a  lot of money could be saved if extensive powers

were  given to the Registrar of Business Names  to

collect the tax every year, rather than give it to

some    specially   created   revenue   collecting

department.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, Sir, that is exactly what

we  intend to do. The present Registry will be the

nucleus of this new department. It was formerly in

the  Ministry  of  Labour and  Law,  and  when  we

contemplated  introducing this tax, it  has  since

been removed to my Ministry.

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, to

revert  to  the answer given by the  Minister  for

Finance,  I appreciate the explanation given  that

there  will  be no fiddling with the appointments,

but  what still remains a question mark to  me  is

whether  it is true or otherwise. I know  that  in

the Work Brigade there are members who have passed

the  School Certificate examination with Grade  II

or  Grade III. Will there be the possibility  that

those who are not members of the Work Brigade  but

who  have  higher qualifications can  be  absorbed

into  this temporary staff? I would like  to  know

what are the qualifications required of applicants

for   these   temporary  staff  posts.   Are   the

qualifications required on the same basis as  that

who are unemployed now?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I think the doubt in the mind of

the  Member  for Kampong Kembangan arises  from  a

statement made by the Minister for Labour and  Law

some  time ago to this Assembly, when he said that

instructions had been given by his Ministry  that,

in  so far as the filling of any future Government

appointments  was  concerned,  the  first   choice

should be given to members of the Work Brigade.  I

believe that is what is at the back of the mind of

the Member for Kampong Kembangan.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Let me dispose of the

statement about recruitment from the Work Brigade.

The present position is that for certain types  of

jobs  in  the Government service - they are jobs  in

the    daily-rated    services,    Division     IV

appointments,    which    are    not     promotion

posts - recruitment for these appointments are  made

from  members  of the Work Brigade. We  have  also

come  to  an  arrangement with  several  statutory

authorities,   including  the  Singapore   Harbour

Board,  whereby they will recruit  from  the  Work

Brigade  for  similar  posts.  We  have  also  had

requests for assistance in recruiting workers from

firms,  manufacturers  and others  who  want  good

workers. We have made use of Work Brigade members,

suitably qualified and trained, for recommendation

to such posts. Now the temporary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>



posts  relevant to this exercise are not the posts

for  which we make special arrangements to  select

from  the Work Brigade. Clerical officers  are  in

Division III. Typists are in Division IV. They are

regarded as promotion posts for more junior staff.

We  may  recruit the office boy, but that is  only

one.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the qualifications for temporary

staff, the qualifications laid down will not  have

any  relation to how the unemployed are qualified,

but   they  must  be  related  to  the  work   and

responsibilities  which  these  people   have   to

perform. For instance, for clerical officers,  the

minimum  educational  qualification  will  be  the

Senior   Cambridge  or  the  equivalent   academic

standard. For typists, it will be somewhat  lower,

and  for  the office boy, it will be still  lower.

The  qualifications laid down will be the same  in

comparable jobs in the Government service.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have   another   question  to   ask.   Will   this

opportunity   be  only  limited  to  citizens   of

Singapore  in  view  of the  fact  that  they  are

temporary  posts? Or will it be open  to  all  and

sundry?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The posts in Divisions III and

IV will be limited to Singapore citizens.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I think a further point arises in the

selection of Divisions III and IV posts.  In  view

of  the  circular  that has  been  issued  by  the

Minister for Labour and Law, is it going to be  an

advantage  to be a member of the Work  Brigade  in

order to get an appointment in this department  if

the   posts  are  in  Divisions  III  and  IV?   I

understand that Division III is outside  it.  What

this  House  wants  to know is  this.  Insofar  as

Division IV appointments are concerned, covered by

this temporary staff, would it be an advantage  to

be  a  member  of  the  Work  Brigade?  Or  is  it

compulsory that he should be a member of the  Work

Brigade? Or is it open to all?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> So far, as the office boy is

concerned,  he  will be recruited  from  the  Work

Brigade.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There are four notices of

amendments standing in the name of the Member  for

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 47 be

reduced  by  $10  in  respect  of  the  new   item

(Assistant Head).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to receive

clarification  from the Minister  for  Culture  on

more or less the same question as I have asked the

Minister   for   Finance.  Will  the   prospective

Assistant  Head  carry  out the  policies  already

formulated by the Head of the Department  who  has

been   made   available  to  us  from   Indonesia?

According to my interpretation, the appointment of

an Assistant Head will mean that the Ministry will

be  short of staff, and that it will only begin to

operate.  If the contrary is the case - plans  might

have  been  formulated but there is no staff - could

the   Minister  for  Culture  explain  to  me  the

position?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  am not quite  clear  about  the

question.  I  gather the question is  whether  the

Assistant  Head would carry out the policies  laid

down  by the present Head of the Dewan. Of course,

the  Assistant Head's function would be to  assist

the  Head  in  administering the  Dewan.  To  that

extent,  he  would  have to carry  out  the  broad

policies  laid down by the Head of the Dewan  who,

in  turn, discusses with the Minister the  general

policy of the Dewan.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like further enlightenment from the Minister

for Culture. The staff is for the Dewan Bahasa dan

Kebudayaan Kebangsaan. Will the Assistant Head  be

a  Malay? If that is so, will he be selected  from

among persons with diplomas, such as a B.A. from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>



the  University of Malaya? Or will the  Government

engage  au Assistant Head from among persons  with

qualifications  and experience  and  who  are  now

employed in the Malay section of Radio Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Government

does  not make appointments in terms of whether  a

person  is  a  Malay, a Chinese or an  Indian.  We

advertise  in  terms  of  particular  skills   and

abilities required for a post, and the person most

suited  would naturally be selected by the  Public

Service  Commission. In this case, this  post  has

already   been  advertised - I  think  it   was   on

Monday - and   the  qualifications  and   experience

necessary  are an Honours degree of  a  recognised

University  plus experience in writing  and

post-graduate  research, preferably academic  research,

in    an    institution   of   higher    learning,

administrative ability and leadership. So it  will

be  left  to the P.S.C. to decide from  among  the

applicants the person who would be most suited  to

fill the post.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, I

am  aware of the explanation given by the Minister

for   Culture.   As   he  is  from   a   Socialist

Party - subject  to correction - it may  be  that  the

P.A.P. is  always  right  in  implementing   its

policies.  But  could  the P.S.C. engage  only  a

Malay? It is not our responsibility but it is  the

responsibility of the P.S.C. But if the Government

could  so direct, I believe the opportunity  could

be  given  to the Malays because only one  man  is

required.  The responsibilities of this  post,  to

carry  out  the  functions and operations  of  the

Dewan Bahasa dan Kebudayaan Kebangsaan, are great.

If,  however, the Assistant Head is a  non-Malay - I

am  not suggesting the Government policy cannot be

implemented  - I  think  it  is  proper  that   the

Government should look to the Federation. I am not

going  to  teach the Government, but the staff  of

the  Dewan Bahasa should comprise more Malays  who

will  be  the pioneers to implement the Government

policy. This is my opinion, Mr Speaker.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the functions

of  the  Dewan  are well known to Members  of  the

Assembly.  There  are  two functions.  One  is  to

foster  the development and the popularisation  of

the  national  language, which is Malay;  and  the

second is to undertake research in connection with

the   primary  aim  of  integrating  the   various

cultures  and  of spreading a knowledge  of  those

cultures. So it is inevitable that whoever is  the

Head of the Dewan shoud be one who is most capable

of  discharging these functions. It will therefore

depend  on who can best discharge those functions.

He  may be a Malay or anybody else, so long as  we

choose  the  right person who can discharge  these

two  essential functions - one, to spread  knowledge

of  the national language (Malay), and to help  in

the  research and development of the language; and

two,   to   carry  out  sociological   duties   in

connection with cultural work. The staff has  been

chosen  with the view that, apart from  the  Malay

language, the other three languages and  the  four

cultures  are involved. It is impossible  to  find

one  man who can carry out this work and therefore

the staff must be balanced in such a way that they

can complement one another's work.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in any

case  that  is the Government's responsibility.  I

have duly conveyed my views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point, Mr Speaker. Can I be informed

whether  administrative  correspondence  in   this

Dewan  will be in Malay, the national language?  I

ask because I know that the status of the national

language  has  not yet been made official,  and  I

would  like to know whether the national  language

will  be used in the daily administration  of  the

Dewan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, the use of the

national language in this Dewan will depend on the

extent  to which use would be made of the national

language  in  the whole administration.  But  here

again,  in view of the present transitional  phase

of   our   development,  it  would  obviously   be

impractical to send, say, a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>



letter in Malay to a Chinese cultural organisation

which might have individuals who do not understand

the   national  language.  So  the  use   of   the

particular  language  will  depend  on   to   whom

correspondence is being sent. It is no use sending

a  letter  in English to somebody who  knows  only

Malay, and it is no use sending a letter in  Malay

to  somebody who knows only Chinese. It  is  hoped

that  as we go on and as the national language  is

extensively  used  throughout the  administration,

the Dewan too will make better use of the national

language.

Officers?

addition, research officers may be called upon  to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 47 be

reduced  by  $10  in respect of the  new  sub-head

(Promotion of Art and Culture).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the subject of culture has been discussed at previous sittings of the Assembly. We

are  in  the  dark as to which culture  we  should

adopt -  whether  it  is  Government  culture,   or

culture   as   understood  by   Members   of   the

Opposition.  In  short, there  may  be  one,  two,

three,  or four cultures. I hope the Minister  for

Culture  will  explain to us what is  culture,  so

that we could consider his views and remarks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am delighted

at the capacity for punishment that Members of the

Opposition  show  in not only  being  prepared  to

listen  to a lecture on culture, but also inviting

the Minister for Culture at this late juncture  to

deliver  a  long  lecture on culture  which  I  am

always prepared to do. In view of the fact that we

are  going  to  spend  a large  sum  of  money  in

establishing   a   Dewan  Bahasa  dan   Kebudayaan

Kebangsaan,   I  hope  the  Member   for   Kampong

Kembangan  will be able to satisfy  his  curiosity

about culture in general by not only attending the

lectures and activities which are organised by the

Dewan   but   also  by  perusing   the   excellent

publications  which  will  be  produced   by   the

Research  Officers of whose functions he  was  not

quite well aware.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Opposition is not

curious.  The Opposition wants to know, on  behalf

of  the  people of Singapore, why it is  that  the

Government  wants $2,500 on the Promotion  of  Art

and  Culture when it has already put in the Budget

quite  a  large sum for culture itself.  We  would

like to hear from the Minister the kind of culture

that  the P.A.P. is introducing in Singapore,  and

we  have the patience to hear him if only he  will

tell us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, as the vote stands, it comes from

"Other Charges - Annually Recurrent" which continues

on to the next page: Promotion of Art and Culture,

$2,500.  If  I  am  reading  this  correctly,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, the suggestion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>



is that this Promotion of Art and Culture ($2,500)

is  an  annually recurrent expenditure.  We  would

like  to know what he is going to, spend the money

on annually.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I was only answering the question

by  the  Member for Kampong Kembangan. If  he  had

asked  me in the way that the Member for Cairnhill

did,  I  would have explained what the $2,500  was

going to be used for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that we have a Culture vote, but in

this  particular case the item "Promotion  of  Art

and Culture" is in connection with a specific type

of activity that the Dewan would undertake, things

like   organising  congresses,  meetings,  special

meetings,  lectures by well-known  authorities  on

some  particular aspect of art or culture. So this

amount would be used to finance a special type  of

cultural  activity which is not undertaken  by  my

Ministry under the vote "Cultural matters".

to Question No. 2*.



<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*See col. 1406.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was giving

an  explanation of the ways in which the Malays of

Singapore earn their livelihood. I said it  should

be  against  this background that  the  Government

should  consider what action could  be  taken  to

improve  their  economic welfare. I ended,  before

the  interruption, with the remark that the  first

thing  to  do  is  to  make sure  that  there  are

sufficient  opportunities for  the  employment  of

Malays   in   the  public  service  and  statutory

authorities, because such a large number  of  them

depend on these sources for a living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second conclusion from my analysis is that we

should  make  every  effort to  expand  the  Malay

professional class which today is so small.  There

is  also  a  third objective which did not  emerge

from the analysis of occupations which I had given

previously. It is this. We have large  numbers  of

Malays  still  engaged  in fishing.  A  number  of

fishing villages along the coasts of Singapore and

in  the Southern Islands are in a depressed  state

because  of  the dependence of so many  people  in

them  on this precarious source of livelihood.  We

shall, therefore, have to take special measures in

regard to this group of Malays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to the policy of the Government in

regard  to  the  economic  welfare  of  the  Malay

citizens  of the State. To achieve the  second  of

the   objectives  which  I  have  outlined  above.

Namely,  the  expansion of the Malay  professional

class,  it  is  necessary that every  Malay  child

should be given education up to the highest  level

possible.  To this end, Members will already  know

that it is the policy and practice of the P.A.P. Government to give free education to  Malay

children  in  Singapore from primary school  level

right  up to the University. They do not  have  to

pay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>



school  fees either in primary  or  secondary

schools.  In the University of Malaya and  in  the

Polytechnic,   special   bursaries    have    been

established for which only Malays can compete.  At

present, we can say that a Malay student  who  has

the  qualification to enter either the Polytechnic

or the University of Malaya will receive a bursary

to enable him to get his higher qualification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards employment in Government service, the

largest  number of posts are, as everybody  knows,

in  Division  IV  and  the  daily-rated  services.

Recruitment  into  these  grades  is  confined  to

members  of the Work Brigade. In recruitment  into

the  Work  Brigade, and hence ultimately into  the

Government  service  as well as  the  services  of

various  public authorities, they have  agreed  to

accept  Government's policy in  this  respect.  In

recruitment   into   the  Work  Brigade,   special

attention is paid to the recruitment of sufficient

numbers  of  Malays.  The Brigade  now  stands  at

1,778.  Of this number, no less than 637, or  more

than one-third, are Malays. The ratio of Malays to

non-Malays in the Work Brigade is higher than that

in   the  Government  establishments  or  in   the

establishments  of  statutory  authorities.   This

means that opportunities open to Malays of

working-class origin for work in public authorities and in

the Government service will be maintained and even

expanded in the years to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the strengthening of the professional

or  technical classes, the relevant policy here is

that in regard to higher appointments to the Civil

Service, it is the policy of the P.A.P. Government

to maximise the opportunities for the promotion of

suitable Malay officers to the highest grades  for

which  they are fitted. Members will have read  in

this  morning's  papers that four  Malay  officers

have been promoted to the Singapore Administrative

Service.  In  the past two years many Malays,  who

started their careers in the Government service as

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the special problem of distressed

occupations  such as fishing. My Ministry  is  not

directly  concerned in these matters. But speaking

from the general angle of economic development,  I

would say that the solution to the problem lies in

two  directions.  The first  is  to  induce  these

persons  to  work in better paid and  more  secure

occupations. This change can be left to the normal

operations of the free market. The second solution

is for those who remain is this depressed industry

to increase their earning power by improving their

production   methods   and  know-how.   What   the

Government  is  doing  through  the  Ministry   of

National Development in this matter can be briefly

stated as follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fishing schools are being established to teach

Malay  youths who want to be fishermen the  latest

technique  in fishing. A school has recently  been

opened at Pasir Panjang, and more schools will  be

established in other parts of the island. Next, to

improve the catch of Malay fishermen, the Ministry

of  National  Development intends  to  purchase  a

number  of  diesel outboard motors  which  can  be

rented  to Malay fishermen at reasonable  charges.

This  scheme  has been approved by the Development

Planning Committee recently, and some five  diesel

outboard engines will be purchased soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One great need of villagers who are depending on

fishing  for  their income is to  diversify  their

sources  of incomes. For this purpose, a plan  has

been   approved   by   the  Development   Planning

Committee  to  introduce goats  in  Malay  fishing

villages. These goats will be purchased  from  the

Federation of Malaya and its introduction  in  the

fishing  villages  will  help  to  strengthen  the

economy of these people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point I have not dealt with, and that is

Malay participation in trade and industry. I  have

held  discussions with the Trade Advisory  Council

on  how  a special effort can be made to get  more

Malays  into  trade and industry. So far  we  have

only  discussed  ways and means  whereby  the  big

commercial and banking firms can engage Malays  on

their staff



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>



and  train  them for more responsible  posts.  The

firms  I  approached told me that their difficulty

is  to  get sufficient numbers of qualified Malays

to  take  up jobs in their businesses. Because  of

the  comparatively small numbers of Malay students

passing  out  with School Certificates,  the  more

promising of these would have little difficulty in

getting  good and more secure jobs elsewhere.  But

in  an  entrepot economy such as ours,  there  are

limits  to Government control and direction  over

business.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the

reply  is  very  lengthy. One  fact  emerges,  Mr

Speaker.  I  would like to know from the  Minister

for  Finance about the promotion of the four Malay

officers which was announced in the papers. Is  it

based  on  merit, or is it based  on  the  special

Malay rights?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is based

on both.

<div align="center"><b>SEAMEN'S REGISTRY BOARD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Numbers Registered and Employed)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Minister

for  Labour and Law to state the total  number  of

seamen  who  have  registered  with  the  Seamen's

Registry Board for employment from the date of its

establishment to 31st March, 1961, and  the  total

number of such seamen for whom the Board has found

employment during the same period.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. M. Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the total

number  of  seamen registered by the Board  up  to

31st  March,  1961,  is  7,435.  During  the  same

period,  455  have been removed from the  Seamen's

Register  by reasons of death, over-age  or  other

causes, leaving a total of 6,980 active seamen  on

the Register as at 31st March, 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the same period 11,123 vacancies have been

filled by the Board. The total number of vacancies

filled   far  exceeds  the  number  of  registered

seamen, because some seamen may serve for a number

of  short  periods  during the year,  particularly

those serving in the home and local trade. It  is,

therefore, possible



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>



for  seamen to obtain employment through the Board

two or three times or even more during one year.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, could

the  Minister  for  Labour and  Law  enlighten  me

whether   the  Seamen's  Registry  Board  register

merely seamen who are citizens of Singapore or  is

registration open to all?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all those who have

been  to sea become registered seamen. In addition

to that, Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a waiting list

which is kept. This waiting list is related to the

number  of  jobs that are available, so that  when

there  are  opportunities of increased employment,

additions are made to this waiting list. The whole

object  of  the  exercise is to  strike  a  proper

balance  between  the demand for  seamen  and  the

number which is available for employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to point out

to  the Assembly that we have sounded the opinions

of  employers of seamen in Singapore, and we  have

been  informed  that, in addition to  the  figures

that   I   have   given  just   now,   there   are

approximately 8,000 of our seamen who are  serving

on  ships  throughout the world and  who  are  not

registered in our Registry.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the

reason for my asking the question is that I  would

like  to  emphasize  that there  are  citizens  of

Singapore  working in Indonesian  boats  who  have

been   dismissed  by  the  Indonesian  authorities

because they are Singapore citizens. It is  proper

that this Board should assist our own citizens and

that   only   citizens  of  Singapore  should   be

registered.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That does not sound like a question

to me but would the Minister like to treat it as a

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir. There are lots

of ships that operate from Singapore which are not

registered  in  Singapore. There are  ships  which

habitually sail from Singapore which are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>



either  of  Panamanian registry or  of  Indonesian

registry. Many Chinese ship-owners register  their

ships  under the registry facilities of Indonesia.

Now,  it  works both ways. These ships  which  are

registered    in   Indonesia   employ   Indonesian

nationals as well as Singapore citizens,  and  we,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  make no  distinction  between

seamen  who  are  Indonesians and seamen  who  are

citizens  of  Singapore. In fact, there  are  many

seamen  from  Indonesia  who  are  our  registered

seamen and who have been working as seamen through

Singapore.  So  if we were to start discriminating

in  this  way, Mr Speaker, Sir, by  making  it  a

condition that only citizens of Singapore  are  to

be  employed  as  sailors on Singapore  registered

ships,  then  it  would be  an  inducement  and  a

temptation  to  ships  which  are  registered   in

Indonesia to dispense with our crews. And it would

be  to  the disadvantage of Singapore if  we  ever

operated it on that basis.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in

future,  will the Government make it a  policy  to

give priority to citizens of Singapore because the

Seamen's  Registry Board is established on  public

funds?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have a

practically complete registry now, and  there  are

opportunities of further employment open to people

who  take  to the sea for the first time.  And  it

will  be our duty in that case to restrict further

opportunities  of  employment  as  seamen  to  our

citizens. That is being actively done now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Chan Sun Wing) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the motion standing in

the name of the Prime Minister, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, in accordance with section 4

of   the   Foreshores  Ordinance  (Chapter   246),

approves  the  reclamation by Government  of  that

portion of the foreshore and seabed containing  an

area   of   approximately  132,925   square   feet

adjoining Lots 569-1, 423-3, 421-1, 421-2  and  552,

Mukim  XXV,  being land at Tanjong  Rhu  Road,  as

delineated  on  plans which are deposited  at  the

Land Office, Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion is the result of an application by

Messrs. Standard-Vacuum Oil Company for permission

to  reclaim  part  of  the foreshore  and  sea-bed

adjacent  to the oil storage terminal  at  Tanjong

Rhu.  The Company propose to use the land  or  the

storage  and  distribution of  petroleum  and  for

purposes connected therewith.

The object of this motion is to give the requisite

authority. The Company will act as agents for  the

Government in making the reclamation and the usual

indemnity  by  deed  will  be  taken.   When   the

reclamation  is  complete, the  land  will  become

State  land  and  a lease will be  issued  to  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh (Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry for Home Affair) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry for Home Affair (Dr Lee Siew Choh):</b> Sir, I beg to

move, " That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offences relating to the Vehicles Ordinance,

1960,  which came into operation on 15th February,

1960,  expired  on  the 14th  February,  1961,  as

Members  are aware, the purpose of this  Ordinance

was  to  enhance  the  punishment  in  respect  of

offences  concerning  thefts  of  motor  vehicles,

bicycles  and parts thereof, and was to act  as  a

deterrent  in  a situation where such  thefts  and

dishonest  retention or disposal of such  property

were  rampant.  It  was also  provided  that  this

Ordinance could be extended by the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara from time to time as he thought fit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government considers that under present

circumstances it would be more desirable  for  the

Ordinance  to be given a more definite  period  of

life.  During  the period of one  year  since  the

operation  of  this Ordinance, 564 motor  vehicles

and  2,400  bicycles  in 1959, it  would  appear,

therefore,  that  from  the  figures  quoted,  the

Ordinance does not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>



have   as   yet  the  right  impact  on  criminals

committing this type of offence. But against  this

it  is considered that the period of one year  was

too  short for the effectiveness of this Ordinance

to  be felt. It must be remembered also that  time

is  required to bring about a definite  change  in

the  abnormal circumstances which necessitated the

enactment  of  the Ordinance. The  fact  that  the

number  of bicycle thefts has increased should  be

weighed  against the fact that there  is  a  large

increase  in  the number of bicycles in  Singapore

and  that,  on the ether hand, there  has  been  a

small drop in thefts of motor vehicles despite the

fact  that the number of motor vehicles  has  also

increased in Singapore. Even if the crime  figures

in  respect  of  thefts of vehicles remain  static

during  the currency of this Ordinance,  that  in

itself is a good indication that the Ordinance has

achieved  something good in preventing  the  theft

figures   from  rising  appreciably.   The   fact,

therefore,  that  this  Ordinance  would   be   in

operation for another four years should act  as  a

deterrent   on   the  nefarious  inclinations   of

criminals towards this type of offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for the purposes of continuity, this

Amendment Bill has been given retrospective effect

from   the   date  of  expiry  of  the   principal

Ordinance. But until this Bill becomes law, thefts

of  motor  vehicles and bicycles are  being  dealt

with under the Penal Code. It is hoped that during

this  further  four-year period  this  legislation

will  have  a salutary effect until the  situation

becomes more normal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, a question of principle is

involved in the manner in which the Government  is

seeking to bring about this legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinance No. 9 of 1960 was an Ordinance which

was  passed  in  this Assembly and  it  came  into

operation on 15th February, 1960. Section 1 (2) of

the Ordinance reads:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This Ordinance shall continue in operation for a

period of one year from the date of commencement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that the Yang di-Pertuan Negara may by

notification  in  the Gazette extend  such  period

from time to time as he shall think fit.'



<br><br>As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for

Home  Affairs has not indicated that the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara has acted under the proviso to  the

section,  I  am taking it that this Ordinance  has

now lapsed. If this Ordinance has now lapsed, then

I  am suggesting to the Government that this is a

highly  improper way of extending the life of  the

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the amendment to amend section 1 (2), it is

sought  to  delete the word "one" and  substitute

therefor  the  word  "five",  thereby  giving   it

continuity  with  retrospective effect.  To  begin

with,   Mr   Speaker,   Sir,   this   is   highly

undesirable, particularly in a criminal  Ordinance

which   affects  the  rights  and   liberties   of

subjects.  If  this amending Bill is  passed  into

law, then the position in law is that what are not

offences   today   become   offences   merely   by

retrospective effect. That is a principle which no

self-respecting Legislature can accede to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary says that the Government is not going to make use of this

Ordinance  in respect of offences that  have  been

committed  since 15th February, 1960,  until  such

time  as  this Bill, if it becomes law, is brought

into operation. With respect to the Government,  I

suggest  that  the proper way to  do  it,  as  the

previous  Ordinance has now lapsed,  would  be  to

bring in an entirely new Ordinance which would not

have - on the statute book anyway - provisions  which

would  enable the Government to take retrospective

action  in  respect of criminal  offences.  It  is

highly  undesirable. As there is  the  Penal  Code

under  which the offence of theft can be punished,

and  as  the laws of the country provide for  the

dealing  of  these  offences,  I  suggest  to  the

Government that they should withdraw this Bill and

reintroduce it in another form.

longer  on  the  statute book. If it  has  lapsed,

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill seeks to repeal Part III of the

Education Ordinance, 1957, and section 16  of  the

Planning    Ordinance,   1959,    which    provide

respectively for the levy of an Education Rate and

an  Improvement  Rate  on  the  annual  values  of

properties by the local authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the integration of the City Council

with the Government, the Education and Improvement

Rates  have been incorporated in the Property  Tax

levied under the Property Tax Ordinance, 1960.  It

is  the intention of the Government to abolish the

Education and Improvement Rates once the  Property

Tax  Ordinance,  1960,  is  fully  operative.  The

Property  Tax Ordinance, 1960, came into force  on

1st  January,  1961, and it is  now  necessary  to

repeal  the  relevant sections  of  the  Education

Ordinance, 1957, and the Planning Ordinance, 1959,

under which the local rates are levied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.- [Mr Low Por Tuck].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

<div align="center"><b>POST OFFICE SAVINGS BANK (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg  to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Post Office Savings Bank Ordinance was drawn

up  and  passed  at  a  time  when  Singapore  was

completely under colonial domination. Although the

Ordinance  was  meant to encourage the  people  to

save,  as  far  as  the use  of  the  savings  was

concerned, we had no say in the matter.  In  fact,

the  Ordinance  was so drawn up that  our  savings

would  benefit the people of Britain and  not  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (1) of section 11 of the Ordinance

stated that the money in the savings bank could be

to  a  small  extent  used to  invest  in  Malayan

Government  securities. To be exact, we  were  not

allowed to invest more than one-third of the money

in   the   Post  Office  Savings  Bank  in   local

securities. The rest of the money was to  be  kept

invested  outside  Malaya,  which  usually   meant

Britain.  This meant that only a small  proportion

of  the  money in the savings bank, which  is  the

money of our people, could be used for the benefit

of  the  people of Singapore. In 1947 we tried  to

ask  the British Government to allow us to  invest

at  least half of the money in the savings bank in

local  securities.  But  we  were  told  that  the

British  Government  would not  agree  to  such  a

proposal. The Federation of Malaya Government also

tried  at that time to do the same thing  but  was

unsuccessful.  But later in 1953,  the  Federation

Government  did succeed not merely in  using  half

the  money  but even all the money in the  Savings

Bank  to invest in their own securities. In  other

words,  they  removed the condition  in  the  Post

Office  Savings Bank Ordinance which  limited  the

amount



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>



of  money  of  the Post Office Savings  Bank  that

could be used to buy local securities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we in Singapore do not have

independence,  we  do have a measure  of  internal

self-government  and we must make  sure  that  the

savings  and money of the people of Singapore  are

used  for the benefit and well-being of the people

themselves. We cannot allow our money to  be  used

for the people of other countries when we need the

money so badly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last Assembly sitting, we presented and

passed  the motion about our Four-Year Development

Plan.  We  were told that as far as possible  this

Plan must be financed from our own money. Thus  we

need  every  cent  that  is  saved  for  our   own

Development Plan. For these reasons, we think that

it  is  about time that this section in  the  Post

Office  Savings Bank Ordinance, which prevents  us

from  using  the  money in the Bank  for  our  own

purposes, should be removed and that we should  be

allowed  to use the money in the Savings  Bank  in

the  way  that we think is best. The  Post  Office

Savings Bank (Amendment) Bill seeks to remove this

condition in the original Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must emphasise that this does not mean that the

Government will now use the money in any way  such

that  people who put the money in the Post  Office

Savings  Bank will stand to lose it.  We  have  an

honest  Government  and this money  will  be  used

honestly  and to the best purpose. Again,  I  must

emphasise   that  it  does  not  mean   that   the

Government will just take the money and use it for

its own purpose. If the Government needs the money

for  the Development Plan, it will borrow from the

Post  Office Savings Bank by selling to  the  Post

Office  Savings  Bank  bonds or  other  Government

securities  and the Government would pay  interest

on  these  bonds.  Thus,  when  we  say  that  the

Government  can use the money, we  mean  that  the

Government can borrow the money and use it and not

that  the  Government can take and use  it  as  it

likes.  This right to borrow freely from the  Post

Office  Savings Bank was formerly  denied  to  us.

When this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>



Bill  is passed, we will have the right to  borrow

any  proportion  of the money in the  Post  Office

Savings Bank.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while welcoming the

Parliamentary   Secretary's   statement   on   the

eventual use of these monies invested by the small

people of Singapore, and his statement that  these

monies  will not be used by the Government without

providing them with an adequate return, he has not

told  the  House  whether these monies  which  the

Government  will  use will  be  at  the  rates  of

interest which the Government would have to pay in

the  money  market.  Could the  Minister  tell  us

whether  the  rates which the depositors  will  be

paid  will  be  the  same as  those  paid  to  the

investors on the money market?



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, what used to

be  adequate as a rate of interest before the  War

is  no longer adequate these days. In view of  the

high  rate  of  interest which the  Government  is

going  to  give  when it borrows  money  from  the

Savings  Bank  fund, could it  not  consider  the

question  of  paying  a  more  enhanced  rate   of

interest  to  those  who save money  in  the  Post

Office Savings Bank?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the rate of

interest will be paid according to what Government

is paying on other securities or bonds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Dr Lee Siew Choh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill introduces a number of necessary and

desirable  amendments to the present Police  Force

Ordinance.  In  the first place, our  re-dedicated

and  reorientated Polis Negara Singapura now  goes

down in the statute book by that name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill introduces a new Part VIIIA to the

principal  Ordinance which places  the  Guard  and

Escort Unit which, as Members are aware, has  been

in  existence since 1st January, 1959, on a proper

status, defines their duties and makes them police

officers for purposes of the Pensions Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another provision of importance is a new Part

VIIIB which provides for the creation of Auxiliary

Police  Forces  within the State. These  Auxiliary

Police  Forces will take the place of small Police

Forces,  like the Singapore Harbour Board  Police,

the  Shell Company Pulau Bukom Security Police and

the  Singapore Airport Police, as it is considered

that  it  would be better to have all  the  Police

Forces  in Singapore under the unified command  of

the  Commissioner  of Police,  by  virtue  of  the

Police  Force Ordinance, than to have small Police

Forces  operating under the authority of  separate

Ordinances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new Part VIIIB makes the personnel of such

separate  Police Forces Auxiliary Police  Officers

subject  to  the authority of the Commissioner  of

Police  for  the  maintenance of  law  and  order,

preservation  of public peace and  the  prevention

and detection of crime, but provides that the pay,

pensions, conditions of service of every Auxiliary

Police Officer and his day-to-day duties shall  be

entirely within the jurisdiction of the Government

if he is employed by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>



Government, or of the Company, Statutory  Body  or

any   other  organisations  employing  him.  These

Auxiliary  Police Forces will operate  within  the

area  under  the jurisdiction and control  of  the

employing  authority  and  the  Auxiliary   Police

Officers  will  have  similar  status  to  regular

Police Officers within their own areas and to such

extent  outside the limits of such  areas  as  the

Commissioner  may  decide.  Like  regular   Police

Officers, they also cannot join trade unions,  but

could  have their own Police associations to  make

representations on their behalf. The  Minister  is

also empowered to make regulations to provide  for

schemes  of training, appointments and promotions,

discipline  and punishment, uniform and equipment,

arms   and   ammunitions  to  be  carried.   These

regulations will naturally be made in consultation

with  the Commissioner of Police and the employing

authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this Bill, provision is also made in clause

13  for  the  employment of  police  officers  for

private  purposes,  such as  guarding  persons  or

property  or  for any other reasons acceptable  to

the  Commissioner of Police, as it  is  considered

more  appropriate that provision for the  hire  of

police  personnel should be made in the  Ordinance

itself and not in Police General Orders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the, Bill introduces an amendment to

section  20 of the Ordinance to provide  that  the

Commissioner   of   Police   could   discharge   a

Probationary  Inspector or  Cadet  Inspector  only

with the consent of the Minister. The discharge of

such an Inspector is excluded from the purview  of

the Public Service Commission under the provisions

of  section 82 (2) of the Singapore (Constitution)

Order  in Council. This clause also introduces  an

amendment  which regularises the eligibility  with

regard to the payment of gratuities in respect  of

subordinate officers discharged with less than  10

years' service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides by virtue of clause 4 that

there  shall  be no exception to the provision  in

the Ordinance which prohibits police officers from

being  members  of trade unions or  of  bodies  or

associations with political objects.  Formerly  it

was provided in the principal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance that where a police officer was a member

of  a trade union before joining the Police Force,

he may, with the consent of the Minister, continue

to be a member of that trade union during the time

of  his service in the Police Force. However,  the

provision  in  the principal Ordinance  permitting

the  establishment  of associations  operated  and

administered in accordance with Police Regulations

for  the  purpose of enabling police  officers  to

consider  and  bring to the notice  of  Government

matters  affecting  their welfare  and  efficiency

remains unchanged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 makes certain amendments to section 27

of   the   principal  Ordinance  with  regard   to

punishment  of  subordinate police  officers  and,

inter  alia,  provides  that  the  police  officer

authorised  by  a  Commanding Officer  to  conduct

disciplinary   proceedings   may   impose   on   a

subordinate  officer any of the punishments  which

the Commanding Officer may impose, except that  of

dismissal or retirement from the Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill provides that a member of

the   Special  Constabulary  (or  Special   Police

Officer)  may be prosecuted in court  for  certain

specified disciplinary offences as in the case  of

a regular Inspector and subordinate officer of the

Police  Force. This clause arose out  of  a  court

case  in  which  it  was held that  there  was  no

provision  for  members of the  Volunteer  Special

Constabulary  to be prosecuted in court  for  such

offences, and this clause now removes any doubt in

the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also makes another provision with

regard  to the Special Constabulary in that clause

11  provides that the Commissioner of Police shall

not,  without  the  permission  of  the  Minister,

accept as a member of the Special Constabulary any

person who is not a citizen of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 introduces a new form of oath or

affirmation  for persons appointed to the  Special

Constabulary  or  to any Auxiliary  Police  Force.

Clause  15  repeals  the provision  of  the  Ports

Ordinance which relates to the Port Police  Force,

as  it is now proposed by virtue of this Bill that

the  Auxiliary  Police  Force  shall  perform  the

functions of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>



present Port Police Force. Lastly, the opportunity

has  been taken in the other clauses not mentioned

above   to   make   a  number  of   phraseological

amendments to the principal Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in

general,  I fully support this Bill to  amend  the

Police  Force  Ordinance. But  there  are  a, few

things   which   should  be   explained   by   the

Parliamentary Secretary. In view of the fact  that

we  are a self-governing State and in view of  the

fact  that  not long after this Bill is passed  it

will  be named the Polis Negara Singapura, I would

like to know whether there is a plan to change the

sign  and  emblem  worn by  the  police  force  of

Singapore, because I find these are the properties

and  rewards which have been left by the  colonial

Government and which should be abolished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another thing, Mr Speaker, in regard to

the  Guard and Escort Unit. I imagine that perhaps

in  the  future, additional expenditure  for  1961

will  be  proposed before this House in regard  to

members of the Guard and Escort Unit. We know that

it  was  debated  in December last  year  in  this

Assembly  that their salary scale was not  at  all

just,  having regard to the expenditure for  1961.

So  the  matter  of  the  salary  scales  and  the

increase   in  pay  should  receive  the   serious

attention of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another thing. There are posts in the

Guard and Escort Unit which have been frozen. Will

these vacancies be filled sometime this year  when

the  Ordinance  has come into existence?  I  would

therefore  like  a  clear  explanation  from   the

responsible quarter.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member for Kampong

Kembangan  must realise that we are  now  debating

the  principle  of this Bill and not  the  details

which  he  has  sought to raise. The Parliamentary

Secretary,  if he is in a position  to  answer  in

regard to the details, may do so. But,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>



strictly, they are completely irrelevant  to  what

we  are discussing, which is the Second Reading of

the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as regards

the first question, there is a plan at the present

moment  to  change the emblem of the Polis  Negara

Singapura.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the readjustment of expenditure, I

think  the  Minister  for Finance  will  be  in  a

position to answer that, if at any time the Member

wishes to raise that question again. Similarly  as

regards  the  frozen posts, because  that  is  the

function of the Establishment Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br>5.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, a number of Commissioners who

have  sat on Inquiry Commissions constituted under

the  Inquiry Commissions Ordinance have  commented

on  the  fact that the powers of the Commissioners

to  require  persons to give evidence before  them

are inadequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 7 (e) of the present Ordinance, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, any person who is required  by  the

Commissioners  to  give  evidence   on   oath   or

affirmation  or  to  produce a document  or  other

thing  and  refuses to do so is only liable  to  a

fine not exceeding $100. And his failure to do so,

Mr Speaker, does not constitute in law a contempt

of  the  authority of the Commission. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  it is therefore proposed to provide  that  a

person  who  refuses to give evidence on  oath  or

affirmation  or  to  produce a document  or  other

thing   required  to  be  produced   before   the

Commission  will be guilty of contempt  under  the

amendment  which  we  have proposed.  It  is  also

proposed  to increase the punishment for contempt,

which  is at present a fine not exceeding $200  or

imprisonment  for  a  term  not  exceeding   three

months,   to  a  fine  not  exceeding  $3,000   or

imprisonment for a term not exceeding  two  years.

This amendment, Sir, will bring the punishment for

contempt  in  line with that for  obstruction  and

threats  to  witnesses under  section  11  of  the

Ordinance,  which is imprisonment for a  term  not

exceeding two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed, Sir, to give the

Commissioners  power  to determine  the  order  in

which  witnesses are to be examined  and  to  give

them  the  powers of a Judge of the Supreme  Court

for  the purpose of recovering costs or fines,  or

to  give effect to a warrant of arrest or an order

of imprisonment. The power of the Commissioners to

require evidence to be taken is related in section

7  of the Ordinance to that of the High Court, and

it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>



felt  that  the  position should be placed  beyond

doubt by giving the Commissioners the powers of  a

Judge of the Supreme Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on

some  aspects of this Bill not in so far  as  they

relate   to  an  Inquiry  Commission  or  to   the

Commissioners  as  set  out  in  the   Bill,   but

particularly with regard to the effect that these

amendments   have  on  the  Legislative   Assembly

(Powers and Privileges) Ordinance, No. 33 of 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing Inquiry Commissions Ordinance,

Mr  Speaker,  the  question of  contempt  of  the

Commissioner  or Commissioners relates  itself  to

the  items  set out in clause 3 (a) and  clause  3

(b).  There has been a new paragraph (c)  inserted

which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"[If any person] being required by the

Commissioners  to  give  evidence   on   oath   or

affirmation  or  to  produce a document  or  other

thing,  refuses  to  do so,  shall  be  guilty  of

contempt.".



<br><br>So  that  once  the Commissioner has subpoenaed  a

person  to  appear before him and if  that  person

refuses to give evidence on oath or affirmation or

to  produce  a  document, he shall  be  guilty  of

contempt and he may be punished under the relevant

section.  Let us examine that section in  relation

to    the   Legislative   Assembly   (Powers   and

Privileges) Ordinance. The first section  I  would

draw your particular attention to, Mr Speaker, in

the  Legislative Assembly (Powers and  Privileges)

Ordinance  is  section  3. Section  3  relates  to

freedom of speech in this Assembly, and it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No civil or criminal proceedings may be

instituted  against any person while a  member  of

the Assembly-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) in respect of words spoken before the

Assembly or a committee thereof; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) in respect of words written in a report to

the Assembly or to any committee thereof or in any

petition,  bill,  resolution, motion  or  question

brought or introduced by him therein.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>



In  other words, Mr Speaker, Sir, section 3 gives

absolute privilege to a Member of the Assembly  in

respect   of  statements  made  by  him  in   this

Assembly. I myself am doubtful what the effect  of

the  proposed amendment to the Inquiry Commissions

Ordinance   will  have  on  section  3   of   this

Ordinance.  There is no doubt that this  amendment

is  going  to  be  later in time. Therefore,  this

amendment  is being made in the full knowledge  of

the  existence  of  section 3 of  the  Legislative

Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether being later in time would have the effect

of  over-riding section 3 of this 1955  Ordinance,

Mr Speaker. Sir, it is not for me to say. I think

the Minister must advise the House on that. If  it

does  over-ride the provisions of section 3,  what

then  is  the protection which an Assemblyman  has

for  statements made by him in this Assembly?  The

Government   could   quite  easily   institute   a

Commission  of  Inquiry  in  respect  of   certain

statements  made by him in this Assembly,  as  has

already been done, and the Commissioner will then

call  upon  this  person to come  along  and  give

evidence.  And if he fails to give evidence  under

this  proposed  new clause, the  Commissioner  can

then commit him for contempt and fine him. If that

is  correct, and if those are the powers  intended

that  the  Commissioner  or  Commissioners  should

have, then section 3 loses any value that it  has.

That is the first point, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point also relates itself to other

provisions in the Legislative Assembly (Powers and

Privileges) Ordinance. May I draw your  attention,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, to section 23? Section 23 is  a

long  section  but perhaps I had better  read  the

whole of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No evidence relating to any of the following

matters, that is to say



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) debates or other proceedings in the

Assembly;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the contents of the minutes of evidence

taken   or  any  documents  laid  before   a

committee of the Assembly or any proceedings

or   examinations  held  before   any   such

committee,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>



by  any  member or officer of the Assembly or  any

shorthand-writer employed to take minutes  of  any

such evidence or proceedings or in respect of  any

of  the matters specified in paragraph (b) of this

section by any person who was a witness before the

committee  shall be admissible in any  proceedings

before a court'-



<br><br>Mark the words, Mr Speaker-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`or person authorized by law to take evidence'-



<br><br>That, I take it, will include the Commissioner-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`unless the court or such last-mentioned person

is satisfied that permission has been given by the

Speaker  or the Chairman of the committee (as  the

case may require) for such evidence to be given.'



<br><br>I  ask  the Minister again what the effect of  the

proposed  new  clause  in the Inquiry  Commissions

Ordinance will have on section 23 of the  existing

Legislative   Assembly  (Powers  and   Privileges)

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more important than that, Sir, I draw your

attention  to  section 24 (1) (e) which  reads  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Any person who-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) publishes any report of a committee of the

Assembly  or  of any evidence  given  or  any

documents  presented  to  such  committee  or

extracts  from  such documents,  before  such

committee  has  presented its report  to  the

Assembly;



<br><br>shall  be guilty of an offence and shall be liable

on conviction to a fine of one thousand dollars or

to  imprisonment for twelve months or to both such

fine and imprisonment.'



<br><br>Sir,  imagine a situation where a Select Committee

is  in session. It has not concluded its sittings.

Certain  evidence  has been given  in  the  Select

Committee. An Inquiry Commission is started  which

relates  itself  to  matters  before  that  Select

Committee, and the Commissioner then exercises his

powers  under  the Inquiry Commissions  Ordinance,

summons  a  Member of the Select Committee  before

him and then says, "I want you to tell me what has

taken  place in Select Committee." Now that Member

is  in  a  nice fix, is he not? He is between  the

devil  and the deep sea. Supposing he refuses,  is

the  position  then  this?  The  Commissioner  may

commit  him for contempt and fine him. If that  is

the position, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>



he  accedes to the powers of the Commissioner  and

he gives evidence, Mr Speaker, Sir, you will have

something  to  say about it and probably  get  him

prosecuted  under  section  24  (1)  (e)  of   the

Legislative   Assembly  (Powers  and   Privileges)

Ordinance  and  have him convicted.  Is  that  the

position?  Similarly with section 24 (1)  (f)  (i)

and (ii) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`publishes any report or statement purporting to

be  a  report of the proceedings of the Assembly

in any case-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) where such proceedings have been conducted

after exclusion by order of the Assembly of

the public; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) where such publication has been expressly

prohibited by order of the Assembly;'.



<br><br>If  anything is revealed in respect of  those  two

matters  set  out therein, that person  "shall  be

guilty  of  an  offence and  shall  be  liable  on

conviction to a fine of one thousand dollars or to

imprisonment  for twelve months or  to  both  such

fine  and imprisonment." Here again, he is between

two  fires - between the fire of the Speaker and the

fire of the Commissioner. So the position seems  a

bit  ticklish for some gentleman who should be  so

foolhardy  as to contest an election, get  himself

elected,  and say something in the Assembly  which

incurs   the   disapproval  of   the   Government;

whereupon  the Government institutes a  Commission

of  Inquiry  and the Commissioner  under  his  new

powers  seeks to get at the truth of  things.  The

ultimate result is that the Assemblyman is between

the two fires of the Speaker and the Commissioner.

Is that the intention of this Bill?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Byrne, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> In reply, Sir. The Member for Farrer

Park  doubtless  knows  that  civil  and  criminal

proceedings  cannot be instituted against  persons

for words spoken before this Legislative Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer Park will

remember   that   in  the  time  of   the   former

Government, a Commission of Inquiry was  appointed

to  look  into the Mayor's handling of the affairs

of  the  City Council. He will also remember  that

the leaders of the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>



moved the High Court for a writ of prohibition  in

an  effort  to  get  the High Court  to  stop  the

proceedings before the Commission of Inquiry which

was  then appointed. The hon. Member will remember

that   the  High  Court  held  that  a   writ   of

prohibition  does not lie, for the  simple  reason

that  the  Commission is not a  Court  within  the

legal definition of the meaning of a Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as you know, the Government is

giving consideration to the introduction of a  new

Ordinance setting out the powers and privileges of

this   Legislative  Assembly.   A   Committee   of

Privileges has already been set up by this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The points that the Member for Farrer Park has

raised  in this Assembly are matters which are  at

present  actively receiving the attention  of  the

Government.  In due course, we will be introducing

a   Bill   which   will  help  to  resolve   these

difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.- [Mr Byrne].

<div align="center"><h4>(AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the object of this Bill is to transfer the

power  to levy a surcharge on rubber estates under

the   Rubber  Estates  (Surcharge  on  Assessment)

Ordinance from the Rural Board to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>



Minister.  The  Bill also seeks  to  increase  the

maximum  rate of the surcharge leviable  on  large

rubber  holdings  from one-half of  one  cent  per

pound  of dry rubber to one cent per pound of  dry

rubber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Rubber Estates (Surcharge on Assessment)

Ordinance (Cap. 169) provides for the levy by  the

Rural  Board  of a surcharge on rates assessed  on

rubber estates under the Rubber Estates Assessment

Ordinance (Cap. 168) and for such surcharge to  be

credited  to the Malayan Rubber Fund. In  view  of

the  integration  of  the  Rural  Board  with  the

Central Government, it is now proposed to transfer

the powers conferred on the Board under the Rubber

Estates (Surcharge on Assessment) Ordinance to the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Ordinance provides that the rate

of  surcharge on rubber holdings shall not  exceed

one-half  of one cent per pound of dry rubber.  It

is  proposed  to raise this maximum  rate  of  the

surcharge  to one cent per pound of dry rubber  to

allow for greater flexibility. In this connection,

I wish to point out that the present research cess

imposed by the Federation is 0.75 cents per  pound

of  dry  rubber which is higher than  the  maximum

rate  of  surcharge at present leviable under  the

Singapore Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments which are proposed to the Public

Trustee  Ordinance were drafted at the request  of

the  Public  Trustee  Board which  is  constituted

under section 13 of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first proposed amendment, which is to section

6  of  the Public Trustee Ordinance, is to  enable

monies of the General Estates Fund to be placed in

fixed  deposit for terms of three to  six  months,

thereby earning interest at about four per cent on

the  daily  balances. Money which is held  by  the

Public Trustee on trust for a long period of  time

is  invested  in  the Common  Fund,  so  that  the

interest can be credited to the individual estates

up  to the time of distribution. Other monies such

as  funds held by an estate which are to  be  paid

out  within  a few months, or small amounts  which

are  held  for  minors and are  being  reduced  by

monthly payments of maintenance, are held  in  the

Public Trustee General Estates Bank Account. Under

the  existing  law,  such monies  are  held  in  a

general banking account and earn interest  at  the

rate of two per cent on the daily balance which is

paid   into   the  Consolidated  Fund  under   the

provisions of section 6 (7) of the Public  Trustee

Ordinance. The proposed amendment will enable such

monies  to  be  placed on fixed  deposit,  thereby

earning  interest  at about  four  per  cent.  The

amount in the General Estates Bank Account is  now

about half a million dollars and represents monies

due  to  about 300 estates varying in  value  from

$100   to  $20,000.  It  is  difficult,  from   an

accounting  point  of view, to  pay  out  interest

earned   on   small   estates   to   the   various

beneficiaries, as this will involve  a  tremendous

amount of work; and as the average amount held  in

such  estates  is small, the interest  earned  for

each  estate  will be negligible. It is  therefore

proposed,  as  in  the past, to pay  out  interest

earned into the Consolidated Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment proposed is to section 14 of

the  Public Trustee Ordinance. Under the  existing

law   the  Public  Trustee  Investment  Board   is

required  to  meet in the month of  February  each

year, and to give directions to the Public Trustee

as regards the disposal of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>



balance  standing  to  the credit  of  the  Income

Account  of  the  Common Fund at the  end  of  the

preceding  year,  after interest  payable  to  the

beneficiaries and other lawful charges  have  been

duly debited to the said Account. In order to give

such  directions,  it will be  necessary  for  the

Board  to have the audited accounts of the  Public

Trustee  for  the preceding year, but  it  is  not

always  possible for such accounts to be ready  by

February  in  the  year. It is therefore  proposed

that  the directions of the Board may be given  in

April  or  such  later month in the  year  as  the

Minister may appoint.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.



<br><br>6.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read  a

Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will remember that when

this Bill was first introduced in this Assembly it

was  a  small Bill and was committed to  a  Select

Committee.  But  the  Select  Committee  spent   a

considerable  amount of time  on  it.  There  were

altogether  12 sittings. The Committee unanimously

agreed to this revised Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we made certain important amendments in

the  Bill as a whole. One is the changing  of  the

name  of  the  Bill.  During the  session  of  the

Committee,   many  witnesses  came  forward.   The

majority  of them were of the opinion that,  since

the Bill was to help in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1451</b></font><br><br>



unification  of the Sikh temples in Singapore,  it

was the proper time to change the name of the Bill

from   the  Queen  Street  and  Silat  Road   Sikh

Gurdawaras Bill to that of the present title.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other major change in the Bill concerns the

constitution  of  the Board of  Trustees.  In  the

past, the two main Sikh temples were dominated  by

three  societies  of Sikhs. In other  words,  they

monopolised  Sikh  affairs  in  Singapore.  During

Committee sessions, various Sikh organisations and

individuals came forward and put forward the  view

that it was high time that this monopoly should be

stopped  and  proper representation in  the  Board

should  be  given.  After  hearing  evidence,  the

Committee    unanimously    decided    to     give

representation  not  only to the  three  societies

already   mentioned,  but  also   to   two   other

organisations  (two  representatives   from   each

organisation),  and 15 elective members  from  the

Central  Sikh  Temple. For election  purposes,  we

made  certain  amendments  in  the  Bill  for  the

compiling of an electoral register.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not going to deal with the

Bill  in  detail, but before I conclude,  I  would

like to put on record, on behalf of the Committee,

that  the  Bill  in its present form  was  brought

about with your able assistance and guidance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have great

pleasure in suggesting to the House that this is a

Bill worthy of support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the main point in this Bill as

it  has emerged from the Select Committee lies,  I

think, in the constitution of the Board. We had  a

number  of  meetings, I think it was 12,  as  the

Member  for  Telok  Blangah has said,  from  which

evidence  was  recorded. And it  emerged  in  that

evidence  that  by and large it  was  the  general

desire  of  the Sikh community that some  form  of

democratisation   should   take   place   in   the

management of these two Gurdwaras.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1452</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The historical background against which the

Gurdwaras were developed was not the spirit  which

was   advocated  by  the  witnesses   before   the

Committee. Because of the things that had happened

previously, the management of their Committees was

left  in  the  hands  of  associations,  and   the

circumstances  which necessitated  that  state  of

affairs  no  longer  exist today.  Therefore,  the

Select  Committee  has sought to  keep  a  balance

between  the  requirements of a  modern  age  and,

shall we say, the management of a past era, and we

have  tried  to  bring  the two  together  in  the

earnest  hope  that  they  too  will  join   hands

together  and  work  this  Bill  for  the  general

benefit  of the Sikh community at large.  I  think

the Committee appreciates that it does not have  a

hundred  per  cent support of all the  people  who

came  before  the Committee, but  I  think  I  can

safely  say  that at least 90 to 95  per  cent  of

those  who  came  before  the  Committee  entirely

approved of clause 3 as it now stands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I appeal to certain

older  members of the Sikh community to work  this

Bill in the spirit which the Select Committee hope

they  will work it? We feel sure that if there  is

this harmony between these five societies and  the

elected representatives of the Gurdwaras, it  will

be in the best interests of that community. And  I

think it is fair to express at this stage that the

Committee felt that the time should soon come when

the  entire  management of  the  Sikh  temples  in

Singapore  would  be left to the congregations  of

the Gurdwaras rather than to any associations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, I would like to associate

myself  with the Member for Telok Blangah in  what

he  said with regard to the Chairman of the Select

Committee. Sir, a lot of evidence was taken and  a

lot   of  marshalling  and  channelling  of   that

evidence  in  a proper direction was  needed.  The

Committee  are very grateful to you,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,   for   having  done  that  and  for   having

pinpionted  the  more important bits  of  evidence

that came out before the Select Committee.
