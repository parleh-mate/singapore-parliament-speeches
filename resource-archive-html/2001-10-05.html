<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Market for incoming tourists)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Wang Kai Yuen asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry, whether the Government recognises the potential  of

the  People's Republic of China as a significant  market  for

incoming  tourists and, if so, what steps are being taken  to

tap this market.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Tang Guan Seng) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the People's Republic

of  China (PRC) is an important and a fast-growing source  of

inbound   tourists  for  Singapore.   My  Minister  mentioned

earlier  in  Parliament  that the  PRC  tourist  arrivals  to

Singapore during the Asian financial crisis continued to grow

at  double  digit level while our other markets  shrank.   In

spite  of  the  11th  September incident,  PRC  tourists  are

expected  to increase in the coming years. Based on Singapore

Tourism   Board's  (STB)  statistics,  from  11th   to   27th

September,  PRC  tourist arrivals registered an  increase  of

12.87%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRC is currently the sixth largest visitor-generating

market  for  Singapore.   Last year,  we  received  more  than

400,000  visitors from the PRC, an increase of 16.5% over  the

previous year. Due largely to China's strong internal economy,

the  STB targets to achieve 1 million PRC visitor arrivals  to

Singapore by 2005.  This will place PRC as one of our  largest

tourism market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We intend to tap this market to the fullest extent

possible.   This large flow will feed our tourism  sector  and

provide  many  jobs for Singaporeans.  STB is working  closely

with other Government agencies to make this happen.  These

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2125</b></font><br><br>

include increasing airlinks between our two countries and more

streamlined  visa  procedures.  For  Singapore  travel  agents

handling  PRC tourists, the quantum of the Banker's  Guarantee

has been lowered for the 96-hour Collective Gratis Visa (CGV).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, STB will work closely with local industry

members  as  well as our neighbouring countries to market  our

countries collectively and to develop new products for the PRC

market.   STB will establish more offices in China to  promote

Singapore.  This year, it will set up a new office in Beijing.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I would like to

ask the Senior Parliamentary Secretary whether the Government

will  improve  on the approval process for visas  applied  by

these  visitors.  Even though we have a target to  achieve  1

million  PRC  visitors  it seems to  me  that  the  approving

authority  for  visas still vests with the Ministry  of  Home

Affairs and they have been quite restrictive in this area.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true that

there  is  stringent control on visitors from PRC.   However,

recently,  there  has been a relaxation on the  requirements.

For  example,  the  Banker's Guarantee  for  group  visits  I

mentioned earlier has been reduced from $150,000 to $100,000.

This  is  what we have been doing and we have been discussing

with  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  to  work  towards   a

streamlined visa procedure.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Sir, my other question is how to

leverage  on  the  very positive impression  of  the  Chinese

public of Singapore and how to prevent the tarnishing of such

impression  by  unscrupulous merchants in  Singapore  whereby

some  of the practices seem to be unhealthy and they tend  to

fleece the tourists.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> STB has been encouraging a group of

tour agencies who are members of the National Association  of

Travel   Agents  in  Singapore  to  work  closely  with   the

authorised tour agents

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2126</b></font><br><br>

in China so that collectively they can improve on the quality

of  the  package  tours in Singapore, thereby increasing  the

number of tourists from PRC and also improving on the quality

of service provided to them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Sir, are there any plans

under  way  to  conduct  visa-free  travel  between  the  two

countries?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang Guan Seng:</b> As I said just now, the procedure

for  visa application has been streamlined for certain groups

of  visitors from the PRC.  As of now, there is no  plan  for

visa-free travel between the two countries.

<div align="center"><b>SECURITIES AND FUTURES BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br><i>Rationale</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital markets have become increasingly sophisticated,

as   a  result  of  technological  advances  giving  rise  to

competition  and globalisation.  In Singapore, we  have  seen

the  demutualisation and merger of the securities and futures

exchanges, a proliferation of electronic business models, and

a  diversity  of  new  products.  Cross-selling  has  blurred

sectoral  boundaries whilst financial innovation has  blurred

product lines.  Institutions no longer confine themselves  to

their  domestic  markets or their immediate  hinterland,  but

reach  out to pools of liquidity in other countries as  well.

The  liberalisation  of  the capital  markets  and  increased

competition has catalysed these processes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fluid and rapidly-evolving financial landscape

poses  new  demands on regulators.  It is important  that  we

create  a sound and transparent legal framework within  which

players  can operate.  The framework must balance  prudential

concerns  with market development.  Moreover,  it  should  be

sufficiently   flexible  to  allow,   and   even   facilitate

innovation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from these developments, there is a need to

recast  the existing legal framework in view of the shift  in

MAS'  regulatory  philosophy  since  the  enactment  of   the

Securities  Industry Act (Chapter 289) (SIA).   The  SIA  was

drafted  and  enacted in the wake of the Pan-El crisis.   The

intention  then was to tighten supervision of the then  Stock

Exchange  of Singapore and the securities industry.  However,

MAS   has,   since  1997,  embraced  a  different  regulatory

philosophy.   We  have  moved from a  merit-based  regulation

where the regulator decides what comes

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2128</b></font><br><br>

to  the  market  to a disclosure-based regime which  empowers

investors   to  make  informed  decisions.   We   have   also

instituted  a fundamental shift in emphasis away  from  "one-size-fits-all"  regulation  of institutions  to  risk-focused

supervision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Securities and Futures Bill (SF Bill) responds to

all  these  developments.  It sets out, in a single rulebook,

the   legislative  framework  governing  the  securities  and

futures industry by consolidating the provisions in the  SIA,

the  Futures  Trading Act (FTA) (Chapter  116),  as  well  as

certain  provisions  in  the Exchanges  (Demutualisation  and

Merger) Act (Chapter 99B) and the Companies Act (Chapter 50).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impetus for the SF Bill can be broadly described as

follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To redraft and update legislation to keep abreast of the

many  developments  that  have taken  place  in  the  capital

markets since the enactment of the SIA and FTA;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To create a flexible regulatory framework for

intermediaries,  to  enhance  competition   and   to   reduce

compliance cost;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance the regulatory framework for clearing and

settlement activities, and to provide an exception to laws of

insolvency for clearing and settlement activities to minimise

any systemic risk to our clearing and settlement system;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide a comprehensive rulebook on capital markets activities;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the development of a disclosure-based regime;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide an enhanced market enforcement regime, which

supports a disclosure-based regime; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To streamline the appeal process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparing the SF Bill, MAS has conducted a public

consultation of an earlier draft of the Bill.  The public has

been  supportive of the policies introduced by the Bill,  and

has provided many comments.  MAS has studied and incorporated

some of these comments in the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2129</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now go through the major policy

reforms in the SF Bill:

<br><br><i>Updating  Legislation  to  Cater to Developments  in  Capital Markets</i>

<br><br><i>Recognised  Trading System Providers (Part II);  Redefinition of    "Markets"    (First   Schedule)   and    "Dealing    in Securities/Trading  in  Futures" (Second  Schedule);   Extra-Territorial Jurisdiction (Section 339)</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation and advances in telecommunication

technology have led to more cross-border trade, especially in

the  electronic realm.  Connectivity to overseas  markets  no

longer  requires the manual intervention by broker-dealers  - it  can  instead  be provided by passive Alternative  Trading

Systems  (ATS).   New  electronic  financial  services   also

deconstruct   traditional  value  chains,   allowing   market

participants to offer services along specific segments of the

value  chains,  and  blurring the time-honoured  concepts  of

either "operating a market" or "acting as an intermediary".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SIA and the FTA - the two old Acts - were not

drafted  with these new business models in mind.  The arrival

of  these business models calls for greater clarification  as

to  how  these businesses would be regulated, ie, whether  as

"markets" or "intermediaries".  MAS' policy intent is to only

regulate  as  markets, facilities which bring  together  many

buyers  and many sellers, and allow the posting of sufficient

information  to  result in a transaction taking  place.   The

redefinitions of markets in the First Schedule of the SF Bill

would  provide  clarity on this issue.  We have  refined  the

definition  of markets to refer to a place or facility  where

offers  to  sell, purchase or exchange securities or  futures

contract  are  made  "on  a centralised  basis".   Places  or

facilities  which  are  used by one person  to  provide  such

offers are excluded from the definition of markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present regulatory framework in the SIA and FTA only

allows for market operators to operate in Singapore as either

approved exchanges, or exempt

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2130</b></font><br><br>

markets.   Neither is appropriate for the regulation  of  the

majority  of  markets  maintained  by  ATS,  for  which   the

imposition  of  a  full  gamut of  exchange  requirements  is

inappropriate,  but for which MAS still wishes  to  retain  a

reasonable extent of regulatory oversight.  The SF Bill  will

introduce  a  new recognition regime for such  markets.   ATS

operators  who  operate  facilities which  are  predominantly

providing market-like services will require authorisation  to

operate  in Singapore as Recognised Trading System  Providers

(ReTS  Providers).  This is found in Part II, Division  4  of

the  Bill.  The regulatory requirements to be imposed on ReTS

Providers, to be spelt out in Regulations, would commensurate

with  the  nature  and scale of risks posed by  these  market

models.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To facilitate the regulation of cross-border financial

services  that target or are made accessible to Singaporeans,

clause  339  of  the Bill will introduce an extra-territorial

jurisdiction  provision for offences.  This is a codification

of judicial pronouncements in common law jurisdictions that a

foreign  act is justiciable in a country if it has an  effect

in  that  country.   This  is the  practice  in  other  major

financial  centres.  Clause 339 will confer  jurisdiction  on

acts  outside Singapore that have substantial and  reasonably

foreseeable effects in Singapore.

<br><br><i>Creating a Flexible Regulatory Framework for Intermediaries, to Enhance Competition and to Reduce Compliance Cost</i>



<br><br><i>Single Licensing Framework for Securities and Futures Market Intermediaries (Part IV)</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing licensing framework under the SIA and the

FTA is characterised by the issuance of multiple licences  to

market  intermediaries according to their business activities

within the securities, futures and asset management industry.

With  the  blurring  of  boundaries  between  securities  and

futures products, and the breaking down of the value chain in

the financial services industry, such multiple licensing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2131</b></font><br><br>

structure  has increasingly become less flexible  in  meeting

the business needs of intermediaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep pace with market developments and to better

accommodate  changes  in  the  business  models   of   market

intermediaries, the SF Bill will introduce a  single  modular

licensing   framework   for  the   securities   and   futures

intermediaries,  to  replace the current  multiple  licensing

regime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the SF Bill will require an intermediary to

hold  only  a  single  licence, known as  a  Capital  Markets

Services   licence,   to  conduct  one  or   more   regulated

activities.    These   regulated  activities   will   include

securities   dealing,  futures  trading,  leveraged   foreign

exchange   trading,  advising  on  corporate  finance,   fund

management,  securities financing and custodial services  for

securities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The single licensing regime will reduce both capital and

compliance   cost,  and  allow  our  intermediaries   to   be

competitive across a broader spectrum of financial services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill will provide for licensing exemptions so

long  as  these  do not compromise the standard  of  investor

protection.   Banks,  merchant banks, finance  companies  and

insurance companies are already supervised by MAS under other

principal  legislation.  They will be exempted from licensing

for  any regulated securities and futures activities so  long

as  they  are not prohibited from undertaking such activities

under   those   principal  legislation.   This  will   reduce

regulatory overlap and save on compliance costs.  However, to

level  the playing field, these institutions will be  subject

to   the   same   business  conduct  rules   and   regulatory

requirements, where appropriate.



<br><br><i>Enhancing   the   Regulatory  Framework  for   Clearing   and

Settlement Activities,  Creating an Exception to Laws of Insolvency  for

Clearing and Settlement Activities to Minimise Systemic Risks</i>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2132</b></font><br><br>



<i>Regulation of Clearing and Settlement Activities (Part III)</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill will introduce a legal framework for the

regulation  of  clearing and settlement institutions  in  the

securities  and  futures  markets.   Such  institutions  will

require MAS' approval.  Part III, Division 2 of the Bill will

introduce provisions for MAS to approve and regulate clearing

houses separately from exchanges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect a clearing house that operates in Singapore,

and thereby all the participants that utilise its facilities,

the  Bill  in Part III, Division 3 also provides an exception

to  the  laws of insolvency where a participant of a clearing

house defaults on its obligations.  By giving primacy to  the

default  rules  of  the  clearing house  over  the  rules  of

insolvency, the SF Bill will ensure that the insolvency of  a

member will not disrupt the clearing and settlement of trades

already  executed.   Such  giving  of  priority  to  systemic

stability  is consistent with the practice in other financial

centres.



<br><br><i>Providing   a  Comprehensive  Rulebook  on  Capital   Markets

Activities in Singapore</i>

<br><br><i>Migration of Capital Raising Provisions from the Companies

Act  - Shares and Debentures (Part XIII, Division 1)</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill migrates the capital raising provisions in

the  Companies  Act  (CA)  into a comprehensive  rulebook  on

capital  markets  activities  in  Singapore.   This   is   to

implement   a   recommendation  of  the   Corporate   Finance

Committee.



<br><br><i>Collective Investment Schemes (Part XIII, Division 2)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, as recommended by the Corporate Finance Committee,

the  provisions  in the CA (the Companies  Act)  relating  to

public offers of "interests other than shares and debentures"

are  migrated  to the SF Bill.  The SF Bill has replaced  the

concept of "interests" under the CA, which governs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2133</b></font><br><br>

unit  trusts,  and  replaced  it  with  that  of  "collective

investment  schemes".   The SF Bill requires  all  collective

investment schemes to be approved by MAS before they  can  be

offered to the public.  MAS is empowered to suspend or revoke

schemes  detrimental to the public interest even after  their

approval.   The  SF  Bill provides an additional  option  for

foreign  funds to be offered directly to the public,  instead

of only through feeder funds, which entail additional costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill provides for the offer of collective

investment   schemes  to  sophisticated   investors   without

prospectuses, as is the case for shares and debentures.   The

criteria for approval of such schemes are less stringent than

that for retail schemes, as sophisticated investors are in  a

better position to fend for themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the SF Bill, trustees for collective investment

schemes will be approved on a one-off basis, instead  of  the

current  cumbersome practice of fund-by-fund approvals.   MAS

will  be  given the power to inspect such trustees, to  check

that  they  perform  their  statutory  duties  properly   and

safeguard the interests of investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS will also introduce an industry Code setting out

investment   and  operational  requirements  for   collective

investment  schemes.  Examples are the investment  guidelines

for  various types of funds, rules governing soft  commission

practices   and  disclosures,  and  contents  of  semi-annual

reports to investors.



<br><br><i>Facilitating the Development of a Disclosure-based Regime</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill seeks to create a legal framework that

facilitates  the  development of a  disclosure-based  capital

markets  regime  in Singapore.  To this end, several  reforms

have been put in place.



<br><br><i>Enhancement in Prospectus Regime (Part XIII, Division 1)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First amongst these are the refinements made to the

prospectus   regime.  To  deter  inadequate   or   misleading

disclosures and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2134</b></font><br><br>

material  omissions  from  prospectuses,  issuers  and  their

advisers  will  be  subject  to  greater  accountability  for

prospectus disclosure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedures for registering prospectuses have been

refined.  Prospectuses lodged with MAS will be subject  to  a

two-week  holding period, during which MAS will  conduct  the

necessary review for compliance with the prospectus law.   At

the same time, the lodged prospectuses will be put on the MAS

website  and made accessible to the public.  The  public  can

scrutinise  and  give comments on the lodged prospectuses  to

MAS.  MAS may refuse to register a prospectus if it is not in

compliance with statutory disclosure requirements or  if  its

registration is not in the public interest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a registered prospectus is later found to be

misleading  or deficient, MAS is empowered to  serve  a  stop

order  to prevent the issuance or sale of securities  to  the

public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill will provide for the return of monies to

investors who have bought or subscribed for securities, after

a  stop  order  has been served or the issuer  has  lodged  a

supplementary  or  replacement document.  This  is  also  the

practice in Australia.  These legal remedies are necessary to

protect  the  investing  public in the  few  instances  where

serious breaches of the law occur.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance regulatory transparency, the SF Bill will

clarify that preliminary prospectuses, used for book-building

to  ascertain the level of market interest in securities, can

be   distributed  only  to  sophisticated  and  institutional

investors.   In addition, the SF Bill will allow issuers  and

their   advisers   to  conduct  roadshow   presentations   to

sophisticated and institutional investors before  registering

a prospectus.



<br><br><i>Continuing   Disclosure  Requirements  by  Listed   Companies

(Clause 203)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill will give legal teeth to the continuous

disclosure  of  material information by listed  corporations.

Presently,   listed  corporations  are   required   to   make

disclosure of material information, on a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2135</b></font><br><br>

continuous  basis,  under  the Singapore  Exchange's  Listing

Manual.    Clause  203 of the Bill will make this  continuous

disclosure requirement a statutory one.  Failure by companies

to  make  disclosure of material information could render  it

liable  to the payment of civil fines or criminal prosecution

(where the failure is intentional or reckless).



<br><br><i>Notification of Substantial Shareholding in Listed  Companies

(Clause 137)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line with international practice, clause 137 of the

SF  Bill will require persons to disclose their shareholdings

to  the securities exchange within two days of their becoming

substantial  shareholders of listed companies and  subsequent

changes  in  their shareholdings.  This will improve  on  the

current  two-stage  process  where  substantial  shareholders

disclose their ownership interests to the listed company  (as

required  by  the  Companies Act), which in turn  relays  the

information  to  the Singapore Exchange, as required  by  the

Exchange's rules.



<br><br><i>Takeovers (Part VIII)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions in the Companies Act governing company

take-overs  and  mergers are migrated  to  the  SF  Bill  and

rationalised.   Part  VIII of the Bill will  empower  MAS  to

promulgate,   and   the   Securities  Industry   Council   to

administer, the Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers. The

SF Bill also makes false or reckless take-over announcements,

criminal offences.



<br><br><i>Enhancing Market Enforcement</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disclosure-based regime demands an effective market

enforcement  regime.  Any transgressions must be swiftly  and

firmly  dealt with, in order to preserve investor  confidence

in  Singapore's  capital  markets.   The  SF  Bill  therefore

introduces provisions that enhance market enforcement.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2136</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Review of Insider Trading Provisions (Part XII Div 3)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill redefines the laws on insider trading. The

present  provisions  are based on the defendant's  connection

with the company and make only the insider and the tippee  (a

person acting in concert with the insider) liable for insider

trading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prove a case against tippees, the Prosecution has to,

firstly,  show that the tippee has received information  from

an  insider.  Secondly, it has to show that the tippee had an

arrangement  or association with the insider.   Thirdly,  the

tippee  must  be aware that the insider himself is  precluded

from  dealing.  The balance is tilted too much in  favour  of

tippees to the detriment of other market participants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, there is difficulty in extending liability

to  others who are further down the information chain.  Where

the  tippee  himself  does not trade but communicates  price-sensitive   information  to  another  person  (the  secondary

tippee),  who then trades in securities, it may be  difficult

to prove any "arrangement" or "association" with the insider.

This  is  unsatisfactory, as the secondary tippee  (or  other

persons further down the information chain) would have traded

with an unfair information advantage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who receives inside information from sources

other  than a connected person is also not caught  under  the

present  approach, which requires the tracing of  information

back to the connected person.  This needs to be remedied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the core, the mischief of insider trading lies in

tilting  the  playing  field unfairly  against  other  market

participants.   Those who knowingly have  inside  information

should  be prohibited from trading, whether or not  they  are

connected  with  the company.  The intent is to  address  the

core  evil  of  trading  while in possession  of  undisclosed

market  sensitive  information, instead of  having  liability

depend on a person's connection with the company.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2137</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new insider trading provisions in Part XII, Division

3  of  the  SF Bill will no longer depend on the proof  of  a

person's connection with the company.   The test will instead

shift  to  the  core  of the offence, ie,  trading  while  in

possession of undisclosed price-sensitive information by  the

defendant.  The new provisions will also tighten the mens rea

(or  mental intent) test for directors and connected persons.

Clause 218(4) creates a rebuttable presumption that connected

persons with possession of inside information, are deemed  to

know  that  the  information  is undisclosed  and  is  price-sensitive.  This will introduce greater discipline for  those

in fiduciary positions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present section 103 of the Securities Industry Act

(SIA) is silent on any mental intent or mens rea requirement.

The  High Court in Public Prosecutor v. Ng Chee Kheong & Tang

Siu  Shing (in June 1999) imposed a 3-tier mens rea test  for

insider  trading, requiring the Prosecution to show that  the

Accused:   firstly,  knew  that the  information  was  price-sensitive;   secondly,   knew  that   the   information   was

undisclosed; and thirdly, intended to use the information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When section 103 of the SIA was introduced in 1986, it

was  meant to remedy the shortcomings of section 158  of  the

Companies  Act  [Reprint of the Companies Act  (Chapter  50),

<br><br>1985&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revised Edition].   Dr Richard Hu, in the Second Reading

of  the  Securities Industry Bill 1986, stated that this  was

the  mischief  that  section 103 of  the  SIA  was  meant  to

address, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Part IX of the Bill contains revised provisions dealing

with  trading in securities.  The significant feature of this

Part  is  the  new  provision for dealing  in  securities  by

insiders,   ie,   persons  with  access  to   price-sensitive

information.  A notable difference under the new provision is

that  an  offence is committed whether or not the dealing  is

undertaken with the intention of using information to gain an

advantage; the purpose of dealing is irrelevant."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision in Public Prosecution v Ng Chee Kheong, by

introducing the "intent to use" test, effectively brings  our

insider  trading laws to the position in the repealed section

158 of the Companies Act.  This interpretation of section 103

of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2138</b></font><br><br>



the  Securities Industry Act negates the very intent  it  was

meant to remedy.  The requirement of proof of "intent to use"

information  by  the  Prosecution makes it  too  onerous  and

reduces the effectiveness of our insider trading laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 220 of the Securities and Futures Bill therefore

makes  it clear that it is not necessary to prove any  intent

to use inside information by the defendant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The insider trading provisions will also be extended to

cover  futures  and  options contracts on  stocks  and  stock

indices which are extensions of the underlying product.  This

approach is consistent with international best practice.



<br><br><i>Extension  of  Civil Fines/Civil Remedies to Other  Forms  of

Market Misconduct (Part XII Div 4)</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill will extend the civil fine/civil remedy

regime  (presently  available only for  insider  trading)  to

other  forms of market misconduct found in Part  XII   -  eg,

market rigging, market manipulation, the publishing of  false

or  misleading information, and the employment of  fraud  and

deceit  in  dealing.  The advantage of a civil remedy  regime

lies  in  its  lower burden of proof.  The extension  of  the

civil  remedy  regime to all forms of market misconduct  will

complement  the  present framework of criminal  offences  for

such misconduct.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS will be empowered to bring an action in court

against  a defendant for a civil penalty.  The offender  will

also  be  liable  for civil damages to investors  who  suffer

losses as a result of the contravening act.



<br><br><i>Enforcement Powers for MAS Officers (Part IX Div 3)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill provides enhanced investigative powers for

MAS  officers to enforce the civil penalty regime for  market

misconduct.   MAS  will  be  given  powers  to   compel   the

production  of  relevant documents and  records,  to  conduct

search

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2139</b></font><br><br>



and  seizure  with  a warrant from the court  and  to  record

statements.



<br><br><i>Fines for Offences</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties for non-compliance with provisions of the

SIA  and  FTA  have  remained largely unchanged  since  their

enactment   -  except  for  penalties  relating   to   market

misconduct offences, which were increased in March 2000 by  a

factor  of  five.  There is a need to revise  the  fines  for

other  offences  under  the SF Bill in  order  to  provide  a

deterrent effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill will therefore update and align the

penalties  for  offences.   It will introduce  penalties  for

continuing  offences, where appropriate.  The fines  in  most

cases  (except  for Part XII offences) will be  raised  by  a

factor  of five while those for continuing offences  will  be

10%  of that for the main offences.   Clause 333 of the  Bill

introduces higher fines for corporations - a maximum of twice

the amount imposed for individuals.



<br><br><i>Extra-Territorial Jurisdiction Clause for Market Misconduct</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than clause 339, clauses 196, 205 and 213 of Part

XII (Market Misconduct) will specifically confer jurisdiction

over  conduct  within Singapore in relation to securities  or

futures  contracts  listed and traded overseas;  and  conduct

outside  Singapore  in  relation  to  securities  or  futures

contracts listed or traded in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first limb will deter perpetrators of market

misconduct  from  using  Singapore as  a  "haven"  for  their

illegal  activities.  The second aspect will  confer  on  our

courts extra-territorial jurisdiction over foreign acts  that

affect   the   integrity   of  Singapore's   markets.     The

enforcement  of  these  provisions  will  be  facilitated  by

various regulatory Memoranda of Understanding entered between

MAS and foreign regulators.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2140</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Streamlining Appeal Processes</i>

<br><br><i>Rationalization of Appeal Processes (Part XIV)</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, streamlining of appeal processes. There are some

inconsistencies,  under the SIA and FTA,  in  the  provisions

relating  to  appeals (by licensees, exchanges  or  aggrieved

persons)  against decisions made by MAS.  Under  the  present

SIA  and  FTA,  most  appeals  are  heard  by  the  Minister.

However,  in the revocation of a dealer's licence  under  the

SIA, an appeal to the High Court is allowed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill streamlines the appeal processes by having

the  appeals heard by the Minister.  The SF Bill  creates  an

independent     advisory    panel,    comprising     industry

representatives  and lawyers, to advise the  Minister.   This

new   approach  allows  MAS  to  tap  on  the  expertise   of

practitioners  to  evaluate  MAS' decisions  objectively  and

impartially, before presenting their recommendations  to  the

Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I wish to speak in support of this Bill.  The introduction of

the   Securities  and  Futures  Bill  serves  to  update  the

legislation  to keep in pace with the changes and advancement

in  the  capital  markets.  It sets out  the  new  regulatory

framework  for the securities and futures market and  put  it

all into a single piece of legislation under the SF Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make a few comments on this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, areas of conflict in SGX as a securities industry

regulator.   As  I  see it, one of the essential  operational

differences  with  the  SF  Bill is that  several  regulatory

functions of SGX are removed and put under MAS.  I feel  that

this  is  a  correct move in the right direction.  Currently,

SGX  itself is listed on the Singapore mainboard.  There  may

well  be  instances of conflict of interest when SGX  has  to

function as both the regulator as well as the player  in  the

securities industry.  However, I note that, with the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2141</b></font><br><br>



changes,  SGX  will  still retain some regulatory  functions,

especially  on listing functions.  I would like  to  ask  the

Deputy Prime Minister what is the rationale for doing so, and

how  are the regulatory functions divided between MAS and SGX

under  this  new  SF  Bill, such that it  will  minimise  the

avenues of conflict of interest on the part of SGX.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, effectiveness of the extra-territorial

jurisdiction.  Clause 339 of the SF Bill confers the power of

extra-territorial jurisdiction on acts of having  substantial

or  reasonably  foreseeable effects in  Singapore.   Here,  I

would  like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister how  we  can  be

effective in policing and curbing undesirable securities  and

futures    trading   activities   that   occur   in   foreign

jurisdictions.  For example, if a foreign syndicate tries  to

play and corner certain local stocks from overseas, how do we

control  and  penalise them?  Similarly, if  a  foreign-based

Internet company offers securities advisory services  without

an  approved licence to Singapore residents, how do we ensure

that  they  are  giving competent advice and  complying  with

Singapore's listing, take-over and other securities rules and

code?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On enhanced rules on insider trading, Part XII, Div 3 of

the  SF  Bill  deals with a new change in  the  treatment  of

insider  trading rules.  As I understand it, it  has  shifted

from  person-connected  to  information-connected  rule.   In

principle,  I am in agreement with this change, as  it  gives

greater clarity and intent on insider trading.  However, I am

unclear  on  the actual implementation of this change.   Will

the  "person-connected" approach be withdrawn such that  only

"information-connected" rule will apply?  For example, during

the  restricted  buying period when a company  was  about  to

announce   its   financial  results,  for  "person-connected"

parties  or persons who have no access or have no information

of the company's results, could they then trade in the shares

of  the company during the restricted buying period?  I would

like  to ask the Deputy Prime Minister to explain further  on

how this new ruling operates.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2142</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to express my appreciation to

MAS for being responsive to market changes by introducing  so

speedily  this  new  legislation  to  regulate  the   capital

markets.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

speak in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, many important developments have taken

place in all the major financial centres of the world, and we

must  keep  pace  by supporting progressive  changes  in  our

capital  markets  and the financial industry  with  laws  and

regulations that are up-to-date and relevant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the consolidation of several of the existing

legislation  into the Securities and Futures Act  (SFA),  the

regulatory  roles  will, henceforth, be concentrated  on  and

undertaken by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.   Until  a

few  years ago, I must say the MAS is a key institution  that

is  little  known  to the public.  Even  today,  the  MAS  is

regarded  with much respect and a fair amount of awe  by  the

industry.   It  has  a solid reputation  as  a  credible  and

competent  financial  regulator.   It  acts  decisively   and

carries a heavy punch, as witnessed by some people who  dared

to  speculate against the Singapore dollar and those who were

adventurous  in trying to circumvent the rules  on  mandatory

takeovers.  But, much has been done over the last  few  years

to  soften  that image by being more consultative,  open  and

receptive.   I  know  a  few  market  participants  who  were

pleasantly surprised to receive invitations to just  drop  by

the MAS anytime to talk about their future plans and on-going

developments.   In  this respect, I would  like  to  ask  DPM

whether  a Securities and Futures Commission will be  set  up

within the MAS to undertake its new function under the SFA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this fast-changing world, to maintain our position as

a premier financial centre, we must adopt fresh approaches to

regulate and develop our financial sector.  The SF Bill  will

be  a  comprehensive attempt to update our laws  relating  to

securities and futures.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2143</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the provisions of the SF Bill, this

consolidation and centralisation of functions should lead  to

a  speedier  and  more  certain timeframe  for  capital  fund

raising.  Clear time limits for registration of prospectuses,

after  they  are lodged, are set out in the Bill.  Situations

under  which the Authority will refuse registration are  also

spelt out.  This is intended to provide much needed certainty

in  terms of when an issue can be launched, which is critical

in  fast-moving  capital markets, to capture  the  window  of

opportunity.   This will be of great help to corporations  as

they  will now have a better idea of when the funds will come

in for their business expansion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this outcome will be achieved in practice and its

benefits  realised.  My fear, that it may not turn  out  this

way,  stems from a number of factors.  Prior to the SF  Bill,

prospectuses  were  scrutinised by  the  SGX.   Comments  and

queries  for clarification might have resulted in  delays  at

times.  But, ultimately, the issuer can proceed to issue  the

prospectus  once  the  SGX is satisfied  that  the  investing

public is sufficiently protected.  If any of its contents  is

subsequently found to be misleading or untrue, the issuer can

be  taken  to  task in a court of law or by  the  regulators.

But,  now, the prospectuses will be open for public  scrutiny

and   criticism.    Is  our  investing  public   sufficiently

sophisticated?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the public and, probably, competitors who are

out  to  cause  trouble, can ask for unnecessary  information

under  the guise that this additional information is required

for  them  to  make an informed assessment  of  the  matters.

Disclosure  of  certain  information,  such  as  confidential

details  about  margins and pricing, although  nice  for  the

investing public to know, may, in fact, be detrimental to the

business  of  the  company.  And  the  people  who  are  most

interested to know are usually the competitors.  In  addition

to  that, imagine poison-pen letters coming in to the MAS one

after another from business rivals or personal rivals.   This

may lead to even more delays before the prospectus is finally

allowed to be registered, and can even derail the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2144</b></font><br><br>



entire  exercise.   I hope the MAS will be firm  in  deciding

what is and what is not reasonable request for clarification,

and will dedicate adequate trained and competent resources to

carry out the intent of the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the DPM whether such a comprehensive

revamp of the legal framework is overwhelming, especially  at

this  present  time  when  it is  already  so  difficult  for

companies  to  raise  funds from  the  market.   Are  we  too

ambitious  in  trying to do too much now under  this  present

economic  environment?  Valuations and pricing of new  issues

have  come down drastically.  Onerous responsibility  imposed

on  merchant bankers, lawyers, accountants, valuers and other

professionals involved in the corporate fund raising exercise

has  led to a substantial increase in fees.  For a small  and

medium  enterprise (SME) to raise $3-4 million, the  expenses

involved  can  be in excess of $1 million.  My fear  is  that

SMEs  can no longer afford to raise funds here and will  have

no choice but to turn to other regional markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier that I hope we get to reap the

benefits   of  this  revamp  that  is  intended  to  increase

transparency and improve the quality of the issues.  But have

these efforts produced rewards?  To a listed company and  its

shareholders,  the cost of a new listing and continuing  that

listing has gone up, but they are still waiting to enjoy  the

benefits  in  terms  of  better  valuations,  higher  trading

volume,   closer  analyst  coverage  and  more  sophisticated

investors.   Perhaps,  the lethargy is  due  to  the  present

market  conditions.  Perhaps, the lack of interest is due  to

inadequate investor relations by the listed company.  But, it

is  certainly  hoped  that  the revamp  will  not  merely  be

something  that looks good for the record, but will translate

into  real  and tangible benefits, whether now  or  when  the

economic situation improves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to turn to certain provisions of

the Bill which relate to "Market Conduct".

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2145</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SF Bill provides three types of punishment for the

person  who  has  acted  in  contravention  of  any  of   the

provisions  of Part XII of the Bill which relates to  "Market

Conduct".   Offences included in this Part range  from  false

trading,  market rigging, disseminating false  or  misleading

information,  bucketing to insider trading.  The contravening

person  faces civil penalty under clause 232, civil liability

under clause 234 and, of course, criminal penalties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that individual investors who have

suffered loss in respect of a contravention need not commence

an  action,  either individually or as a  class,  to  try  to

recover  their  loss,  but can rely on  the  outcome  of  the

proceedings  commenced by the Authority.  The relevant  court

may,  after  the conviction or the imposition  of  the  civil

penalty, invite all claimants to file and prove their  claims

for compensation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the DPM: what if the Authority

decides  to  settle the contravention with  the  contravening

person?   Clause 232(5) provides that nothing in  clause  232

shall  prevent the Authority from entering into an  agreement

with  any  person  to  pay,  with  or  without  admission  of

liability, a civil penalty.  And, clause 236(1) implies  that

if  a  consent  order  is made by the Authority  against  the

contravening   person,   with   or   without   admission   of

contravention, the court will not be involved and, therefore,

other  aggrieved persons will not be invited  to  file  their

claims.   Under the settlement agreement with the  Authority,

the  civil  penalty, if any, imposed by clause  232  will  be

payable  to  the  Authority.  How about  the  losses  of  the

individual   claimants?    Would  they   have   to   commence

proceedings separately against the offender?  This may not be

easy,  as  they  will be disadvantaged by the  difficulty  of

gathering evidence and by the lack of resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the DPM, whether in the interest of

the  investing public, we should set out the types  of  cases

which the Authority should not settle bilaterally but should,

if  there is sufficient evidence, bring the proceedings  into

open court.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2146</b></font><br><br>



The  guidelines  on  whether  the  case  can  be  settled  by

agreement need not be based on the type of offence, but could

be  based on criteria, such as the number of people aggrieved

or the amount involved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, in the event the Authority enters into an

agreement for civil penalty to be paid, it should disclose to

a  bona  fide  claimant  the grounds for  its  decision,  the

results of its investigation and the evidence collated, so as

to  assist  the  potential claimant in  deciding  whether  to

pursue the case separately against the contravening person.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  in  support  of the Bill, as the new legislation  is  a

fitting  enabling  legal  framework for  all  the  structural

reforms and initiatives that the Government has undertaken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effort to consolidate the provisions in the various

pieces  of legislation is commendable and will go a long  way

towards  facilitating  further  development  of  our  capital

markets.    As   a  consequence  of  the  amalgamation,   the

provisions cover a wide range of issues.  I shall, therefore,

limit my comments and questions to the following three areas,

ie,  the  specific  issues of developing  a  disclosure-based

regime and market misconduct, and the general issue of public

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, developing a disclosure-based regime. The

shift  from a prescriptive to a disclosure-based approach  is

timely.   It  is consistent with the increasing  emphasis  on

transparency and information disclosure.  Essentially, market

participants should no longer rely solely on prospectuses  or

offers  that have made the grade, ie, endorsed by  the  stock

exchange, to make their investment decisions.  Instead,  they

should  now  carefully examine the substance of  the  offers.

Whilst this may be a departure from the previous mindset that

an   approved   public  offer  equals   a   good   investment

opportunity,   it   will   cause   investors   to   be   more

discriminating and savvy over time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2147</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several provisions deal with enhancing market

accountability   and  raising  the  standard   of   corporate

disclosure.  For example, draft prospectuses would be allowed

exposure prior to a proposed offer although they may  not  be

registered  finally.  Therefore, investors,  especially  non-institutional investors, need to comprehend the  implications

of  the  posting of such drafts.  My colleague, Mr  Ong  Kian

Min,  has  already  elaborated on  the  preparedness  of  the

investing public at large.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the SF Bill seeks to give legal teeth

to  the  disclosure-based  regime by  making  the  continuous

disclosure  requirement  a  statutory  one.   Sir,  at   this

juncture,  I  would  like  to  raise  the  notion  of   "fair

disclosure"  even though it is not specifically mentioned  in

the  Bill.  I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister  to

comment on the Authority's stand on the extent to which  fair

disclosure would be a feature of this statutory requirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me elaborate. I would like to know how listed

companies  would  be  deemed  to  have  complied  with   this

statutory  requirement.  Would a filing  with  the  Singapore

Exchange, for example through MASNET, be sufficient?  If  so,

the extent of dissemination to investors must be relevant  in

order for the primary objective to be met, hence my reference

to the notion of fair disclosure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the US, compliance with the spirit of Regulation

Fair  Disclosure takes the form of more press releases,  more

Form 8K filings and more webcasts of earning calls.  This  is

accompanied  by greater discomfort for listed companies  when

dealing  with analysts and professional investors and  a  lot

more  care, if not paranoia, in providing earnings  guidance,

if at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fair disclosure is a noble goal as it seeks to

level  the playing field for all investors, small retail  and

large institutions alike.  However, in deciding on how

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2148</b></font><br><br>



compliance will be assessed, I seek the DPM's assurance  that

listed companies in Singapore would not find this onerous and

be  reduced to saying the very minimum, leading to an  "equal

misery" scenario for all investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, market misconduct and insider trading. Sir,

the   shift   from   focusing  on  a  "person-connected"   to

"information-connected" definition is significant  and  takes

cognisance  of  the reality that price-sensitive  information

per  se  drives  trading,  without  necessarily  involving  a

connection with the company.  This enlargement of the net  is

justifiable, but it also imposes greater discipline on  those

in  fiduciary  positions.  Ultimately, without  the  need  to

prove any intent, a balance has to be struck so that it would

not  be  too  onerous for operators, especially non-executive

directors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a related note, the power to be vested in the MAS to

bring  an  action  in  court against perpetrators  of  market

misconduct,  such  as  rigging  and  manipulation,  is   much

welcome,  especially by the retail investors.  Once again,  I

would like to urge the DPM to strike a balance when executing

this    power,    especially   in   terms   of    undertaking

investigations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, public education. Many of these provisions

will  pave  the  way for further development of  our  capital

markets.   However, I would like to urge the  DPM  to  ensure

that sufficient resources are devoted to public education  so

that  the desired end-states are achieved.  For example, many

might  mistakenly  think that draft prospectuses  are  actual

offers  or that participating in a friendly scheme to make  a

killing out of an illiquid stock is being astute.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many changes arising from the reforms over the past few

years  have  made visible improvements to the  operation  and

integrity of our capital markets.  I would like to  seek  the

assurance of the DPM that market participants, especially the

retail, individual investors, would be brought up to speed as

best as we can.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2149</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before I

speak  in support of the Bill, I wish to state at the  outset

that,  as a solicitor, I may have an interest in the  subject

matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before this House is a bold attempt by the

Government  in reforming our legislative framework  to  bring

our capital market in line with the best practices of capital

markets  elsewhere.   This reform is,  indeed,  part  of  our

enduring  effort to make Singapore the financial hub  in  the

region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Bill is in part a consolidation of the various

pieces   of   legislation,  it  has  nonetheless  taken   the

opportunity  to  introduce new changes and  policies.   These

changes take into account, amongst other things, advances  in

technologies  that  allow for new and innovative  methods  of

trading,   convergence   in  the   financial   products   and

instruments   and  the  way  in  which  these  products   and

instruments are sold or delivered by intermediaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill in itself is massive, running into 344 clauses,

many  of which are rather important in the way in which  they

underpin the capital market.  One regret, Sir, is that  there

is  not  enough time between the last sitting and the present

sitting  for  us  to  digest and analyse  the  Bill  and  its

implications.   I  hope that there would be  other  occasions

where,  with the fullness of time, we will be able to  digest

and debate this Bill in a more comprehensive manner.  Be that

as it may, a number of comments and queries came to mind as I

went through the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the issue of overseas trading systems and

exchanges  which  are  targeted at  Singaporeans.   With  the

advent  of  the  Internet, what has become  obvious  is  that

Singaporeans  now  have alternative trading  systems.   These

services  can  provide  trading platforms  that  do  not  fit

traditional descriptions of market trading and dealing.  What

is  critical is that these alternative trading systems can be

cross-border   in   nature.    The   MAS   recognises    that

increasingly, Singaporeans are beginning

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2150</b></font><br><br>



to  trade on overseas exchanges and, as a consequence,  there

is  a  need  to bring this new development into the  fold  of

regulation.   Apart from either approving these exchanges  in

which case, these exchanges would come under the entire gamut

of  laws in Singapore, or exempting these exchanges from  the

application of relevant legislation here, the Bill  seeks  to

provide  for  extra-territorial reach in our  legislation  in

order  to regulate these exchanges that do not operate within

our  jurisdiction.  In this regard, the Bill deals  with  the

situation  by providing that if the act was partly  committed

in  Singapore and partly committed outside Singapore,  or  if

that act, committed outside Singapore, has a substantial  and

reasonably foreseeable effect in Singapore, and if  that  act

is  an  offence if it is committed in Singapore, that  person

who committed the act would be guilty of an offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I appreciate the policy intent behind the

extra-territorial  reach of the Bill, I would  say  that  the

clause  in its present form is weak.  First, the Bill is  not

clear  as  to  the extent, whether partial or  otherwise,  to

which  it  must be committed in Singapore, or the  extent  to

which  it  must  go  before it has a  substantial  effect  in

Singapore.   I  suppose this should be left  to  the  courts,

although  I think it would help if legislation could  provide

some guidance here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Bill is not clear as to who the person

should  be.  For instance, what happens if that person  is  a

company incorporated say, in Vanuatu.  In all probability, it

would  be  a company that would be set up by the operator  if

they are intent on breaking the law here.  The question which

I  have  is:  does the law seek to catch the company  or  the

agents operating behind the veil of these companies, and  how

would you enforce our laws against these people?  This is the

same point raised by my colleague, Mr Leong Horn Kee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose, Sir, the way forward is to strengthen our

international network by getting the cooperation of  as  many

countries  as  possible in our bid to regulate  these  cross-border activities.  The truth of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2151</b></font><br><br>



the  matter  is that the veil of protection that we  seek  to

give  ourselves through legislation is bound to be  punctured

with  holes  as  foreign operators can  operate  almost  with

impunity, notwithstanding provisions in our legislation  that

say  otherwise.  Unless we get the cooperation of  the  other

countries,  I doubt very much if the cross-border  provisions

in the Bill are going to work effectively.  In this regard, I

would  like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether  we  are

negotiating  with other countries and, if so,  how  many,  to

deal  with  these issues, and whether we ought to promote  an

international legal framework to regulate these activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, the question of a single licensing framework for

securities   and  market  intermediaries.   As  proposed,   a

singular  modular framework allows for a range  of  regulated

activities that are better differentiated to accommodate  the

business  needs  of the intermediaries.  Accordingly,  market

intermediaries  would  only  be required  to  hold  a  single

modular licence instead of multiple licences to engage in the

activities  listed in the Second Schedule.  These  activities

set out in the Second Schedule include, for instance, dealing

with  securities, providing custodial services to securities,

engaging  in  the business of advising on corporate  finance,

and  so on and so forth.  What this actually means is that  a

person holding a capital market licence can engage in any  of

these activities provided he is suitably qualified.  For  the

intermediaries  and professionals engaged in  capital  market

services, this is indeed good news as they no longer have  to

chase up different legislation to get the necessary permits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern here, Sir, is one of detail. I would like to

ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether the application process

for  the licence could be made easier for the boutique  firms

or  individuals who intend to provide e-services but who  are

not   in   the  same  league  as  the  banks  and   financial

institutions.  I say this, Sir, because of late,  we  see  in

the  industry,  a fair number of ex-bankers or  employees  of

financial institutions providing services,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2152</b></font><br><br>



particularly  in  the area of corporate  finance.   No  doubt

these  consultants and professionals would  now  have  to  be

regulated under this Bill, I hope that the conditions  to  be

set  up  by  the  Authority would not be  so  onerous  as  to

effectively  prevent them from undertaking this task.   These

consultants  perform  a  very useful  function  by  providing

advice  and services to the SMEs and to clients who  may  not

have  the  wherewithal  to engage the  services  of  merchant

bankers or other financial institutions.  It would be helpful

if  the  Minister could further elaborate on this  issue  and

perhaps provide some assurance to the smaller players in  the

market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, providing a comprehensive rule book of capital

market activities.  I do appreciate the intention on the part

of  the  Government to migrate the fund-raising provision  of

the  Companies  Act into a more comprehensive  rule  book  on

capital  market activities in Singapore.  I have no  comments

on  this  migration,  save for some particulars  of  details.

First  of all, I was hoping that in migrating this provision,

the  Government would take the opportunity to spell  out  the

activities  that  would constitute an offer  to  the  public.

This  phrase  "an  offer to the public" is  indeed,  in  many

cases, key to the question of whether or not a prospectus  is

necessary.   This  is  the  question  which  has  vexed  many

lawyers, with the consequence that some take the view that an

offer  of  securities to five or 10 members of the public  is

not  a  public offer ostensibly because the size is not large

enough.   And in the other extreme, there are some  who  have

taken the view that an offer of securities to even one member

of the public, if that offer was indiscriminately made, would

constitute  a  public offer.  Very often,  a  judgement  call

would  have  to  be  made by the offerer or the  professional

adviser  on whether or not a particular offer, when made,  is

made  to  the public.  Even until recently, the industry  was

not  even  sure  whether  or  not  shares  of  the  employees

constitute an offer to the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may be unfair to place such a responsibility on

offerers and professional

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2153</b></font><br><br>



advisers to make such a judgement call.  I believe our policy

would  be  better  served if legislation can perhaps  provide

clearer  guidelines as to what constitute  an  offer  to  the

public.   At  this moment, Sir, the Bill does not  offer  any

guideline  and  I  would appreciate it if  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister can give us a clarification on this point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 243 sets out broadly the content requirements of

prospectuses.  Clause 243(3)(c) additionally seems to suggest

that the person making the offer of shares or debentures,  if

the   person  controls  the  corporation  whose  shares   and

debentures  underlie  the offer of invitation,  must  provide

information  on  assets,  liabilities,  profits,  losses  and

financial   position   in  respect   of   that   corporation.

Typically,  in  a  prospectus,  information  on  a  group  is

provided on a consolidated basis.  If, as the provision seems

to  suggest, the listing company is now required  to  set  up

details  of  individual companies in the  group,  then  I  am

afraid  that  the  prospectus may  get  rather  unwieldy  and

cumbersome.   This may not serve any better  purpose  than  a

consolidated  group account is now able to  provide  and,  in

this regard, I would be grateful if the Deputy Prime Minister

could also elaborate on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, collective investment schemes. The Securities

and  Futures  Bill seeks to replace the term "interest  other

than shares" with collective investment schemes.  Ostensibly,

the  approach seeks to plug a gap in our present  legislation

which  on the surface does not include investments in  actual

property.  For instance, it seems that investments in ostrich

eggs  are  not  covered  by our current  legislation  because

promoters  of such investments were able to sell  the  actual

commodity or property such as the egg and not the interest in

the  investment itself.  Because it is an investment into the

actual  property, such schemes are not caught by our  current

legislation  and hence it would seem that the new  provisions

in the Securities and Futures Bill would be able to deal with

such  a  lacuna in law.  This, Sir, is a development that  is

most welcomed indeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the Bill in its present form, does not

clarify the ambiguities

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2154</b></font><br><br>



surrounding  listed  unit trusts in the  Singapore  Exchange.

Under its present definition, securities means any unit in  a

collective investment scheme.  However, in the definition  of

the collective investment scheme, it is expressly stated that

the  scheme does not include closed-end funds constituted  in

Singapore.   Such closed-end funds, Sir, are funds  that  are

non-redeemable.   In  the  case  of  unit  trusts,  they  are

normally constituted in a manner which is non-redeemable  and

therefore  are  typically regarded as closed-end.   It  would

appear  therefore that any listed unit trust  constituted  in

Singapore  would  not  be considered a collective  investment

scheme under the Securities and Futures Bill.  A listed  unit

trust  will  not be deemed as a security for the purposes  of

the Bill and if that was so, Sir, I think it would have grave

ramification in relation to the listing of unit trusts in our

Exchange.   This is because, based on the book entry  system,

it does not appear that the provisions in our law relating to

book entry securities apply to listed unit trusts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, section 130G of the Companies Act provides

that  a  transfer of securities by the depository by  way  of

book entry to the depositor under the Act shall be valid  and

shall  not  be challenged in any court of law on  the  ground

that  the  transfer  is  not accompanied  by  an  appropriate

instrument of transfer or that the transfer was not  made  in

writing.   This is a provision, Sir, to deal with  any  doubt

that  may  arise under the Civil Law Act which requires  such

transfers  ordinarily  to  be made  in  writing.   Under  the

Companies  Act, the definition of securities does not  appear

to  include  unit trusts as well.  The implication  of  this,

Sir,  is that unit trusts may not have the benefit of a  book

entry  system of trading.  Accordingly, any transfer arguably

would have to be governed by an instrument in writing and  it

would  appear  therefore,  Sir, if unit  trusts  are  cleared

through  the depository via a book entry system,  it  may  be

open to legal challenge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my concern is shared by some in the industry who

seem to have taken the view that the present legislation does

not cover unit trusts constituted in Singapore under

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2155</b></font><br><br>



the  book entry system.  And indeed in some prospectuses, the

fact  that  the book entry system does not cover unit  trusts

has  been  raised  as a risk factor in the  prospectuses.   I

would   like  to  ask  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister   for   a

clarification in this regard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, facilitating the development of a disclosure-based regime. The present Bill seeks to create a legal

framework  which  seeks to facilitate the  development  of  a

disclosure-based   capital   market   in   Singapore.    This

development  is in line with practices elsewhere,  especially

in  the West which encourages participants in the industry to

disclose  as much information as possible in order  to  allow

investors to make a more informed choice.  In order  to  deal

with this process, the Bill seeks to give legal teeth to  the

disclosure   regime  by  making  obligation  to  disclose   a

statutory  one rather than one that is based on an obligation

to  the  Exchange  pursuant to the rules  under  the  listing

manual.    While  it  is  understandable  why  a  regime   of

disclosure is encouraged in the marketplace, the drawback  is

often  one of uncertainty on the part of the listed  company.

One would expect that under the regime, particularly now that

the disclosure obligation is required by statute, there is  a

likelihood  of anxiety on the part of the listed entities  to

want  to  disclose,  and  disclose  as  much  information  as

possible, in order not to run foul of the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one has to have a certain balance in the whole

regime.   Arguably, it may be said that to require a complete

disclosure of all material information without much  guidance

would be rather onerous on the listed entity itself.  I would

therefore  like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether  the

Authority would help to give better guidance as to  the  type

and  quality of information to be disclosed in order to  help

the listed companies in the process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the above comments, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the

Members who have supported

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2156</b></font><br><br>



the  Bill.  Let me address some of the points which they have

raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Leong Horn Kee has asked about conflict of

interest  in  SGX between MAS' and SGX's role.   This  is  an

issue  which  arose when we first demutualised  SGX  because,

once  it was demutualised and focused more on the bottomline,

this may reduce SGX's commitment and resources to fulfil  its

regulatory responsibilities.  MAS' view overall is that SGX's

interests  are  more aligned than divergent with  the  public

interest as represented by the users of the Exchange, because

to  sustain  its  business  of success,  SGX  needs  a  fair,

transparent  and efficiently regulated market  and  a  market

which  falls into bad reputation is not going to do  SGX  any

good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, to mitigate any potential conflicts arising

from  SGX's self-listing, MAS has assumed the role of listing

authority  for  SGX's own listing, conducts  surveillance  of

trading  in  its shares and has the power to issue directives

to  SGX to resolve any conflict of interest arising from  its

self-listing.  At the same time, MAS has defined more clearly

its  regulatory  relationship with  SGX.   As  the  statutory

regulator,  MAS will administer the corpus of laws regulating

the  capital markets.  It will also have oversight over SGX's

regulatory  functions to assure that SGX  is  performing  its

regulatory  functions competently and responsibly,  and  that

there  are  no gaps in the overall regulatory framework.   It

inspects  SGX.  It carries out regulatory oversight of  SGX's

listing   and   business  rules,  and  it   conducts   market

surveillance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGX retains the front-line responsibility of regulating

the   securities   and  futures  markets   and   its   market

participants,  and ensuring compliance with its  rules.   SGX

has  also appointed a Conflicts Committee to deal with issues

of potential conflicts of interest, with MAS as the approving

authority  for the composition of the Committee.  These  were

issues   which  were  largely  addressed  in  the   Exchanges

(Demutualisation and Merger) Act which was  passed  in  1999,

when SGX was demutualised.  This Act does not change

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2157</b></font><br><br>



the  situation  because we have just imported those  sections

from the Exchanges (Demutualisation and Merger) Act into  the

new SF Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Mr Leong asked about enforcement of extra-territorial jurisdiction, given that the players are

overseas, and Mr Sin Boon Ann also highlighted this  problem.

They are right.  It is not straightforward.  You can pass the

legislation, but to actually have the reach to enforce it and

put  things  right, there will be holes in the  armour.   The

extra-territorial jurisdiction provisions in  clause  339  of

the  Bill will make clear that acts outside Singapore,  which

target   Singapore  investors,  would  be  subject   to   our

regulatory  reach.  Without such a clause, we  may  not  even

have  a  legal  reach against operators of  such  businesses.

Having  created  that legal reach, Part  X  of  the  SF  Bill

relates  to  provisions  relating to  assistance  to  foreign

regulatory  authorities.   Apart  from  this,  MAS  has  also

entered   into   several  memoranda  of  understanding   with

regulators  from  major financial centres.   These  MOUs  and

mutual  assistance  provisions facilitate  the  procuring  of

assistance  from  overseas regulators  and  would  facilitate

enforcement processes.  It is not easy to do but you  need  a

memorandum  of  understanding, and  you  need  a  cooperative

regulator  on  the  other side.  In some cases,  it  will  be

helpful  to  have  a mutual legal assistance  treaty.   [MLAT

negotiations are multi-agency-led, coordinated by  AGC.]   We

passed legislation to enable this a couple of years ago,  and

Singapore  is  in  the  process of negotiating  several  such

mutual  legal assistance treaties, although none of them  are

ready yet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Mr Leong Horn Kee asked about insider trading - how the information-connected approach works, and what

happens to the person-connected criterion, eg, trading during

a  restricted  period [in SGX-ST's Best  Practices  Guide  on

Dealing in Securities] by relatives of a person.  First,  may

I  explain  that whether or not a trade violates the  insider

trading rules does not depend on the restriction period.   It

depends   on  whether  or  not  you  have  sensitive   inside

information at the time of trading.  It can be outside the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2158</b></font><br><br>



restricted  period.   But if you have some  information,  you

know  something is going to happen, you trade on it, you have

violated  the  rule.   And  when we say  it  is  information-connected rather than person-connected, we mean that it  goes

down  the chain  -  I told you, he told the next person,  and

so  on.  It is information-connected.  Whereas under the  old

person-connected rule, you had to have a direct contact.   If

it  went  to  the next person, then we had to establish  that

there was some joint activity amongst those three persons  in

order  to establish that this was an insider trading offence.

So  it is not whether you are a member of the family or  not,

or  whether you are trading within the restricted period.  It

is  to do with whether there was information which was passed

from  the insider to the tippee, and from the tippee  onwards

to another person.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Ong Kian Min asked whether we will be setting

up  a  Securities and Futures Commission.  The answer is  no,

but  we  will be beefing up significantly MAS' department  in

charge of securities and futures.  We have appointed a Deputy

Managing  Director in charge of this.  It is a big  function.

In  countries  like Malaysia or Hong Kong, it is  a  separate

entity.   But in other countries like Britain and now  Japan,

the  trend  is  to  bring together the regulation  under  one

consolidated financial supervisory authority.  In  Singapore,

MAS  has  a  consolidated supervisor.  We have  derived  some

economies of scale and it has worked well for us.  So I think

we  will build up the securities and futures function  within

MAS, but it does need to be built up substantially.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Ong asked whether the benefits of the

disclosure-based regime will be realised in  practice.   This

is  something which we will have to work out.   I  think,  in

principle, we have to move to a disclosure-based regime.  The

old  regime  where the authorities exercise merit supervision

and  guided  what  companies were fit to be listed  and  what

companies really should not be allowed to raise funds because

it is too dangerous, is not an approach which we can sustain.

So we have to go forward and we have to derive

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2159</b></font><br><br>



it.  And if, in the process of working the disclosure regime,

we   run  into  difficulties,  we  have  to  overcome   those

difficulties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the uncertainties which Mr Ong raised was that

when  an exposure copy of a prospectus is posted, there  will

be unreasonable requests for information. This will really be

up  to  MAS  to administer, and MAS will have to be  firm  in

deciding   what  information  is  needed.   It  is   not   an

unprecedented  arrangement.   The  Australians  have  a  very

similar scheme, and it has worked for them.  I think  we  can

make it work for us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the new corporate finance provisions making fund

raising  prohibitively  expensive  for  SMEs,  I  would  say,

firstly,  that  the new provisions apply only  to  offers  of

securities to the public on the stock market.  Many SMEs  are

more  likely  to  raise private equity from  venture  capital

firms,  business angels and family friends.  It  is  not  our

intention to make things onerous for them.  In fact, we  have

a  committee presently led by the private sector  on  company

legislation and regulatory framework, which is studying  ways

to make fund raising easier and less costly for the SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong said that it will cost $1 million in fees in

order  to  do  an IPO for a listing on SGX.    This  probably

includes both professional and underwriting fees. If you  are

making a public offer of unlisted securities, the cost should

be  much  lower.  It should be noted that, in fact,  our  IPO

fees  in Singapore are much lower than IPO fees in many other

countries.   For example, in the US, to list a  company,  the

underwriting  fees  alone will amount  to  7%  of  the  funds

raised.   So  a million dollars is a lot if you are  a  small

company,  but  that  is the expense which is  involved  going

through the processes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep the fund raising cost down, the Bill provides

for certain exemptions from the prospectus requirements.  For

example,  when  securities are being offered to institutional

or  sophisticated investors, a company would not be  required

to prepare a prospectus.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2160</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong also asked about civil actions - what will happen

if  MAS decides to settle a civil action instead of going  to

court?  Our intent when we introduced the civil penalties and

civil remedies for insider trading in the Securities Industry

(Amendment) Act last year, we wanted the civil remedies to be

filed as an independent course of action by investors who had

traded contemporaneously with the defendant.  We have applied

the  same  approach in this Bill.  We have  not  changed  the

approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a civil fine action is initiated by MAS or where

criminal prosecution is commenced against the defendant,  the

civil  proceedings  will  be stayed.   When  a  defendant  is

eventually convicted in a criminal proceeding or found liable

to  pay  a civil penalty in a civil action initiated by  MAS,

clause  236 allows contemporaneous investors to ride  on  the

coat-tail  of  such criminal proceedings  or  of  civil  fine

action.  This is because it would be a waste of resources for

a  court  to  rehear the entire action for the  civil  action

based  on the same set of facts.  So you have to see  clauses

234  and 236 of the Bill in that context.  The civil remedies

have  always  been  intended  to  constitute  an  independent

action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In out-of-court settlements - they occur, they are not

unusual - it is a practice of securities regulators in  other

financial centres.  MAS will exercise any discretion  it  has

to  enter into a settlement judiciously, having regard to all

the  facts  and circumstances of the case and the seriousness

of the transgression.  MAS will have to obtain the consent of

the  Attorney-General, and in exercising its discretion,  MAS

will take into account the impact of that settlement on civil

claims.   But  that  factor in itself,  the possibility  that

there are other civil claims, cannot determine whether or not

an out-of-court settlement is entered.  Civil compensation is

not  barred by an out-of-court settlement with the Authority,

under clause 232(5) of the Bill.  Even where there is an out-of-court settlement, the claimants of civil compensation  are

not worse off than plaintiffs in other types of civil claims.

Because, even if MAS settles out of court,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2161</b></font><br><br>



it  does  not stop other plaintiffs from pursuing  their  own

claims  independently.  Nor are these  plaintiffs  worse  off

than  claimants in situations in which neither  criminal  nor

civil penalty proceedings are commenced.  Under the rules  of

court  which  will  be promulgated under the  Securities  and

Futures Bill, claimants will have available to them discovery

and  interrogatories.  However, we do not think  that  it  is

desirable nor is it practicable to set guidelines as  to  the

types  of cases that the Authority should not settle.   There

are  many  variables that determine whether  or  not  a  case

should  be settled, the potential number of claimants or  the

amounts  involved cannot be used to determine the issue,  and

the  civil claim regime is meant to operate independently  of

anything which anybody else may wish to pursue his claim in a

civil action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is a settlement, MAS may, where it is

appropriate, disclose the fact of the settlement and a  brief

description of the transgression.  However, it would  not  be

in  the public interest for MAS to disclose its investigative

methods, the results of its investigations and the source  of

its  information.  No prosecution or investigative  authority

does  that.   As  a  parallel, criminal  authorities  do  not

disclose  the  evidence that they uncover in  the  course  of

investigations to facilitate civil claims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua talked about the disclosure-based

regime and asked about fair disclosure, and to what extent we

require fair disclosure as part of this regime.  The SF  Bill

requires listed companies to disclose information required by

the  rules  of  the  Exchange on  a  continuous  basis.   The

Exchange  has  a  system in place to ensure prompt  and  wide

dissemination  of  such information to  the  public.   Listed

companies  issue public announcements via MASNet which  is  a

financial  network connecting listed companies,  SGX,  banks,

financial  institutions  as  well  as  news  agencies.   Such

announcements  will  be  uploaded simultaneously  onto  SGX's

website,  which  is  fully accessible to  the  public  at  no

charge.   These arrangements ensure that the public  and  all

market participants have equal and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2162</b></font><br><br>



immediate access to material information disclosed by  listed

companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim also asked about investor education. Investor

education  is  a  collective effort by  all  players  in  the

securities industry.  Local players have been doing their bit

in  recent  years,  eg, Singapore Exchange  organises  public

talks  and  exhibitions  on  share  investments  and  trading

regularly.  There is an Investment Management Association  of

Singapore  that  has  sponsored radio talks  and  contributed

articles  to  the  press on investments in various  financial

products.   The Securities Investors Association of Singapore

has  taken  its investor education programme to neighbourhood

community  centres.   This  is  a  continuing  effort.    MAS

supports   and  encourages  these  initiatives  in   investor

education.   We  will be open to helping out with  co-funding

from  the  financial  sector development  fund  for  specific

projects.   In  addition, MAS will play a coordinating  role,

identifying gaps and filling them where it is necessary.  And

we  will put general investor education materials on our  MAS

website.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shift to disclosure-based regulation makes investor

education  more important, because companies  now  no  longer

require  MAS' approval to launch new investment  products  or

schemes,  provided that basic requirements are  met  and  all

relevant information is disclosed to investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public will be reminded time and again that the

primary  responsibility for making investment decisions  lies

with themselves and, over time, they will be able to learn to

be  able  to  look out for their own interest.  There  is  no

alternative.   We have to shift.  We cannot go on  the  basis

that  the  regulator, or MAS, or the Exchange will make  sure

that every investment is safe and sure to make money.  If you

want to invest, you have to make your own judgement, find out

your own information and make your own decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Sin Boon Ann has raised several points in

his  speech,  many of them have to do with the implementation

and operation of the legislation.  This is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2163</b></font><br><br>



new  piece of legislation, it is complicated.  We have  tried

our  best  to  address all the uncertainties  and  lacuna  by

exposing  it to the industry for public comments,  taking  in

comments and then going several rounds of consultations.   We

think that what we have is workable but it is complicated and

I  would not be surprised that as we operate the scheme  over

the next years, we will find problems or parts which need  to

be  changed  or fixed, and we will come back and  have  those

parts amended by Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to address one point which Mr Sin

raised,  which is the issue of boutique firms or  individuals

who  are  small and who want to become market intermediaries.

It  is  not our intention to make it difficult for ex-bankers

and  employees of financial institutions to start up on their

own  and enter corporate finance or other activities.  So  we

will have a level playing field.  And if they are able to  do

it and if they have the expertise, I think the framework will

enable them to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [BG Lee Hsien Loong].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>FINANCIAL ADVISERS BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>2.03 pm

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br><i>Overview</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Advisers (FA) Bill proposes to regulate

Financial  Advisers and their representatives, and to  repeal

the  Insurance Intermediaries Act (Chapter 142A of  the  2000

Revised  Edition).   It  will govern all  financial  advisory

activities in respect of investment products, and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2164</b></font><br><br>



marketing  of  specific  investment  products,  namely,  life

insurance  policies and collective investment schemes  across

all   financial  institutions,  from  banks,  life  insurance

companies and insurance brokers, to independent advisers.  As

mentioned earlier, corporate finance advisory activities will

be regulated under the Securities and Futures Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current regulatory framework for Financial Advisers

is  contained in various pieces of statutes, depending on the

asset   class  they  advise  on.   These  statutes  are   the

Securities  Industry Act, Futures Trading Act  and  Insurance

Intermediaries Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, product innovation has resulted

in  the  emergence  of  new and complex  products  that  have

blurred  product lines.  Financial institutions do  not  just

offer  "plain-vanilla" instruments these days.  For instance,

insurance  companies offer investment-linked  life  insurance

products  (ILPs),  which are similar to unit  trusts,  except

that they have an insurance element attached to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distribution channels for financial products are also no

longer  confined to traditional boundaries and  institutions.

Investors may now purchase unit trusts from various  sources:

directly  from  fund managers, banks, stockbroking  firms  or

Internet  portals.   Besides  the  traditional  agency  sales

force,  life  insurance  companies are  relying  on  external

parties, such as life insurance brokers and banks, to  market

their  policies.  Financial intermediaries are now  expanding

beyond  traditional  lines of business to provide  "one-stop"

service to meet investors' financial needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present regulatory model of multiple licensing has

its  merits  when financial products are distinct  and  dealt

with  by  different professions.  However, this is no  longer

the  case.   Therefore,  the FA Bill  will  introduce  a  new

integrated regulatory and supervisory framework for Financial

Advisers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Bill will consolidate the current regulatory

regime governing the provision

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2165</b></font><br><br>



of  financial  advisory  services in respect  of  securities,

futures  and  life  insurance products, which  are  currently

contained  in  three different Acts, namely,  the  Securities

Industry  Act (SIA), Futures Trading Act (FTA) and  Insurance

Intermediaries Act (IIA), into a single legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several benefits from consolidating the

legislation regarding the provision of financial advice  into

one  Bill.  Firstly, streamlining the regulation of Financial

Advisers,  allowing a single licence to authorise the  giving

of  advice  on  a wider spectrum of financial products,  will

reduce administrative and compliance costs, as compared  with

holding  multiple licences under the securities, futures  and

insurance laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it will establish a consistent set of

regulatory   requirements  across  the   financial   advisory

industry.    This  will  reduce  the  scope   of   regulatory

arbitrage,  level  the  playing  field  and  facilitate   the

maintenance  of  uniform professional  standards  across  the

board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Bill will create a new class of licensed

financial  advisers.  These professionals  will  be  able  to

provide  investment  advice  on a  wide  array  of  financial

products,   and  also  sell  unit  trusts  and  their   close

substitutes,  such  as investment-linked products.   In  some

cases, these financial advisers will not be connected to  any

product   providers,  such  as  fund  managers  or  insurance

companies,   and  will  act  independently  of  them.    Such

independent  financial advisers will represent the  interests

of  their  clients,  rather than the  interests  of  specific

product providers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial institutions that are already licensed by MAS

and  also  provide similar advisory services, such as  banks,

fund  managers and insurance companies, will be  exempt  from

licensing  under the Bill but will have to observe  the  same

business conduct requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In preparing the Financial Advisers Bill, MAS has

conducted  public  consultation on  an  earlier  draft.   All

comments were

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2166</b></font><br><br>



carefully  considered  and where relevant  were  incorporated

into  the Bill.  I will now highlight some of the key  policy

initiatives the Bill contains.

<br><br><i>A Single Licensing Regime</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FA Bill will introduce a streamlined licensing

regime for persons engaging in financial advisory services on

securities,  futures and life insurance.  Clause  6  provides

that  a person must not act as a financial adviser in respect

of  any financial advisory service unless he is authorised by

a  Financial  Adviser's  licence or is  an  exempt  financial

adviser.   The Financial Adviser's licence will  replace  the

existing   licences  required  under   the   SIA,   FTA   and

registration under the IIA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 requires that any individual who acts on behalf

of  a licensed Financial Adviser be similarly licensed by the

Authority.  As representatives act on behalf of the  licensed

Financial  Advisers  and, in most cases, deal  directly  with

clients,  it is important that these individuals are suitably

qualified and are subject to regulatory requirements and  are

under MAS' supervision.

<br><br><i>Prudential Requirements for Licensed Financial Advisers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Licensed Financial Advisers must meet certain prudential

requirements,  such as minimum paid-up capital and  financial

resources, at all times.  These requirements are necessary in

order  to  establish  the Financial Adviser's  commitment  to

operate  in  Singapore  and to ensure  that  it  possesses  a

minimum  level  of  financial  resources  to  discharge   its

liabilities and obligations as and when they fall  due.   The

capital  requirements will be minimal and will be lower  than

existing   ones.   To  complement  them,  Licensed  Financial

Advisers  will  need  to  procure  a  professional  indemnity

insurance,  as is the practice in other professional  fields.

Clause  10  empowers MAS to take regulatory  actions  in  the

event  of  the  Financial Adviser's  inability  to  meet  the

minimum  financial resource requirements or  its  failure  to

have  in  force  a  professional  indemnity  insurance.   MAS

believes that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2167</b></font><br><br>



a  right  mix  of financial requirements and insurance  cover

will  result in better utilisation of the Licensed  Financial

Adviser's financial resources, without compromising  investor

protection.

<br><br><i>Exemption for Financial Institutions Supervised by the

Authority under Other Acts</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned earlier, financial institutions which are

already  supervised  by  the MAS under  other  Acts  will  be

exempted  from the need for licensing under the  Bill.   This

will  minimise regulatory overlap and reduce compliance costs

for  these institutions, which will be referred to as  Exempt

Financial  Advisers  in  the Bill.   However,  to  level  the

playing  field and to apply uniform standards to  all  market

participants  engaging in the same types of activities,  such

Exempt  Financial Advisers will be required  to  comply  with

similar requirements on market conduct and practices  as  the

Licensed  Financial  Advisers in respect of  their  financial

advisory activities.



<br><br><i>Power to Issue Prohibition Orders</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, MAS has the power to issue an order to

prohibit  undesirable persons from engaging in life insurance

broking  activities  in Singapore.  This  mechanism  is  also

found  in  other  jurisdictions with more developed  markets.

MAS  has found this an effective regulatory tool and proposes

to introduce it in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 59 to 62 of the Bill relate to prohibition

orders.  MAS will have the power to issue an order to  forbid

a  person from providing any or all of the financial advisory

services regulated by the Bill, either permanently or  for  a

specified  period.    MAS may vary or  revoke  a  prohibition

order  either  on the application of the person against  whom

the  order is made, or on its own initiative if the Authority

is  satisfied that it is inappropriate to continue  with  the

prohibition order because of a change in the circumstances on

which the prohibition order was issued.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2168</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Appointment and Removal of officers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CEOs and directors are the key persons of a company. It

is  important that such key appointments are held by  persons

of  integrity  who are fit and proper.  Therefore,  MAS  will

require  Licensed Financial Advisers to seek the  Authority's

prior  approval  for the appointment of these  key  personnel

(under  clause  56).   The  fit and  proper  criterion  is  a

continuing  requirement.  Where MAS is of the view  that  any

officer of the Licensed Financial Adviser does not measure up

to  this benchmark, it may direct the company to remove  such

officer  from his office if the Authority thinks it necessary

in  the public interest or for the protection of investors to

do so (under clause 57).



<br><br><i>Inspection Power of MAS</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On-site inspection of intermediaries is an integral part

of MAS' supervisory framework.  MAS' inspection power will be

provided for under clause 70 of the Bill.



<br><br><i>Appeals to be made to the Minister</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appeals process in the Bill is similar to that in

the Securities and Futures Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I serve as a member

of   the   Executive  Committee  of  the  Financial  Planning

Association of Singapore and while I speak in support of  the

Financial   Advisers  Bill  in  general,   I   hope   certain

refinements  can  be made in the course of implementing  this

Act.   Consultation draft of the Financial Advisers  Act  (or

FAA) has been circulated for some time and some of the points

I  am  raising  now  are not new, but I  think  they  deserve

mention in this debate on the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FA Bill serves to consolidate and streamline the

regulations   found  in  three  separate  Acts  relating   to

provision  of services in respect of securities, futures  and

life insurance products.  While the intention is commendable,

I  feel that in the process of consolidating and in coming up

with  the FA Bill in this present form, we have missed a good

opportunity

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2169</b></font><br><br>



to  upgrade  the  entire industry in the  area  of  financial

planning  and to promote Singapore as a centre of  excellence

in this field.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, by virtue of its origin, the FA Bill is

product oriented.  It regulates financial advisory activities

in  respect  of  a  range  of investment  products,  and  the

distribution  and  marketing of life insurance  policies  and

unit trusts.  Any person presently permitted to carry on  his

activity  under  the  Securities Industry  Act,  the  Futures

Trading Act or the Insurance Intermediaries Act will be  able

to automatically migrate over to be a licensee under the FAA.

So,  I  presume an insurance agency presently operating under

the  Insurance Act will automatically qualify to be  licensed

as  a  financial  adviser under the  FAA,  and  each  of  its

insurance  agents  can  be  now  called  "financial   adviser

representative"  simply  based on his present  qualifications

without having to undergo any additional examinations of  his

skills  and competency.  If this is not the case,  then  many

people  presently  working  in  the  insurance  industry  and

financial  industry will not be able to carry  on  what  they

have  been  doing  once the FA Bill comes into  force.   This

would be a cause of concern as they will add to the number of

retrenched  and unemployed.  I would like to ask DPM  whether

the  passing of this Bill into law will result in any  person

presently engaged as an insurance agent, financial analyst or

investment  adviser  representative  to  be  disqualified  or

prohibited from doing what he has been doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, Sir, if everyone in the industry will be

migrated over and covered under the term "financial adviser",

then this generic term "financial adviser" can potentially be

extremely confusing to the public.  This, I find, is the  big

weakness of this Bill.  Now, when someone approaches you  and

represents   to   you   that  he  is  a   financial   adviser

representative   licensed  by  the  MAS,  what   skills   and

qualifications would you expect him to have?   What  kind  of

advice would you think he is competent to give?   I think  it

is   reasonable   to   assume  that   a   financial   adviser

representative licensed by the MAS is competent to  give  you

advice

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2170</b></font><br><br>



regarding  your  financial matters.  But, lo and  behold,  he

merely wants to sell you an insurance policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a big difference between someone who can

analyse your financial needs and someone who is knowledgeable

only  about  a  particular product.  It is analogous  to  the

relationship  existing between doctors and pharmacists.   One

would  go  to a doctor for diagnosis of what sickness  he  is

suffering  from.   The doctor does the tests,  diagnoses  the

illness  and prescribes the medicine to take.  One  does  not

expect  the  pharmacist  to  do  all  that  even  though  the

pharmacist  may  be  very  knowledgeable  about  the  medical

products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the general public make a distinction between a

financial planner and a financial adviser?  I believe  it  is

hard  to change public perception once it is associated  with

the  usage of a certain term; it is easier to change the term

to one that is in-line with the public's perception of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask DPM to consider changing

the  term  "financial adviser" as used in the  FA  Bill.   To

avoid  confusion,  the words "financial adviser",  "financial

consultant",  "financial planner", or words  to  the  effect,

should  be  reserved  for someone who  is  able  to  properly

discover  and analyse the financial needs of his  client  and

render  more  comprehensive financial planning  advice  in  a

holistic manner customised to the client's needs.  Could  DPM

consider whether other terms, such as "insurance adviser" and

"unit trust adviser", that are more descriptive of the skills

set,  could be adopted for other specialists in the  area  of

insurance and unit trust respectively?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An alternative would be to split the licence for

"financial  adviser" into distinct categories,  like  perhaps

Cat 1, Cat 2 and Cat 3, to denote specialty in the respective

regulated   financial   advisory  services   and   investment

products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The danger of putting everyone into a single licence is

that   people  tend  to  just  strive  to  meet  the  minimum

requirements - enough to be qualified as a "financial

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2171</b></font><br><br>



adviser  representative", enough to sell their  products  and

earn  the  commission,  and will not  endeavour  to  progress

further  to  upgrade  their skills  and  gain  competency  in

financial  planning.   In  legal  practice,  we  are  "Senior

Counsel".  For financial advisers, I would like to ask DPM to

consider  having  another category of licensee  who  will  be

required  to have a higher level of competency and skills  to

which the entire profession can strive towards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose that we push the FA Bill to go a

little  further  and  differentiate  financial  advisory  and

planning  activities  from  the mere  selling  of  investment

products.   In addition to consolidating existing regulations

touching  on the selling of insurance and financial products,

we  should go one step further with this piece of legislation

to  cover new areas of financial planning so as to bring  the

entire   industry  to  a  higher  level  of  competence   and

excellence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Financial

Advisers Bill answers the need for a legal framework for both

the  burgeoning range of investment products and distribution

channels,  and the convergence of various financial products.

I support the establishment of this framework which will help

ensure,  amongst other things, the integrity of our financial

markets in general.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to however briefly raise two issues,

one  of  which  will arise as a result of a single  licensing

concept  and  the  other which concerns  the  possibility  of

unwitting discouragement of entrepreneurial efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, increasing competition. Whilst it makes

perfect sense to adopt a consistent approach to the licensing

of persons engaging in financial advisory activities, we must

be  mindful  of  the implications of such a convergence.   As

alluded  to,  opportunities to advise on  a  wider  range  of

financial products will increase, as will, on the flip  side,

competition.  Sir, this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2172</b></font><br><br>



could  precipitate  a falling out of the  less  sophisticated

advisers  who  have only very narrow and specific  expertise.

For  example, remisiers who are adept at broking  stocks  can

now   extend  such  expertise  into,  say,  investment-linked

insurance  policies,  which have hitherto  been  marketed  by

insurance  agents.   As such, product specialists  could  now

face  even more competition.  I would therefore like  to  ask

the  Deputy  Prime  Minister if he envisages  this  to  be  a

significant dislocation and, if so, whether assistance can be

rendered   to   help   interested   persons   develop   other

capabilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, capital requirements for independent financial

advisers.  Sir, in a market where most services are typically

offered  on  a proprietary or an agency basis, the  need  for

independent  financial  advice  will  be  felt  increasingly.

Whilst  our  market  does not appear  to  support  such  paid

services at the moment, it is felt that the Government  could

help  facilitate  the  sustainability of any  entrepreneurial

efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current consolidation within the financial sector

may  well  inspire some experienced professionals to consider

providing independent advice, say, on financial planning.  If

capital  and  licensing requirements  are  too  stringent  or

prohibitive,  then fledgling efforts would  not  survive.   I

would  like  to  ask  the Deputy Prime Minister  to  consider

further  measures to help nurture such a group  of  advisers,

which,  I  believe, is performing a very useful role  in  the

USA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in response to Mr

Ong  Kian Min about upgrading the entire industry, the  types

of  services  provided  by financial  planners  vary  widely.

Sometimes, it assesses every aspect of the client's financial

profile  -  savings, investment, insurance, tax,  retirement,

estate  planning - and help them to develop detailed strategy

to meet the objectives.  Others may call themselves financial

planners  but may only provide advice on a limited  range  of

products  and services.  MAS currently regulates all  aspects

of financial planning

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2173</b></font><br><br>



relating  to  securities, futures and  insurance.   But  tax,

retirement and estate planning activities will not come under

MAS'  regulatory ambit, and this is going to  continue  under

the  Financial Advisers Act.  Hence, only financial  planners

who  conduct  activities regulated  under  the  FAA  need  be

licensed as a financial adviser and only in respect of  those

regulated  activities.   The financial  planner  may  conduct

other  activities, such as retirement and tax  planning,  but

this  will not be subject to MAS' supervision.  This is  very

much   in  line  with  the  regulatory  framework  in   other

jurisdictions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS will engage the industry bodies representing

financial  planners, where appropriate, and seek their  views

on regulatory issues affecting the financial advisory market.

As  a  regulator,  MAS will facilitate and encourage  healthy

market development and work with industry bodies to encourage

improved  professional standards to promote  Singapore  as  a

centre of excellence in this field.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Mr Ong asked about retrenchment and unemployment

on  the  part  of  insurance agents, financial  analysts  and

people like that, as a result of this Bill.  I would like  to

allay  this  concern because existing professionals  will  be

able to engage in the existing activities that they have been

authorised  to  do  when the Bill is enacted.   However,  one

major   objective  of  introducing  this  Financial   Adviser

regulatory  regime is to provide an integrated and consistent

regulatory  framework for market intermediaries  engaging  in

similar  activities  across  a broad  spectrum  of  different

investment  products.  This would facilitate the setting  and

maintenance of consistent professional standards and business

conduct rules for the provision of financial advice.   As  we

introduce  progressively new standards to raise the standards

of  professionalism and knowledge, existing players will also

be  expected to meet these new standards.  And we are already

doing  it in insurance, for example, with the recommendations

of the Committee on Efficient Distribution on Life Insurance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the question of different categories of licences,

I think this would defeat

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2174</b></font><br><br>



the objective of having a single licensing regime.  The whole

idea  of  the  business  conduct  requirements  is  that  all

individuals should have the necessary professional competence

and  standards before they can operate as representatives  of

financial  advisers.   While  MAS  could  prescribe   minimum

standards  which  financial advisers' representatives  should

possess  by  setting  examinations and continual  educational

requirements,  ultimately  it is the  responsibility  of  the

financial  advisers to ensure that they upgrade their  skills

to  provide value-added services to their clients.  Financial

advisers  who do not strive to upgrade their skills  and  who

are  content with meeting only basic requirements can  expect

to lose clients to more competent advisers who provide better

and higher quality services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not keen to control many words, "financial

adviser",  "financial  consultant", "financial  planner",  or

words to that effect.  I think what we will do is to restrict

the use of the term "financial adviser", one name, to holders

of  a financial adviser's licence and exempted entities.   We

are mindful that there are some market participants currently

holding  themselves out as financial advisers.   However,  we

believe  that restriction on the usage of the term "financial

adviser"  will  better enable investors to  identify  whether

they  are receiving financial advice from an entity which  is

licensed  by  MAS, as opposed to an entity not  regulated  by

MAS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not intend to restrict the use of other titles,

like  "financial planner", "financial consultant", and  such.

However, the investing public should be aware that people who

use  such titles may or may not be regulated by MAS depending

on  the  services  that they offer.  Financial  advisers  are

permitted   to   provide   advice  on  investment   products,

distribute  unit trusts and arrange life insurance  policies.

Financial advisers can choose which of these activities  they

wish   to  engage  in  for  which  there  will  be  different

requirements  that must be met, such as passing  of  relevant

competency examinations.  It is not the intention of the Bill

to license only

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2175</b></font><br><br>



the  class of professionals providing comprehensive financial

planning advice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for splitting the licence into distinct categories 1,

2  and  3,  one  objective of the Bill is to respond  to  the

industry  trend of product convergence and the  emergence  of

distribution  channels which cross-sell investment  products.

I think if we introduce different sub-categories of licences,

we are likely to confuse the public.  We propose to deal with

the  problem by requiring advisers to disclose what  products

they  are qualified or authorised to provide financial advice

on before they deal with the investing public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim expressed concern about competition and whether

there will be significant dislocation and, if so, whether  we

can help intermediaries who will be affected.  The impact  of

globalisation  and  convergence  of  financial  products  and

services  have  affected all financial services  sector  even

before  the  introduction of this Bill.  The  life  insurance

industry,  as  I  told you, has subjected  itself  to  higher

standards  following the recommendations by the Committee  on

Efficient  Distribution of Life Insurance earlier this  year.

These  recommendations are being implemented and will  result

in  improved knowledge, skills and efficiency of the  agents.

Life insurance agents will also benefit from a wider range of

products  for distribution with the introduction  of  the  FA

Bill.    There   will   be  more  competition   and   perhaps

dislocation.   There  will  also be  more  opportunities,  as

intermediaries  can broaden their activities if  they  master

their skills.  So, I do not expect significant dislocation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for nurturing a group of independent financial

advisers, indeed the introduction of this Bill will  help  to

foster  the  development  of independent  financial  advisers

which,  I  hope,  will provide greater  depth  to  the  local

industry,  alongside  the existing  players  in  the  market.

These  IFA  firms  are  likely to be owned  and  operated  by

experienced professionals.  In licensing such IFA firms,  MAS

will take into consideration the financial resources of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2176</b></font><br><br>



company   as  well  as  the  qualifications,  integrity   and

experience of the key officers.  The capital requirements for

a corporation applying for a Financial Adviser's licence will

not  be onerous and will be lower than existing requirements.

These new capital requirements for financial advisers do  not

mean  that MAS is relaxing its prudential standards;  rather,

it  is  another example of MAS' shift away from the one-size-fits-all regulatory approach to a more risk-based supervisory

regime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [BG Lee Hsien Loong].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>INSURANCE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>2.32 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments introduced in the Insurance (Amendment)

Bill are necessary because of the following reasons:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, with the introduction of the Financial Advisers

Bill,  which  DPM has just moved the Second Reading  in  this

House,  this  will  result  in the repeal  of  the  Insurance

Intermediaries Act.  As a result, we need to migrate some  of

the  provisions  of the Intermediaries Act to  the  Insurance

Act.  These provisions are those that relate to all insurance

agents,   non-life  insurance  brokers  and  all  reinsurance

brokers,  which  will  henceforth  be  regulated  under   the

Insurance Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is to ensure that prudential standards are

kept  current  and  appropriate  while,  at  the  same  time,

providing  a conducive environment for growth and competition

in the insurance industry.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2177</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, it is to update the Insurance Act in line with

the provisions in the other financial regulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first deal with the migration of the

Intermediaries Act provisions, in clause 20 of the Bill.  The

provisions,  inserted as Part IIB of the Act, will  generally

remain  the same.  However, MAS has taken the opportunity  to

make  some changes for alignment with the Financial  Advisers

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These changes are:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Financial institutions acting as insurance agents

will  be  required  to  have  written  agreements  with   the

insurers,  to set out clearly the rights and responsibilities

between these parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Financial institutions acting as insurance agents or

insurance brokers will be subject to the same market  conduct

rules    and    standards   applicable   to   all   insurance

intermediaries.  This is to align with the Financial Advisers

Act and to ensure a level playing field.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Insurance agents will no longer be allowed to retain

the  interest  earned from the moneys held in  the  insurance

brokers' premium accounts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Insurance brokers will no longer be allowed to grant

unsecured  loans  or  advances to their directors,  and  such

unsecured loans to their employees will be capped at $3,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. MAS will be empowered to direct the removal of the

CEOs  or  directors of an insurance broker, if these  persons

fail  to  perform their duties and functions.   MAS  will  be

permitted to create a register of these key personnel removed

from office, as well as of other persons prohibited under the

Act from becoming intermediaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. MAS' powers to prohibit or to direct any removal of

key  personnel, will be subject to a right of hearing as well

as to a right of appeal to the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the other amendments which are not

consequential to the Financial Advisers Bill.  For prudential

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2178</b></font><br><br>



industry   development  reasons,  we  have   introduced   the

following amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, removing the exemption for credit insurers.

Clause  2 of the Bill removes the current statutory exemption

from  registration  granted to an insurer that  is  primarily

engaged in export credit business.  With the removal of  this

exemption,  all  credit  insurers  will  be  required  to  be

registered  under the Insurance Act, and be subject  to  MAS'

supervision.   These insurers will have to  comply  with  all

prudential  regulations, such as minimum paid-up capital  and

solvency margin requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, facilitating players like Lloyds to operate

here.   Clause 19 of the Bill inserts a new part of the  Act,

Part  IIA,  to provide for the creation of schemes that  will

allow  a  defined  group,  class or  association  of  foreign

insurers to be established in Singapore under the Scheme,  to

underwrite  insurance business.  Players such  as  Lloyds  of

London,  which  is essentially an insurance marketplace  with

insurance  capacity  provided by members  who  are  organised

annually  into syndicates, will then be permitted to  set  up

such a scheme here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the insertion of Part IIA, section 34 will be

repealed and the current arrangements for Lloyds will be  re-created  as a Scheme under Part IIA, to be called the Lloyds'

Scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS would like Lloyds to go beyond the current

arrangements and, in fact, establish a physical  presence  in

Singapore.  To permit this physical establishment,  a  second

Scheme,  called the Lloyds Asia Scheme, will be  set  up  and

Service Companies representing the underwriting syndicates of

Lloyds  will operate under this Scheme.  The added  insurance

capacity  from  these  syndicates  in  Singapore,   and   the

expertise  to  be brought in with the Service Companies  will

enhance our market as a regional insurance centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, appointment of actuaries. This is covered in

clause  22  of  the  Bill.   The appointed  Actuary  of  life

insurers currently certifies the financial condition  of  the

life insurer annually.  Non-life

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2179</b></font><br><br>



insurers   and   reinsurers  are  not  subject   to   similar

requirements at the moment.  This amendment will require non-life    insurers   and   reinsurers   to   obtain   actuarial

certification  of  their insurance liabilities  annually,  to

ensure  that the reserves maintained are sufficient  to  meet

all  ultimate  liabilities.   These changes  are  made  after

consultation with the non-life insurance industry, and MAS is

working closely with industry representatives on the detailed

requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, improving regulatory supervision. Clause 27

inserts a new Part IIIA to provide for the mutual exchange of

assistance  between regulators of different countries.   With

the growing internationalization of insurers and cross-border

financial  services,  cooperation  and  information  exchange

between  regulators of different jurisdictions  is  an  added

advantage  to achieve efficient supervision.  The  amendments

will   provide   a   framework   for   such   agreements   or

understandings  to be given due effect, while ensuring  that,

in the process, persons affected are given the due process of

law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the final set of amendments which

updates  the Insurance Act and brings the provisions in  line

with the other financial regulations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28 of the Bill inserts new Part IIIB, providing

for  the  procedures to handle appeals to  the  Minister.   A

right of hearing is currently provided, in both the Insurance

Act and the Intermediaries Act, when the Authority intends to

cancel an insurer's or a broker's registration.  At the  same

time,  an  appeal  to  the High Court is provided  against  a

decision  of  the  Authority in relation to approval  of  key

personnel.   To streamline existing provisions, it  has  been

decided  that  a  right of hearing, plus an  appeal  process,

should  be  made available in relation to the exercise  of  a

discretionary power by MAS, in respect of:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Cancellation of registration;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The removal of key personnel; and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2180</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Prohibition from carrying on business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the appeal process more efficient, the amendment

will provide for the appeals to be made to the Minister,  who

shall  convene an appropriate Advisory Committee of  relevant

but  independent appointees, to hear the appeal,  and  advise

the Minister accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to clause 33, section 55 of the Act will be

amended to allow the MAS to compound offences to carry a fine

only as a penalty.  The power to compound will be limited  to

situations  where the offender has admitted the offence,  and

has  agreed,  in  writing, to have the fine compounded.   The

amendment  will reduce the administrative cost  of  enforcing

the  Act in circumstances where the offender has admitted the

offence and agreed to pay the fine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties imposed under the Act will also be

increased  to achieve a more appropriate level of  deterrence

today.   At  the same time, the maximum fine for corporations

will  be  set  at twice that for individuals, as corporations

have more financial resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I refer to clause 35 of the Bill, which gives

our Courts jurisdiction to adjudicate on acts that take place

extra-territorially.  The increased use of the  Internet  for

sale   and  distribution  of  financial  products,  including

insurance,  has resulted in a situation where it is  possible

for  a  person outside Singapore to target sales at consumers

in Singapore.  These acts, carried on externally, may have an

effect in Singapore and could harm consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other clauses of the Bill that I have not elaborated on

are  minor  technical  amendments to clarify  or  expand  the

existing provisions, or to remove obsolete provisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Insurance

(Amendment) Bill is introduced mainly because of  changes  to

the other Bills, ie, the SF Bill and the FA Bill,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2181</b></font><br><br>



which  have just been passed by this House.  There  are  also

other  measures on improving and updating the  regulation  of

the insurance industry, and these new rules are also welcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to express my support for the Bill.

However,  I  would  like  to ask the Minister  the  following

questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, cost impact on the insurance industry. I would

like to ask the Minister whether the Bill will have an impact

on the operating and training costs to the insurance industry

arising  from  the several new requirements to  upgrade  this

industry.   For example, the Bill requires non-life insurance

companies   to  obtain  actuarial  certification   of   their

insurance  liabilities.   This is to  ensure  that  insurance

companies  have  appropriate reserves to  meet  all  ultimate

liabilities.  Would this requirement add to their costs?   As

the  intention  is to continuously upgrade the knowledge  and

expertise  of insurance agents and brokers, would the  higher

operating costs also add to the companies' operating burden?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, secondly, under the division of the various

functions  between  the  new legislation  where  direct  life

insurance  brokers will be governed under the  new  FA  Bill,

could  insurance companies also participate in the  financial

advisory and planning business?  If they could, would they be

governed by the Financial Advisers Act as well?  And how does

MAS ensure that insurance companies and their agents have the

necessary  competency to give financial  planning  advice  to

their clients?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on interest income from insurance broking premium

account,  under  the  new Bill, the MAS will  prescribe  that

interest earned from insurance broking premium account should

be  distributed to insurers.  Previously, the interest can be

retained   by  the  insurance  brokers.   This  has   enabled

insurance   brokers  to  quote  lower  and  more  competitive

insurance  premiums.   I  wonder  why  the  MAS  has  decided

unilaterally  to dictate that interest earned should  now  be

distributed to the insurers, instead of being retained by the

insurance brokers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2182</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the register of prohibited persons, I understand that

the  MAS will keep a register of prohibited persons who would

be debarred from participation in the insurance business.   I

am  concerned about easy accessibility of the public to  this

register,  as  that could be subject to abuse or  undesirable

usage,  since  it is available for public inspection.   Could

the  Minister allay the public's fear on how the handling  of

the register would not be subject to abuse?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on the impact on the insurance industry of risk

exposure  caused  by terrorist attacks.  Sir,  on  a  general

issue  relating to the insurance industry which could  be  of

public interest, I would like to ask the Minister whether the

recent  terrorist attacks on the World Trade  Centre  in  New

York  have  affected our insurance industry.  Are  our  local

insurance  companies  affected  and  exposed  to   the   huge

potential  insurance claims arising from  this  incident?   I

wonder  whether risks against terrorist attacks are insurable

and,  if so, how would our local insurance industry deal with

this  matter  and  could  it give rise  to  higher  insurance

premiums payable in the event of potential claims for damages

caused by acts of terrorists.  Of course, Sir, we do not hope

that there will be a terrorist attack in Singapore, but it is

an area which we should look into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

thank  Mr  Leong Horn Kee for supporting the Bill.   I  would

like  to respond to his questions.  First, on the cost impact

on  the insurance industry, let me assure the House that  one

of  the objectives of putting this amendment in place  is  to

make   the  insurance  industry  more  competitive  and  cost

implication is one of the considerations high in  our  minds.

At   the   same  time,  we  do  need  to  enhance  prudential

regulations.   So the example that Mr Leong  posed,  ie,  the

requirement   to   have   actuarial  certification   of   the

liabilities,  we  consider  this  to  be  a  very   important

prudential  requirement.   It should  not  add  to  the  cost

significantly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the operation of the Financial Advisers Act

and the Insurance

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2183</b></font><br><br>



Act, the whole idea is to align the two Acts together so that

the  requirements for the different intermediaries  operating

under  these two Acts would be the same, and the requirements

would  not  be onerous.  A life insurance broker, who  has  a

permit  under the Financial Advisers Act, would not face  the

additional requirements because both Acts have been aligned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the question on interest income from premium

accounts.  If you look at it logically, when somebody buys an

insurance policy and pays a premium, that premium is actually

due to the insurer and should not be kept by the broker.  But

the current rules allow the broker to hold the premium during

the  transition period, and in fact, keep the interest income

from the premium during this transition period.  This is  not

desirable because then it incentivises the broker to hold  on

to the premium for a much longer time and enjoy the interest.

I  think  the  changes  that we put into  this  Bill  are  to

regularise this, so that when somebody pays a premium  for  a

policy,  that  premium  should go  to  the  insurer  and  the

interest that comes from the premium should go to the insurer

as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also raised the point about the register of

prohibited  persons.  I would like to assure the  House  that

although  we  allow access to this register,  this  would  be

restricted.   It would not be open to public  scrutiny.   The

way we would operate it is that anybody who intends to employ

somebody, whether as a director, an employee or as a  broker,

can  come  to  MAS  and query whether  such  a  person  is  a

prohibited  person.  Therefore, the register is not  intended

for  public scrutiny, but it is for somebody to check whether

that person has been under prohibition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong also asked about the impact on the insurance

industry  arising  from the terrorist attacks  on  the  World

Trade  Centre.   MAS is monitoring the impact.   Our  initial

assessment is that Singapore-based insurers do not  have  any

known  direct  exposure  to  the  losses  arising  from   the

terrorist attacks.  Singapore-based

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2184</b></font><br><br>



reinsurers  have minimal exposure to US risks as their  major

markets  are  in  the Asia Pacific region.   So,  our  direct

impact is minimal.  The main impact would be indirect.  First

of  all, weaknesses experienced by parent offices and foreign

reinsurers  may give rise to negative spill-over  effects  on

local  operations.   Secondly,  as  Singapore  insurers  rely

heavily  on  reinsurance support, they may be affected  by  a

reduction   or   even  cancellation  of  reinsurance   cover,

restricted  coverages and higher premium charges.   Mr  Leong

pointed  out  that  because of the risk from  such  terrorist

attacks, the premium for reinsurance is likely to go up.  And

this is one of the indirect consequences that Singapore would

have to face.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS is also paying close attention to the claim

situation and solvency position of local insurance companies.

While  there  has  been  no  immediate  concern  about  their

liability risk, we are closely monitoring the asset  position

of  insurance companies, including life insurance, given  the

decline of the equities markets and the other assets markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

<div align="center"><b>CONTRACTS (RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read  a  Second

time".

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2185</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is essentially a law reform measure,

what  I would call lawyer's law.  It is to reform the law  by

making  provision  for  enforcement of contractual  terms  by

third parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of background, let me say that, at present, under

the general principle of law, a person who is not a party  to

a  contract has no legal right to enforce the contract,  even

if the contracting parties intended the contract to confer  a

benefit on him.  This principle is known as the "third  party

rule".  For example, under the third party rule, a person who

bought  a house on the resale market will have no contractual

recourse  against the housing developer for  defects  in  the

house even though the developer had contractually agreed with

the  original  purchaser to confer a  benefit  on  subsequent

purchasers.   This  is because, unlike a  person  who  bought

direct  from  the developer, the resale buyer has  no  direct

contractual   relationship  with  the   developer.    Another

instance is where a couple is getting married, and a relative

goes  to  a  shop  where a wedding list is  kept,  buys  them

whatever  gift,  a  dining table or sofa set,  as  a  wedding

present  and arranges to have it delivered directly to  them.

It  is made clear in the discussions with the shop that holds

the  list that the item is a gift for the couple.  Under  the

third  party  rule,  the couple would not have  any  recourse

against  the  shop,  because they were  not  parties  to  the

contract.  Any action against the shop for breach of contract

would  have  to be taken by the relative who was one  of  the

original contracting parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We inherited this third party rule from England and it

forms  part  of  the  law of contract.  The  United  Kingdom,

however,   itself   has  modified  the  third   party   rule.

Therefore,  the  Law  Reform and  Revision  Division  of  the

Attorney-General's Chambers reviewed the third party rule  in

Singapore  and  has recommended this amending law  which  the

Government agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this reform, Singapore's law will then be in line

with  developments in other advanced economies of the  world,

including  the leading international financial centres,  such

as New York and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2186</b></font><br><br>



London.   The  "third party rule" has already been  abrogated

throughout much of the common law world; in countries such as

the  United States, New Zealand, parts of Australia and, most

recently,  in  the UK.  Most member states  of  the  European

Union  also  recognise and enforce the rights of third  party

beneficiaries under contracts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this reform is clearly needed as it enables

carrying  out the intention of contracting parties to  confer

benefits  on  third  parties.  The third party  rule,  as  it

stands,  causes  injustice  to a third  party  who  may  have

reasonable  expectations about his rights under the  contract

and, for example, may have arranged his affairs accordingly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third party rule has led to many ad hoc statutory

and  common  law  exceptions to circumvent  the  inconvenient

effects  of  the  third  party rule.   It  has  also  led  to

complicated legal documentation and consequently higher legal

costs.  In the example I gave earlier, to overcome the effect

of the third party rule, additional legal documentation, such

as  an assignment of rights, a collateral warranty or a  deed

of  indemnity, would have to be effected.  All these and  the

resulting  litigation  cause  legal  uncertainty  and  it  is

commercially not convenient.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This law reform Bill will facilitate business and

contractual  practice by providing a simple  method  to  give

third  parties rights to enforce a contract.  It will  bring,

in  my  view,  certainty to the law and help to  lower  legal

costs incurred by business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may now turn to the provisions of the Bill, the

provisions   are  essentially  modelled  after   the   United

Kingdom's Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act, which came

into   force  in  November  1999.   It  provides  a  detailed

legislative scheme spelling out when a third party will  have

the  right  to  enforce a contract and how  a  third  party's

rights can be exercised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill provides that a third party would

have the right to enforce a term of a contract in one of  two

situations:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2187</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, where the contract says so expressly; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, where the term purports to confer a benefit on

the  third  party unless, on a proper interpretation  of  the

contract,  the contracting parties did not intend  the  third

party to have the right to enforce it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2, paragraph (3), provides that the third party

must  be expressly identified in the contract by name,  class

or  description.  However, there is no requirement  that  the

third party should be in existence when the contract is made.

This  allows  contracting parties,  for  example,  to  confer

enforceable rights on an unborn child or a future spouse or a

company that has not yet been incorporated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides that the parties to a contract lose

their  right  to vary the contract without the consent  of  a

third party beneficiary if:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the third party has communicated his assent of

the term to the promisor; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the third party has relied on the term, and

the promisor is either aware of the third party's reliance on

it;  or can reasonably be expected to have foreseen that  the

third party would rely on the term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 provides that any defence which the promisor

can  use against a claim by the other contracting party  will

also be usable against a claim by a third party.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 preserves the right of the contracting parties

to  sue  each  other  on  the contract,  notwithstanding  the

existence of third party rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 protects the promisor from double liability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 sets out a list of subject matter to which the

Bill will not apply.  The list includes:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contracts of employment;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;negotiable instruments;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2188</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contracts for carriage of goods by sea covered by the

Bills of Lading Act;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contracts for carriage of goods by air covered by the

Carriage by Air Act;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contracts for international carriage of goods by land

which are covered by such international conventions as may be

prescribed by the Minister; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contracts formed among a company and members of a

company  as  a  result  of  the memorandum  and  articles  of

associations of the company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, contracts of employment are excluded so that

employees who breach their duties to their employers will not

be exposed to law suits from their employers' customers.  The

customer's  remedy  should be against the employer,  not  the

employee.   The  other categories are excluded because  these

are  areas  of  laws where clear and established  rules  have

already  emerged concerning the rights of third  parties  and

the limitation to such rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards commencement, let me say that the Bill will

come  into  operation in two stages.  During  the  first  six

months of its operation, the new law will apply to a contract

only  if the parties expressly opt into the new regime.  This

will  change to an opt-out regime after six months.  The six-month  phasing-in period will ensure that parties who are  in

the midst of negotiating contracts are not taken unawares  by

the  new law.  It will also allow time for publicity  on  the

new  law to reach various sectors, the legal profession,  the

business  community and the public.  In the meantime,  having

an  opt-in  regime  during the first six  months  will  allow

contracting parties who wish to take advantage of the new law

to do so immediately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, let me say that in the drafting of

this  Bill,  feedback  from  various  agencies  such  as  the

Ministry of Trade and Industry, Ministry of Finance, the  Law

Society  as well as leading academics and practitioners  were

sought.  Parties consulted were generally supportive  of  the

Bill,   and   felt  that  the  change  was  a  positive   and

commercially progressive one.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2189</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  with your leave, may I firstly say that it is an honour

and  a  privilege for me to be chosen to serve as a Nominated

Member of Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise in support of the Contracts (Rights of Third

Parties)  Bill.  This Bill is to be welcomed as  it  protects

third parties in certain instances, as the Hon. Minister  has

indicated,  even  though there may not be what  is  known  as

privity  of contract (or agreement) between the parties,  ie,

the parties were not originally parties to the agreement.  On

a proper construction, may I just clarify that I take it that

this Bill covers both written contracts and oral, or what  is

known  as  verbal contracts, so that that point is  clarified

and  members  of  the  public would be fully  aware  that  it

applies to all contracts, and not just to written contracts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than that, Sir, I think the provisions in this

Bill  are  to be welcomed, as indicated by the Minister.   It

would  save, in many ways, legal costs and also documentation

that   might  be  required  if  third  parties  are  involved

subsequently, in terms of assignments of contractual  rights.

I  take  it  that in this situation, it is only the  benefits

that  are  passed on, and not the burdens of a contract  that

applies to the original parties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sense, although there are, as indicated, other

jurisdictions that have this particular kind of law, would it

be   proper   for  me  to  suggest  also,  for  purposes   of

parliamentarians to consider some of the Bills  as  presented

to  Parliament, that there would be access to information and

material that are prepared by various Ministries to  be  made

available  also to those parliamentarians who are  interested

in  having access to them, except perhaps on sensitive pieces

of  legislation where sensitive information is made available

to the Minister or to the Minister of State, for instance, on

Defence matters perhaps.  If so, parliamentarians would  have

access to this research that is probably thoroughly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2190</b></font><br><br>



done  by  Permanent Secretaries from various  Ministries  and

legal  officers and senior officers of the relevant Ministry.

And  if that is so, it will give a more positive approach  to

us parliamentarians also doing research and contributing in a

better fashion in Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I do support this Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise to speak in support of this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of some business and consumer transactions

can be quite complicated involving several parties.  Some  of

these  transactions involve significant amounts of money  and

long-term  warranties on the product.  It  is  fair  that  we

grant  protection to third parties in a transaction, and  not

just to the original parties who signed the contract.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this while, promisors have been shielded by the rule

of  privity  of  contracts when the issue  involves  a  third

party.   For example, property developers have been  shielded

by  this  rule  from  resale property  buyers.   And  certain

household appliance suppliers have been shielded by this rule

from  third  party  consumers.  In  the  interest  of  making

business  and  consumer transactions fairer, it is  therefore

appropriate  that  we enact this Bill.  In  the  interest  of

bringing  our  law to be in line with developments  in  other

advanced  economies  and  leading financial  centres,  it  is

appropriate that we enact this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are two clarifications that I would like

the  Minister  to respond.   The Minister has  clarified  the

rationale  for allowing a time lag in applying the  Bill,  as

stated  in  clause 1(2).  The Bill applies to contracts  made

more than six months after the commencement of the Bill, with

the  exception  of contracts made within six  months  of  the

commencement  of the Bill, which expressly provides  for  the

application of the Bill.  However, if we agree to  the  merit

of  this  Bill,  I  would  have  thought  that  it  would  be

preferable to apply it straightaway, rather than wait for six

months for it to take effect.  I also would have thought that

it would be more confusing to have a provision to allow, by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2191</b></font><br><br>



exception,   contracts  made  within  six   months   of   the

commencement  of the Bill to grant third party  rights  where

the  term  of contract provides for the Bill to apply.   Does

this  mean  that during the six-month period, the law  grants

certain  people who have knowledge of it the right  of  third

parties and disadvantaging others?  May I seek the Minister's

further clarification on this point, please?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, secondly, under clause 2(2) of the Bill, third

party rights shall not apply if, on a proper construction  of

the  contract, it appears that the parties did not intend the

term  to  be  enforceable by third party.  This clause  gives

some  flexibility for the promisor and promisee not to confer

third party rights.  I believe that this proviso may be valid

under  certain circumstances.  But it can be a  loophole  for

the  promisor  to  include as a fine print in  the  contract,

especially  if the promisee is ignorant of the  relevance  of

third  party  rights.  Hence, I would like  the  Minister  to

consider  whether third party rights can be enforced  at  all

times  for  some  transactions,  making  it  irrelevant   for

contracts  to  expressly state otherwise.  These transactions

that  will  grant  compulsory third party  rights  should  be

contracts  involving substantial value, such as property  and

cars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis for my suggestion is that, too often,

consumers  are  ignorant of what is in  the  agreement.   For

example,  for  most  first-hand property buyers,  their  main

concern would be the location, the value, the finishing,  and

so  on.   Whether the contract conferred the right  to  third

party  or  not  is likely to be of a much lesser  concern  to

them.  It may not be something that they would pay particular

attention  to.  After all, a typical agreement  for  consumer

transaction,  such  as  property and cars,  is  usually  very

lengthy  and couched in terms that would test one's  patience

in  trying to understand it fully.  It is possible for  these

property buyers to miss the fine print in the agreement  that

expressly takes away third party rights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I suggest that for transactions involving a

substantial amount, we should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2192</b></font><br><br>



protect  consumers who are ignorant of third party rights  by

making third party rights compulsory.  My concern is that  no

matter  how  we  try  to educate the public  on  third  party

rights, there will still be some who may not be aware of  it.

The  law  should  still  seek to protect  those  unsuspecting

consumers  from promisors who delete the third  party  rights

from  the contract, especially if the transaction involves  a

substantial amount of money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these two clarifications which I would like the

Minister to respond to us, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I thank Mr Chandra Mohan and Mr Noris

Ong  for  their support of the Bill and I will  turn  to  the

comments that they have made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a general point was made by Mr Chandra Mohan as

to  whether parliamentarians could have access to information

or  materials which the relevant Ministries may have, on  the

basis  of  which  Bills and amendments are proposed  in  this

House.  Let me say that it has always been the approach of my

Cabinet colleagues and myself that where Members request  for

such information, we will be happy to consider it.  But it is

best  that  specific  requests  be  made  according  to   the

particular  issue  that  is  before  the  House  because  the

Ministry may have a whole array of files and papers  and  the

Member concerned may be interested in one particular part  of

the Bill.  And if he can tailor the request accordingly, I am

sure   the  Ministry  will  be  happy  to  oblige.   In  this

particular case, the basic materials and research  were  done

by  the  Law  Reform and Revision Division of  the  Attorney-General's  Chambers and they produced most of  the  essential

research  work.  And if the Member is interested, I  will  be

happy to furnish him with a copy of that report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised one substantive point and that is to seek

clarification whether the Bill only covers written  contracts

or  would  it  also cover oral contracts.  To that,  I  would

respond  by saying that the Bill does not distinguish between

oral   contracts  and  written  contracts,  and   by   normal

interpretation of the word "contract", it would also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2193</b></font><br><br>



include oral contracts, granted that some of the requirements

in  the  Bill  may  be  more easily fulfilled  by  a  written

contract than an oral contract.  But I should think  that  it

is  not impossible for an oral contract to meet them.  And if

an oral contract were to meet the requirements, then the Bill

would  apply.  Indeed, Sir, examples which were given in  the

report  of the United Kingdom Law Reform Commission indicated

that even there, the Law Commission envisaged application  of

the  new  law  to  oral  contract and examples  included  the

purchase of wedding gifts in a department store.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Noris Ong has raised at least two points to which I

should  respond.   First,  the  six-month  period.   Let   me

clarify, Sir, first, that the six-month period does not  mean

that  parties who wish to benefit would actually have to wait

for  six  months.  I hope my Second Reading  speech  made  it

clear that it really provides for a two-stage process for the

new  law  to  come  into operation.  During the  initial  six

months,  parties  who  wish  to  benefit  from  the  new  law

immediately  can  expressly opt into the  new  law  and  take

advantage of it.  This phasing-in period actually is to allow

time for lawyers and the public to be educated about the  new

law so that there will be less risk of confusion once the new

law comes completely into force after the phasing-in period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add also that the United Kingdom also adopted

this  six-month phasing-in period, and I am not aware of  any

negative consequences or effects from that approach.  In  any

case,  it occurs to me that even if we did not have the  six-month  period written into the Bill, I think we  would  still

have  to  provide for sufficient time before the commencement

of  the Bill for the lawyers and other sectors of society  to

familiarise themselves with the new law.  If we  did  not  so

provide,  I think there will be some inconvenience.   Lawyers

who are ready to take advantage of this new law, for example,

in  preparing  corporate finance instruments, would  then  be

forced to wait.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point concerns Mr Noris Ong's comment that

this rule ought to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2194</b></font><br><br>



made  obligatory or mandatory for certain types of  important

contracts,  like  purchase  of  property  and  cars.   It  is

important for me to stress and clarify that this Bill is  not

intended  to be a consumer protection measure.   That  is  an

important point.  Although I can see that some, including  Mr

Noris  Ong,  may  see  the benefits for some  consumers,  the

purport  of  this  law is not a consumer protection  measure.

The  purpose  is  not  to  impose liabilities  on  businesses

against their wishes.  What then is the purpose?  The purpose

is really to meet the needs of parties who contractually wish

to confer rights on third parties but find it inconvenient or

not possible to do so under the existing law.  So the new law

is  to  give  them a convenient way or method to achieve  the

objectives  of  conferring rights to third parties.   If  the

contracting party has no intention to confer rights on  third

parties,  then  we  would  not want to  force  an  unintended

consequence on unwilling parties.  In other words, the  basic

principle  is  to  give  effect  to  the  intention  of   the

contracting parties.  And that principle of giving effect  to

the  intention of contracting parties is a cardinal principle

in  the law of contract.  So, it would be difficult for me to

accept  the  proposal of Mr Noris Ong because it  would  mean

departing  from that cardinal principle.  It also means  that

the  legislation will interfere with the parties' freedom  to

contract.   I  hope  my  explanations  have  clarified  these

points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

<div align="center"><b>LEGAL PROFESSION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>3.42 pm

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read  a  Second

time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill amends the Legal Profession Act to

improve  and  fine-tune the operation of the Act  in  several

respects.   These  include the disciplinary  proceedings  for

lawyers, the qualifications for practice of law in Singapore,

and  the  general operation of the Law Society of  Singapore.

The   amendments   have   been  finalised   after   extensive

consultation with the Chief Justice, the Attorney-General and

the Law Society of Singapore.

<br><br><i>Disciplinary Proceedings</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will first deal with the disciplinary proceedings for

lawyers.   The first amendment creates a new machinery  known

as the Review Committee.  Section 85 of the main Act requires

all complaints against lawyers to be made to the Law Society.

The  Council or the Society is to forward every complaint  to

the  Chairman of the Inquiry Panel for him to form an Inquiry

Committee to look into the complaint.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 1986, the Council could only refer to the

Chairman  of  the Inquiry Panel those complaints relating  to

the  conduct  of a lawyer in his professional capacity.   The

Council  therefore weeded out those complaints which did  not

relate to a lawyer's professional conduct.  In 1986, the  Act

was  amended to allow any complaints relating to any  conduct

of  a  lawyer, not just conduct in his professional capacity.

This was because, sometimes, misconduct by a lawyer, even  in

his  private capacity, may be sufficient to render him  unfit

to continue being a member of the honourable profession.  The

Council  thereafter acted on the assumption that they  should

continue  to  play  a sifting role in the  post-1986  regime.

However, the Court of Appeal ruled earlier this year that the

Council should not be performing such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2196</b></font><br><br>



a  sifting function, but should simply forward all complaints

to be dealt with by the Inquiry Committees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not practical and has resulted in some

difficulties.   The  Law  Society  receives  more  than   100

complaints  a  year.   More than half  of  them  are  without

substance  and  are  sifted out by  the  Council,  while  the

remainder  goes to an Inquiry Committee for a  full  inquiry.

If  the  Council is not to sift, the caseload on the  Inquiry

Committees will more than double.  Each Inquiry Committee  is

made  up  of  two lawyers of at least 12 years'  standing,  a

Legal  Service  Officer of at least 10 years'  experience  as

well  as  a lay person.  Doubling the caseload of the Inquiry

Committees  will create a serious strain on scarce  resources

and  slow  down  the disciplinary process.  Therefore  a  new

machinery known as the Review Committee will be set up to act

as a sifting mechanism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Review Committee will have two members. One will

be  a  lawyer of at least 12 years' standing.  The other will

be  a  Legal Officer of at least 10 years' experience.  Under

the new arrangement, the Council will forward every complaint

to  the  Chairman  of the Inquiry Panel who  will  convene  a

Review  Committee.  The Review Committee will have two  weeks

to  decide  whether  there  is sufficient  substance  in  the

complaint to warrant an inquiry by an Inquiry Committee.  The

Review Committee does not have a blank cheque to dismiss  any

case.  Its mandate is limited.  It can only dismiss a case if

both  members  of the Committee agree that the  complaint  is

frivolous,  vexatious, misconceived or lacking in  substance.

If  either one of the Committee members feels that  there  is

some substance to the complaint, the case must proceed to  an

Inquiry  Committee.  This new arrangement seeks to  carefully

balance  the  need to have an efficient disciplinary  process

and the need to ensure that every complaint is looked into as

thoroughly as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, clause 16 removes the cap on the number of lawyers

and  lay persons which can be appointed to the Inquiry Panel.

This is the panel from which members of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2197</b></font><br><br>



the  Inquiry  Committees and the Disciplinary Committees  are

chosen.  Currently, there is a maximum of 40 lawyers  and  40

lay  persons.   Experience has shown  that  this  number  can

sometimes  be  insufficient.  To ensure that the disciplinary

system  retains sufficient flexibility to deal with  changing

caseload  in a timely manner, it is proposed that  the  Chief

Justice  be given the flexibility to appoint as many  lawyers

and lay persons to the Inquiry Panel as may be necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, section 90 of the Act says that the Chairman

of a Disciplinary Committee is to be appointed from a pool of

not  more than five senior lawyers.  This means that  we  can

only    have   five   Disciplinary   Committees   functioning

concurrently  at any one time.  Clause 19 removes  this  cap,

for the same reasons of flexibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21, Sir, amends section 93 of the Act to allow a

Disciplinary Committee to recommend that a lawyer be  ordered

to  pay  a  monetary penalty.  This is really to  correct  an

anomaly in the current process.  At present, after an Inquiry

Committee makes a report to the Council, the Council can make

one  of  four recommendations - (1) to send the matter  to  a

Disciplinary  Committee  for  a  formal  investigation,   (2)

dismiss  the  complaint,  (3) dispose  of  the  complaint  by

reprimanding  the lawyer, or (4) dispose of the complaint  by

ordering the lawyer to pay a monetary penalty.  That  is  the

Inquiry  Committee stage.  But at the end of the Disciplinary

Committee  process,  the  Council  can  only  (1)   make   an

application to the court to strike off or suspend the lawyer,

(2) dismiss the complaint, or (3) dispose of the complaint by

reprimanding  the  lawyer.  The option  of  monetary  penalty

which  is  available at the Inquiry Committee  stage  is  now

being made available at the Disciplinary Committee stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a related amendment, Sir, all penalties which lawyers

are ordered by the Council to pay as a result of disciplinary

proceedings go to the Consolidated Fund.  The Law Society has

recently  asked  the Government to allow the Law  Society  to

retain  the penalties paid by lawyers, in order that the  Law

Society can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2198</b></font><br><br>



use  these  moneys for worthy causes, such as  promoting  law

awareness,  providing  legal aid or  assistance.   They  have

pointed   out  that  other  professional  bodies,   such   as

accountants,  architects and engineers are similarly  allowed

to  retain  the penalties paid by their members  pursuant  to

disciplinary proceedings.  The Government has considered this

and  agreed  to  the request, and clause 23 therefore  amends

section 95 for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, amendments have also been made to provide for more

transparency to the disciplinary process.  Clause  21  amends

section  93  to  require  the findings  of  all  Disciplinary

Committees  to  be  published either  in  the  Singapore  Law

Gazette  or  in such other medium as would adequately  inform

the  public  of  the findings of the Committees.   Clause  18

amends   section  88  to  require  the  publication  in   the

Government Gazette of all orders by the Council to  a  lawyer

to  pay  penalty.   Currently, only orders to  pay  penalties

exceeding  $1,000  have  to be published  in  the  Government

Gazette.



<br><br><i>Legal Education</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to some amendments concerning the Board of

Legal Education and the qualifications for practising law  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 amends section 5 to allow the Board of Legal

Education to make rules requiring pupils to keep dining terms

before  they  can  be admitted to the Bar.   The  keeping  of

dining  terms will provide an additional avenue for imparting

the  values  and  tradition of the legal  profession  through

social  interaction with senior members of the Bar and  also,

through interaction, to pick up relevant social skills needed

for a successful legal practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 amends section 7 to widen the Board's

discretion  to  recognise as qualified persons  lawyers  who,

although not graduates from universities recognised  for  the

purposes  of  admission  to the Singapore  Bar,  nevertheless

possess  such qualifications or expertise as would contribute

to, promote or enhance the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2199</b></font><br><br>



quality  of  legal services in Singapore or the economic  and

technological development of Singapore.  This amendment is to

give  effect  to a recommendation of the Second Committee  on

Supply  of Lawyers that we should empower the Board to  admit

persons  who  possess  such  skills  and  expertise  as   the

Singapore legal profession needs.  The Second Committee  felt

that  the  current  wording of section 7  was  overly  tight,

resulting in only a small handful qualifying under it in  the

last five years.  While the new section 7 will allow more  to

qualify, I wish to stress, Sir, that this is not meant to  be

used  as  a backdoor to enter the Singapore legal profession.

The  Board  will be vigilant in ensuring that the quality  of

entrants to the legal profession is at the high standard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with the widened discretion in section 7, the

Second  Committee  on  Supply  of  Lawyers  also  recommended

allowing  the  Board  wider powers to  grant  exemption  from

pupillage.  Currently, the Board can only grant exemption for

up  to  three months' pupillage.  The wider exemption  powers

will  allow the Board to better take into account the varying

levels  of  experience of persons seeking  admission  to  the

Singapore Bar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these increased roles being given to the Board, two

amendments  touching on the administration of the  Board  are

also  being  proposed.  First, clause 4 amends section  8  to

make the President of the Law Society an ex-officio member of

the  Board of Legal Education.  The Attorney-General and  the

Dean of the Law Faculty, NUS, are already ex-officio members.

Sir,  the President of the Law Society has also traditionally

always been appointed to the Board.  Putting it into law that

the  President is an ex-officio member would signify a formal

recognition  of the important role played by the Law  Society

in  its  work of the Board.  Second, section 5 is amended  to

increase  the  Board's powers to invest its funds,  including

allowing  the  Board  to lend money to law  firms  to  pursue

projects which the Board finds worthy of its support.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2200</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Limited Purpose Practising Certificates</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next group of amendments, Sir, deals with special

categories of persons who can be issued with limited  purpose

practising  certificates notwithstanding that  they  are  not

actually practising law as a member of a law firm.  Clause  7

amends section 26 of the Act to allow the Attorney-General to

issue  limited  purpose practising certificates  to  a  legal

officer  of a foreign government to appear in our  courts  to

represent their governments on certain matters.  Sir, let  me

explain  that this amendment is mainly meant for  cases  like

extradition  cases and proceedings for taking of evidence  in

our  courts  under  the schemes for mutual legal  assistance.

Allowing legal officers of foreign governments to participate

directly in appropriate cases can indeed speed up proceedings

and free up our prosecutors to handle other work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 26 is also amended to enable law lecturers from

NUS  and  other institutions of higher learning in  Singapore

(who  are  advocates and solicitors) to appear in  court,  if

they  have a certificate from the Attorney-General  for  this

purpose.  This amendment, Sir, is intended mainly to cater to

cases  where  the  law  lecturer has  been  instructed  by  a

practising  lawyer, or where the law lecturer is  invited  by

the  court  to  assist on a particular issue.  The  Attorney-General's certificate will only be issued to those  who  have

been  employed as a member of the academic staff by  the  law

department of any institution of higher learning in Singapore

for  at  least  three continuous years (unless the  Attorney-General shortens the period).  Sir, this proposal would allow

the law lecturers to enhance their skills which in turn would

benefit their students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For consistency, section 34(h) of the Act, which

presently  applies only to a law lecturer of the Law  Faculty

of  the NUS, is amended by clause 10 of the Bill to extend to

all  law  lecturers  of institutions of  higher  learning  in

Singapore.   This  would  enable them  to  render  any  legal

opinion  or  act  in an advisory capacity.   Again,  this  is

intended  to  be  limited to only matters in  which  the  law

lecturer has been instructed by an advocate and solicitor.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2201</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Amendments Concerning Law Society's Operations</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final group of amendments consists mainly of

housekeeping amendments to improve the administration of  the

Law  Society.  Clause 15 amends section 51 to make  provision

for electronic voting in Council elections, to exempt the Law

Society  members who are overseas from having to comply  with

the compulsory voting requirements.  Clause 13 amends section

48  to  allow  the  Council to co-opt more members  into  the

Council.    The  Law  Society  requested  this  because  many

lawyers  are willing and prepared to volunteer their time  to

help  out with the work of the Council but they are unwilling

to  campaign  for  election  into  the  Council.   Clause  12

provides  for  the Law Society to take in as non-practitioner

members   foreign  lawyers  working  in  offshore  firms   in

Singapore.  Clause 28 allows the Law Society to intervene  in

a  lawyer's  practice in two additional instances to  protect

the  public.  These two instances are where  the  Council  is

satisfied  that a sole solicitor has abandoned his  practice,

and  where  the  Council is satisfied  that  a  solicitor  is

practising without a practising certificate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise  to speak in support of this Bill.   This  Bill

provides  for  several important changes to the  conduct  and

regulation  of  the legal profession.  The legal  profession,

together  with  other  professions  in  Singapore,  is  going

through  a  period of necessary change, both in  the  way  it

works  and in the way it seeks to upgrade itself to meet  the

challenges of the so-called New Economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer, first, to clause 3 that seeks to broaden the

discretion  of  the  Board to certify  persons  who  are  not

qualified   persons   to  be  so,  if  they   possess   "such

qualification or expertise as would contribute to, promote or

enhance  the  quality of legal services in Singapore  or  the

economic or technological development of Singapore".  This is

wider in at least two

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2202</b></font><br><br>



respects from the original provision which requires the Board

to  act  only  in  exceptional cases and where  the  person's

qualification or expertise would enhance the quality of legal

services.   Under  the new provision, once an  applicant  can

contribute  to the quality of legal services or  economic  or

technological development of Singapore, he can be  certified.

This is really open-ended and there may be difficulty for the

Board  to exercise this discretion in a focused way.  It  may

open  the  door for judicial review of the Board's decisions.

I  should  also like to ask the Minister what is intended  in

this  broader  provision and what type of legal professionals

would therefore be expected to gain entry through this route?

My  concern  is  that such persons may be  admitted  to  fill

certain  needs of the time but, subsequently, may not  be  so

useful.  Would these individuals still be welcomed to general

practice   in  Singapore?   After  admitting  them   to   the

profession, it may not be so easy to tell them to leave.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to turn to clause 7, which

contains  disqualifications for practising certificates.   In

the  new provision, it is envisaged that the Attorney-General

can,   through  his  certificate,  allow  certain  types   of

solicitors, such as those working in the university, to get a

practising  certificate.   I  would  just  like  to  ask  the

Minister  to confirm that this is the new procedure that  the

Attorney-General's certificate is required for solicitors who

are  working for statutory bodies or for universities  before

they  can  apply for a practising certificate.  If so,  could

the    Minister   explain   why   there   is   a   need   for

disqualifications?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I welcome the new complaints provisions set out

in the Bill and, especially, in clause 17.  In particular,  I

note  that  the Council is obliged to inform the  complainant

and  the advocate concerned if the complaint is dismissed  as

frivolous,  vexatious, misconceived or lacking in  substance.

This  is certainly most welcome.  Anecdotal evidence  in  the

past  suggests that complainants do not really know  why  the

complaints are dismissed without further action.  However,  I

would like to ask the Minister whether some

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2203</b></font><br><br>



more  public-friendly mechanism can be found to inform  those

who   wish  to  complain  about  legal  services.   Is  there

sufficient  information given to those who wish to  complain?

Can  the complaints mechanism be made simpler for the public?

Many  Members in this House must have come across cases where

a   member  of  the  public  informs  them  of  some  alleged

mishandling  of  legal  matters  and  professes  a  lack   of

knowledge  as to what to do.  The other problem is that  they

fear the lawyers and do not expect a satisfactory outcome  in

most  cases.  I hope the Minister can look into ways  on  how

members  of  the  public  can be  informed  of  their  rights

concerning  allegations  of mishandling  of  cases  by  their

solicitors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the above comments, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chandra Mohan K Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chandra Mohan Nair:</b> Sir, I rise to support this

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the amendment to section 5 regarding the

Board  of  Legal Education's powers to invest its monies,  my

comment  is:  what  is the effect of this  amendment  on  the

finances  of the Board of Legal Education?  These  are  trust

monies,  and  the  persons in charge  should  be  careful  in

venturing  into perhaps speculative forms of investment.   It

may  be  prudent  to  remain conservative and  obtain  modest

returns instead of being too active in wanting to get  higher

returns.  The Trustees Act must be observed by the custodians

of funds belonging to the Board of Legal Education.  No doubt

there are responsible persons in charge of these matters, but

it  would be prudent to be careful.  I would suggest that the

experiences  of  other similar organisations,  including  the

Singapore  Academy of Law - and the Board of Legal  Education

is, in a way, part and parcel of the Singapore Academy of Law

- the Law Society of Singapore and other professional groups,

such  as  those  of  accountants, doctors and  engineers,  be

studied   closely   before  embarking  on   any   speculative

investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Board of Legal Education is part of the Academy

of Law, I would also

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2204</b></font><br><br>



suggest  that  the members of the Singapore Academy  of  Law,

which   include  both  practitioners,  legal  officers,   the

judiciary and the Law Faculty members, be consulted  as  they

are  the  equivalent  of  shareholders,  and  the  Board   of

Directors  should  give the members a chance  to  give  their

inputs on this matter.  And it may be a point to note to  see

whether even the Academy of Law should have an annual general

meeting  where  these matters could be reviewed  by  all  the

members of the Academy of Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a provision which provides for the Board

of  Legal Education to be allowed to invest in other business

or   professional  bodies.   Perhaps,  there  could  be  some

clarification  of  the ambit within which  we  would  include

business or professional bodies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the provisions regarding dining terms, Sir,

this  is  an  English  concept that  we  have.   I  hope,  in

introducing the concept of dining terms, that it will be done

professionally  so that the young graduates do  benefit  from

it,  and the senior members of the Bar, the judiciary and the

legal  fraternity would participate so that it will  come  to

fruition where there would be dissemination of experiences of

senior  members  and the professional standards  as  a  whole

would  be increased.  The ethical standards could be  imbibed

into  younger  members through the concept of  dining  terms,

provided it is done properly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Prof Chin has indicated, in new section 7, there is

the  removal of the term "exceptional cases", and there seems

to  be a more liberal approach even to allowing non-qualified

persons  to  be  qualified persons because, under  the  Legal

Profession Act, the term "qualified persons" is defined,  and

I  would think that, through these amendments, it is given  a

wider  scope now.  And what exactly would it mean by "or  the

economic or technological developments of Singapore"?   In  a

way,  it is progressive but, as indicated, it could have some

negative  effect, if there are too many of them coming  in  a

little too easily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would welcome the amendments in section 48 where there

is provision for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2205</b></font><br><br>



co-option of new members into the Council of the Law Society.

This is a welcome provision because, as indicated, there  may

be some persons who may not be willing to stand for elections

but  who are capable and can contribute to the Council of the

Law  Society,  including lady members.  Now we have  a  legal

profession  where women make up at least half its membership,

and  they  could  be of much benefit to the efficacy  of  the

running of the Law Society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sections 93, 94 and 97, the further amendments

empowering the disciplinary committee and courts with greater

powers  and  a variety of punishments are also welcome  where

there  is  more  discretion given to these bodies  to  impose

punishment instead of having stricter rules before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also welcome the monies that are paid in the

form  of  penalty  to be used by the Law Society  for  public

service, eg, criminal legal aid and law awareness, instead of

passing  it on to the Consolidated Fund.  That is  a  welcome

sign.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am  deeply obliged to you for allowing me this opportunity

to  speak.  I rise to support the Bill and, before I do that,

I  would  like to declare that I am a Member of  the  Nanyang

Technological  University's Law  Department  in  the  Nanyang

Business  School.  But the topic I raise will  not  have  any

effect on me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, firstly, I would like to mention that I support the

Bill  because, as the Minister has said, where clauses 7  and

10 are concerned, these are amendments to allow law lecturers

to  enhance  their skills.  In the past, the Legal Profession

Act only allowed the law lecturers from the Faculty of Law to

have  these privileges.  I would like to applaud the Minister

for  extending  this  now to law lecturers  in  all  the  law

departments  of the other institutes of higher  learning  and

other   law   departments  of  the  National  University   of

Singapore.  This is because I have always believed  that  law

lecturers, whoever they may be, wherever they may be, should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2206</b></font><br><br>



have  practical experience.  They should stay in  touch  with

business  realities,  and  what  they  teach  ought  to  have

relevance to the students.  Therefore, these opportunities to

appear  before the courts and to give legal opinions  without

breaching any provision of the Legal Profession Act are  much

to be welcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see this also as a fulfilment of the Minister's

promise, in response to what Prof. Walter Woon said  in  this

House  in  1996, when the Minister introduced, for the  first

time,  amendments  in  sections  75C  and  75D.   These   new

amendments  recognise the fact that, since 1996,  there  have

been  many  law  departments filled and  there  are  now  new

universities which have staff who are every bit as  good,  if

not  better  than, the staff from the National University  of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I want to ask the Minister to consider if

there  could  be further amendments on the lines  of  section

75D.   I  know  Prof. Walter Woon mentioned these  points  in

1996, but let me assure the Minister I am not retreading  the

same ground.  Prof. Woon wanted to see that sections 75C  and

75D  be  extended  to law lecturers who have  no  experience,

perhaps  very  young  and inexperienced  law  lecturers.   My

purpose,  Sir, is to urge the Minister, perhaps in  the  next

amendment  of  the  Legal Profession Act,  to  consider  this

point,  that there is in section 75D this entitlement  to  be

called a "consultant", to practise as a consultant.  When the

Minister  introduced this section in 1996,  he  mentioned  in

this House that it was important - this was in relation to  a

request from the Law Society, and maybe Mr Chandra Mohan  was

there  then - and it was a request that we should  not  allow

just  any  person to hang up a signplate that says  he  is  a

consultant.   And  I agree that anyone who  calls  himself  a

consultant has to have the experience and the expertise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise to the notice of this House and to

the  Minister that with the universities we have now, eg,  in

the  Singapore Management University, our foremost expert  on

contract in Singapore and Malaysia, Dr Andrew Pang, is there.

Under section 75D, as it stands currently

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2207</b></font><br><br>



and  there is no amendment today in this House, it would mean

that the years that he spends in SMU are useless to him.   He

cannot  count those years towards being called a  consultant.

There  are  others:  Dr Low Kee Yang, who  is  an  expert  in

guarantees,  also  in  SMU; in NTU itself,  we  have  several

doctorates   in   law  who  are  experts  in  Internet   law,

intellectual property rights and e-commerce;  in the National

University of Singapore, outside the Law Faculty,  there  are

experts on land law.  I say these are experts, not because  I

say  so,  Sir,  but  these  are  recognised  experts  in  the

profession  because they have been asked to write volumes  in

the  Singapore  edition of the Halsbury's Laws of  Singapore,

and  they  are also well-known authors of different books  on

different areas of law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if these experts - and I believe they should be

qualified persons also, with more than 10 years' experience - if  the  Minister feels that should be so, I think these  are

experts that we ought to recognise.  And if they want  to  go

out  and  hang up a signplate that says they are consultants,

we  should  not  stop them from doing so.  Otherwise,  it  is

rather anomalous.  We allow them to appear before the courts,

we  allow them to advise lawyers, but, for a lesser privilege

such as a title, we say no to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this would be relevant, Sir, when, for example,

one  day, after many years of teaching, they decide  to  come

out,  but  they do not want to be a partner and,  of  course,

they are too senior to be a legal assistant in a law firm.  I

think  these  are  times when they would want  to  be  called

consultants.   There are also serving staff of the  different

universities  who  would want to take up  a  full  practising

certificate  because  they are qualified  persons  and  their

employers  allow  them  to do so, but because  they  are  too

senior  to  be legal assistants and they do not  want  to  be

employees of any law firm in Singapore, it would not be right

for  them  to  take up a practising certificate  as  a  legal

assistant or even as a partner.  So, this is when,  again,  a

title like "consultant" would be useful to them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2208</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, it is also anomalous that after 10-15 years as

a  law  lecturer  in the Law Faculty you  can  come  out  and

practise as a law consultant but nobody else can do  so  even

though  he  may be an expert, say, Dr Andrew Pang.   I  think

this  is  a reasonable request to make.  I hope the  Minister

would  consider  this.   As I have  said,  I  would  like  to

reiterate that these points are not relevant to me because  I

hold  a  practising certificate and by the time my practising

certificate  expires, I have the number of  years  needed  in

practice to be called a consultant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Members who

have  spoken in support of the Bill and I would touch on  the

points that they have raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin asked about the broader wordings for section

7,  whether  it would pose some difficulties and wanted  some

idea  on  what  sort of legal professionals we expect  to  be

making  an  entry  through  this  route.   Let  me  say  that

previously, the applicant must be an exceptional one in  that

his  qualifications and expertise must be such that it  would

enhance  the quality of legal service in Singapore.   Out  of

the  many  applications we received under section 7 over  the

past  six years, the Board could only grant approval for four

cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new wordings will provide the Board with a little

bit  more  flexibility  because it  emphasises  more  on  the

economic contribution that an applicant can make to Singapore

in such areas of economic activities where there is presently

a lack of expertise both qualitatively as well as in numbers.

It  would allow the Board to take into consideration  whether

the  expertise or experience of the applicant is required  or

desirable   for  Singapore  generally.   This   would   allow

successful applicants to contribute to an emerging  range  of

new  economic activities in which there is insufficient legal

expertise.  As Prof. Chin has said and Mr Chandra Mohan  also

commented,  the world of legal practice is changing  rapidly.

And   for  Singapore,  the  legal  service  is  an  important

supporting pillar for our effort

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2209</b></font><br><br>



to  maintain  our competitiveness.  This means not  just  the

traditional  role of a lawyer, as understood by most  laymen,

it  means  getting into the cutting edge where  there  is  an

interplay  between intellectual properties, genetics,  patent

law  and  so  forth,  where you need  to  have  some  experts

knowledgeable   about  the  law  and,  at  the   same   time,

knowledgeable about other areas.  For example, a law graduate

with   multiple   skills  and  experiences  may   apply   for

certification under this provision.  Another example would be

an  IP  lawyer  with science or engineering  background.   So

really, it does not mean that by this amendment, we are going

to  have  a deluge of applications.  It is that the  previous

criterion was very rigid for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also say that the amendment does not mean that

the  Board has to approve every case.  The Board is given the

discretion,  and  I  am  sure  that  it  would  exercise  its

discretion judiciously.  I think it has to be very  selective

in  its use of powers under this new provision to ensure that

high  quality persons are admitted under this route,  and  it

will not be a backdoor entry to get to the Singapore Bar.  Of

course,  the Board will have to establish its own guidelines,

and the broader wordings of this new section would enable the

Board   to  have  the  flexibility  to  adjust  its  internal

guidelines to suit changing needs and circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin posed the question whether Singapore's needs

may  be  changing and people who are admitted to fulfill  the

needs  of  certain times, may not be useful  later.   We  are

really  talking about outstanding people and I hope  he  does

not mind if I were to mention that many years ago, when I was

the Dean of the Faculty, I had interviewed a young, promising

lawyer from Sabah for the Law Faculty.  I was impressed  with

him  and  he was thinking of just a three-year contract  with

the  Law  Faculty.  But he stayed on, became a PR and  he  is

none  other than Prof. Chin.  But at that time, how could  we

say that this outstanding graduate was just going to meet the

demands  of  the Law Faculty at that time and  would  not  be

useful later?  So, we are talking about

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2210</b></font><br><br>



other  outstanding people like Prof. Chin.  I think it  would

be a provision that would be used judiciously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to clause 7, let me say that it does not impose any

new  limitations  but  actually  it  creates  exceptions   to

limitations which are already found in section 26(1)  of  the

Legal Profession Act.  Because section 26(1) says that no one

can be issued with a practising certificate unless he intends

to practise law as a sole proprietor, in partnership or as an

employee of a law firm or law corporation or as a director of

a law corporation.  This naturally means that lawyers working

in  statutory  boards and universities are disqualified  from

holding practising certificates.  The existing section  26(3)

created an exception for lawyers working in statutory boards,

subject  to  certification  by  the  Attorney-General.   What

clause  7 does is to widen the exception to include also  law

lecturers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that this creation of a new exception for law

lecturers   would  create  greater  opportunities   for   law

lecturers  to sharpen their legal skills which will  in  turn

benefit their students.  The requirement for certification by

the  Attorney-General  would allow  the  Attorney-General  to

impose  conditions and controls over situations in which  the

law lecturers can make use of the practising certificate.  As

I  have  said in my speech, it is not the intention to  allow

law lecturers to set up a full-fledged legal practice.  It is

really  intended  to  cater mainly  for  cases  where  a  law

lecturer has been instructed by a practising lawyer, or where

the  law  lecturer is invited by the court  to  assist  in  a

particular case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also made the point about the need for the

Law Society to print and disseminate information about how it

deals  with complaints.  This is a suggestion which  I  would

certainly  take up with the Law Society.  But,  in  fairness,

let  me  say that the Law Society does publish and distribute

pamphlets  explaining to the public the procedure for  making

complaints about lawyers and the pamphlets are also available

on the Internet.  For Members of the House who previously had

difficulties explaining the procedure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2211</b></font><br><br>



to their constituents, I can also get my officials to forward

the relevant website address to the constituency secretariats

so that MPs can advise their constituents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chandra Mohan was particularly concerned with two

points.   One  was on the Board's investment powers.   It  is

true  that  these amendments have given a new flexibility  to

the  Board.  But one should not conclude that this means that

the   Board  is  going  to  be  speculative  and  engage   in

questionable investments.  This new provision on the  Board's

investment  powers is actually similar to those on investment

powers of many other statutory bodies in Singapore.  So it is

not  unprecedented.  The idea is really  to  give  the  Board

greater  flexibility to invest its funds to better  meet  its

objectives.  I believe that the Attorney-General  hopes  that

this   flexibility  would  allow  the  Board,   on   suitable

occasions,  for example, to selectively grant  loans  to  law

firms to assist with operations on worthwhile projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also hoped that this would allow the Board and

firms  to  engage in win-win partnerships for the benefit  of

the  legal profession as a whole.  I myself do not fear  that

this  would lead to imprudent and unwise investments  because

the  control over these investments rests with members of the

Board,  which is chaired by the Attorney-General and includes

the  Dean of the Law Faculty, as well as the President of the

Law Society, all of whom, I am sure, would make it a point to

ensure  that  the  investments are  defensible  and  on  good

grounds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his point about dining terms, let me say the Board of

Legal Education has been trying out this idea informally  for

the past two years.  But unlike the way dining terms are kept

in  England,  the  arrangement here would  have  considerable

educational  flavour or component and I understand  that  the

intention  is  to invite prominent speakers for  such  dining

sessions,  and the pupils would be seated with practitioners.

I  think  this idea should be encouraged as it  would  add  a

further dimension to education of our younger budding

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2212</b></font><br><br>



lawyers  and  hopefully, it would enable them to  absorb  the

values  and  traditions of the Bar by interacting  with  more

senior practitioners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have taken note of what Prof. Toh See Kiat has said.

First,  I  want  to make it clear that I do not underestimate

the  expertise  and competence of the law  teachers  who  are

teaching law outside the NUS Law Faculty.  But in response to

his  points,  let  me say that there is a difference  between

teaching law full-time to law students in the Law Faculty and

teaching   law  to  engineering,  accountancy   or   business

students.   The  Member may or may not agree  with  me.   The

lecturers   in   the   Law  Faculty   are   training   future

practitioners of law and they have to constantly keep up with

the  legal  skills and knowledge, well-honed, up-to-date  and

even  a  cutting edge.  It is for that reason that Parliament

saw  it fit to regard each year spent teaching law in the NUS

Law  Faculty  as  equivalent  to one  year's  legal  practice

experience for the purposes of qualification used in the term

"consultant".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without appearing to underestimate those teaching law

outside  the  Law  Faculty,  I should  say  that,  relatively

speaking,  the  demands  on a law lecturer  teaching  non-law

students may not be as intense as the Law Faculty because the

Law Faculty lecturers are in a total law environment and they

interact  with  some  40  to  50  other  colleagues  who  are

specialists in their law disciplines.  I am not sure that the

other departments outside the NUS Law Faculty have this total

interactive  environment which is not unlike  a  leading  law

firm in town.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this Bill has opened up certain NUS law lecturers'

privileges  to  also  non-law  faculty  lecturers  and  other

institutions,  they  do  not  make  the  conferment  of  such

privileges  automatic.   For  example,  the  issuance  of   a

practising  certificate is subject to the  Attorney-General's

approval  and  the  Attorney-General can  impose  conditions.

This  would  allow  the  Attorney-General  to  exercise  some

control.   My  response may not satisfy Prof.  Toh  See  Kiat

because he would favour a result where all law lecturers  are

conferred the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2213</b></font><br><br>



benefit  which is given to the NUS Law Faculty.  Let us  take

matters  one step at a time.  I would not completely rule  it

out.  But as Prof. Toh See Kiat knows, my approach is not  to

rule  it  out.  Let us try this first, see how it works,  and

he, or other colleagues who feel the same way, can take it up

to  try  and  persuade me or the future Minister for  Law  on

another occasion.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> A point of clarification,

Sir.   When the Minister mentioned that law lecturers in  the

Law  Faculty have got more intensive experience, I do  agree.

But   has   he  taken  note  that  nowadays,  in  the   other

universities,  when  the  law  lecturers  fight   for   their

promotions, they have to be compared with their peers in  the

law faculty and their research papers have got to be the same

class, or else they do not make it?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I am very glad to hear that, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Prof. S. Jayakumar].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>ARBITRATION BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill repeals the Arbitration Act. In its

place, the Bill enacts a new Arbitration Act which is more in

line  with  our  International  Arbitration  Act  (IAA)   and

international  practices, as reflected in the UNCITRAL  Model

Law on International Commercial Arbitration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, arbitration is a useful and efficient alternative

dispute   resolution  (ADR)  process  to  settle   commercial

disputes.  Hence, it is important that our arbitration laws

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2214</b></font><br><br>



and practices effectively support the business infrastructure

in  Singapore  and at the same time encourage and  facilitate

its greater use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Arbitration Act was enacted in 1953. It is

largely  based  on UK arbitration law.  In 1995,  this  House

passed  the International Arbitration Act to adopt the  Model

Law   as   our  governing  law  on  international  commercial

arbitrations.   At  that  time,  it  was  decided  that   the

migration  to the UNCITRAL Model Law be conducted in  phases,

with   the   first   phase   involving   only   international

arbitration.   As  the Model Law has been  well  received  by

Singapore arbitrators and practitioners, the next step is  to

align our domestic laws with the Model Law.  This will narrow

the  differences between the two regimes.  In  1996,  the  UK

revamped   their  arbitration  laws  and  incorporated   many

provisions  from  the  Model Law.   In  the  light  of  these

developments, the Attorney-General initiated a review of  our

Arbitration  laws, spearheaded by the Chambers' newly  formed

Law  Reform  and  Revision Division.  The Division  consulted

many  bodies  in  this  review.  They include  the  Singapore

Institute   of   Arbitrators,  the  Singapore   International

Arbitration  Centre,  the  Law  Society  of  Singapore,   the

Singapore Institute of Architects, the National University of

Singapore,  the  Economic Development  Board  and  the  Trade

Development Board. The Bill is therefore the product  of  all

these  consultations.  In fact, it is the  first  law  reform

proposal  from  the Law Reform and Revision  Division  to  be

introduced as a Bill in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is largely based on the UNCITRAL Model

Law,   which   already   forms  the  basis   of   Singapore's

International  Arbitration Act.  The Bill  also  incorporates

useful  provisions  from the 1996 UK Arbitration  Act.   This

approach allows the creation of an arbitration regime that is

in  line  with international standards and yet preserves  key

features  of  those existing arbitration practices  that  are

deemed to be desirable for domestic arbitrations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now highlight the main features of the Bill.

Firstly, the Bill adopts

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2215</b></font><br><br>



the  territorial criterion recommended in the Model  Law  and

affirms the position that every arbitration held in Singapore

must  be governed by an applicable law of arbitration  either

under  the International Arbitration Act or under this  Bill.

The  concept of a `delocalised' arbitration unconnected  with

any  system  of municipal laws would not be recognised  under

Singapore law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Bill adopts the position that some

supervision by the Courts over the conduct of arbitration  in

domestic arbitration is desirable.  For example, the power to

grant  Mareva  injunctions and Anton  Piller  injunctions  is

vested  in the Court, and not in the arbitral tribunal.   The

Bill  also  provides for the Court to be able to determine  a

preliminary point of law, to set aside the arbitral award  on

certain grounds and for appeals to be made against the  award

on a point of law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Bill allows a party to apply for stay of

court  proceedings in favour of arbitration in the  court  in

which  the  proceedings  were  first  commenced.   Under  the

current   position,  if  an  action  is  commenced   in   the

Subordinate Courts and a stay of the proceedings is sought in

favour  of arbitration, the person seeking the stay needs  to

apply  to  the  High  Court to stay the  proceedings  in  the

Subordinate  Courts.   The new arrangements  under  the  Bill

would therefore remove this inconvenience in having to submit

the matter for determination by the High Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also allows the Court, on its own motion, to

discontinue certain stayed actions if at least two years have

elapsed  since  the  order of stay  was  made.   This  is  in

recognition  of the fact that most disputes under arbitration

would  take  less than two years to resolve, and  that  if  a

court proceeding is stayed for more than two years on account

of  an  ongoing arbitration, the subject matter of the  court

proceeding  would  most probably have been  resolved,  and  a

further  continuation  of  the  stay  would  be  unnecessary.

Either  party may still apply for the discontinued action  to

be reinstated.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2216</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the Model Law concept of separability is

adopted.  What this means is that an arbitration clause in  a

commercial  contract  is treated as a separate  and  distinct

agreement  from the underlying contract itself, and  as  such

would survive the termination of the underlying contract.  An

arbitration  clause  in a contract thus constitutes  a  self-contained  contract  that  is  ancillary  to  the  underlying

contract and is capable of independent existence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, the Chairman of the Singapore International

Arbitration Centre (SIAC) will now be the default  appointing

authority  where  the  parties are unable  to  agree  on  the

appointment   of  arbitrators.   Currently,  the   appointing

authority  is  the  High Court.  This change  recognises  the

position  of  the SIAC as the premier arbitration  centre  in

Singapore  and  the  region. The SIAC has  been  the  default

appointing  authority  for  international  arbitration  since

1995.   The  steady  increase in the number of  international

arbitrations confirms the confidence of parties in the  SIAC.

With  the  expertise  of the SIAC and its  panel  of  eminent

arbitrators,  the  SIAC is well-positioned  to  fulfill  this

function.   This  change  will  also  conserve  the  valuable

resources of the High Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, the existing provisions on the institution of

umpires have been removed from the Bill.  Having umpires is a

unique English concept to break deadlocks arising out of  the

decisions  of two-man arbitral tribunals.  Umpire  provisions

have been found to be cumbersome and expensive to employ, and

the  concept of umpires does not exist at all under the Model

Law.  The Bill thus makes no mention of umpires and there are

only  provisions for appointing one-man or three-man arbitral

tribunals.   This  is  consistent  with  the  Model  Law  and

international  commercial  practice.   The  Bill  contains  a

transitional  provision  to cater  for  existing  arbitration

agreements  that  contain  references  to  umpires.   Out  of

respect for party autonomy, the Bill allows for the continued

operation  of the existing legislative provisions on  umpires

for  existing  arbitration agreements that  make  mention  of

umpires.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a related change, there are no longer provisions

governing the appointment of two-man tribunals as the  umpire

provisions for breaking deadlocks have been removed from  the

proposed Arbitration Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh, the Bill provides for a modification of the

UNCITRAL  Model  Law approach in the default  appointment  of

three-man tribunals.  Under the Model Law, where parties wish

to  appoint  a  three-man tribunal, each party  appoints  one

arbitrator  and the two so appointed would then  appoint  the

third arbitrator.  As arbitrators would appoint persons  they

know or are familiar with, the participation in international

arbitrations   may  be  limited  to  a  few  and   home-grown

arbitrators  may  not have an opportunity to  participate  in

these arbitrations.  After extensive discussions between  the

SIAC and the Law Reform and Revision Division of the Attorney-General's   Chambers,  it  is  proposed  that   the   default

appointment  for  three-man tribunals be  modified  to  allow

parties   to  appoint  the  third  arbitrator  by  agreement.

Failing  the  agreement,  the  SIAC,  as  default  appointing

authority, would appoint the third arbitrator.  In this  way,

where   the   SIAC  has  an  opportunity  to   make   default

appointments, it may do so to promote and develop  home-grown

arbitrators.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, consequential amendments are also made to the

Limitation  Act  and  Bankruptcy  Act.   In  particular,  the

provision  in  the existing Arbitration Act that  deals  with

adoption of an arbitration agreement by the Official Assignee

in  the event of a party's bankruptcy has been enacted in the

Bankruptcy Act.  In the UK, this approach is also taken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will help facilitate arbitration as a

means of resolving commercial disputes in Singapore and  will

ensure that our domestic regime continues to stay on par with

international  standards.   It  will  reinforce   Singapore's

position as a desirable venue for the conduct of arbitration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2218</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

speak in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is positioning itself as a centre for

services,  and one of the most important form of service  is,

of  course,  dispute settlement.  Arbitration is increasingly

becoming  important  as  a means of  settling  disputes.   It

affords  advantages  beyond litigation,  which  is  far  more

formal  in its procedures.  I therefore welcome the  Bill  in

its  entirety.  I only wish to ask the Minister of  State  to

clarify a couple of issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, what steps are being taken to develop Singapore

as  an arbitration centre in the region?  How is the Ministry

and other relevant agencies going to train sufficient quality

arbitrators   to   enhance  Singapore's  reputation   as   an

arbitration centre?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, in clauses 62 and 63, reference is made to

arbitrators acting as mediators.  Mediation is, of course,  a

different dispute settlement mechanism than arbitration.  And

it seems that arbitrators in this Bill are expected to act as

mediators.   Are arbitrators now expected to  be  trained  in

mediation as well?  And if so, what steps are taken to ensure

that arbitrators know how to mediate properly?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these comments, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first, let me thank

Prof.  Chin  for  supporting the Bill and for  making  useful

comments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin's first query is on how we can further ensure

that  Singapore  becomes the centre for  arbitration  in  the

region.   As I have mentioned, we are always looking  at  how

our laws can be improved.  Indeed, what we are doing today in

passing these amendments to the Arbitration Act is a big step

in  that  direction.  After all, the Arbitration Act has  not

been  amended  very often since its enactment  in  1953.   In

other  words,  we are providing two regimes for  parties  who

want  to  arbitrate in Singapore to choose from,  either  the

International Arbitration Act regime or the domestic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2219</b></font><br><br>



Arbitration Act regime.  My assurance to Prof. Chin  is  that

the  Attorney-General's Chambers will continue to monitor all

trends   and   developments  overseas  and,   if   necessary,

incorporate  these, as we have done in these amendments  this

afternoon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other approach is to ensure that the Singapore

International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) is well  run.   As  I

have  mentioned in my speech, the SIAC, since  its  inception

about  10 years ago, has made giant steps.  Currently, it  is

chaired by a former High Court Judge.  And not only him,  but

his  predecessor, and others working with him  have  promoted

the  SIAC  to  parties,  especially  overseas  and  also   in

Singapore.  The SIAC was launched in 1991.  In 1992,  it  had

two  international arbitrations, one year after  its  launch.

Last  year,  the number rose to about 60.  So there  is  some

increase.   But the Chairman of the SIAC tells me  that  they

will  further  promote  the Centre,  and  that  will  include

working  with  relevant agencies like the  Trade  Development

Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is the quality of the arbitrators. I

think that is another selling point of any centre.  The  SIAC

has on its panel over the years built up a group of local  as

well  as  foreign  arbitrators.  There  are  about  70  local

arbitrators, not just eminent and distinguished  lawyers  but

also  people  in  the various fields where parties  may  want

expertise  in  arbitration.  So there are  engineers,  marine

captains  and  architects.   That  is  the  local  panel   of

arbitrators.   That is complemented by a panel  of  about  70

foreign distinguished arbitrators.  Here again, parties  have

a  choice,  which  is important, because  the  key  tenet  of

arbitration  is  party's autonomy.  They  can  choose.   They

choose  the venue, they choose the rules, they have a  choice

of arbitrators, and how it is conducted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, the training of arbitrators, a point

which  Prof. Chin mentioned is also important.  Let me assure

him that this is being done, not just by the SIAC but also by

the Singapore Institute of Arbitrators, which has been around

even

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2220</b></font><br><br>



longer  than  the  SIAC.  And together with  the  SIAC,  they

conduct  continuing legal education.  I understand  that  all

these years, the Singapore Institute of Arbitrators has  been

training  and  accrediting arbitrators.  They have  a  scheme

where  people join as members and, over time, when they prove

themselves,  they  are upgraded to Fellows.   There  is  also

training  done in conjunction with the UK Chartered Institute

of Arbitrators.  So, let me again make this point, which is a

good  point,  that training is important, and I  thank  Prof.

Chin for that reminder.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also talks about clause 62. As I mentioned

just  now,  one of the key tenets of arbitration  is  party's

autonomy.  In fact, clause 62, where an arbitrator may act as

a  mediator,  is  not  a new provision because  it  is  found

currently  in  the  International  Arbitration  Act.   So  in

bringing the two Acts closer together, this has been co-opted

into  the Arbitration Act.  But let me assure Prof. Chin that

this provision only applies where the parties agree that  the

arbitrator  shall  have the powers to act;  in  other  words,

party's  autonomy.  Some parties may very well think that  it

is  a  good  thing  to do that, ie, before  they  submit  the

dispute  to  an  arbitrator,  they  give  the  arbitrator  an

opportunity to mediate.  Then, of course, we all know that it

is a tenet that all arbitrators must remember that if they do

mediate before that, they are wearing different hats  and  it

is  very  important not to mix the two.  So all  parties,  in

other words, enter into this arrangement with eyes open - the

parties  in  dispute as well as the arbitrator.  Indeed,  the

provisions are there to guide the arbitrator, if he  does  so

wear  this other hat, what he should or should not  do.   So,

again, let me assure Prof. Chin that this provision has  been

added after much thought.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is related to the Bill which was just

passed.  This Bill makes consequential and related amendments

to   the   International  Arbitration  Act  to   ensure   its

consistency  with  the Arbitration Bill which  we  have  just

moved  earlier.   Another objective  is  to  clarify  certain

provisions in the International Arbitration Act.   This  Bill

is  another  product  of  the work of the  Attorney-General's

Chambers'   Law   Reform  and  Revision  Division.    Indeed,

consultation  on this Bill was done jointly with  those  that

took place on the Arbitration Bill.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.49 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill effects the following changes in order to

harmonise it with the proposed Arbitration Act:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the stay of proceedings provisions will be

streamlined.  I think I have mentioned this already just now.

Because under the existing International Arbitration Act, all

stay  of  proceeding applications must be filed in  the  High

Court,  regardless  of  whether  the  action  was  originally

commenced in the Subordinate Courts or the High Court.   This

Bill  will remove this inconvenience because now the  parties

need  not  submit the matter for determination  by  the  High

Court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Bill amends the International Arbitration

Act  to  allow  the  Court on its own motion  to  discontinue

certain  stayed  actions if at least two years  have  elapsed

since  the  order of stay has been made.  As I have explained

just now, this amendment follows from that in the first Bill,

because  two  years is a long enough time for the  action  to

proceed  if  the parties have so intended and, in  any  case,

even if

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2222</b></font><br><br>



discontinued, they can take up an action to restart it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Bill provides limited immunity to the

default appointing authority and arbitral institutions.  This

states that arbitral institutions are not liable for anything

done  or  omitted  in  respect  of  the  discharge  of  their

functions  in  appointing  or nominating  arbitrators  unless

there is shown to have been bad faith involved in the act  or

omission.   The provision also clarifies that the  appointing

authority or arbitral institution is not liable for the  acts

of the arbitrator appointed or nominated by it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from the foregoing, two main amendments are

made to provide clarifications, so that there will be greater

certainty   as   to   the  operation  of  the   International

Arbitration  Act.  Firstly, clause 14 provides  clarification

on  the  finality of an interim award.  Under UK  arbitration

law  and our domestic Arbitration Act, an interim award, once

given,  is  binding and cannot be reviewed by the arbitrator.

The  Model Law says nothing about the finality of an  interim

award  but practitioners have long assumed that the  position

is  the same as well.  The Attorney-General, the Chairman  of

the  SIAC and leading arbitrators, including members  of  the

Singapore  Institute  of Arbitrators, have  recommended  that

legislation  be  passed  to clarify this  position  to  avoid

uncertainty  in the law.  Thus, clause 14 of the Bill  amends

the  Act to state clearly that the position in Singapore  for

international arbitrations is that interim awards  are  final

and binding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, clause 12 of the Bill amends section 15 of the

International Arbitration Act to clarify its scope.   Section

15  was intended to allow parties who desire a greater degree

of  judicial intervention to opt out of the Model Law  regime

into  the domestic Arbitration Act as the applicable  law  of

arbitration.   In  its  existing form  it  has  created  some

uncertainty in the industry and requires clarification.   The

first  question  to  be  resolved is whether  parties  to  an

arbitration agreement should be regarded as having opted  out

of the Model Law if the arbitration agreement

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2223</b></font><br><br>



contains  a reference to the use of institutional arbitration

rules,  eg, ICC rules, without more.  A new section 15(2)  is

therefore added to clarify that a reference in an arbitration

agreement  to any institutional arbitration rules would  not,

by  itself,  be regarded as an agreement to opt  out  of  the

Model Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question to resolve is which legal regime

will  apply  in  the event that parties to  an  international

arbitration conducted in Singapore opt out of the Model  Law.

For  the  avoidance of doubt, section 15 is amended to  state

that   Singapore's  domestic  arbitration   law   under   the

Arbitration  Act  would apply to the arbitration  if  parties

expressly  choose to opt out of the International Arbitration

Act or the Model Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will help ensure that our International

Arbitration  regime  continues to keep  pace  with  the  best

practices  among  international  standards  and  more  firmly

establish  Singapore  as  an  attractive  place  to   conduct

international commercial arbitrations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

rise to speak in support of the Bill which together with  the

Arbitration  Bill  that  was just considered  will  form  the

substantive  basis for Singapore to develop as  an  important

arbitration  centre.   But as rules  are  just  part  of  the

process  and  the practice of how to encourage  international

arbitration  has to be taken into account, I should  like  to

ask the Minister of State to clarify a couple of points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of international arbitration, I would like

to  ask  him how we can ensure that Singapore would be looked

upon, regarded as a good forum for international arbitration.

For  example, how do we make sure that our arbitrators  would

have  a  high standard of objectivity and independence,  even

when  they are considering disputes between Singapore parties

and parties from abroad?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2224</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I would like to know whether we have taken steps

to  facilitate  entry  into Singapore of  well-known  foreign

arbitrators.   I understand, for example, that  when  foreign

arbitrators come to Singapore, they are uncertain  about  the

tax position and some of them have expressed unhappiness over

the  red  tape  encountered,  especially  with  reference  to

withholding  tax.   Could the Minister of  State  assure  the

House  that  steps will be taken to smoothen the  process  of

admitting foreign arbitrators to Singapore so that  with  the

new regime of rules and practices, Singapore can continue  to

be a good base for international arbitration as well?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Bill, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, once again, I thank

Prof. Chin for his comments and support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, his first point is the attractiveness of the

centre, in particular when parties are in dispute, and one of

the parties is a non-Singaporean party.  I think that has  to

do  with  two  areas.   The first will  be  the  quality  and

integrity of the panel of arbitrators.  This is because  SIAC

that  forms  these  two lists of arbitrators  stands  by  the

reputation of these arbitrators.  If Prof. Chin looks at  the

list  of arbitrators, he will see that they comprise  men  of

good professional standing, proven expertise not just in  the

legal  field but also in other fields, and that also goes  to

say  for the other list of international arbitrators.   So  I

think  the  track record is important.  People who have  done

arbitration in Singapore must feel good about what they  have

experienced  and then word can get around.  And I  think  the

numbers  that have increased over the years do show that  the

SIAC has built up a track record.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is, of course, on how the centre is run.

As I have said, I think it must be well run.  So here we have

got  a  former High Court Judge who heads the centre, working

with  a  team  of  very committed people.  Also,  it  is  not

linked, for example, to the Government, because that is  also

an issue, especially if one of the contracting parties is the

Singapore Government.  We also want parties to such contracts

to consider Singapore as a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2225</b></font><br><br>



venue  for arbitration.  This, of course, has been helped  by

what  we  did  in August 1999 when previously  the  SIAC  was

organised   and  came  under  the  auspices  of   the   Trade

Development  Board,  which is a statutory  board  under  MTI.

This  is  not  to  say  that  at that  time,  there  was  any

wrongdoing, but more in terms of perception and holding  out.

At  that  time,  we switched it and now it  comes  under  the

Singapore  Academy  of  Law, which  all  of  us  know  is  an

institution of high standing and of repute overseas.  So that

is the first point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point, of course, is again part of this

process  I  have  talked  about earlier  on,  how  to  always

consider  requests  and ways in which we can  make  Singapore

more  attractive.  On the point of tax that  Prof.  Chin  has

asked, what MinLaw has done is that we have asked Ministry of

Finance  to consider whether if there is any situation  where

foreign arbitrators who come to Singapore as arbitrators  may

be   in   a  disadvantaged  position,  vis-a-vis  their   tax

liability.   We should look at it and see whether  there  are

grounds and, if so, how we can ameliorate it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE BUSINESS FEDERATION BILL</b></div>

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."

<br><br><i>Rationale   for  Bill  -  Formation  of  Singapore   Business

Federation</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this Bill is to enable the formation

of the Singapore Business Federation (or SBF) as the new apex

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2226</b></font><br><br>



organisation  to represent Singapore business interests  both

locally and abroad.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there is a wide array of business chambers

and  associations  representing the various  sectors  of  our

business community.  Each organisation plays a niche  role  - serving  members  and the economy along ethnic  lines  or  by

industry, professional or national groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Federation of Chambers of Commerce and

Industry  (or  SFCCI) was set up in 1978 as a  national  body

representing  local business interests and  employer  groups.

Its  members  comprise the three ethnic  chambers,  Singapore

International  Chambers  of  Commerce  (SICC)  and  Singapore

Confederation of Industries (SCI).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, the SFCCI has done much to represent the

interests of our private sector in local and regional forums,

such  as the NWC and the ASEAN Business Council.  It has also

helped many local businesses expand overseas and network with

overseas partners.  Let me take this opportunity to thank the

SFCCI  for  the good work that it has done over the  last  23

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation and rapid technological progress have

fundamentally  changed the way business  is  done  worldwide.

Our  companies  are  relatively small and they  face  growing

challenges overseas.  They have to work together and leverage

on  each  other's strengths.  Even as they compete  at  home,

there are benefits to be gained from working together to  tap

regional and global opportunities.  Domestically, there is  a

need   to  strengthen  the  representation  of  the  business

community in forums, such as the NWC, ASEAN, APEC,  ASEM  and

many  bilateral  business councils.  In our  bilateral  free-trade   negotiations,  there  are  opportunities  which   our

business  community  should help to identify.   We  therefore

need a stronger collective voice to strengthen our tripartite

structure,  facilitate  better co-ordination  between  public

agencies  and the business community and assist our companies

when  they  venture  overseas.  This is much  like  the  role

Keidandren plays in Japan.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2227</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong urged the SFCCI to

review  its structure so that it could play a more  effective

role  in  Singapore.   In response, the  SFCCI  proposed  the

formation  of  a  Singapore  Business  Federation  funded  by

compulsory  contributions from larger companies.   The  SFCCI

recognises that its current policy of voluntary membership by

business  chambers and associations has not  been  effective.

The  business community in Singapore remains fragmented.   We

lack   a   strong   and   united  private   sector   umbrella

organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government fully supports SFCCI's proposal. To

operationalize  it, I requested Mr Stephen Lee,  Chairman  of

SNEF, in March this year to head an SBF Pro tem Committee and

study  in detail issues, such as the composition of  the  SBF

Council, the Constitution of the SBF and the legislation  for

compulsory membership of larger companies.  SFCCI's intention

is to dissolve itself once the SBF has been formed.



<br><br><i>Main recommendations by SBF Pro tem Committee</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This SBF Bill, before the House, was drafted based on

the  recommendations  of  the SBF  Pro  tem  Committee.   The

Committee has had extensive consultations with the local  and

foreign  business  community  in  Singapore.   Let   me   now

highlight  the main recommendations of the Pro tem  Committee

which are contained in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, while the SBF should be run by the business

community,  it  needs  the Government  to  enact  legislation

requiring  local companies with paid-up capital  and  foreign

companies with authorised capital of  $0.5 million and  above

to  be members of the SBF.  Mandatory membership is not  new.

Countries like Germany, France and Brazil have laws requiring

companies to contribute to their chambers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we should not burden small businesses with the

compulsory SBF subscription.  With the cut-off set at above

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2228</b></font><br><br>



$0.5  million paid-up capital, most of our SMEs will not need

to  pay  SBF fees.  We allow membership of the SBF indirectly

through  a  chamber or association.  Therefore, the  SBF  can

still  represent  the  interest of  small  companies  through

existing chambers and associations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, a Board of Trustees must be formed to protect the

assets  of  the SBF as these assets will be mainly  built  up

from the collection of mandatory fees and to ensure that  the

SBF   does  not  deviate  from  its  mission.   Beyond   such

protection,  the Trustees will not interfere in the  workings

of the SBF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we should not reserve seats in the SBF Council

for particular chambers or associations, except for the three

ethnic  chambers.  Nothing is static.  As the nature  of  our

economy  changes,  it  is  natural  that  some  chambers   or

associations would become more important while others  become

less  so.  Some may have to be closed.  New ones may have  to

be   formed.    The   Council  would  draw   up   rules   for

representation  which are fair and transparent.   Recognising

the important role of the international business community in

Singapore,  up to a quarter of the SBF Council  will  be  set

aside  for  foreign representation.  Only  the  three  ethnic

chambers  will be given permanent seats as they represent  an

important part of our multi-racial society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some concerns that the SBF may supplant

existing   chambers  and  associations   and   reduce   their

membership.   This is not the purpose for creating  the  SBF.

So  long as the chambers and associations serve their members

meaningfully, they will continue to play important roles.  In

countries with compulsory membership like France, Germany and

Brazil,  the  apex  chambers  work  closely  with  the  other

chambers  which continue to flourish alongside.  In the  same

way,  the  SBF  will work closely with existing chambers  and

associations to serve our business community.



<br><br><i>Role of the SBF</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SBF, thus proposed, is a network and not an

exclusive   organisation.   It  provides   a   facility   for

information exchange

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2229</b></font><br><br>



and  for  promoting  dialogue not  only  with  the  Singapore

Government but with foreign governments as well.   It  should

also  advance the interests of Singapore businesses  overseas

and  link  up  with  Singapore business  clubs  and  chambers

established in other countries.

<br><br><i>Key Features of Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill addresses key aspects

of  the  SBF  Council relating to the representation  of  the

three  local ethnic chambers and foreign chambers, compulsory

membership  and payment of subscriptions by larger companies.

The  legislation also provides for the appointment of a Board

of Trustees, prescribes supervisory powers for this Board and

requires  SBF  to  keep  proper accounts  for  the  Board  to

oversee.   The  Bill includes the steps to be taken  for  the

dissolution of the SBF, should this be done one day.  Let  me

now outline the key provisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill spells out the main role and

objectives of the SBF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 specifies the requirement for the SBF Council

to have the three ethnic chambers permanently represented and

for up to one-quarter of the seats to be allocated to foreign

chambers.   The Pro tem Committee has proposed 20  seats  for

the Council.  Apart from the ethnic and foreign chambers, the

rest  of the Council seats will be allocated to various local

chambers,     business    associations    and    professional

organisations based on an objective set of criteria, such  as

their   membership  base  and  the  relative  importance   of

different  sectors  in our economy.   A  few  seats  will  be

allocated  to  representatives who are  directly  elected  by

member  companies,  those which are not  represented  through

chambers.  In addition to the 20 seats, the Council will  co-opt up to six members.  This arrangement will ensure that the

SBF  leadership  structure is not rigid and unchanging.   The

composition  of  the  Council will be specified  in  the  SBF

Constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 provides that local companies with paid-up

capital of S$0.5 million and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2230</b></font><br><br>



above and foreign companies with authorised share capital  of

S$0.5 million and above shall be members of the SBF.  Smaller

companies who have an interest in the SBF can still join  it.

In  fact,  they are welcome to join it.  Alternatively,  they

may  find that joining an industry association or one of  the

ethnic chambers might serve their needs sufficiently.   Paid-up  share capital was chosen as it is a simple proxy for  the

size of a company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6 and 7 provide for the appointment by the

Minister  of a Board of Trustees and its functions.   As  the

SBF will be financed by compulsory subscriptions, the Board's

role  is  to ensure that the SBF acts in furtherance  of  its

Constitution  and the law, that the funds and assets  of  the

SBF  are properly accounted for and safeguarded, and that the

Council members are fit and proper to hold office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 8 and 9 pertain to the proper maintenance and

audit  of the accounts and records of the SBF and the Board's

powers to access these records.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 provides that the SBF cannot be dissolved

without  the  prior approval of the Minister,  and  that  the

disposal of the assets of the SBF, upon dissolution, shall be

approved by the Board of Trustees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to perform its role effectively, the SBF needs

adequate  resources.  As specified in clause 12, SBF  members

will  pay  an  annual  subscription not exceeding  a  cap  of

$1,500.   The schedule of subscription fees will be drawn  up

by  the SBF and must be approved by the Minister.  Under  the

schedule  proposed  by  the  Pro tem  Committee,  the  annual

subscription  ranges  from  $300  to  $800.   Based  on   the

subscription rates proposed by the Pro tem Committee, the SBF

will  have an annual income of about $6 million to carry  out

its programmes and activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 amends the Small Claims Tribunal Act to allow

the  SBF Council or an authorised SBF employee to recover any

unpaid subscriptions through the Small Claims Tribunal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drawing up its recommendations on the Bill, the Pro

tem Committee worked

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2231</b></font><br><br>



closely  with  MTI and consulted widely and intensively  with

the   various   business  chambers  and  associations,   with

professional  groups and with members of the general  public.

Many  of the suggestions received have been incorporated into

the Bill.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank all

those who have given us their valuable feedback.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the establishment of the SBF is

an  important initiative of the Singapore business  community

which the Government supports.  With this Bill, the SBF  will

be  the  apex business organisation in Singapore representing

the  collective  interest of Singapore  businesses  here  and

abroad.   The Government supports this initiative because  it

will benefit our economy, enhance tripartite co-operation and

strengthen our international position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I support

the  Bill as it serves to create a new super chamber or  body

to  act  as a powerful and concerted voice to speak  for  the

business  community.  Similar federations of business  bodies

have  been  formed,  as  the  Minister  has  mentioned,   the

Keidandren  in Japan, and others elsewhere.  In Britain,  the

Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has been  formed  for

the same purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I previously asked some Questions for Oral Answer

in the House regarding this Bill.  At that time, the Minister

replied that the Bill was being formulated and he would  give

a   more   complete  answer  when  the  Bill  is  ready   for

presentation to this House.  So I shall take this opportunity

to ask a few questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on compulsory membership. According to clause

5(1)   of  the  Bill,  membership  is  compulsory  for  local

companies  with  paid-up capital of more  than  $500,000  and

foreign companies with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2232</b></font><br><br>



authorised  share capital of over $500,000.   I  have  a  few

questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Is it advisable to have compulsory membership by

law,  for  both  local and foreign companies?   There  are  a

myriad of local and foreign companies.  Some may not find any

reason  or need to join the SBF, or some can be dormant  even

though they have the qualifying $500,000 paid-up capital.  So

why  not make the membership voluntary, instead of making  it

compulsory?   Under the compulsory scheme,  as  I  heard  the

Minister,  they  would have collected  $6  million  from  the

membership fees.  That seems to be a large sum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Why is there a difference in the definition used for

paid-up  capital  for local companies and another  definition

used for authorised share capital for foreign companies?   As

I  understand  it,  unless  I am mistaken,  authorised  share

capital may not necessarily equate to paid-up capital because

full  equity  may  not  be  paid by  the  foreign  companies,

although they may have the authorised share capital.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, representation of varied interests in the SBF.

Given that the SBF will be a large gathering of companies,  I

wonder  how it can be effective in representing the wide  and

varied  interests  of  all its members.   Would  the  smaller

companies  feel that they have lesser representation  because

the  Council  could  be dominated by the  big  boys  and  the

prominent businessmen?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the role of the SBF vis-a-vis other business

bodies,  a  query I have is how is the SBF going  to  operate

effectively.  At present, the Bill provides for  three  local

chambers  of  commerce and industry, ie, Chinese,  Malay  and

Indian, to be represented on the Council.  But there are also

many  other  business and trade bodies that  are  already  in

existence.   They speak for their own industries'  interests.

For  example,  there is the Association of Small  and  Medium

Enterprises   (ASME)   and  there  is  also   the   Singapore

Confederation of Industries (SCI).  What are their roles  now

vis-a-vis  the  SBF?   The Minister has  explained  that  the

SFCCI, which is the confederation of chambers of commerce,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2233</b></font><br><br>



is going to be closed.  But what about the SCI?  Will it also

become  defunct or will it be invited to join the  SBF  as  a

component  member?   I  would like to  ask  the  Minister  to

enlighten us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the introduction of

this  Bill  is timely as it will see the birth of a  new  and

powerful organisation which can represent the interest of all

businesses.  It will also help look after the interest of the

business community within Singapore and represent Singapore's

business interest overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that the SBF will provide mandatory

representation  on its Council for the three ethnic  chambers

of  commerce.  This has been a matter of serious  concern  to

the three chambers concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I would like to ask the Minister what

is  going to happen to the other two organisations,  ie,  the

Singapore Confederation of Industries (SCI) and the Singapore

International Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SICCI).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask whether there will be any

mandatory provisions to provide for these organisations to be

represented  on  the  SBF Council or whether  there  will  be

special  provisions made in the Constitution of  the  SBF  to

provide for the membership of these two organisations on  the

Council itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also unclear as to what exactly is the full

scope  of activities of the SBF, as the Constitution  of  the

SBF has not been disclosed to-date.  Perhaps the Minister can

highlight  the  principal areas SBF will be  concerned  with.

This  is  a  matter of significance as some of  the  existing

chambers rely on certain activities like issuing certificates

of  origin  and  bar coding as a source of  income,  and  any

competition from SBF in these areas will affect the income of

these chambers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the appointment powers. Clause

6(1) of the Bill gives the Minister the power to appoint  the

Board of Trustees.  The Board of Trustees, in turn, is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2234</b></font><br><br>



given  the  power to ensure that Council members are  persons

who are fit and proper to hold the position.  I am puzzled as

to  why  the  Council is given the power when the  qualifying

criteria should be laid down in the Constitution of  the  SBF

itself,  together  with other qualifying  criteria,  eg,  the

person should not be a bankrupt or have criminal records.  In

addition, it would be a better idea if the tests of  fit  and

proper  persons are clearly stated, ie, what are the criteria

when  we  mean  "a fit and proper person", so that  everybody

knows  whether  he  falls  within  these  criteria.   If  the

individual is not a fit and proper person, then he should  be

disqualified from standing for the elections to  the  Council

right at the beginning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask the Minister why the Board

of  Trustees must approve the appointment of the  members  to

the Council after they are properly elected by the members of

the  SBF  in  an election within the SBF.  This unnecessarily

curbs  the  freedom of the members of the SBF  from  electing

members  who  they feel will represent their interests.   The

instances,  of when the Board of Trustees should not  approve

these  Council  members who are duly elected,  are  also  not

spelt out clearly anywhere in the Bill, unless it is going to

be  provided  for in the Constitution of the  SBF.   I  would

suggest that this clause be deleted as it curbs the right  of

the  SBF members to decide who represents them.  Perhaps  the

Minister  can share with us the experiences of  some  of  the

countries  where  there  are  similar  organisations  on  how

elections of their council members are done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the concern of the Government is that the

Government view should be voiced in the Council, perhaps  the

model  of  the  Law  Society Council is  one  that  could  be

considered.   The  Law  Society has  a  Council  where  three

Government  appointees  are appointed  to  represent  certain

viewpoints.  This is a model that the Minister could  perhaps

consider  for  the SBF.  Otherwise, it will be seen  by  some

members  that the clause impinges on the right of  choice  of

SBF members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the exemption powers of the

Minister.  Clause 5(2)(c)

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2235</b></font><br><br>



gives  the  Minister  the  power  to  exempt  companies  from

becoming  members  of  the SBF.  I  would  like  to  ask  the

Minister  for  clarification on the type of  companies  which

will  be exempted from membership.  A matter of concern among

some companies relates to holding companies that have several

single-purpose companies, eg, shipping companies and property

companies.   These are done primarily to protect  the  parent

company  and other sister companies in the group  from  legal

liabilities.   In  the case of property companies,  it  is  a

requirement  that  a  separate company be  set  up  for  each

property  development project.  Will exemption be granted  to

such companies?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to subscription monies. Clause

12(3)  caps the maximum amount of subscription fee at  $1,500

per  year.   I  would  like  to ask the  Minister  the  exact

subscription that will be collected from all companies  which

qualify  to  be members as of today.  I think the figure  the

Minister highlighted is $6 million.  I would like to ask  the

Minister  whether  he  would consider  a  lower  subscription

amount as there are many companies which are going through  a

difficult phase now because of the economic climate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now move on to the last topic. I am happy that

companies with a lower paid-up capital can become members  of

SBF, as many may find a benefit in joining SBF because of the

many  activities  and programmes that it may  offer.   But  I

would also like to ask the Minister whether:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. partnerships and sole proprietorships can also

become members of SBF, besides companies;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. professional partnerships or sole proprietorships,

eg, lawyers, accountants and doctors, can also become members

of the SBF; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. SBF will allow for individual members, as some

existing  chambers  allow  for  individual  membership   from

certain categories, eg, lawyers, IT professionals, etc.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2236</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are my main concerns. Despite all these

comments, I am confident that, with strong support  from  the

business community and the broad spectrum of support from all

larger  companies,  the SBF will grow  to  become  a  dynamic

organisation.    I  am  also  confident,  as   the   Minister

highlighted,  that  the SBF will develop into  a  strong  and

united private-sector umbrella organisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on that note, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, I support the Bill in principle  to  establish

the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) to take over the role

of  the  Singapore  Federation of Chambers  of  Commerce  and

Industry  (SFCCI) as the apex body of the Singapore  business

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the SFCCI has, since its

inauguration in 1978, been depending on its five  constituent

members,  ie,  Singapore  Chinese  Chamber  of  Commerce  and

Industry,  Singapore  Confederation of Industries,  Singapore

Indian   Chamber   of   Commerce  and   Industry,   Singapore

International Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Singapore

Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry for financial support.

Despite its financial constraints, it has fulfilled its  role

in  maintaining a useful channel of communication between the

business  community and the Government, as well  as  a  close

working relationship with its counterparts in ASEAN and other

countries.   It  has represented and safeguarded  Singapore's

interests  actively and consistently in ASEAN  CCI,  ICC  and

other international fora.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be effective in its role, the SBF will require much

financial  resources  to fund its activities,  especially  in

economic  research  and  overseas  assignments.   Since   the

business community will be the eventual beneficiary of  these

services,  it  is fair and reasonable for the  Government  to

introduce  this Bill to enable SBF to collect a small  annual

contribution from the larger and more successful companies to

fund  its  activities.  And I sincerely hope  that  with  the

stronger  financial resources and continued  support  of  the

SFCCI

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2237</b></font><br><br>



constituent members and other business associations, the  SBF

could  play  a  much more effective role in representing  the

interests  of  our  business  community  within  and  outside

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the SFCCI has effectively been

functioning  as the apex body of major business chambers  and

associations  in  Singapore, successfully carrying  out  this

function  in  close  cooperation with  its  five  constituent

members without having to recruit direct corporate members in

competition with its individual constituents.  It  has,  over

the  years,  accumulated  a wealth  of  practical  knowledge,

networking experiences and negotiating skills in dealing with

the  national  and international issues which  are  of  great

concern to the business community.  It is, therefore, in  the

interests  of  the SBF to tap the existing  human  and  other

resources  of the SFCCI and its five constituent  members  to

perform a larger role in the New Economy.  Naturally, we hope

that  SBF  will  stay with this practice and avoid  competing

with   its  constituents  in  recruiting  corporate   members

directly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Bill, however, provides that every local

company  with a paid-up share capital of or above the  amount

of  $500,000 shall automatically become a member of  the  SBF

and be expected to pay an annual subscription of up to $1,500

to SBF in any calendar year.  This has raised a great deal of

concern  among the SFCCI constituent members and the business

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SFCCI's constituent members and many other trade

associations in Singapore want to know their role in relation

to  the  role of SBF in addressing the needs and problems  of

the  individual companies and the specific industries.   Will

the  SBF  choose to ignore or compete with all  the  existing

associations  with a view to replacing or  diluting  them  in

representing the interests of their members?  Rather,  it  is

hoped  that  SBF will encourage smaller companies  with  less

than  $500,000  paid-up  share  capital  to  join  any  other

chambers  of  commerce and industry and business associations

so that their individual business needs can be catered to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2238</b></font><br><br>



more  effectively  by  appropriate  associations  within  the

respective industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has clearly spelt out the payment obligations

of  companies affected but failed to specify the services and

benefits  they will enjoy as members of SBF.  Many local  and

foreign  companies  question the need to compel  them  to  be

members  of  SBF  when they are already members  of  existing

business  chambers and trade associations.   These  companies

want  to know what specific kinds of membership services  the

SBF  will provide and whether there will be a duplication  of

service at their expense.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are further concerns as regards the compulsory

membership  to  SBF and the quantum of annual  contributions.

Companies  are  worried that the SBF Council  could,  at  the

slightest   excuse  in  the  future,  obtain  the  Minister's

approval  to  increase  the annual  subscription  up  to  the

maximum  of  $1,500  under clause  12(1)  of  the  Bill.   In

addition,  many SMEs are also worried that the  Minister  may

lower the amount of paid-up share capital under clauses  5(1)

and 5(2)(b) of the Bill to compel more SMEs to be members  of

SBF  for  fund-raising  purposes in the  near  future.   This

scenario may cause undue hardship to individual companies and

there  is no way for them to avoid payment except to wind  up

their  business in Singapore.  Companies, therefore, want  to

know  what  are  the  safeguards against amendment  of  these

clauses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business elites and professionals have also

expressed their concerns over the proposed appointment of the

Board of Trustees by the Minister to oversee the work of  SBF

as  provided under clauses 6 and 7 of the Bill.  One possible

interpretation  of the two clauses is that  it  will  be  the

Minister and the Board of Trustees appointed by him  and  not

the  general membership of the SBF or its Council, that  will

ultimately decide who will run the SBF and how SBF should  be

run.    The  strong  Government  presence  within   the   SBF

inevitably raises the question of accountability and  whether

the   SBF   will   be   able  to  function  effectively   and

independently as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2239</b></font><br><br>



a  credible  and  representative body of the entire  business

community in the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many want to know what kind of persons are deemed to be

fit and proper persons to serve on both the Board of Trustees

and  Council  of the SBF.  What will happen if  the  nominees

elected  by  SBF  members  or the local  ethnic  and  foreign

chambers of commerce and industry cannot be accepted  by  the

Minister?    Could   we  successfully  encourage   the   more

successful  and capable business elites and professionals  to

serve  in the SBF Council with pride and commitment?  Can  we

promote spontaneity, creativity and initiative in the SBF  to

expect   its  Council  members  to  speak  their   minds   in

representing  the specific industries without  any  fear  and

inhibitions?  Can we ensure that the SBF is not perceived  as

another Government organisation or statutory body?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have painstakingly voiced the

genuine  concerns of the business community over the specific

provisions  of  the Bill because I strongly believe  that  we

need  a  strong and creditable SBF to serve as  an  effective

apex  business  body for the private sector.   The  SBF  must

truly  represent the entire Singapore business  community  in

the tripartism of our economy and in the international scene.

It is important for the Minister to address the issues raised

at  the outset and make appropriate amendments to the Bill if

necessary.   This  is  to ensure that  we  reach  a  national

consensus in establishing the SBF for the benefit of  all  in

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, I would like to thank Mr

Leong  Horn Kee, Mr Ravindran and Mr Tay Beng Chuan for their

very thoughtful comments about the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a step back and ask ourselves why such a

Bill is necessary.  I agree with Mr Ravindran and Mr Tay that

it  is important that the SBF is a business organisation  and

not a Government organisation.  Our objective is not to have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2240</b></font><br><br>



a  Government voice in it through our appointees, like in the

Law  Society, not at all.  Our objective is really to  enable

the  SBF to do the kind of good work which the SFCCI has done

in the past and to do much more because of all the challenges

that   we   are  facing,  brought  about  as  a   result   of

globalisation and global competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SFCCI, within its framework, as Mr Tay Beng Chuan has

pointed out, has done an excellent job.  But because  of  the

voluntary  nature  of  the  organisation,  it  faces  certain

limitations  and  the  principal limitation  is  a  financial

limitation.  And when Prime Minister Goh challenged SFCCI  to

restructure itself to become more effective, it came back  to

say,  "Look,  the  only  way  is:  we  must  have  compulsory

membership  of larger companies so that it has got  a  steady

flow  of  income."  So their request to us was to  legislate.

Once  we  legislate, we have responsibility.  And  since  the

power   to   legislate   is  vested  in   this   House,   the

responsibility must come back to this House. Hence, the  need

for  a  Board  of Trustees.  We cannot have one  without  the

other.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee asked a fundamental question:</b> is it

necessary, in the first place, to have compulsory membership?

Our  first  choice  was  never to have compulsory  membership

which is why we never had this Bill all this while.  The fact

is  we need it now and since we need it, and since it is this

House  which would give power to the SBF to collect  payment,

we  must  set limits to it to ensure that the money collected

and  the  assets accumulated are properly protected.   Hence,

the  need  for  a Board of Trustees, who will be  responsible

people,  people who are respected by Singaporeans, by members

of  the  business community and it is for them to  make  sure

that  when  the Constitution is amended, that it  is  amended

with the mission in mind.  And that when Council members  are

appointed, nominated or elected, these are people who are fit

and proper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the Ministry be involved? The Ministry should

not  be involved.  Should Parliament be involved?  Only  when

big

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2241</b></font><br><br>



things  are  impacted upon.   But as to issues  like  whether

professional  groups should be allowed membership,  what  the

detailed aspects of the Constitution are, I would say, let us

go  back to one of the fundamental principles, which is  that

SBF  is  not  a  statutory  board, it  is  not  a  Government

organisation,  it  should  be left  mostly  to  run  its  own

affairs.   Therefore, many of the comments  which  have  been

brought up, which are very important comments, are, in  fact,

built  into the heart of the Bill, which is a balance between

having  a  business  federation  which  is  independent   and

creative  and accountable to its own members, and one  which,

because  it  relies  upon Parliament to  give  it  powers  to

collect subscription, is also ultimately responsible for  the

mission which we have set out in this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now go into some of the detailed questions which

have  been  raised  by our three Members of  Parliament.   Mr

Leong Horn Kee asked about the differences in definition  for

locally registered companies and foreign companies.  There is

a   difference  because,  for  local  branches   of   foreign

companies,  there  is  no  reporting  mechanism  for  paid-up

capital.   So  we  have  to  use the  best  proxy,  which  is

authorised paid-up capital.  About a thousand local  branches

of foreign companies would be involved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the "fate", to use the language of by Mr Leong and

others, of organisations like ASME, SCI, SICC, frankly,  that

is    not   Parliament's   business.    These   are   private

organisations.   It  is for them to decide  how  they  should

react to the formation of SBF.  How they should work the  SBF

is  something between them and the SBF to decide.  I have  no

doubt  that  SBF  would  not want to duplicate  or  replicate

functions  already effectively performed by  these  chambers.

In  fact, it is completely in the interest of the SBF to work

with  an economy of effort, to work through and with existing

organisations.  Some of these organisations like SCI had done

a  very good job and I see no reason why there should be  any

diminution  in  their roles.  Others are less  effective  and

they will have to respond to the fact that there is now a new

organisation with a clear

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2242</b></font><br><br>



purpose  and  with  a  steady source of income  to  fund  its

activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked about issues concerning certificates

of  origin and bar codings.  Where these are franchises given

by  TDB,  it  is  really  for TDB  to  decide  whether  these

franchises  should  continue in the future.   Obviously,  TDB

would  make  no change without consultation with the  various

agencies  involved.  As to questions concerning the exemption

clause, single purpose companies like shipping companies  and

property companies, MTI has had discussions with the Pro  tem

Committee,  which  in  turn  has  had  discussions  with  the

industry  players  involved.  The Pro tem Committee  told  me

that once you allow for certain groups to be exempted, it  is

very  difficult  to draw the line because  there  are  always

worthy causes to be exempted.  My response to them is, "Well,

I will have this clause in the Bill so that if I have to give

an  exemption, I can.  But you must advise me whether you are

making  any recommendations."  To-date, the Pro tem Committee

has  recommended  no  exempted  category.   So  that  is  the

position as it stands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On subscription rates, although we have set a cap at

$1,500,  the  Pro  tem Committee has in fact,  worked  out  a

schedule ranging from $300 to $800 for companies of different

sizes.  They will take a practical approach and if these  are

reasonable numbers, I, as the Minister, will approve them.  I

do  not intend to second guess why they set certain schedules

for  certain  groups  of  companies.   Can  they  raise  this

subscription  lightly, a point raised by Mr Tay  Beng  Chuan.

No, they cannot, because firstly, they must have my approval.

I  am  accountable to this House and if I want to  go  beyond

$1,500,  I  have  got to amend the Act which cannot  be  done

lightly.   In  the same way, the fear that we may  lower  the

threshold of $0.5 million and suddenly make many SMEs pay up,

this  is  something  that  we cannot  do  lightly.   This  is

something  which  we can only do when we come  back  to  this

House.   I  am sure if we were to do that, many of you  would

have your views.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2243</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked whether partnerships and sole

proprietorships will be allowed as members of the SBF.   That

is  for the SBF to decide.  I have told them that they should

consider  it  and  I  believe they  are  favourably  disposed

towards  that idea.  In fact, the SBF Pro tem Committee  does

not  see the SBF as representing only the interest of  larger

companies   who  are  its  compulsory  members.    They   see

themselves  as  representing  all  businesses  in  Singapore,

including SMEs.  I believe that the interest of SMEs would be

adequately  represented,  even  if  they  are  not   directly

members,  by chambers such as the Chinese, Malay  and  Indian

chambers and ASME.  But of course, if an SME does not want to

be  a  member  of such a chamber, but wants to  be  a  direct

member  of  the  SBF, it is free to do so.  We  allow  for  a

certain  amount of healthy competition but, as  Mr  Tay  Beng

Chuan  pointed  out,  without  wanting  to  cannibalise   the

membership of existing chambers and associations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of SICC, which was raised by Mr Ravindran,

is  an important one.  We had draft structures circulated  to

the  business  communities earlier  and  some  of  them  were

concerned that the SICC may not be able to represent national

chambers sufficiently.  What we have done is to say  that  in

the  Bill, we allow up to one quarter of the Council's  seats

to be allocated to foreign chambers, but it is for the SBF to

draw  up  rules  in  consultation with the  foreign  business

community on how best they should be represented.  And I  see

the  compromise being a combination of representation by  the

SICC  and by the chambers of the major national groups  which

are  in  Singapore.   I  believe  I  have  answered  all  the

questions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [BG George Yong-Boon Yeo].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second reading read.

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (RAdm Teo Chee Hean):</b> Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education plays a critical role in moulding the future

of  our  nation.   Education  is  not  just  about  imparting

academic  knowledge.  It is about nurturing the whole  child.

It  is  about  developing the child morally,  intellectually,

physically,   socially  and  aesthetically.   It   is   about

equipping our students for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teachers play a vital role in educating and developing

our  young.   We  must have good teachers and  we  must  have

enough  of  them.  Building up a strong teaching  force  with

good  experience  levels is one of the  challenges  we  face.

Many countries face the same challenge.  This is all the more

important for us because of the profile of our teachers.   We

project that one quarter of our 24,000 trained teachers  will

retire  over  the  next 10 years.  We must therefore  attract

young  people  with the right motivations and  commitment  to

join the teaching profession and, more importantly, to retain

sufficient numbers of them.  We must ensure that our teachers

are properly developed and properly rewarded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was with this in mind that the Ministry of Education

embarked  on  a  fundamental review of  the  pay  and  career

structure  of the Education Service in September  last  year.

The aim of the review was to better shape the Service to meet

the  Ministry's organisational needs as well as the  personal

aspirations of teachers.  The Ministry completed  the  review

in  April  this  year.    The package,  which  is  named  the

Education  Service Professional Development and Career  Plan,

or  Edu-Pac  in  short, has been announced to  all  teachers.

Feedback  on  the package has been positive.  Under  Edu-Pac,

the  Ministry  will implement a new career structure,  a  new

recognition structure and will enhance the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2245</b></font><br><br>



performance    management   system   for    teachers.     The

recommendations are in the process of being implemented.



<br><br><i>The CONNECT Plan</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key component of Edu-Pac is the recognition structure,

and  a  key component of the new recognition structure is  an

incentive  payment  scheme  to  encourage  teachers  to  make

teaching their life-long career, and at least their long-term

career.   We are calling this the CONNECT Plan, which  stands

for CONtiNuity, Experience and Commitment in Teaching.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will implement the Plan from 1st January next year.

Under  the Plan, the Ministry will set aside a sum  of  money

every  year  for each Education Officer who meets performance

requirements.  The amount will be a flat rate  based  on  the

officer's substantive grade and the number of years  that  he

or  she  has been with the Ministry.  The amount, of  course,

will  be dependent on other factors such as the state of  the

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deposit amounts will range from $2,000 to $4,800 a

year.  At defined points every 3 to 5 years, officers will be

eligible  for a payout from the Plan.  The payout will  be  a

proportion  of  the money that has been accumulated.   Larger

payouts will be made at the 15th year of service and near the

officer's retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payouts and the money set aside are not an

entitlement.  Officers will receive the payouts only if  they

remain  in service and meet eligibility conditions.  Officers

who  resign will lose the money that has been set  aside  for

them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A newly trained teacher who joins service when the Plan

is  implemented  and  stays for a full 40-year  career  could

potentially  receive a total payout ranging from  $90,000  to

$120,000, spread over nine payments throughout his career.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CONNECT Plan will be available to all trained

officers  in  the Timescale grades employed on the  permanent

establishment.  Superscale officers will not be eligible  for

the Plan, as they will draw

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2246</b></font><br><br>



other  benefits from their overall remuneration package.   So

this  Plan is really aimed at the main teaching force,  those

who work in the classrooms daily with the children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both serving officers and new officers will benefit from

the  CONNECT  Plan.   Serving  officers  will  be  placed  at

appropriate  points  of  the  Plan.   We  will   manage   the

transition such that the longer-serving officers will see  an

earlier payout from the Plan.  There will however not be  any

retrospective amounts given for past service as this is a new

fund that has been set aside from next year onwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before the House entitled "The Education

Service Incentive Payment Act" provides for the establishment

of  the  CONNECT Plan and the CONNECT Fund.  Let me highlight

the key clauses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides for regulations to be made to

establish and administer the CONNECT Plan.  This will  enable

us  to  fine-tune the CONNECT Plan as we progress  to  ensure

that  the CONNECT Plan remains effective and relevant towards

its objective of helping to retain teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 to 10 provide for the CONNECT Plan to be an

eligibility and not an entitlement.  Officers will  not  have

absolute  rights  to any payment under the CONNECT  Plan  and

Government's  rights to dismiss officers without compensation

will  also not be limited.  The money set aside for  officers

will  not  be  transferable and will not  form  part  of  the

officers'  properties or estates.  The Government  will  also

reserve  the  right  to  withhold or refuse  any  payment  to

officers who have been convicted in court or have been  dealt

with disciplinarily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 11 to 18 provide for the establishment and

management of a new Government Fund called the CONNECT  Fund.

Money  will be set aside each year from the Ministry's budget

and  paid  into the Fund.  The periodic payouts  to  officers

will  be made from this Fund.  By setting aside money in  the

Fund,  we can be assured that there will be sufficient  money

to pay officers eligible for the payouts and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2247</b></font><br><br>



that  their payouts will not be affected by the state of  the

Ministry's  budget  in  any  particular  year.   Besides  the

payouts under the CONNECT Plan, the Fund will also be used to

meet expenses related to the administration of the Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the CONNECT Plan and the other

parts  of Edu-Pac are now being implemented and taking shape.

The  Education Service Incentive Payment Act is a key element

of  the  comprehensive plan that the Ministry is  putting  in

place to build a high quality Education Service.  This is our

investment for our future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this Bill

seeks  to  establish the CONNECT Plan as a  means  to  retain

teachers,  particularly  young  teachers,  in  the   teaching

service.  It is an award scheme with payments at intermediate

break  points  in a teacher's career.  With  this  scheme  in

place,  the  teachers would have some monetary  incentive  to

look  forward to as they progress in their careers.  It  will

be  a  valuable  tool  to motivate the  teachers  when  their

enthusiasm  starts to wane, commitment starts to  waver,  and

realism sets in after a few years of service.  For those  who

would otherwise have quit the teaching profession, the scheme

would give them cause to pause and weigh the pros and cons of

completing  the remainder of a prescribed qualifying  period.

As  such, Sir, I support this initiative by the Ministry,  as

any programme that helps to retain teachers in the service is

worthy  of consideration.  Without a doubt, we shall try  our

very best to retain the best teachers in the education of our

next generation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in presenting the scheme to the teachers, I think

it is important to re-emphasise that the CONNECT payments are

over  and  above the existing compensation for the  teachers.

As  the  Ministry has already just reviewed teachers' pay  in

the past year, there is no question in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2248</b></font><br><br>



my mind that this money paid into the CONNECT Fund is removed

from  funds that would have otherwise been incorporated  into

the  pay  increases of the teachers concerned in  the  future

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has already elaborated on some of the

details of the scheme and I believe the total sum to be  paid

out is quite attractive and shall be welcome by the teachers.

However,  Sir,  while  financial incentive  is  an  important

useful  tool,  we should not depend entirely on  a  financial

incentive scheme like the CONNECT Plan to solve the retention

problem of the teachers.  Many teachers left the service  for

other  reasons  as  well, and these reasons  or  root  causes

should be addressed.  Therefore, I think it is useful for the

Ministry  to review the issue of retention in total  and  not

depend  principally on the CONNECT scheme.  In his speech,  I

heard  the Minister mention that he has implemented the  Edu-Pac  scheme  to  review the Education Service in  total,  but

perhaps  he should take this opportunity in implementing  the

scheme to review all the related issues of teacher retention,

eg, workload, career path, training and upgrading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it seems to me that the heavy workload of the

teachers   is   a  perennial  issue.   The  introduction   of

administrative assistants in the school is a  good  start  to

reduce the workload, but we should not stop there.  We  could

review  the  course load and other unnecessary demands  on  a

teacher's time.  A lower workload might have a better effect,

in  the  sense that it would make the pace more bearable  for

the teachers who are in for the long haul.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also look into the career development and

retraining  of the teachers.  Other staff retention  measures

should continue to be pursued.  These include the pursuit  of

higher  qualifications,  career opportunities  in  education,

attendance at seminars, workshops and other courses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me now touch on a few

details   of   the  Bill.   I  believe  this  Bill   excludes

independent schools.  I understand that the teachers employed

directly by the eight independent schools

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2249</b></font><br><br>



are  not included, for the reason that their terms of service

are  different.   I am wondering whether the Government  will

take  care  of these teachers through some parallel measures,

so that they do not feel left out by the introduction of this

scheme when the majority of teachers in Singapore would start

to  enjoy  something over and above their  current  salaries.

Furthermore,  since we have a different category  of  schools

called   independent  schools  and  if  more  schools  become

independent,  how do we treat the transition of  teachers  in

those schools going independent in the future when they  have

already  been vested by an endowment or award scheme in  this

CONNECT Plan?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 7 states that the contributions or awards

due to a member will be "excluded property" from the bankrupt

member's  estate.  This gives the impression that  a  teacher

who  has  served the prescribed period and qualified for  the

awards would still be entitled to the money even though he is

adjudicated a bankrupt later.  However, the Explanatory  Note

on  clause  8, which is the clause on "Effect on  conviction,

dismissal,  etc.",  dealing with the  effect  of  bankruptcy,

conviction,  dismissal,  states that  "Contributions  may  be

withheld  and awards refused if the member is a bankrupt  .".

Sir,   this  means  that  a  bankrupt  might  lose  all   his

entitlements under the scheme for past contributions and  for

service rendered.  I wonder why the Explanatory Note of  this

Bill   needs   to  include  this  statement  on   bankruptcy,

especially  when  we are taking measures  in  this  House  to

render this society more tolerant of failures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8: Effect on conviction, dismissal, etc on Awards

and  Contributions.  I believe it is justifiable to  withhold

or  refuse to pay, in part or in whole, if a member has  been

dismissed  or  charged with any disciplinary charge  for  any

negligence  or misconduct.  It also would seem reasonable  to

deny  payment if a member is convicted and sentenced to death

or  for  other penal servitude.  But there is a provision  to

deny  payment to a member if he or she were sentenced to  any

term of imprisonment for any crime or offence

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2250</b></font><br><br>



that  seems to me rather punitive.  Perhaps that is  the  way

all  Bills  in this House are written.  But if we read  those

clauses,  one  gets  the impression that  a  member  of  this

CONNECT  Plan  might lose his entitlement  even  if  he  were

imprisoned for one day for a non-criminal offence.  I realise

that in the Explanatory Note of the Bill, it did mention that

clause 8 would come into force if the member is sentenced  to

certain  penalties due to conviction.  This implies  that  it

would  not  necessarily  come into  force  for  all  offences

resulting  in imprisonment.  But, nonetheless,  I  feel  that

perhaps the Minister could elaborate on the types of offences

that would be covered by this clause 8.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you,

Sir,  for the time and thank you also, Members of the  House,

for believing that I can do something as an NMP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support, in principle, this Bill but I have a few

reservations  that  I  hope  the  Education  Minister   would

elaborate.   The first one being that the objective  of  this

Bill  is to keep teachers in the fore.  While these are great

monetary  benefits that are coming by for  teachers  who  are

just beginning as well as teachers who have been there for  a

long  time, I fear that in the implementation of this scheme,

teachers  who  have  been there for a  long  time,  here  the

premise we are talking about is good loyal teachers, might be

demoralised in seeing younger teachers catch up in  a  matter

of  a  few years under this scheme and with better incentives

than  themselves.   So  I just wonder whether  the  Education

Ministry  could go further with the CONNECT Plan and  perhaps

give a token lump sum payment in appreciation to teachers who

have given long years of service so that they continue to  be

good serving officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I have here is that all this is

going  to be based on a good appraisal scheme.  I think  that

there  are  a lot of good things coming the teachers'  way  - performance bonuses and good promotion prospects.  And now we

have the CONNECT Plan too.  It then becomes

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2251</b></font><br><br>



imperative, I believe, for the Education Ministry to  have  a

staff  appraisal scheme that is consistent - it is a daunting

task  -  because we are talking about 22,000 teachers  spread

across  more than 200 schools of different streams and school

types.  But when the Government is giving out quite a lot  of

money  in terms of incentives, I would like to know  how  the

Education Ministry would implement a good standardised system

of appraisal better than what it already has.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point here is the whole question of exclusion.

Like  Dr Wang, I too have questions about independent  school

teachers.  Perhaps, is it possible that there is a co-sharing

payment scheme for independent schools such that teachers who

teach  in independent schools do not lose out on the  CONNECT

Plan?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other group that I would like to talk about is the

special education teachers.  I know that for years they  have

fallen  between the cracks of the Ministry of Education,  the

Ministry of Community Development and Sports as well  as  the

National Council of Social Service.  There are many among the

almost  500  teachers  giving lots  of  long  years  of  good

service.   Without belabouring their contributions,  I  think

perhaps  it  would be timely if the Education Ministry  could

mainstream  special education teachers and  include  them  in

plans  like  this  or  see how there  can  be  some  kind  of

contribution    across   the   Ministries    and    different

organisations  such  that they too do not  lose  out  in  the

scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I do agree with Dr Wang that these are great

plans  -  the  CONNECT Plan is good; it is a good  incentive.

Nevertheless, I think there is something greater,  perhaps  a

systemic situation, within the education system that we  need

to  look  at closely.  And I think right now there may  be  a

situation, with the recession, that we might have one or  two

years'  lead  time  to perhaps see who among  our  retrenched

officers can support the school system as a parallel layer of

support staff, or whatever, so that we can beef up the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2252</b></font><br><br>



whole education system and teachers do not feel overburdened.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

it  has been a long day and I think actually Dr Wang and Miss

Braemaputhri  have covered a lot of ground and issues  I  had

wanted  to  raise.  So I am just going to be very  brief  and

restrict myself to saying I fully support the Plan.  I  think

it  is  wonderful that we have been hearing in the  media  of

programmes and plans that the Ministry put up for  the  high-flyers,  principals'  training, and, I  think,  there  was  a

Leaders  in  Education  Programme and Master  Teachers.   But

these are the high-flyers and they are important because  you

leverage  on  them.   You  get  a  multiplier  effect.   But,

essentially,  the high-flyers alone cannot do the  job.   You

need the rank-and-file, the majority of those 25,000 teachers

who  you  have to keep on board, who you have to acknowledge,

and  keep their spirits up, and give them incentives to  stay

on.  Because, regardless of what wonderfully well-crafted and

farsighted policies you may have coming out of the  Ministry,

you   cannot  have  successful  implementation  without  that

continuity  and that mass of teaching workforce  staying  on.

So  I  think this is a great plan.  Details of issues  to  be

raised,  I think, have pretty much been covered.  So I  would

just like to say I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I rise

to speak in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too often, we tend to associate economic downturn with

gloom  and doom.  We tend to miss out on the silver  linings.

There  are  opportunities  even in  downturns,  sometimes  in

unexpected  forms.   For example, I see the  introduction  of

this  Bill  as  opportune  to  incentivise  both  prospective

teachers  and  current teachers to join  and  remain  in  the

teaching   profession.   After  all,  the  current   economic

downturn has caused many mid-career professionals to look for

alternatives  and  possibly  making  teaching  their   second

career.   The  current economic climate has  also  helped  to

transform  our universities and polytechnics into  favourable

hunting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2253</b></font><br><br>



grounds  to recruit more teachers for our schools.  I believe

that  many  schools are finding it easier to engage  contract

teachers as compared to last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of the current economic uncertainty, one

thing remains certain - our people are the best resources and

that  we  should continue to invest in our people, especially

in  educating and equipping our next generation to  face  the

challenges  ahead.  To succeed in educating our children  for

the new millennium, we need to retain and enlarge our pool of

dedicated  teachers  over  time.   Too  often,  due  to   the

resignations of teachers, our students' learning  journey  is

disrupted.   I  understand that in some of our  neighbourhood

schools,  some  students have to endure up to four  different

teachers  for  the  same subject during  the  year  owing  to

resignations, contract teachers leaving to study in NIE,  and

so  on.   Our students' learning journey requires experienced

teachers  who  are  committed to teach and impart  the  right

value to our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is ultimately human enterprise requiring

committed  teachers to reach out and touch the lives  of  our

students.  To do this, we need more experienced teachers.  We

need  to  both  attract and retain our  teachers.   For  this

purpose, I commend MOE for their Edu-Pac strategy to help  to

attract and retain our teachers.  The salary revisions are in

the  right  direction.   The creation of  Senior  and  Master

Teachers, appointments under the Teaching Track Scheme, is in

the right direction.  I understand that some of our teachers,

including contract teachers, are very bright and can  go  far

if  they  are  prepared to commit themselves to the  teaching

career, which is to seek to incentivise both current teachers

and  teachers-to-be to remain in service through longer  term

measures such as the CONNECT Plan.  We must ensure that their

future is properly taken care of and we must ensure that  our

teachers get their due respect and reward.  After all, we  do

not  want  a situation where teachers join the profession  by

the  hordes  only to leave a couple of years later  when  the

economy  rebounds.   This  would  defeat  the  purpose.   Our

schools are not a dumping ground for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2254</b></font><br><br>



those  who  are only interested in seeking shelter  from  the

current  economic  storm.   The teaching  profession  is  for

professionals committed to the mission of preparing our  next

generation  for  new millennium changes  and  not  for  fair-weather job seekers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, I support the Bill. I would also, however,

like  to  raise  two concerns which I hope the  Minister  can

clarify.   My fellow MPs have asked the Minister to  consider

ways in which the CONNECT Plan can recognise in part the past

services of teachers.  As it is, the teachers' past years  of

service are not recognised to any extent in the CONNECT Plan,

as  specified in the Bill.  Our older teachers, those in  the

late  40s  and 50s, are on the old pension scheme  and  their

retirement  needs taken care of.  But the teachers  who  have

served five, 10 or 15 years and so on are not likely to be on

any  incentive payment scheme.  To start them with  the  same

year as newly graduate teachers is no incentive for them.   I

am  not suggesting that the past years of service of teachers

not  on  the pension scheme should be recognised in full.   I

acknowledge that these teachers are on different remuneration

schemes altogether.  As a gesture of goodwill and recognition

towards  the  long service of these teachers, I propose  that

MOE consider their past years of service partially.  I do not

think  that  the  CONNECT Plan should be so clinical  in  its

starting  date  for these teachers as it may send  the  wrong

signals to our older teachers not on the pension scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to

clarify  how  his  Ministry intends to implement  the  scheme

without  a  concomitant pension scheme  mentality.   By  this

term,  I refer to the mindset of teachers who have lost their

interest  and passion for teaching but are still  staying  on

the job for the sake of the incentive payment scheme.  Having

lost  their interest and passion for teaching, these teachers

also exhibit none of the innovative and creative quality that

I   feel  are  the  necessary  qualifications  for  our   new

millennium teachers.  Going forward would witness  even  more

rapid changes to our environment and the use of technology in

the teaching syllabus and in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2255</b></font><br><br>



the   methods  of  teaching.   Instead  of  accelerating  the

learning  journeys  of our students, these pension  mentality

teachers  may instead put the brakes on the learning journeys

because they themselves are finding it difficult to cope with

the  changes.   To  this end, I wish to seek  the  Minister's

assurance  that there are measures taken to ensure  that  the

CONNECT  Plan  does not breed a pension mentality  among  our

teachers.  After all, the principal aim of this plan  is  not

merely to attract and retain more teachers but to enlarge the

pool  of  dedicated and experienced teachers.  We should  not

merely  be  looking  at  numbers  but  also  the  quality  of

teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these concerns that I hope the Minister can

clarify, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Thank you, Mr Deputy

Speaker, for allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise to support the CONNECT Plan because it is an

innovative and radical scheme.  Unless we try and  test  this

out,  we  would not be able to know the results.   I  support

this because it is a radical departure from all other efforts

that  have  been undertaken.  However, I feel that incentives

alone  are not sufficient because there is a need to look  at

other  efforts to try and improve the whole education system.

What   I  would  like  to  see  is  a  need  to  review   the

organisational   structure,   both   at   the   middle,   the

administrative level and at the school level.  I  would  like

to  ask  the  Minister whether there will be more efforts  to

allow  teachers to make decisions, to be able  to  take  more

charge at the school level and whether we are also looking at

providing  more  autonomy to various schools  to  manage  and

direct themselves because these are issues which will address

the   organisational  culture  and  the  structure   at   the

implementation level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that these issues which have a direct bearing

on  the  sustenance of teachers, to improve their morale,  to

allow  more creativity and innovation to take place,  to  me,

are equally important.  What I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2256</b></font><br><br>



want  to  find  out  from  the  Minister  is,  since  he  has

introduced  a  number  of changes to  the  teaching  service,

whether the attrition of teachers has been arrested over  the

last five years.  Is he able to retain more teachers and,  if

so,  is  he satisfied that the earlier incentives and changes

have in fact addressed some of the attrition problems?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue that I would also like to point out is

that we should not neglect teachers who are providing support

to  the special education sector.  There is a large number of

teachers  who  have  been contributing to  the  education  of

special children and they have spent many dedicated years  of

service.   I hope that this CONNECT Plan will be extended  to

them.  What I would like to ask the Minister is whether he is

looking at the needs of these teachers who deserve attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would also like to find out from the Minister

whether teachers from independent schools would benefit  from

this CONNECT Plan too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that note, I would like to support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would

like to thank all the Members who spoke for their support  of

the  Bill.   This is an important Bill.  But as  the  Members

have  pointed  out, this is only part of the whole  range  of

weapons, if you like, in the arsenal to try to deal with  the

issue of making sure that we have enough teachers and that we

have good teachers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I explained earlier, we have done a fundamental

review of the teaching career under Edu-Pac.  The recognition

system is part of Edu-Pac and this CONNECT Plan is also  only

one  part  of the recognition scheme.  In Edu-Pac, there  has

also  been  a  revision  in  the whole  career  structure  of

teachers  to have different tracks - the teaching track,  the

professional track and the leadership track.  This  would  go

some  way  to  address some of the concerns  that  have  been

raised  by  Dr  Wang and some of the other Members  who  have

spoken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some specific questions have been raised: whether

monetary incentives are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2257</b></font><br><br>



enough  and whether we have to do many other things to retain

our teachers.  Certainly, we have to do many other things  to

retain  our teachers.  And under Edu-Pac and in the  revision

of  the way that we manage our schools, we intend to do that.

We  are giving a lot more autonomy to our schools.  In  fact,

we  want  to  see  much more initiative and creativity  being

exercised  by the school leadership in the middle  management

as  well as giving teachers more room in order to make use of

new  strategies in the classrooms.  These are all the  things

which  we  want to encourage, and which we want to  see,  and

which  we  believe would also give the teachers  a  lot  more

satisfaction in the kind of work that they do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of workload, this is also an area which we are

very  concerned about, and we watch that carefully.   One  of

the  ways in which we can reduce the workload of teachers  is

really to have more teachers so that there are more shoulders

in  which to spread the load.  Edu-Pac, I believe, will  help

to  ensure  that  we have more teachers in the  schools.   In

fact, I am happy to report to this House that, over the  last

four  to five years, we have actually been able to fill  most

of  the vacancies in the schools.  There are of course always

some  frictional  issues  because teachers  may  leave  at  a

particular  point in time and there will be  some  vacancies.

But  we  have  managed to fill most of the vacancies  in  the

schools.   Not  only  that, we have managed  to  add  to  the

establishments  of  the schools so that, today,  compared  to

five years ago, I would say that, on average, each school has

between five and seven more teachers than they used to  have.

And  each school has three more support staff than they  used

to  have,  compared to five years ago.  So the  situation  of

workload  and support staff is improving.  But there  are  no

magical  solutions.  I cannot click my fingers  and  suddenly

produce tens of thousands of people who will meet the quality

standard that I am sure this House will demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On independent schools, independent school teachers are

not  covered  under the CONNECT Plan because the Ministry  of

Education does not employ them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2258</b></font><br><br>



The  independent schools employ them directly.  What we would

do  is that, in our subvention to the independent schools, we

would  increase the subvention to include what we would  have

given under the CONNECT Plan.  So it is up to the independent

schools to devise their own structures in order to reward the

teachers in the way that they feel is necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do we have all these exclusions in the Bill for the

pay-out from the CONNECT fund?  The reason that we have to do

so  is  basically  because we want to make  sure  that  these

CONNECT pay-outs do not become an entitlement, and that we do

have  provisions in the Act to allow us to withhold  payments

for  good  reasons.  So we include all the  reasons  that  we

think  may  arise  which would result in  us  saying,  "Well,

perhaps  it  is not such a good idea to pay out these  monies

from  the CONNECT fund to this particular teacher because  it

would reflect badly on the service if we were to do so."   So

all these exclusions are there for that purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we taking care of the older teachers? The principle

under  which we will do the pay-outs is this.  First of  all,

this  is new money.  So I do not have funds basically  to  go

back and reward teachers for the last 20, 30, or 40 years  of

service.  But in any case, those teachers would have received

their  fair remuneration for those periods of time.  Teachers

who  are  longer  in the service would also be  generally  on

higher  salary scales because they have had more  increments.

But  what  we  will make sure of in the CONNECT Plan  in  the

design of the pay-outs is that those who have been longer  in

service  will see their pay-outs earlier than those who  have

been shorter in the service.  We will stagger it that way  so

that  the first people to get pay-outs from the CONNECT  fund

will  be  the older teachers.  And then we will schedule  the

younger teachers to receive their pay-outs later.  They  will

all  receive  their pay-in into their own little accounts  at

the same time.  But the older teachers will be the first ones

to be able to draw on their CONNECT fund, and I think that is

quite fair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staff appraisal system is also a very important part of

the system.  We have to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2259</b></font><br><br>



be  able to appraise our staff well in order to put in  place

bonuses,  and  so  on.   Staff  appraisal  is  probably  more

important  for  bonuses and promotions than for  the  CONNECT

Plan  because the CONNECT Plan applies to everybody.  But  we

are  putting in place quite a new staff appraisal system  and

we  are going to introduce some revisions to that also at the

end of this year.  And this is important so that the teachers

will be incentivised to perform well and will not have, as Mr

Noris Ong said, a "pension mentality".  So bonuses, appraisal

systems,  promotions, are the kinds of things which  we  will

make  sure  that teachers will remain motivated  if  they  do

well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On special education teachers, I cannot apply the

CONNECT  Plan  to special education teachers because  special

education  teachers  are  not employed  by  the  Ministry  of

Education and we will not be able to pay them.  I would  have

no standing to pay them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been some suggestions about making use of the

recession to employ more people.  Yes, certainly, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2260</b></font><br><br>



are doing that.  Our recruitment has been excellent over this

past period and our attrition has been relatively low.  But I

am  realistic enough to know that it is not just  because  of

the Ministry of Education, the economy has helped a lot.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that I have answered most of the questions

posed by Members.  And I would just like to thank Members for

giving  me this extra weapon in the arsenal to build  a  good

teaching force.
