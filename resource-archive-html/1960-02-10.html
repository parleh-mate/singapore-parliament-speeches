Minister whether he will make a statement  on  his

recent visit to Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is

little  I can add to the statement signed  by  the

First  Minister of the Republic of  Indonesia  and

myself,  and to the Press conferences  in  Jakarta

and Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to repeat, however, that we

received   the  utmost  courtesy  and  hospitality

during our stay in Indonesia, and look forward  to

the  strengthening of trade and cultural relations

in the months ahead.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  know  how  many of our local experts  went  to

<div align="center"><b>NATIONALISATION OF SINGAPORE TRACTION COMPANY AND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OTHER BUS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>COMPANIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Request for statement on Government policy)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister whether he will make a statement  on  the

policy  of  the  Government  with  regard  to  the

nationalisation of the Singapore Traction  Company

and/or other bus companies in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, on principle, it

is   the  policy  of  the  P.A.P.  Government   to

nationalise  public road transport. When  and  how

nationalisation  of  the  bus  companies  will  be

brought  about must depend on the ability  of  the

Government  to  meet  the  financial  problem   of

compensating the bus companies. In this respect, I

would  like  to  remind the House that  there  are

other  and  more important claims to the financial

resources of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not committed within the next five years

to  bring about this nationalisation, as this  has

not  been  declared as par of our Five-Year  Plan.

Nonetheless, it will be our intention to  organise

and  train an administrative and managerial  staff

to  form  the nucleus for a future Road  Transport

Authority  which will effectively  take  over  the

control   of   public   transport.   This   is   a

prerequisite,  as  the  complicated  machinery  of

running   public  transport  is  not  within   the

capability  of  any Government department  at  the

moment, or, for that matter, of any statutory body

that can be created in the immediate future.

<div align="center"><b>SCHEME OF CHARGING FEES FOR CAR-PARKING IN CITY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AREA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Total revenue collected and total expenditure incurred)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  what  were the total  revenue  collected

from,  and the total expenditure incurred in,  the

operation of the scheme of charging fees for  car-parking in the City area from its commencement  up

to 31st January, 1960.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, since the parking

scheme  was  started  on 21st December  1959,  the

following are the three car parks where  fees  are

charged for parking cars:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raffles Place which contains 113 spaces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fullerton Square - 75 spaces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clifford Pier - 406 spaces.



<br><br>Of   the  three  car  parks,  the  first  two  are

restricted  car-parking  places  where  a  car  is

allowed to park for a maximum period of two  hours

at  40 cents per hour. The third is Clifford  Pier

car  park where cars can park there all day at  20

cents per hour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capital expenditure amounted to $24,107. This

capital expenditure relates not only to the  three

car  parks  mentioned but also to other car  parks

which are now being prepared for future use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 21st December 1959, to 31st January, 1960,

there were 31 working days. The takings were on an

average  of $636 per day. The range was from  $440

per day to $790 per day. The total takings for the

period  amounted  to $19,706. The  expenditure  in

respect  of  salaries,  uniforms,  advertisements,

telephones  and  other miscellaneous  charges  was

$6,584.  There  was  therefore  a  net  profit  of

$13,122  for the period. We hope that in the  next

few  months the profit that we will make  will  be

able to cover the capital expenditure spent on the

car parks.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the

operation of this new scheme, I would like to know

how  many  new  people were employed  and  whether

these  new  employees  were  from  the  Automobile

Association of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The employees who have been

recruited  to  man the car parks are divided  into

two grades: five senior parking attendants and  22

parking   attendants.  All  of  them   have   been

recruited from the Labour Exchange.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah:</b> Could the Minister say, Mr

Speaker, Sir, whether the income from this  scheme

would  be  increased if the Shenton Way  car  park

were to be brought into use?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I mentioned just

now that we have car parks being prepared for

future use, and it is our intention to use the car

park adjacent to Shenton Way in the near future.

<div align="center"><b>TEMPORARY POLICE CONSTABLES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Number and manner recruited, and duties)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Minister

for Home Affairs how many Temporary Police

Constables have been recruited since June 1959, how

were they recruited, and what are the duties

generally performed by them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, 16 Police

Constables have been recruited since June 1959.

Following a Cabinet decision, they were selected by

me and appointed by the Commissioner of Police

under section 19 of the Police Force Ordinance. 13

have completed their training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their duties are to guard Ministers and

Parliamentary Secretaries to whom they are assigned

for security purposes, but they have the ordinary

powers of police officers.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi:</b> Sir, in connection with Question

No. 4, I would like to know whether any of the 16

Temporary Police Constables have been suspended

from duty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> The services of two of these

Temporary Police Constables have been terminated.

<div align="center"><b>VOLUNTARY TEACHERS IN MALAY IN GOVERNMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SPECIAL EVENING CLASSES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> asked the Minister for

Education how many voluntary teachers in  Malay  in

the  Government Special Evening Classes are members

of  the  Singapore Police Force,  and  whether  the

Malay Education Committee had been consulted before

they were accepted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, out of a

total  of 481 teachers who are dealing with Special

Government evening classes in Malay, 201  from  the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



Singapore Police Force offered their services in  a

voluntary capacity as far back as September,  1959,

when  the  Ministry of Education started  its  mass

literacy drive in respect of the national language.

At  that time, the offer made from the Ministry  of

Home  Affairs was in the number of 630, made up  of

450  from Malays, 100 from Chinese, 50 from Indians

and  30  others who were prepared  to  assist  the

Government  in  its  drive. In  October  1959,  the

Minister for Education accepted the voluntary offer

with grateful thanks, considering the fact that the

new  Government had in view a change in  spirit  in

the  new  Police Force. Instead of confining  their

activities to Police duties, they were prepared  to

come  forward to teach those who wish to learn  the

national language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan, who happens to be the

Chairman  of  the Malay Education Committee,  which

assists me in the Ministry, was fully aware of this

decision  and  was also a party to the  discussions

between  the Ministry of Education and  the  Police

Force which took place in November. In January this

year, the Member for Ulu Pandan, as Chairman of the

Malay  Education Committee, conveyed the  decisions

of  the Minister to this Committee and they in turn

suggested  that these voluntary teachers  from  the

Police  Force  should  also  undergo  a  course  of

training just as the hundred-odd untrained teachers

who were recruited by the Ministry of Education  in

September last year had to undergo.

<div align="center"><b>REPORT OF NANYANG UNIVERSITY REVIEW COMMITTEE</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Statement by the Minister for Education



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

speak  on  the  subject of the  Nanyang  University

consequent  upon the presentation to this  Assembly

on 6th February, 1960, of the Report of the Nanyang

University Review Committee headed by Dr  Gwee  Ah

Leng.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Review Committee was appointed by me on

23rd July 1959, to "review the Report submitted by

the  Prescott Commission on Nanyang University and

to  determine  the  extent  and  sequence  of  the

reorganisation deemed necessary." The  appointment

of the Review Committee was in keeping with one of

the  recommendations (except in the manner of  the

composition of its members) contained in the  1959

Prescott    Commission's   Report    on    Nanyang

University, which stated:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We recommend that an Ad Hoc Committee be formed

of  not  more  than seven members,  consisting  of

representatives of the Nanyang University  and  of

the  Government,  to  review  our  Report  and  to

determine   the   extent  and  sequence   of   the

reorganisation deemed necessary."



<br><br>In   view   of   the  findings  of  the   Prescott

Commission, it was considered desirable  that  the

members   of  the  Review  Committee   should   be

outstanding,  in, dependent, local  men,  each  of

whom having distinguished himself in varied fields

of   activity,  for  example,  higher   education,

medicine, journalism and finance. One member  from

the  staff of Nanyang University and another from

the  staff of the Ministry of Education  acted  as

Joint  Secretaries to the Review Committee. It  is

worthy to record, at this stage, that when persons

appointed to the Review Committee were made  known

to  the  public  in July last year, they  received

warm approval from all quarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Report now in the hands of Members of

this  Assembly, you will agree with me, Sir,  that

the  Review Committee had put in considerable work

during  the  four months of its deliberations.  On

behalf  of  the  Government, I wish  to  place  on

record our deep appreciation of their devotion  to

duty  and  sacrifice of time  and  labour  in  the

service of their country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The signed Report was handed to me on 20th

November  1959, and copies have been forwarded  to

the  Federation Government authorities  for  their

information. The Review Committee's findings  are,

in   a   few  words,  reorganisation  of   Nanyang

University with Government support. The  Singapore

Government  now  finds itself in the  position  of

having



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



to carry the whole financial responsibility

of Nanyang University, in addition to its share of

subsidising   the  University   of   Malaya.   The

Singapore Government will face this problem to the

best  of its ability in the interest of the people

and of education of our City State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is regretted that the Nanyang University

authorities  failed  to take  any  positive  steps

towards  the  maintenance  of  academic  standards

during  the recent graduation examination held  in

December,  1959, for its first batch of graduates,

by   not   implementing  the  "external  examiners

system"  which was part of the Nanyang  University

Examination   Regulations  as  approved   by   its

Executive  Council on 3rd July, 1956.  Examination

Regulation 28 (v) states as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Graduation Examination: conducted at the end of

the  course  by a Board of Examiners appointed  by

the  University  and consisting  of  internal  and

external  Professors and specialists. The subjects

and scope of the Graduation Examination shall  be

the  principal  special subjects  in  each  course

together with a thesis. The standard shall be  set

by the Board of Examiners."



<br><br>To  our  knowledge,  no  external  examiners  were

appointed and according to newspaper reports which

are  the  only information we have,  there  was  a

Final  Examination  Board  of  three;  firstly,  a

Member of the Executive Council, and now its Vice-Chancellor; secondly, the Secretary-General of the

Executive Council who is resigning in a few  days'

time;  and thirdly, the Dean of Studies,  who  has

since  resigned  from  Nanyang  and  returned   to

Hongkong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would therefore appear that the first batch

of  graduates  from Nanyang University  have  been

allowed   to   graduate  without  fulfilling   the

requirements of its own Examination regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, up till today, there is no official

published  list of the reported 437 who  graduated

out  of  the 471 students who presented themselves

for   the   Final  Examination.  The  public   is,

therefore, kept in the dark as to who has  or  has

not,   in   fact,  graduated.  In  the   meantime,

graduates  have to seek employment  and  employers

are kept wondering. Even my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



Ministry,  which will be the largest  employer  of

Nanyang   University  graduates,  is  without   an

official  list  of  graduates;  all  we  have  are

stencilled statements of 1959 Final Year students,

with  blue pencil lines drawn across certain names

purporting to be failures!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unknown in any university that such a high

percentage (more than 92 per cent) of the students

would be allowed to pass in the Final Examination.

Again,  another unusual feature appears to  be  no

grading  amongst  those  who  have  passed;   good

students have been thrown in with poor students in

the  same  unclassified lot and thereby penalised.

To the many parents who have saved and stinted for

years  in  order that their children may pursue  a

course  of higher education at Nanyang University,

the  conduct  of the graduation examinations  must

come as a shock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Review Committee came to the core of the

problem when it stated that -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The administration of Nanyang University has

inherited  certain  features from  the  system  of

management in many local Chinese schools. This  is

a  system  where the financiers of the  school  or

their  nominees form the Board of Management which

is  responsible, not only for the appointment  and

dismissal  of staff, but also for the  educational

policy of the school. With men of vision and  good

sense  on  the Board of Management, it is possible

for  such  a school to achieve a higher degree  of

efficiency. On the other hand, it is not  uncommon

for  a Board of Management with good intention but

little  knowledge of education to  interfere  with

the  staffing  and the educational policy  of  the

school   to  such  an  extent  that  progress   is

seriously hampered."



<br><br>The   Review  Committee  clearly  indicated   that

something   is   basically  wrong   with   Nanyang

University.  The  ideals of the  founders  of  the

Nanyang University were admirable. They set out to

establish  a  University to meet  the  demand  for

higher  education  for students from  the  Chinese

secondary  stream  at  a time  when  the  colonial

government  failed  to  do anything.  However,  in

moving towards their goal, the founders, who  have

become  the  Management Committee, were confronted

with  university  problems which their  commercial

and trading



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



experience could not provide the answers, to.  Had

the  previous Government been realistic  in  their

approach to problems, they should have immediately

warned   Nanyang   University,  soon   after   its

establishment, of the dangers arising out  of  the

control of the University by businessmen, who  are

without  the  experience of dealing  with  matters

concerning  higher education. This  misfortune  of

Nanyang  University would not  have  reached  such

proportions  today  had  the  previous  Government

acted in a more responsible manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Nanyang University Ordinance came into

being, Nanyang University was organised and run on

the   basis  of  a  limited  company.  The   major

preoccupation of the Management Committee was  how

to  run  the University without too big an  annual

deficit.  No  doubt  some  $20  million  had  been

promised  to the University, but out of  this  sum

only   $13  million  is  reported  to  have   been

subscribed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its four years of existence, Nanyang

University suffered many setbacks, but  none  more

crippling  than  the lack of expert  planning  and

advice. A group of shrewd businessmen started  the

University with a great deal of initiative, but  a

university  is  an organisation for  learning  and

research  and  not  a  business  enterprise.   The

attitude  which  goes  to make  for  a  successful

business   enterprise  is  not   necessarily   the

attitude  required  for administering  a  seat  of

learning.  In a university, a line must  be  drawn

between  general policy and academic  policy,  and

the latter should be left in the hands of academic

personnel.  In  Nanyang  University,  the  curious

situation  had arisen where the Secretary-General,

who    has    no    acquaintance   of   university

administration,  found  himself  on  all  academic

committees  and also one of the three  members  of

the Final Examinations Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new university could not possibly achieve both

quality  and  quantity in a short space  of  time.

Perhaps   out   of  consideration  for   financial

stability,  quality  has been  sacrificed  in  the

interest of quantity. Further, there appears to be

no proper evaluation of the individual



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



teacher's  qualifications  and  merit.  From   the

Review  Committee's Report, it  appears  that  the

curriculum of Nanyang University shows a  lack  of

systematic planning and proper co-ordination,  and

individual guidance from staff members appears  to

be lacking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then is the Singapore Government's stand on

Nanyang University in view of the findings of  the

Gwee   Ah  Leng  Review  Committee?  Despite   the

critical   findings  contained   in   the   Review

Committee's  Report, the Singapore Government  has

decided to employ Nanyang University graduates and

to  recognise  the Nanyang University  degrees  as

equivalent   to  Pass  Degrees  of  a   recognised

university.  Selection  will,  as  usual,  be   on

individual merits through interview by the  Public

Service  Commission. But in the  public  interest,

the  Singapore Government will have to  reconsider

the  position  if the next graduation examinations

are conducted in this lackadaisical manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next important question is, in what manner

and  under  what  conditions  will  the  Singapore

Government   be   prepared  to   support   Nanyang

University?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the People's Action Party Government's

education  policy is based on parity of  treatment

for the four streams of education in Singapore, it

follows  that the new Government will be  prepared

to support Nanyang University on the same basis as

it  does  the University of Malaya, provided  that

there are similar safeguards as to the maintenance

of proper academic standards and proper accounting

of public monies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Review Committee has recommended certain

reorganisational changes which, if effected, would

result  in  the  following  budget  deficits   for

Nanyang University and which they recommend should

be  met by Government, namely, $606,570 for  1960,

$675,302 for 1961, and $745,034 for 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government has no hesitation in

accepting  its  share of these deficits,  for  the

Singapore students in Nanyang University  who  are

estimated  at  40  per cent of the  total  student

population. The sums involved being:-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>

<pre>

   40% of:

          $606,570 = $242,628 for 1960

          $675,302 = $270,121 for 1961

          $745,034 = $298,014 for 1962.

</pre>

<br><br>However,   since  the  Singapore   Government   is

prepared to accord parity of treatment for Nanyang

University with the University of Malaya, provided

academic  standards are raised and maintained,  we

are  prepared  to shoulder much heavier  financial

commitments.  I  will  now  outline  the   general

principles on which the financial calculations are

based and details are shown in an Appendix to this

statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the 1958 Report of the Joint

Committee on Finance on the University of  Malaya,

appointed by the two Governments of the Federation

and   Singapore,  the  cost  per  student  in  the

University of Malaya, i.e. "per capita basis", was

as follows:-

<pre>

           Arts student     $3,000 p.a.

           Science student  $6,000 p.a.

           Medical student  $8,000 p.a.

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of an estimated student population

of 2,085 for 1960, of which 750 are to be in Kuala

Lumpur  Division and 1,335 in Singapore  Division,

the  deficit  arrived at was $9.2  million,  after

some  adjustment  as shown in the appendix.  Since

the   proportion  of  Singapore  students  at  the

University  of Malaya was agreed at one-third  and

two-thirds  for  the  Federation,  the   Singapore

Government  has agreed to subsidise the University

of  Malaya  to  the  extent of one-third  of  $9.2

million,  or $3.06 million, which sum was approved

under  sub-head  60 in the 1960  Education  budget

recently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we use the same "per capita" cost formula for

Nanyang  University basing on  1959  enrolment  of

1,700  students as the basis for 1960 as well,  we

arrive  at  a  deficit  of $5.286  million.  Since

available facts would indicate that 40 per cent of

Nanyang  University students are  from  Singapore,

the  Singapore Government is prepared to subsidise

40  per  cent  of $5.286 million, or  the  sum  of

$2.115 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is the duty of the Singapore

Government  only to subsidise its own students  at

Nanyang  University, we are however prepared,  for

the time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



being,  to shoulder a greater financial burden  in

order  that  Federation students  now  in  Nanyang

University  may  be  allowed  to  complete   their

studies with the same advantages and facilities as

Singapore students and at the same cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be stated, however, that this proposed

annual  grant  is  in  addition  to  the  $600,000

already  approved under sub-head 54 of the  recent

budget for Bursaries and Scholarships for Nan-yang

University.  But, before any grant  can  be  made,

Government  must be assured that government  funds

are  well  spent and properly accounted  for,  and

that  proper standards in regard to academic staff

and the teaching are maintained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point worthy of mention, at this juncture,

is  the fact that the last Government paid the sum

of  $385,896  on  6th May, 1959,  to  the  Nanyang

University  authorities  to  meet  their  supposed

deficit  for  1958. Payment was made  "subject  to

production   of  audited  accounts  as   soon   as

possible", on the basis of a Statement of  Account

rendered  by  the Chairman and Hon.  Treasurer  of

Nanyang  University Council on 13th  April,  1959,

showing  a deficit of $450,000 out of a budget  of

$1.4 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to state that after three reminders for

the  1958 audited accounts, the last of which  was

on  23rd January, 1960, the audited accounts  were

received by the Ministry of Education only a  week

ago, on 2nd February, 1960, and is now the subject

of    study.   Any   properly   organised   public

institution  working  on  a  budget  of  under  $1½

million per annum should be able to render audited

accounts  within three months. The fact  that  the

Nanyang  University authorities  had  to  take  13

months  to submit audited accounts is a matter  of

concern to the people of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanyang University must therefore be

reorganised,  academic standards must  be  raised,

and  the general policy of Nanyang University must

be  entrusted  to  a  group of  people  with  high

academic  reputation and experience  to  discharge

such  onerous duties, and adequate checks made  on

expenditure and accounts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Singapore Government is alone in

shouldering  the  financial  burden   of   Nanyang

University,  Nanyang University will  have  to  be

reorganised  to  serve  the  needs  of  Singapore.

Therefore  the present policy regarding intake  of

students  from outside Singapore will have  to  be

revised. After all, it is the responsibility of  a

State to provide education for the children of its

own  citizens  and taxpayers, first and  foremost.

However, the Singapore Government will be prepared

to  subsidise non-Singapore students to a total of

15  per  cent of the student population in Nanyang

University. The common practice in other countries

is  to  have less than 5 per cent of the  students

from  outside  their territories. Reorganisational

restrictions, when introduced, will be  applicable

to new entrants only.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With full Singapore Government support for

Nanyang  University,  it is  envisaged  that  even

those  who  fail  to  obtain  bursaries  from  the

Singapore  Government will not find it  impossible

to  benefit from further studies, should  lack  of

finance  be  the  chief obstacle. Therefore,  full

Singapore    Government   support   for    Nanyang

University will result in more students  from  the

poorer classes benefiting from higher education at

Nanyang  University,  than has  been  possible  at

present.  Higher  education  should  not  be   the

preserve of only those who can afford to pay  high

fees,  but  should be thrown open to  as  many  as

possible  who have the mental capacity to  undergo

higher  studies,  so that more  graduates  can  be

turned  out  to  make  their maximum  contribution

towards the betterment of society in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government accepts, in principle,

the main recommendations contained in the Gwee  Ah

Leng   Review   Committee's  Report   on   Nanyang

University.  As stated earlier, we are,  in  fact,

prepared    to   go   even   further   than    the

recommendations  in  applying  the  principle   of

parity of treatment to Nanyang University together

with  the  financial  implications  thereof.   The

question  is,  whether to patch  and  tinker  with

Nanyang  or really to resolve the basic  problems.

We will not shirk our responsibility of supporting

wholeheartedly  the  reorganisation   of   Nanyang

University



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



and  to back it with adequate finance, when it  is

in  the  interest of the people and the  cause  of

education  in  Singapore so to  do.  To  the  many

benefactors who have so generously contributed  to

the  Nanyang University endowment fund, Government

appeals for their continued support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government, on its part, has

decided  to take all the steps necessary  to  make

the  Nanyang University a real university and,  to

this end, would be prepared to spend as much money

on the Nanyang University as it is spending on the

University  of Malaya, on the basis of  parity  of

treatment.  At the same time, in the  interest  of

higher   education  in  Singapore,  the  Singapore

Government will see that positive steps  will  be

taken   to  ensure  closer  co-operation   between

Nanyang  University and the Singapore Division  of

the University of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as we expect the Singapore Division of the

University  of  Malaya, which was  established  to

meet the needs of higher education for the English

stream,  to open its doors to those emerging  from

the  non-English  secondary streams,  so  in  like

manner  Nanyang University, which was  established

to  meet  the  needs of higher education  for  the

Chinese   stream,  should  develop  in  a  similar

fashion  to  absorb  the products  from  the  non-Chinese   secondary   streams.   The   media    of

instruction in the two universities will remain as

they are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years now, the people of Singapore have

been   wondering  what  will  become  of   Nanyang

University  and  its future destiny.  The  present

decision  of the Singapore Government will  settle

their doubt. With reorganisation, students will be

assured of a future and parents can also plan  the

careers of their sons and daughters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the members of the management Committee of

Nanyang  University,  we say  that  the  Singapore

Government  will  welcome  the  holding  of  early

discussions  on the implementation of this  policy

statement  prior  to  reorganisation  of   Nanyang

University as recommended

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara has permitted me to signify  his

recommendation to the Legislative Assembly.  I  beg

leave  to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the explanatory statement

published  with the Bill summarises in considerable

detail  the  main



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



provisions  of  this  Bill. In Committee I shall move certain  amendments  which will not affect the general features of the scheme

embodied  in this Bill. These are the encouragement

of  collective bargaining with a view to  the  free

negotiation  of  collective agreements  on  matters

affecting  the  relations  between  employers   and

employees,   conciliation   to   assist   in    the

negotiations  and,  as far as possible,  to  remove

deadlocks   in   the  negotiations,  and   finally,

arbitration where agreement cannot be reached.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I refer first to collective

bargaining,  because  I wish to  lay  the  greatest

possible  emphasis  upon the importance  that  this

Government attaches to the bargaining provisions of

this Bill. The Government believes in the value  of

freely   negotiated  industrial   agreements   and,

indeed, I venture to say that few will deny that an

agreement  is  the best method whereby  in  a  free

society  the relations between people or groups  of

people  can  be  regulated.  The  proposition  that

people  ought  to observe their agreements  is  one

which commands universal acceptance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, conciliation has proved valuable

in  the  past  and we propose that the services  of

specially   trained  conciliation  officers   shall

continue to be available where this can help  those

endeavouring  to reach agreement.  In  relation  to

this  aspect  of the Bill, I would point  out  that

provision has been made to ensure that negotiations

initiated, as provided in the Bill, are not  unduly

prolonged;  that  collective  agreements  shall  be

enforceable in the same way as arbitral awards; and

that  where negotiations break down or where  there

is  a  refusal  to  negotiate,  there  is  a  means

provided  whereby  disputes  may  be  resolved   by

arbitrable awards. This, Sir, I emphasise,  is  the

way  in  which  the arbitral provisions  should  be

viewed.  One often hears collective bargaining  and

arbitration  spoken  of as if  they  were  mutually

exclusive alternatives. This, Sir, is not  so,  and

we  are providing a system which allows for the co-existence of agreements and awards. If matters work

out  in the way that we hope and expect, agreements

will  be  the rule and awards we hope will  be  the

very rare exception. Fears have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



been expressed that the court will, soon after its

establishment,  be faced with  a  volume  of  work

which  will  be beyond its capacity to dispose  of

expeditiously. I hope that this will not prove  to

be  the  case, but one of the amendments  which  I

shall  move  at a later stage will be designed  to

enable  this position to be controlled  should  it

arise.   I  hope,  however,  that  it  will   not.

Compulsory    arbitration,    unlike    collective

bargaining  and conciliation, is I  admit  new  to

Singapore   and   I   can  well   understand   any

reservations  about it, and indeed any  opposition

to  it  that  may be expressed. On the  employers'

side,  it  invades, for example, their liberty  to

engage  labour at the rates established in a  free

market,  that is, it may force them  to  pay  more

than  they  would  otherwise  have  to  pay.   And

equally, on  the  employees'  side,  it   implies

limitation  on the right to use direct  action  to

obtain the limit of what can be obtained by  trial

of  strength, that is, awards must be accepted. On

the  other  hand, there are correlative advantages

to  both  sides. Awards are a great  safeguard  to

employees   particularly  in  times  of   economic

adversity, and from the employers' point of  view,

there  is  the  assurance that the  system  offers

continuity  of  work and stability  in  industrial

relations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But perhaps the most important consideration is

this.  Strikes and lockouts and other  traditional

forms   of  direct  action  cause  suffering   and

hardship to those involved, and economic  loss  to

the  community  as  a whole on  a  scale  which  a

progressive society, aiming at a happier life  and

higher economic standards for all, cannot tolerate

and  cannot afford. I ask all of those who dislike

the  element  of judicial regulation  involved  in

compulsory arbitration to view the matter  in  the

light o those considerations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we are setting out to do is to

substitute  the  rule of law for the  law  of  the

jungle  in industrial relations, to establish,  in

the words of the first president of the Australian

Arbitration Tribunal, "a new province for law  and

order". But I repeat, Sir, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



rule  of  law never means that one side  can  have

everything  its own way. A system of  law  implies

rights  and  obligations  and  there  can  be   no

enjoyment of the rights without observance of  the

obligations.  What we want to see is  the  general

observance  and  acceptance  of  the  awards   and

agreements by both sides. But, Sir, it will depend

on  the  spirit in which employees and  employers,

and  particularly  their organisations  and  their

leaders,   approach   the   new   system:    their

willingness  to  meet round the bargaining  table,

and  their  preparedness to place their respective

points  of view fairly before the court if matters

go  to arbitration. I appeal to all, who desire to

see   the   establishment   and   maintenance   of

industrial  peace, to approach  the  scheme  in  a

spirit conducive to the achievement of those  good

results  which I am confident it can yield.  As  I

have already said, I know that certain features of

the  Bill  will arouse dislikes and even fears  in

some   quarters;   fears  that  powers   will   be

exercised,  for  example, sc as to impose  ruinous

obligations on employers or savage penalties  upon

trade  unions  of employees. I ask those  who  may

think in that way to believe that experience  will

show that such disasters will not materialise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Court is, of course, tripartite in character.

There will be members nominated by each side drawn

from  panels constituted by the Minister.  But  it

will  be  the  president on whom, if  the  members

differ,  the final decision will rest. It  is,  of

course,  our intention to appoint a man  who  will

have   a  full  sense  of  the  high  duties   and

responsibilities  of  his  office  and  who   will

discharge  his functions in a judicial spirit  and

with due regard to all the factors relevant to and

the  interests  affected by the decisions  of  the

Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be suggested that the president being, as

he  will be, an impartial person may, in the  very

nature  of  things,  have neither  a  trade  union

background such as to enable him to appreciate the

feelings and aspirations of the workers,  nor  the

commercial  experience which will  enable  him  to

understand the problems of management. But  it  is

for this reason



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



among  others that we have provided that  the  two

members  who  will  join  with  the  president  in

constituting the court will be drawn  from  panels

constituted  from  among  the  nominees   of   the

employers'   and   employees'  organisations.   In

selecting  members from the panels for  particular

cases,  the  parties' preferences  will  be  given

effect to. The members will be members in the full

sense, not representatives of the disputants, much

less  advocates for them. Their membership  should

ensure  that no aspect of a case is overlooked  or

not fully appreciated when the court comes to make

its decision. With regard to the representation of

the parties in proceedings before the court, it is

our  belief that this is a function which is  best

performed by officers of trade unions. We have not

limited  it  strictly to officers,  as  clause  62

shows. I shall move certain amendments at a  later

stage  with  the object of making the clause  less

restrictive,   because   it   is   realised   that

particularly in the early stages of the  operation

of the Ordinance some unions may not have officers

equipped  to do this work effectively.  But  in  a

scheme  such as this, the representation of  union

members  in  negotiations  and  before  the  Court

should come to be regarded as the normal function,

indeed  one of the principal functions of a  trade

union  leader.  He has a part to play  within  the

system  and  it  offers him a new  field  for  the

exercise  of  his  talents  and  for  serving  his

members with credit to himself. This, Sir, is  the

consideration  which has led us  to  provide  that

there  will  not be representation by an  advocate

and   solicitor  in  arbitral  proceedings.   This

provision is not intended as any reflection on the

legal profession. Indeed we know that if the  Bill

permitted it, professional representation would be

very frequently availed of. One difficulty relates

to  a matter always close to a lawyer's heart,  as

the  Member  for Farrer Park very well knows,  and

that  is  the question of costs; and the  workers'

organisations  could  be in real  difficulties  if

they  were confronted by Counsel on the other side

as  they have not the resources to pay for similar

representation.  This, however, is  not  the  main

reason why the Bill



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



proposes  as  it does. It is desired to  encourage

union officials particularly on the workers'  side

to  handle  their union affairs. On the employers'

side,  the  larger  employers already  include  on

their  staff  officers  who  are  specialists   in

industrial relations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, it must be pointed out that

proceedings   before   the   Court   relating   to

industrial  matters are not judicial  proceedings.

The  judicial  function is the  ascertainment  and

enforcement of rights under the law. The  arbitral

function  involves the determination of  what  the

rights  and  duties are to be in the  future.  The

arbitrator's role is closer to that of the parties

when  they negotiate an agreement than that  of  a

judge  when he decides the matter litigated before

him.  Indeed,  if there is an analogy,  it  is  to

delegated legislation. When this is realised,  the

exclusion of professional representation assumes a

different   aspect.  Likewise,  the  question   of

appeals.  It  will be noted that an award  is  not

subject   to   review  except  by  the  Industrial

Arbitration  Court itself upon an application  for

variation.  If  there were to be  a  review,  this

would not be a function of a court of law for  the

reason that I have just explained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have referred to fears that may exist that the

Court  may, through  inexperience,  do  something

which  could involve us all in economic  disaster.

The Court is empowered by clause 32 to have regard

to  the  interest of the community as a whole  and

the  condition  of the economy of the  State.  The

Court  includes members who will be aware of these

considerations. Strong advocacy in the Court  will

ensure that such considerations are put before the

Court.   The  Court  is  empowered  to  vary   its

decisions  where sufficiently strong  reasons  are

advanced. Finally, the President will, as  I  have

said,  be  a responsible man chosen with the  full

realisation  of  the importance of  the  Court  in

relation  to the economy. As the system  develops.

it could be that we may have to have more than one

Court  to deal with matters in the first instance.

If that happened, the question of an appeal system

would arise, but any appeal would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



naturally be to another arbitral body and  not  to

the  ordinary courts. However, all that is for the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has received the very careful

consideration of myself and all my colleagues.  We

have  had the benefit of advice and experience  in

the  planning  and  in  the  drafting  stage  from

Australia, where industrial arbitration  has  been

in  operation for over sixty years. But we do  not

claim  that  the Bill is perfect  and  we  do  not

believe  that the Ordinance will operate  for  any

great  length of time without amendments. We will,

of  course, watch its operation most carefully and

I draw the attention of this Assembly to clause 87

under  which the President is required  to  report

annually to the Government on the working  of  the

arbitration system. In this, we have followed  the

Australian law where a similar provision  provides

a  regular opportunity to review the operation  of

the  system. I assure this House that we will give

very careful consideration to these reports and to

representations  made  to  us,  and  we  will  not

hesitate to introduce amending legislation if  the

need to do so is shown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have also decided to leave

the  Services  and  their  employees  out  of  the

provisions of this Bill. This is because our State

is fully self-governing in internal affairs but is

not a sovereign State as far as external relations

and  internal  security are  concerned.  For  that

reason,  we are in no position to pass  any  local

legislation  binding on Her Majesty's  Government.

That  being  so,  we consider  that  it  would  be

advisable  to leave it to the Services  and  their

employees to decide whether they would freely wish

to  avail  themselves  of the  machinery  we  have

provided  in  this  Bill  for  the  settlement  of

industrial  disputes, and it would be up  to  them

therefore to decide whether they would freely come

in  or keep out altogether. In this connection,  I

have   been   advised   by  the   United   Kingdom

Commissioner  in  Singapore, with  whom  both  the

Prime  Minister  and I have had discussions,  that

the United Kingdom departments are not opposed  in

principle to the objects of the Bill, since indeed

arbitration



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



courts  have  for  long been a normal  feature  of

civil  service negotiating machinery in the United

Kingdom.  I have also been informed by the  United

Kingdom  Commission here that the  United  Kingdom

departments  could  not,  however,  agree  to  the

Bill's  application without modification to  cover

certain  aspects  which  are  governed  by  United

Kingdom statute or practice and are not within the

direct  competence of the United  Kingdom  Service

departments functioning in Singapore. I hope  that

it  will  be possible in the near future  for  the

United  Kingdom Service departments  to  reach  an

agreement  with their employees on the application

of the Bill on such terms as may be agreed between

them,  and, if such agreement is not possible,  to

settle their problems by other amicable means.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I commend this Bill to the

Assembly and I do move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Minister has given us reasons why he considers

such a Bill is necessary at the present time,  and

while  we do not disagree with him on some of  the

reasons,  we  do feel that certain  provisions  in

this  Bill go far beyond what is required. I  will

therefore go through this Bill and point  out  the

various clauses where I feel that amendments  have

to  be made in order to make it more effective  or

less reprehensible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, towards the end of his speech, the Minister

tells  us why it has been necessary that employees

in  Service  departments have to be excluded  from

the operation of this Bill, but that if they, of

their own accord, desire to enjoy the operation of

this Bill they may do so. It therefore means, Sir,

if  I  read the definition of "employee" correctly

in  page  2 of the Bill, that officers or servants

of  the  Singapore Government are for the purposes

of this Ordinance "employees". If that is so, Sir,

then the definition of "employer" will have to  be

amended   because  the  definition  of  "employer"

restricts  the  class or classes  of  officers  or

servants  in the employment of the Government.  On

the one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



hand - as  I  have  said, if I read it  aright   - all

employees of the Government are employees, but  on

the  other hand, the Government as an employer  is

not an employer of all its employees.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> On a point of information, Sir. I

think the Member for Cairnhill is not aware of the

amendments of which we have given notice.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I might remind the Member

for Cairnhill that we are on the Second Reading of

the  Bill and I trust that he will not go into the

details  of his amendments or the details  of  the

clauses,  because paragraph (2) of Standing  Order

67 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'On the order for the second reading of a Bill

being read, a motion may be made "That the Bill be

now  read  a second time", and a debate may  arise

covering the general merits and principle  of  the

Bill.'



<br><br>There have been several notices of amendments sent

in, and I trust that the Member for Cairnhill will

be  patient  and  wait until the  Committee  stage

before commenting in detail on the clauses.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I understand that, but this is in relation to

the   principle  whether  all  employees  of   the

Government are employees for the purposes of  this

Ordinance and I am a little puzzled as to  whether

they  are or they are not. If they are, then  well

and  good:  if they are not, then I have something

to say on principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see that one of the most important clauses

in  this  Bill  is  clause 62. The  Minister  gave

reasons why trade unions should not be represented

by  an advocate and solicitor. While I agree  with

him  on those reasons, I cannot help but say that,

previous to the tabling of this Bill, trade unions

have   found  it  not  only  desirable  but   also

effective  that they should be represented  by  an

advocate and solicitor who knows what is going  on

in the trade union field and who is, shall we say,

au fait with almost all labour legislation to help

them  in  arguing  conciliation cases  or  in  the

courts.  It  seems,  Sir,  that  the  trade  union

leaders  of  the  P.A.P. who  are  advocates  and

solicitors as well now feel that such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



a  thing  should not be allowed because, in  their

view, the trade union leaders themselves are quite

capable of carrying out their functions in arguing

a  case  in the Arbitration Court. Sir, I  do  see

that  in  denying  a  trade  union  the  right  of

employing  an  advocate and solicitor  to  present

their  case  in  court  the employer  is  also  so

barred,  but  then,  as the Minister  himself  has

said,   most  employers  have  employed  personnel

managers  who are well trained and are specialists

in  their  jobs. But I do not think that the  same

can  be said of all the trade unions in Singapore.

There  are  some  officers  of  trade  unions,  of

course,  who  are  quite capable  of  representing

their unions. But there are many - many more - who are

not in that position. Therefore, I feel, Sir, that

for  the  present,  as  the Minister  himself  has

indicated  that this law has to be tried  out  and

amendments may be found necessary, that until  all

the  trade union officers have enough training  to

represent   their  unions  on   their   own,   the

assistance   of  an  advocate  and  solicitor   in

representing the case of trade unions  before  the

Arbitration Court should be allowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am wondering whether the Minister, because

he  has  said  that he has several  amendments  to

submit  during  the Committee stage  in  order  to

strengthen  the Bill, would agree  to  refer  this

Bill to a Select Committee. If he does, then there

is no need for a lengthy debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one is not so clear in regard to Part III,

particularly  clauses 18 and 20. According  to  my

reading  of these two clauses in relation to  this

Part of the Bill, when the Commissioner for Labour

himself  is  notified by a trade union of  workmen

that  it  has submitted a request to the  employer

for  negotiations, he must notify the Minister but

he  cannot  notify  the Registrar  of  the  Court,

unless the Minister so directs. We can understand,

Sir,  why  that clause is necessary,  because  the

Minister  feels that he may consider it  necessary

that  a further attempt at conciliation under  his

chairmanship or under the chairmanship of somebody

appointed  by  him may help to resolve  the  trade

dispute.  But there is nothing, Sir, in this  Part

of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



Bill  to  say  that  if such  an  attempt  by  the

Minister  has  resulted in failure,  the  Minister

shall  direct  the  Commissioner  to  notify   the

Registrar  of the Court. One can say  that  it  is

implied in those words, but I feel that it has  to

be  inserted into the clause in order to  make  it

abundantly  clear  that  if  any  attempt  by  the

Minister   to   bring  about   a   settlement   by

conciliation   results  in   failure,   then   the

Commissioner  shall  be  directed  to  notify  the

Registrar of the Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24, Sir, is rather complicated. This

clause   brings  in  the  question  of   a   union

submitting a notice to more than one employer,  or

more  than  one union sending in a  notice  for  a

collective  agreement to one employer. The  clause

is  a bit puzzling. It brings in the question that

unless  all the employers or all the trade  unions

have  reached  agreement,  the  matter  should  be

referred to the Commissioner for Labour.  I  think

it  would be desirable, if one trade union has  to

submit  three notices to three separate employers,

and  if  agreement  has been reached  between  the

trade  union  and  one employer, that  the  matter

should be taken out of this clause. But if  it  is

not  so, whether or not agreement has been reached

between  a trade union and one employer, all  that

must be reported to the Commissioner for Labour. I

think that clause requires amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see, Sir, that in regard to the President of

the Court, he shall be appointed on the advice  of

the  Prime  Minister. But in regard to the  Acting

President,  who  is to have the  same  duties  and

functions  of the President, he is to be appointed

on the advice of the Minister for Labour. I do not

see  why  it  should  be  necessary  to  have  two

appointing bodies. If it is going to be the  Prime

Minister, why not make him the appointing body for

both appointees? Or the Minister for both?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the qualifications of a member of

the  Panel. I feel that anyone who is a  Committee

member  of  any  political party  or  any  of  its

branches  should be disqualified from  serving  on

the  Panel. The Minister has said that the members

on  the  Panel  are not there to  look  after  any

particular interest - that I accept. They are  there

with an open



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



mind  to  try  and understand the problems  before

them  and to consider them in the light of  clause

32,  whether or not it is in the economic interest

of  the  country  that any improvements  in  their

wages  and  salaries should be made. I  feel  that

Committee members of political parties should  not

be on this Panel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have learnt during my few years of service

in  this  House that the power to appoint  carries

with  it the power to remove. But I see in  clause

9,  the  removal  of a person from  the  Panel  in

certain  instances by the Minister, and  in  other

instances by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara (obviously

on  the  advice of the Minister). Surely, Sir,  if

removal  is necessary of any member of the  Panel,

the Minister should have that power to remove such

members.  He need not have to advise the Yang  di-Pertuan Negara to remove anybody who, according to

sub-clause (2) of clause 9, has become permanently

incapable of discharging his functions. Surely  if

he   has   become  "permanently  incapable",   the

Minister  can say. "Well, sorry. You cannot  serve

because  you are permanently incapable." There  is

no  need  to  ask  the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  to

declare   that,  because  a  member   has   become

permanently  incapable, he  cannot  serve  on  the

Panel.  But I think why the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

has  been  brought into this matter  to  remove  a

member  of the Panel is because of sub-clause  (2)

(b):  that  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara is  of  the

opinion  that that member is not a fit and  proper

person  to  be selected to constitute  the  Court.

Sir,  before  any  nominee  of  the  Trades  Union

Congress or any nominee of the employer's side  is

appointed  by the Minister to serve on the  Panel,

the  Minister, under clause 6 sub-clause (6), must

be  of  the opinion that that person is a fit  and

proper  person. If he is a fit and  proper  person

before his appointment how can he become not a fit

and  proper person after his appointment? It could

only lead to speculation that such a case can only

arise  if that member on the Panel does not  carry

out  his duties to the wishes or to the liking  of

the government of the day. I do not think that  is

so. I do not believe that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



it  is  so.  Therefore, I would suggest,  "Let  us

carry  on  with the normal way of legislating - that

the  power to appoint will carry with it the power

to remove."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to clause 23, Sir, in the case of

trade  unions  which have reached  agreement  with

their employers, they must prepare a memorandum of

the  terms  of  agreement and  submit  it  to  the

President  of the Court. But there is  nowhere  in

this clause which says that it can be submitted in

either  of  the four languages of Singapore - Malay,

English, Chinese or Tamil. But in another  clause,

clause 45 (2), the Registrar shall cause copies to

be  made in these four languages. I am sure,  Sir,

that  it  is just an oversight, and it is not  the

intention  of the Minister that the memorandum  of

the  terms  of agreement reached between  a  trade

union and the employer must be in English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 31 is, I think, going a bit too

far - giving   unnecessary   protection    to    the

Government. Clause 31 says that before a matter or

a  trade  dispute  between the  Government  as  an

employer and its employees can be arbitrated upon,

the President must get the sanction of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. But the matter cannot come  before

the  Court;  the Court cannot have cognizance  of

such  a trade dispute unless the two parties, i.e.

Government  on the one side and its  employees  on

the  other, both agree to refer the matter to  the

Court,   or   where  the  Minister   directs   the

Commissioner for Labour that such a trade  dispute

should  be notified. Once the Commissioner has  so

notified  the  Court  through the  Registrar  that

there is a trade dispute between the Government as

an  employer and its employees, surely,  Sir,  the

Court  should  go  ahead without  getting  another

"green  light", shall we say, from  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure is, I understand, that if a trade

union and an employer cannot reach an agreement in

negotiations,  then  the Commissioner  for  Labour

will have a try. He will ask conciliation officers

to  bring  the  two  parties together  to  try  to

conciliate  to reach agreement. If  he  fails,  he

will then tell the Minister, "I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



failed." The Minister, again, can under clause  21

say,  "All right. I think there should be  further

conciliation." He steps in, either with he himself

as  the chairman or somebody appointed by him. And

then if he finds that he has failed, he says, "All

right.  Refer  to the Court." Then  the  President

will  have another try. Sir, this is dragging  the

matter  unnecessarily. The  Commissioner  has  one

try, the Minister for Labour has one try, and when

it  reaches  the Court, I think the  Court  should

straightaway  sit and arbitrate  on  the  dispute,

instead of having a further try. As we know,  Sir,

the  longer a dispute is left to exist,  the  more

heart-aches there will be between disputants. So I

feel  that,  once the Commissioner for Labour  has

had his trial, and the Minister for Labour and Law

has had his second trial, the President should not

be  given  the power to say that there  should  be

another  trial.  I feel that the Court  should  go

straight ahead arbitrating on the trade dispute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I read in the Press that the Trades Union

Congress  have called a meeting of its constituent

members  to seek their views on this Bill,  but  I

have  not  read in the Press any more whether  the

Trades Union Congress have made representations to

the   Minister   or  whether  the   Minister   has

considered such representations, and that  in  the

light  of  such representations, he  is  going  to

submit  amendments during the Committee  Stage  of

the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that this is a very important Bill. It

is  a  Bill  designed  to bring  about  industrial

peace. Everyone wants that. We know that in  1956,

1957 and 1958, because there was no such Bill  and

because there were no restrictions on trade unions

on  strikes,  there had been a lot  of  industrial

unrest.  The  Government may be profiting  by  the

experience of their own sins in the past  and  may

now  have  realised  that to  foster  strikes  and

encourage   trade  unions  to  go  to  the   limit

irrespective of the economy of the country is  all

wrong,  and that such things should not be allowed

to take place again. And I even find, under clause

83,  that  an officer of a trade union  cannot  go

into a place of work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



to talk about trade union matters. I think it is a

good thing. But then I cannot help but say that it

was  because of an officer of a trade union  being

refused  by  an employer to go into the  place  of

work  to talk to members of a trade union on trade

union matters that the union called a strike,  and

that  particular union had for its  legal  adviser

the  Hon. the  Prime  Minister.  Maybe  they  are

learning their mistakes, or learning the folly  of

their  ways,  and  they think that  such  a  thing

should  not be repeated. I am with them.  I  think

they are right now and that they were wrong in the

past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is this clause 37, sub-clause (2)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- it is a bit difficult to understand why it is

necessary. Now, it is right that there  should  be

protection  to ensure that the employer  does  not

get  out  of  an  award by just  transferring  his

business to somebody else. If an employer  employs

a  devious  method of getting out of an award,  he

should  not  be  allowed to do so. That  I  agree,

under clause 37 (1) (d), that is, any successor or

any  assignee or transmittee shall be bound by the

award. But I cannot understand the purpose of sub-clause (2) of clause 37. What it means is this, if

I  have read it right. If A starts a business  at,

say,  No.  51 Neil Road, and then later  he  finds

that  he cannot carry on any longer and he  closes

the  shop.  Then another man starts a business  at

the  same  address  and  does  the  same  kind  of

business.  Even though he may have  no  connection

whatsoever  with  A, he is to  be  bound  by  this

award - just  because he happens to  find  that  the

premises  are  suitable for his business.  He  may

have his own set of employees. He may have removed

his  business  from a different  address  to  this

address - to  No.  51 Neil Road,  for  the  sake  of

argument. Is it intended that he should  be  bound

by  the award - he, who has no connection whatsoever

with the previous employer who was a party to this

award?  I  think  it  is wrong  to  encourage  the

premises to be left vacant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do feel, Sir, that this Bill should be

referred to a Select Committee, and I am sure that

trade  unions  and  employers alike  will  greatly

welcome  the opportunity to submit representations

to this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



Select  Committee  in  order  to  make  this  very

important labour legislation a welcome one by  all

sides.  I would urge upon the Government to  refer

the Bill to a Select Committee.



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in connection

with  the Industrial Relations Bill which  is  now

being debated, I wish to support the findings  and

views  of  the Member for Cairnhill and hope  that

this  Bill will be referred to a Select Committee,

because,  Mr Speaker, from the opinions expressed

by  the  Member for Cairnhill, there is  no  doubt

that  there are many matters which require further

consideration, and this coincides  with  the  fact

that  the Government itself has given notice of  a

number  of amendments. It is therefore appropriate

that    this    Bill    should   receive    proper

consideration.  At  the same time  referring  this

Bill   to   a  Select  Committee  will   give   an

opportunity to the trade unions to study it.  They

have  had no opportunity to have close connections

with the Government and are in the dark as to  the

contents  of this Bill. They can give their  views

to  the  Select  Committee  in  the  interests  of

industrial peace in Singapore.



<br><br>4.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche M. Ismail Rahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche M. Ismail Rahim (Geylang East)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr   Speaker,  I  fully  support  the  Industrial

Relations Bill because the Government have carried

out  a careful investigation into this matter  and

have  reached an agreement with influential  trade

union leaders. Mr Speaker, the Government side is

aware  of  all  the matters affecting  this  Bill.

Furthermore,  it  is also aware that  the  working

class  has  been oppressed and suppressed  by  the

employers  whose  objective is to  cause  disunity

among  the trade unions. Such was the fate of  the

labour  movement in the past. The labour  movement

was  designed to create unity so that the  workers

could  earn a living for their families and  their

children.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this Bill, Mr Speaker, is to help

the  labour  movement. This  Government  has  many

trade  union  leaders  on its  side  who  are  now

leading  their  fellow workers in the  unions.  In

addition,   we   on   this   side   realise    our

responsibilities  towards  the  labour   movement.

Therefore, we wish to safeguard the freedom of the

labour  movement  in future so that  it  will  not

deteriorate  as  it did in the  past.  Hence,  Mr

Speaker, I fully support this Industrial Relations

Bill.



<br><br>4.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, the

Industrial Relations Bill is, in fact, one of  the

outstanding  Bills introduced by this  Government.

Before I go into the details of this Bill, I would

like to mention certain things. When this Bill was

first  introduced into this Assembly,  the  Trades

Union  Congress and 16 unionists read  through  it

very  carefully, and afterwards submitted  certain

amendments to the Minister for Labour and Law.  At

the  same  time, the Federation of  Employers  and

other  employers  also went into  this  Bill  very

thoroughly,   and   they   submitted   a   20-page

memorandum to the Minister for Labour and Law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade union side read this Bill through very

carefully.  We  had the opportunity  to  meet  the

Minister for Labour and Law. In fact, we discussed

the  Bill clause by clause, and also discussed the

amendments  which  will  be  introduced   at   the

Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main aim of this Bill is to stabilise the

relations between employer and employee in a  more

practical  way  with regard to trade  disputes  in

Singapore. This Bill, in fact, is in line with our

Party's  policy which we put before the people  of

Singapore during the elections. And, of course, we

then  mentioned  categorically that  our  aim  was

industrial peace with justice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was hearing the speech of the Member for

Cairnhill,  I  thought he was  going  to  make  an

outburst  against this Bill. In fact, he  had  not

much to say. He just took clause 50. When the  Minister made his speech earlier, he had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



said  that  he  would make certain  amendments  to

clause  50,  and therefore clause 50  is  no  more

valid.  Even if he makes capital out  of  it,  the

trade   unionists  cannot  carry  on  their  union

activities  in  their  working  place.  When   the

amendment is introduced, that part is deleted.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member mention the clause?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> Clause 50 of the Bill, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Clause 50?



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen:</b> I am sorry, Sir. It is clause 83.

When the Minister introduces this amendment at the

Committee  stage, that part will  not  be  in  the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we took office in June 1959, Sir, and

basing on the present Industrial Relations Bill or

other  Ordinances  pertaining to labour  disputes,

neither   the   Minister  nor  his   Parliamentary

Secretary  nor  the civil servants of  the  Labour

Ministry  have  been in a position  to  force  the

employer to come to any sort of agreement with the

employees  when they submitted demands for  better

wages  and  working conditions. But we  are  quite

proud of the way in which the Minister dealt  with

labour  disputes  during the  last  six  or  seven

months  as  compared with the  way  in  which  the

Member  for  Cairnhill, when he was  Minister  for

Labour  and  Welfare, dealt with  labour  disputes

during his four and a half years of office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unions in their day-to-day dealings with the

employers usually meet two categories of employers

in  Singapore.  One  is the unscrupulous  type  of

employers,  and when the P.A.P. took  office  they

quite  understood  the P.A.P.'s  policy - industrial

peace  with  justice. The behaviour of  the  trade

unions   for   the  last  six  months   has   been

creditable.  I  should like to say here  that  the

trade  unions,  as a whole, stick to  the  Party's

policy  and they behave quite responsibly in  that

respect.  But  the employers, on the  other  hand,

took  advantage of the situation. They  said  that

since   the   P.A.P.   Government's   policy   was

industrial peace with justice, they would make use

of   the  fact,  thinking  that  the  trade  union

movement  would one day or other go  against  this

Government and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



create  industrial disturbances in  Singapore.  To

deal  with this situation, therefore, we must have

some kind of legislation to pin down this type  of

employers, and that is the main reason why we, the

trade unions, support this Bill in principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is going to move an amendment in clause 28, and when this amendment is made, most

of  the fears of the trade unions will be removed.

Clause  28  deals  with  the  question  when  both

parties jointly request arbitration. Paragraph (b)

of  clause  28  will be deleted when the  Minister

moves  his amendment. Why I say the trade  unions'

fears will be partly removed is this. There  is  a

time  lapse when negotiation fails and  the  court

takes  cognizance of the trade dispute; and during

this  period  the trade unions are at  liberty  to

take  industrial  action against their  employers.

But the important point is this - that the court  is

only going to take cognizance of the trade dispute

after  the Minister informs the court. Of  course,

we  agree  in  principle that when the  matter  is

referred   to  the  court  there  should   be   no

industrial action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again in this Bill, if any collective

agreement is reached between both parties and that

agreement is registered with the court, it has the

effect of an award. In the situation in Singapore,

Sir,  we  find  in most cases that when  employers

negotiate  with  employees  and  reach  a  certain

agreement, and when the time comes for them to put

their  signature on the agreement,  the  employers

just  say, "No, we are not going to sign  it."  So

many  of  these cases are happening, even  in  the

Labour Ministry. A union submitted a claim.  Their

employers  negotiated with  them  and  reached  an

agreement.  But  when  the  time  came   for   the

employers to put their signature on the' agreement

and  make  it  valid,  the union  found  that  the

employers just flatly refused to sign and were not

going to adhere to what they had agreed during the

negotiations.  At the present moment,  in  such  a

situation, either the unions will have to call for

industrial action or go to the Ministry of  Labour

and Law. And if they go to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



the  Ministry  of Labour and Law on  the  existing

rules   and  regulations,  the  Minister  or   his

Parliamentary  Secretary  or  anybody  cannot   do

anything, because the law is such and they  cannot

go  beyond  the law. But when this Bill is  passed

and an agreement is reached, it is notified to the

Registrar of the Court and the Registrar  will  in

turn  inform  the  President  who  will  sign  the

agreement, and that agreement will be valid for l½

years or 2 years or 3 years, or whatever period is

agreed between the union and the employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important fact is this. We find that there

are  people who take an active part in  the  trade

union  movement  for their selfish  interest.  The

employers  know the situation well and easily  buy

these people over with prize appointments, so that

they  will become black-legs or traitors to  their

union;  and  when  the union submits  demands  and

something  is achieved, these people are benefited

both ways:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Being traitors to the union, they will get

prize appointments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) When the union makes an agreement with the

employers, they will get the same benefit.



<br><br>But  one  important fact to strengthen  the  trade

union movement is this. So far, when a trade union

puts up a demand and an agreement is signed, or it

goes  to  arbitration and an award is  made,  that

award  is only applicable to members of that trade

union.  That  is  now going to be amended  by  the

Minister.  That one clause is very  important  for

the  growth  of a healthy trade union movement  in

this  country. Knowing that position, no employees

can  loyally work for an employer, or be  traitors

to  the union. If they do, then the union is in  a

position  to  say  that these  employees  are  not

eligible  for that award for which the  union  has

fought so hard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the amendments which are going to

be  introduced by the Minister, I think, Sir,  the

majority of the trade unions in Singapore will  be

happy about this Bill. For the last six months



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



the  trade unions have shown a considerable amount

of   responsibility  and  cooperation   with   the

Government.  At  the same time, the  Minister  for

Labour and Law and the whole of his Ministry  have

tried  their level best to bring about  industrial

peace  with justice. The trade union movement  has

complete confidence in the present Government, and

especially in the Ministry of Labour and  Law,  in

seeing  that this Bill, when it is passed and  put

into  operation,  will surely  benefit  the  trade

union movement as a whole, and any fears among the

trade  union  movement, if  there  are  any,  will

easily be removed.



<br><br>4.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  this Bill which we have before the House  is

an  important piece of legislation and we must pay

tribute to the Minister for Labour and Law who has

done  so  much during these last eight months  for

the  labour movement. We know that since  he  took

office  in  June  last year he has  fulfilled  the

promise  of  getting a Trade Union House  for  the

labour movement. He has also introduced a Bill  to

eliminate yellow and splinter unions so  that  the

labour movement could be strengthened and be in  a

better   position  to  bargain  collectively   and

achieve better things from the employers.  And  we

know that his Ministry has also been seeing to  it

that  the  legislation which has been in force  is

being carried out. No one can deny that during the

less  than nine months since the P.A.P. Government

has been in control, there have been confidence in

the Government and industrial stability. This Bill

seeks   to  promote  stability  so  that   capital

development  and  industrial  expansion  could  be

carried   out.   We  all  know  of   the   growing

unemployment  in Singapore. We all know  that,  to

survive, we have to industrialise; and we all know

that  no  one  will invest money unless  there  is

stability.   This   piece  of   legislation   will

encourage  such capital development and industrial

expansion. At the same time, this Bill  will  also

ensure that the worker gets his fair share of  the

fruits of his labour.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Cairnhill has mentioned just

now that if the Industrial Relations Bill had been

in existence there would not have been disorder or

industrial unrest during 1955, 1956 and 1957. I am

glad he has realised that the introduction of this

Bill will be good for the country.



<br><br>4.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

it  would be very interesting to speculate on what

would   have  happened  had  such  a   Bill   been

introduced three or four years earlier. I  venture

to  suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, that if  this  Bill

had  been in force four years ago, quite a lot  of

the  Members  sitting opposite me might  not  have

been  in  this  Assembly. However, these  are  all

matters  of  speculation. Any one's guess  may  be

right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thing is that we are here this

afternoon to debate the principle involved in this

Bill.  Speaking for myself and for Members in  the

Opposition,  I think it is a good Bill.  It  is  a

genuine  attempt  by the Government  to  hold  the

balance  equally  between  the  employer  and  the

employee in the interests of the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seems to be the principle underlying this

Bill'.   It  is  a  principle  accepted   by   the

Opposition, and if anyone says it should have been

implemented earlier he may be right or he may  not

be  right.  It may be that four or five years  ago

the  time was not opportune. Perhaps this  is  the

golden moment when it should be introduced and the

golden moment is in the hands of the Minister  for

Labour and Law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, in seeking to bring- about

industrial  peace  and good relationships  between

employees  and  employers, a principle  which  has

been  accepted in the past is being departed  from

and  a  new principle is being introduced.  It  is

important  not only to the employees but  also  to

the  employers that this Bill should be a success,

because it is vital to the survival of the  State.

So  I think, Mr Speaker, Sir, that all aspects of

this Bill should be very carefully considered. The

Hon. the Minister for Labour and Law himself said

that he and his Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



had  given this Bill a great deal of thought  even

before they put it down as Bill No. 61. Apparently

on  this matter, the Government was assisted by an

Australian expert loaned to them by the Australian

Government.  But at this late stage this  morning,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the Minister  has  filed  very

important  amendments which, to my mind,  somewhat

disturb the original balance held in the Bill. The

amendments  to  be moved are important.  The  Bill

itself   is   sufficiently  important,   but   all

interested  opinion  on  this  matter  should   be

consulted  before a new system whereby  industrial

peace  may  be  achieved is to be  implemented.  I

would  therefore ask the Minister for  Labour  and

Law  to consent to this Bill being referred  to  a

Select  Committee in order that that end might  be

achieved. But if the Minister feels that he  would

not  permit it to go to a Select Committee,  could

he  consider deferring the Committee stage of this

Bill  in  order  that further  and  more  adequate

representation be made to him before final  action

is  taken  by the Assembly? The Minister  himself,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, did not indicate to  the  House

what  representations had been made to him, either

by  employers  or employees, but  the  Member  for

Telok  Blangah, who seems to be very well-informed

in  these  matters, made so bold as  to  say  that

representations had been made. But in  so  far  as

the Minister himself is concerned, he has not made

any  statement  to  the House  as  to  what  those

representations were.



<br><br>4.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Bill

because  it  contains  provisions  whereby   small

unions  can  be  given the opportunity  to  derive

benefits  as  a  result of negotiations  with  big

employers.  With the existence of this Bill,  such

unions can fight in the interest of their members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague the Member for Telok Blangah has

pointed  out  just  now, only  employees  who  are

members  of  unions  will stand  to  benefit  from

agreements signed with their employers. This is  a

matter which employees should be proud



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



of,   because   hitherto  all  employees   derived

benefits  as  a  result  of  negotiations  between

employers and trade unions, despite the fact  that

some  of  them were non-members of the unions.  We

know  that  such people are obstructionists.  They

hinder  a healthy labour movement. When this  Bill

is  enacted, these opportunists will no longer  be

able  to  derive  benefits from agreements  signed

with their employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Cairnhill stated that

under  this  Bill,  if, for instance,  a  business

concern  at No. 51 Neil Road, came to an agreement

with  its employees and it became bankrupt  months

later,  its successor would have to abide  by  the

agreement  reached earlier. It  was  the  practice

during the past Government for a business concern,

after   having  reached  an  agreement  with   its

employees, to wind up its business on the  pretext

of  bankruptcy. Then a few months later, this firm

would establish itself under a different name  and

under  a different management board; but the  fact

is that the same persons managed the new firm. The

reason  for  that  is that they  wished  to  avoid

paying the benefits to their employees. Therefore,

with  the  existence of this Bill, I am sure  that

the  employers who had been encouraged by the past

Government to indulge in such malpractices will no

longer  be  able to get an opportunity to  oppress

their employees in such a manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park said just now that if

this Bill had been enacted four or five years  ago

those trade union leaders who are now on this side

of  the House would surely not be here today.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, I would like to explain the stand of

the  trade  unionists  who are  in  this  Assembly

today. Their stand is different from that taken by

the  Member for Farrer Park. In the last election,

he  stood as an Independent candidate, but when he

was  returned, he became an S.P.A. member. But the

stand  of the trade unionists on this side of  the

House  has never wavered. There is no doubt  that,

in  spite of the fact that some of them are on the

Government  side,  they  will  still  continue  to

struggle in the interest of the workers,  as  they

have  done previously. We do not switch our  stand

from one side to another. Why I say this,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Speaker, Sir, is because when this  Bill  was

read  the  First time, we trade unionists  on  the

Government  side  and other trade  unionists  were

invited to attend a conference to discuss the Bill

which  is before us today clause by clause.  As  a

result, several amendments were put forward by the

trade unionists. Therefore, we trade unionists  on

this side of the House fully support this Bill  to

which  several amendments will be moved  later  by

the Minister concerned.



<br><br>4.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr   Speaker,   Sir,  although   the   Industrial

Relations  Bill which is being introduced  by  the

Minister  for Labour and Law has not  reached  the

ideal  stage,  I  do think, however,  that  it  is

practical,  for the reason that it will substitute

the  legislation of the previous Government  which

has   taken  an  irresponsible  attitude   towards

industrial relations in this country. This Bill is

an   attempt  to  amend  the  legislation  of  the

previous  irresponsible  Government  and   it   is

practical  in the interest of the masses  in  this

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people have the power to

run  their own affairs. Therefore, the people  who

hold this power must be represented by themselves.

An  important  fact arises out of  this  important

piece of legislation. Those who are interested  in

the trade union movement believe that the Minister

for Labour and Law has the final say. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  this Bill has not been drafted in a  day  or

two.  It  has been drafted after the Minister  for

Labour has put in much effort, energy and time  in

discussions  with  members of  trade  unions,  and

after  agreement has been reached on many  matters

in  this  Bill. Because this Bill has been amended

in  many  respects, we can see for ourselves  that

the   P.A.P.  Government  is  different  from  the

previous  Government. Our policy is based  on  the

views  of  the masses of the people.  Their  views

must  be  respected  and given preference  to  and

should be embodied in Government legislation. When

that happens, we accept them and amend the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when going through the Bill,

we   found   a  clause  in  relation  to  disputes

submitted  by the Minister for Labour and  Law  to

the Arbitration Court. The previous Government was

cunning.  They  used  to  cheat  and  deceive  the

brothers and sisters of the workers. They used  to

refer  disputes to the Arbitration Court. We  know

that  the previous Arbitration Court was  a  fake.

Therefore, in this sense, such a Court could  only

represent a one-sided view. On the other hand, the

views  of  the other side were totally  overlooked

and neglected. But our Minister for Labour and Law

has  adopted a different attitude. If any  dispute

arises, and if our Minister thinks that it can  be

referred to the Arbitration Court, then he has the

power  to submit it to the ruling and findings  of

the Court. If the dispute between the employer and

the  employee  can  be solved by conciliation,  he

will then leave it to the conciliation officers to

decide. This attitude is very practical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember in the past I

represented   the   Singapore   Telephone    Board

Employees' Union in negotiations. When the workers

submitted  their terms to the employer,  they  got

their  victory. Many of the workers did  not  join

the union, but they gave full support to the union

in  their  negotiations with their employer.  Thus

those who did not join the union also enjoyed  the

benefits  fought for by the union for the members.

This  fact  was  unique  under  the  rule  of  the

previous  government. From this we  can  obviously

see  for  ourselves  that there were  unreasonable

things  in  society. The employers would blackmail

the  trade  union movement; they would  discourage

workers  to  join trade unions. We could  see  for

ourselves many workers sitting on the fence.  They

did  not  join  the trade unions, but  waited  for

others  to  fight for them. There is now provision

in the present Bill to provide that any member who

does  not  join a union in negotiations  with  the

employer  will  not  be  entitled  to  enjoy   the

benefits  fought for by the union for its members.

This   provision  will  enable  the   workers   to

understand that it is essential for them to join a

union.  It  is in their interest to join  a  trade

union.   This   provision  fully  represents   the

interests of the workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus when the Minister for Labour and Law

introduces this Bill, I think it is practical for

the reasons I have said.



<br><br>4.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Kallang)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr Speaker. Sir, when this Bill was debated just

now, the Opposition Members - the Member for Farrer

Park,  the  Member for Cairnhill, and the  Member

for  the  Southern  Islands - put  forward  various

amendments and views. I would like to say, as has

also  been  said by my colleagues just now,  that

before   this   Bill  was  debated   today,   the

Government  had  received  representations   from

several  trade unions in Singapore, and  that  we

trade  unionists had got together  and  discussed

its  pros and cons and reached a certain  measure

of agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill not only protects

the workers but also ensures industrial stability

and  peace.  Under the previous government,  when

they  enacted  a  Bill, it  often  appeared  good

outwardly,  but  in effect it did  not  give  the

workers anything concrete. What I have just said,

perhaps  the  Opposition Members themselves  will

understand,  for  they  know  what  happened   in

Singapore  in  the  past.  We  had  strikes   and

lockouts.   The   outdated  Ordinance   was   not

effective  and  had  no  provisions  as  are  now

embodied in this Bill. After this Government  had

assumed office for a few months, I myself,  as  a

trade  union leader, had negotiated with  several

employers for better conditions of service,  such

as  overtime pay, involving sums amounting to not

just  hundreds of dollars but many  thousands  of

dollars, which the employers were obliged to pay.

This  is  the  result of the present Government's

genuine  intention to better the economic  status

of  the workers. Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir,  by

this  Industrial Relations Bill, as I  have  said

earlier, not only will it protect the workers  in

Singapore  but  it  will also  ensure  industrial

peace.   Therefore,  as  regards  some   of   the

Opposition  Members, they should  be  ashamed  of

themselves for what they had failed to do in  the

past.   When  we  enact  such  a  Bill  as   this

Industrial Relations Bill, we do not merely enact

it for the sake of enacting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



it  but, at the same time, we will carry out  its

provisions  to  the letter and  take  appropriate

action  against employers who fail to  carry  out

their obligations.

Sir,  the  responsibility for the maintenance  of

the country's industrial peace is tripartite.  It

rests on the Government, on the employers and  on

the  workers. But Government up to 1959 had  been

nothing more than an administrative machinery  to

be used by the employers, and a machinery for the

enforcement  of order over the workers,  so  that

the  exploitation of the workers  could  continue

unhindered. In those circumstances,  it  was  not

surprising to find that all arbitration tribunals

and courts of enquiries had been directed against

the  workers, and had never been impartial bodies

at all. We have had examples of these in the case

of  the  Naval  Base Arbitration  Tribunal  whose

Chairman  was  on  the  reserved  list   of   the

Admiralty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not very long ago, We former Government set up a

Court of Inquiry, and when its findings were  not

favourable  to  the  Government,  the  Government

refused  to implement the findings of that  Court

of  Inquiry. It was not long ago that the  Member

for  Farrer  Park was a member of  the  so-called

independent   panel  of  the  Industrial   Courts

Ordinance. Those were the conditions under  which

the workers found themselves.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>





We  were faced with so-called independent Chairmen

and  independent persons, but they were, in  fact,

not independent at all but, in one way or another,

were associated with the employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employers,

too,   have   a   responsibility  for  maintaining

industrial peace. But the employers of today  have

never  progressed  from  the  days  of  indentured

labour, the Kangani system. The trade unions  have

quite often found it difficult to expect employers

to  abide  by  collective agreement, and  even  to

observe  the  minimum requirements of  the  Labour

Ordinance.  Even now we come across employers  who

are   not  observing  the  Labour  Ordinance,  the

minimum standards laid down by the Shop Assistants

Ordinance  and  the  Clerks Employment  Ordinance.

With  these  experiences  the  workers  could   do

nothing  else  but  resort to  industrial  action.

Their frustrations and discontent found expression

in strikes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Party contested the election on a policy

based  on  industrial  peace  with  justice.   Its

leaders  have  for  a very long time  worked  with

trade  unions  and  with  the  workers,  and  were

trusted  by them. True to the policy of my  Party.

this Bill has been introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill introduces a new chapter in the

history  of  our country. For the  first  time  it

introduces a new concept, the concept of the force

of law to collective agreement voluntarily reached

between employers and workers. Never before has  a

collective  agreement been binding.  Never  before

has   a  collective  agreement  been  enforceable.

Employers have just ignored agreements whenever it

suits  them.  Agreements have been signed  on  one

day,  and on the following day, the employers have

just  ignored them. To my mind, this is  the  most

important   step   taken  to  promote   collective

bargaining in this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also aims at promoting collective

bargaining  between employers and their respective

trade  union of workers. As the Bill  will,  at  a

later  stage,  be amended, it will be  found  that

collective   bargaining  is  being  kept   between

employers and trade unions of workers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



This is to avoid the present situation whereby  an

association of employers reached agreement with  a

trade  union  of  workmen,  and  subsequently  the

individual   employers  resigned  from   the   old

association and refused to abide by that agreement

which  they were a party to when they were members

of  the  old  association.  In  order  to  prevent

employers  from  cluttering up  the  work  of  the

Arbitration  Court by forwarding, by default,  all

disputes  to the Court, the Bill will  enable  the

unions  to  decide whether or not to  take  strike

action.  The  right to strike is still maintained.

It  must be maintained, otherwise we might find  a

situation  where  the Arbitration  Court  will  be

cluttered  up with all those trade disputes  which

can rightly be solved by negotiations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the right to strike must be exercised in a

responsible manner. As long as it is exercised for

the benefit of the workers, it must be maintained.

This Bill provides sufficient freedom, and, at the

same  time, sufficient protection to see that this

weapon  is  not used by wild men to enhance  their

personal  power  or to coerce the Government.  The

trade  unionists have accepted the principle  that

trade   union  leaders  who  obstruct  the  proper

functioning  of the Court should be punished,  but

not the union as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Law must be complimented for agreeing to the deletion of the

provisions  dealing with the cancellation  of  the

registration  of unions whose leaders deliberately

flouted the orders of the Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The denial of the right of representation before

the Court to an advocate and solicitor is in order

to direct the attention of the Court to the merits

of  the  case before it, rather than to engage  in

legal   technicalities   and   formalities.   This

particular clause will enable trade unions  to  be

represented  by persons who are considered  to  be

most suitable for this task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Cairnhill cast a slur on the

trade  union movement when he said that the  trade

unions   did   not  have  sufficient   experienced

officers to represent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



the  case  of  the workers before the  Arbitration

Court. Sir, the trade union movement is capable of

looking   after   itself.   It   is   capable   of

representing  the interests of the workers  before

this  Court - so long as we know that the  Court  is

there  to  judge and decide on the merits  of  the

case  and not on the form of representation or  on

the technicalities of the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill must be supported if we are to solve

our  economic ills and expand our economy so  that

we  may  abolish unemployment from our country.  I

believe  this  Bill is one that will  keep  labour

disputes to a minimum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compulsory arbitration is not a popular

solution.  It is not a solution wholly  acceptable

to  the unions. But in the situation that we  find

ourselves  in today, there is no better instrument

than  compulsory  arbitration. In  this  Bill  the

emphasis  is  on collective bargaining.  But  when

collective   bargaining  fails,  there   must   be

arbitration, and arbitration, if it is to succeed,

must  also  have  the force of  law.  It  must  be

binding  on the parties that do appear before  the

Arbitration Court. This Bill provides  such  force

of  law.  I,  for  one, am sure  that  responsible

leaders on either side of the labour dispute  will

resort  to  collective bargaining. But both  sides

have  their  wild men, perhaps the employers  more

than  the  workers, and to ensure that these  wild

men do not destroy our standards of living and our

economy,  this Bill is necessary. Sir,  I  support

the Bill.



<br><br>5.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. T. Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. T. Bani (Thomson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

must  say that I am terribly disappointed  at  the

performance of the hon. Members in the Opposition.

Perhaps  they are not sure on which side the  Bill

is  weighted,  whether it is on the  side  of  the

employers or on the side of the workers.  However,

the Bill before the House today is, as a matter of

fact,  the  most  important piece  of  legislation

introduced by the Government so far, and one  that

has  initiated widespread interest and discussion.

Employers  and  bodies  of  employers  have  quite

obviously  scrutinised  the  Bill  carefully.  The

Straits  Times  has editorially commented  on  the

Bill more than once, and has even aired the unsaid

fears of the employers. On



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



the other hand, Sir, the trade unions have set  up

special sub-committees to study the Bill and  have

gone  over,  clause by clause, the provisions  for

and   against  their  interests.  The  unions  and

employers   have  made  representations   to   the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is indeed my duty today to speak both as

a  trade  unionist and as a Government Member,  as

one who understands and shares the aspirations  of

the   workers   and  recognises   the   legitimate

democratic rights of the trade unions in the field

of  industrial  relations, and as one  responsible

for  the  ideals and objectives of  the  Party.  I

think,  Sir,  at  the outset it  is  important  to

mention  the  fact  that although  both  sides - the

employers and the employees - seem to have expressed

certain  fears  with regard to the application  of

the  Bill,  no one so far appears to quarrel  with

the   intention   of  the  Bill.  The   underlying

principle   of  the  P.A.P.'s  labour  policy   is

industrial  peace with justice. This will  be  the

objective  which  the Bill in its  final  form  is

intended  to achieve, and the truth of all  truths

is to put into practice this principle in the most

effective and workable manner. Fears we all  have.

I  am  sure  Members  of this House  have  various

fears,  just as the employers and the trade unions

have  fears on the result of the operation of this

Bill.  I  am being frank and honest when  I  state

here in clear and unambiguous terms the fears  and

the worries of the workers and the trade unions in

regard to this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before I proceed any further, I must state

quite  definitely  that  despite  the  fears   and

concern of the workers, they are quite prepared to

accept the Bill, with the amendments, in the final

form  in which it appears after the trimming. This

is solely because they have hope and confidence in

the  men  who  are  going to  be  responsible  for

operating  this Bill, namely, the Members  of  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, Sir, I just want to refer to a

statement  by  the hon. Member for  Cairnhill.  He

sounded  as  though he was sorry that he  did  not

have  the opportunity of introducing such  a  Bill

during  his term of office. Let me tell the  House

quite plainly this. If it is the Lim Yew



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



Hock  Government which were to introduce the Bill,

then  I  say today there would be workers  outside

holding  placards, his the faith in the leadership

of  the  Government and in the basic intention  of

the  Bill, i.e. to mete out justice to the workers

while  preserving  peace on the industrial  front,

which led the trade unions to take this decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to refer very briefly to a few clauses

which  are  causing  some apprehension  among  the

workers. To start with, it is necessary to examine

the difference between the Party's election pledge

and  the  provisions of this Bill. In the  Party's

manifesto  during the elections in regard  to  the

Arbitration  Court, it was stated that  the  union

could opt to be brought within the jurisdiction of

such a court. When the union so opts, the employer

is  automatically brought within the  jurisdiction

of the court. This, Sir, is no longer the case now

under  this Bill, and quite rightly there is  some

uncertainty  and  worry creeping  into  the  trade

unions of workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28 of the Bill, as the amendments to be

moved  by  the Minister will provide,  will  allow

employers and the trade unions who are parties  to

a  trade  dispute  to  make a request  jointly  in

writing to the Registrar that the trade dispute be

submitted to arbitration, and when this  is  done,

the  court  shall  have cognizance  of  the  trade

dispute.  The fear of the trade unions is  on  the

opportunities   which  this   clause   will   give

employers  to refer, or refuse to refer,  disputes

with  the  unions  according to  their  particular

benefits  and thus make the workers helpless.  But

the  safeguard  against  this  possible  abuse  is

provided  by a sub-clause under the clause,  where

the  Minister will have the authority to direct  a

dispute to arbitration. Here it is appropriate to)

draw an illustrious example of what I said just a

little  earlier. While the unions strongly  desire

what  was  promised to them during the  elections,

they are prepared to accept the amendments to this

principle,  in  the  belief  and  faith  that  the

Government, in particular the Minister who has  to

operate this Bill, will do so judiciously



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



and  in  a manner that will preserve the unity  of

the  workers and add strength to the working class

movement.  But  sad to say, Sir, if  the  Minister

were to be, for example, the Member for Cairnhill,

then  we would have to be prepared to face another

round of the industrial unrests of 1955 and 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me refer to clause 32. Here, the Court in

reaching its decision may have regard not only  to

the interests of the persons immediately concerned

but  to  the interest of the community as a  whole

and  to the economy of the State as a whole.  This

clause   is  considered  by  workers  to   be   an

employers' clause, for the simple reason  that  it

appears   to  transmit  the  frequent   howls   of

employers. We all know that employers are  in  the

habit  of  crying  about  the  interests  of   the

community and the conditions of the economy of the

State  every time the unions make claims for  just

and  improved  conditions of  employment  for  the

workers. It must be stated that this clause in the

Bill  affords opportunities for employers  to  try

and  seek to prejudice the reaching of a just  and

reasonable  settlement through arbitration.  As  a

matter of fact, without any Ordinance to cite, the

counsel for the Singapore Traction Company, in its

recent  dispute  with  the union,  at  the  actual

hearing  roared something to the effect  that  the

eyes  of the industry were upon the Tribunal,  and

that the eyes particularly of those investors  who

sought  to invest money in the City were  watching

carefully the deliberations of the Tribunal, it is

well  known now, Sir, what effect this has had  on

the  Tribunal which was fairly constituted and  it

is  not unlikely that there will be many more  Mr

Hills in the future casting intimidatory words  at

the  proposed Court and the President. It is  also

not unlikely that it may affect adversely the case

of  the  employers. But nevertheless, I must  warn

that  if  the  decision of  the  Court  is  to  go

contrary  to  the  interests and feelings  of  the

workers, because  of  the over-emphasis  of  this

clause,  there will be grave dangers in  that  the

Court  will not only be brought into disrepute  in

the eyes of the workers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



and the whole machinery of arbitration jammed, but

the   employers  will  also  have  to   bear   the

consequences.  Sir, this is not to  say  that  the

interests of the whole community and the whole eco

nomy should not be considered, but they should not

be  a  blind  for  all kinds of spurious  argument

advancing selfish interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, I have one point to make on the penal

clauses.  Here,  what is of deep  concern  to  the

trade  unions  is the provision that  will  appear

after  the amendment which will prohibit  a  trade

union  leader  from holding office for  a  certain

period.  To  forfeit the trade  union  leader  the

right  to be an officer is something that no union

would  like  to  see happen, and I  am  sure  that

nobody  on  this side of the House is particularly

keen  to  deprive any leader of the  right  to  be

elected. The intention of the Government to  check

irresponsible Trade unionism is appreciated by the

unions.  But the fear remains on the grounds  that

this clause may be abused. However, this fear will

be  rendered  groundless  if  the  officer  is  of

obvious  integrity.  These are  the  main  clauses

which remain a source of uncertainty and worry  to

the  trade  unions,  but what  is  of  the  utmost

importance is the actual function of the Court and

the  implementation of the various  provisions  of

the Bill. Hope for the workers emerges as a result

of  the  confidence in the men who  are  going  to

operate  this Bill. As far as the trade unions  of

workers are concerned, the passing of this Bill in

whatever form is not the be all and end all of the

matter.  I  might say that certain  employers  who

have  yet to learn the lessons of the past - lessons

of  reality -   may  feel  that  they  can  use  the

provisions of this Bill to harass and irritate the

unions.  And  there  may be undesirable  elements,

pimps  and  stooges of vested interests,  who  may

want  to  sabotage the proper functioning of  this

Court.  Sir, it is common knowledge to  those  who

have  witnessed and who have participated  in  the

combats  between the employers and  employees  how

jolly well employers desire to maintain industrial

peace  but resist justice from being done  to  the

workers. If this is going to be the case,  then  I

must point out that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



trade  unions of workers are not going to let  the

employers  get away with that. The employers  will

have  to  face the force of a united and determind

trade union movement, and while the Government has

decided to establish and foster industrial  peace,

it  has made it abundantly clear that it will  not

allow  injustice to be meted out to  workers.  Let

there be no doubts in the minds of employers  that

if  and when such a situation develops, the  whole

machinery of the Government will be trained on the

employer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I have no doubt

that the trade unions will give every co-operation

and assistance to the Government to work the Bill,

and  my  only  hope  is  that  the  employers   do

likewise.



<br><br>6.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to speak on the

Bill  which we are now debating. I understand that

the  purpose of this Bill is to promote industrial

peace.  I  have  heard  it  expressed  by  several

experts  or champions of the labour movement  that

this Bill aims at protecting the interests of  the

workers.  However,  there are many  provisions  in

this  Bill which affect the prosperity and economy

of our State. On the whole, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do

not  entirely  disagree  with  this  Bill.  It  is

foreseeable that this Bill will not be referred to

a  Select Committee and that it is necessary  that

certain provisions therein should be amended. I do

not  wish  to  be a defender of the Government  on

this  issue. But we must be careful if we want  to

ensure  the peace and prosperity of the  State.  I

know,  Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Members  on  the

Government  side  have declared  that  it  is  the

policy of the P.A.P. to fight for the interest  of

the  workers.  I,  as a Member on  the  Opposition

side,  do not deny this. It is a fact and we  have

had  proof that it is the policy of the P.A.P. to

be the champions of the workers on this island.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that most of the workers in the labour

movement  are illiterate in the English  language.

When this Bill is enacted, all the provisions will

be printed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



in English. I am sure not all the workers will be

able  to  comprehend  the  true  meaning  of  the

provisions of the Bill which we are now debating.

Therefore,  I  think the time has  come  for  the

champions  of  the workers who  are  now  on  the

Government side and who, as I have said  earlier,

have achieved successful results in the field  of

trade  unionism,  to guide the workers  in  their

interest.  In  this situation, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

lawyers  should also be given the opportunity  to

represent either the employers or employees in  a

trade   dispute  when  it  is  referred  to   the

Arbitration Court for settlement, because if  the

workers  are not represented by a lawyer  in  the

Court, I am confident that the employers who have

all  the necessary resources will be able to  put

forward their case better than can the employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, Mr Speaker, Sir, I do

not disagree with the Bill as a whole. But I have

not yet received any clarification concerning the

reported  agreement reached as a  result  of  the

discussions   between  the   trade   unions   and

employers. We should have clarification  in  this

House  as  to what percentage of trade unions  in

Singapore support this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to dwell on this Bill at length,

Mr  Speaker,  and I am prepared to  receive  any

explanation from the Government. But if  this  is

unacceptable to us, it is just like  the  proverb

of the camel having to surrender to its master.



<br><br>6.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim)</b>

<b></b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we are fully aware

that  the  Industrial  Relations  Bill  has  been

discussed  at  great length during the  past  few

weeks. The labour movement and the employers have

expressed  their  intention  to  join  with   the

Government  to  stabilise  the  economy   through

industrial  relations. We are determined  not  to

allow an atmosphere which would create industrial

chaos.  We are also determined to make an all-out

effort  to  maintain industrial  peace.  We  have

heard  the views of the Members on the Opposition

side  on  this  Bill and all the criticisms  that

have been put forward



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



will    be   considered   by   Government.    The

implementation of this Bill will be  carried  out

judiciously.   The  Government   has   considered

carefully  the  amendments put up by  the  labour

movement   and   employers  and   after   careful

consideration of these amendments, the Government

has made several amendments to this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be understood that all those concerned

in  a  trade dispute should be asked to reach  an

amicable  settlement, but there  are  times  when

such  a  settlement cannot be reached because  of

the attitude adopted by one side or by the other.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  in  such  a  situation,  the

Minister then should be empowered to have  a  say

in the matter and thus avoid what would otherwise

be  a  bad situation. If it is felt that the only

recourse  to  the trade unions  is  to  be  given

complete  freedom  to take industrial  action  or

resort to strike action in order to achieve their

objectives,  it  is  not  the  intention  of  the

Government  to deny them this right. However,  it

is  important for the Minister and the Government

to  have  powers  to  achieve  industrial  peace.

Therefore,  it is found necessary  to  give  such

powers  to  the  Minister  who  will,  no  doubt,

implement the provisions of this Bill judiciously

in  any trade dispute which may arise. This  Bill

at first was considered to be too drastic, but it

was  subsequently  found necessary  to  strike  a

balance  between the employers and  the  workers.

For  instance, it is admitted that clause  82  of

this  Bill  concerning "go slow" action  will  be

carried  out by the workers because it is  feared

that  certain unscrupulous employers will exploit

this clause to the detriment of the workers.  We,

the   Government,  admit  that  the  workers  and

employers  now  have a new sense of consciousness

and we feel that such a state of relations should

be  reflected in agreements which are  backed  by

law. Such agreements or decisions reached in  the

Court  will  definitely stabilise conditions  and

benefit the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this Bill particularly aims at achieving industrial peace with justice in this

country.  Not  only  does  this  rest  with   the

Government, but all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



concerned   must   make  an  effort   to   achieve

industrial  peace with justice. Therefore,  anyone

who  shirks  his  obligations and responsibilities

will  find  that there are clauses  in  this  Bill

whereby action can justifiably be taken.



<br><br>6.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  since  the  introduction  of   the

Industrial  Relations Bill in Singapore,  everyone

has  concentrated his attention on it. We all know

that Singapore is a small island. If any sector of

the community is not well looked after, then there

will be no peace in industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this Bill was moved for Second Reading, our

friends   on   the  Opposition  side   felt   very

interested and made speeches in the hope that they

would become the champions of the workers. So they

criticised  this and that, saying that  this  Bill

was  not  appropriate. Of course, we know that  if

any  clause  of  this  Bill  is  contrary  to  the

interests of the people, then the people will  not

welcome the Bill and will not support it.  We  can

see  for  ourselves very clearly that  during  the

Labour Front Government the representatives of the

trade unions had discussed with them at that  time

the  impracticability of a  Bill  which  they  had

wanted to put through concerning the trade unions.

At  that time, if they could have looked after the

people  well and had listened to them, then  there

would  not have been so many placards and  slogans

against them. It is evident that their actions and

attitudes  were  against  the  interests  of   the

people.  But  today  they  feel  that  the  P.A.P.

Government  will  neglect  the  interests  of  the

workers  and put through the Bill. They are  under

the impression that, in criticising the Government

Bill,  they  will  become  the  champions  of  the

workers.  However, my colleagues  have  explicitly

declared  that  in drafting this  Bill  they  have

accepted representations from every sector of  the

community. And we can say that in the interests of

the  people,  we  have tried  to  repeal  the  old

Ordinance  without fear. They are putting  a  mask

over their face, being themselves cheats.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think I did read the

appropriate Standing Order which says that on  the

Second  Reading,  the  debate  should  be  on  the

general merits and principle of the Bill.  I  have

allowed  the honourable Member to carry on  up  to

now  in  his exordium. Perhaps he could  now  come

back to the general merits of this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was just giving

an example just now without any ulterior motive at

all.  We can see for ourselves today that  if  the

Bill  is not passed, the people of Singapore  will

suffer. The Minister has said that we can get full

support   from  the  trade  unionists.   We   have

discussed with them their views and these have now

been  incorporated in the Bill. So we can say that

if the Bill cannot get the support of the majority

of  the people, then they will not support it  and

therefore it will not be passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has stated that if

this Bill was put through three or four years ago,

he would not have been able to see us on this side

of the House today. It a little childish of him.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The honourable Member has been

interpreted as having called another Member of the

House "childish". If that is correct, then I think

that  word  should  not be used of  an  honourable

Member of this House and should be withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lin You Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lin You Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I beg your leave

to  withdraw,  Mr  Speaker, Sir. I  cannot  help

laughing  at the Member for Farrer Park's  speech.

He  said that if the Bill was put through, then he

would  not  have  been able to see the  Government

side  today.  We  can see for ourselves  that  the

previous Government, under the leadership  of  Lim

Yew  Hock,  could not look after the interests  of

the  people of Singapore. Thus if they had  passed

such  a  Bill, then the people of Singapore  would

have  given him an even bigger blow. This Bill,  I

think,  is  beneficial to the security  and  well-being  of  the  country. This being  so,  I  fully

support it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, this Bill is

the first attempt to bring order into the field of

industrial  relations,  and  to  allow  reason  to

prevail.  It is in pursuance of the Labour  policy

of  the  People's Action Party. At the  outset,  I

would  like  to point out that in one  respect  we

have departed from the set programme of the Party,

namely, in giving power to the Minister for Labour

and   Law   to   send  a  matter  to  arbitration,

regardless  of  the wishes of  the  union  or  the

employer. It was our original intention to try and

work  out  a  scheme whereby all unions  could  be

affiliated to a Trades Union Congress, which would

opt  for  arbitration  on behalf  of  all  unions.

However,   the   Minister,  after  eight   months'

experience in his Ministry, has assured  us  that,

regardless of the ultimate shape and form  of  the

T.U.C. and its constitution, it is necessary  for

the  Minister to have this reserve power in  order

to  ensure  that, in the unlikely  event  of  both

union  leaders  and employers being  recalcitrant,

matters  should  not  be  allowed  to  take  their

illogical  course and end in an industrial  strike

and confusion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not intend to deal with points of

detail - they  have been raised by  Members  of  the

Opposition.  I  shall leave that to my  colleague,

the  Hon. Minister who is moving the Bill.  But  I

would like to answer Members of the Opposition  on

their  request  that this Bill be  referred  to  a

Select  Committee. My colleagues and I have  given

careful consideration to whether or not this  Bill

should go to a Select Committee. The conclusion we

came  to  is that the sooner the Bill is  enacted,

the  sooner we can get the provisions worked  out,

and the better possible it is for the Minister  to

implement our Labour policy. It would take several

months  to have the Court set up, the form agreed,

and  the machinery set in motion. To send the Bill

to a Select Committee where it may lie for another

three  or  four months would be another  three  or

four months lost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of principle, may I say that

this  is a new field of legislation? Whether these

provisions are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



practicable  and  workable, or  whether  they  are

academic  and  unsuited to local conditions,  will

not  depend  upon an academic debate in  a  Select

Committee,  but upon the actual implementation  of

the  provisions of the Bill. On principle, we  are

determined - as  indeed we have  the  right  to  be,

having  stated  it quite clearly in  our  election

programme - to  bring about industrial peace  which,

at  the same time, ensures that justice is done to

the workers. If there were a question of principle

involved  in which employers or unions could  make

representations on the basic features of the Bill,

then  some  useful  purpose  might  be  served  by

sending  it to a Select Committee. But as  far  as

the  main features of the Bill are concerned,  its

framework  and  its  structure have  already  been

decided upon, namely, that the emphasis must be on

negotiations.  Provisions  have  been   laid   out

whereby   unions  can  either  get  or   not   get

recognition.  Provisions are laid out  as  to  how

negotiations  can  be  commenced   and   must   be

commenced. Provisions are made as to what is to be

done if either negotiations are not commenced,  or

a deadlock is reached in negotiations. There is no

question  of  principle involved on which  we  can

give  way.  The only question is on the smoothness

of   the  implementation  of  the  intentions  and

objects of the Bill. That is a matter which we can

only learn from experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two principal objectives which this

Bill  seeks  to achieve. First, that  the  workers

receive their fair share of the fruits which their

labour  helps  to create. Second, that  it  should

establish   conditions  which  are  conducive   to

industrial expansion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if only the first objective is achieved,

namely, that workers get their fair share, or more

than their fair share, without creating conditions

conducive  to  industrial  expansion,   then   our

problems of unemployment will mount over the  next

four  years to disproportionate figures  by  1964.

Therefore,  it is fundamental that we should  also

achieve  stability  in  industrial  relations,  to

assist  the  necessary expansion of  industry,  to

create employment for the 20,000 to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



30,000  young men and women who every, year  enter

the field looking for jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, on the other hand, if this Bill only

succeeds  in  creating  stability  for  industrial

expansion,  without  bringing  the  benefits   and

ensuring  that  fair  shares  are  given  to   the

workers,  then we will have failed as  a  movement

dedicated to the advancement of the working class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our hope that an intelligent application

of  the  provisions of this Bill by the Government

will  prepare  the  conditions  under  which  both

objectives can be secured. Needless to say, it  is

fundamental to the working of the whole Bill  that

the Court must be so constituted that it earns the

respect,  if  not the admiration, of both  workers

and  employers.  That  is,  the  awards  must   be

balanced and fair, made on the merits not only  of

the  dispute but of the dispute within the context

of the whole complex of our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not pretend that all parts of the Bill

commend  themselves  to employers  or  to  unions.

There  are several provisions in the Bill to which

the   Federation  of  Employers  takes  exception.

Indeed, as some Members on the Government side  of

the House have informed you, Mr Speaker, Sir, the

unions  are  not  without their views  as  to  the

possible    effects    of   certain    provisions,

particularly  the  penal  ones  on   trade   union

activity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last analysis, it is the balancing of

competing  interests - first, fair  shares  for  the

workers; and, second, industrial conditions  which

will encourage investment and expansion - which  has

resulted in the Bill and its proposed amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we could have done one of two things. The

first  one is to proceed with the Bill,  which  we

are doing. The other is to leave things alone. The

second  alternative  really  means  the  state  of

affairs  which prevailed for many years  past,  in

which   there   were   no  adequate   and   proper

legislative  controls,  resulting  very  often  in

unlimited scraps between employers and unions, and

the  intervention  of the Government  not  through

legislation   designed   for   the   purpose    of

controlling  industrial disputes, but intervention

through  legislation designed to maintain law  and

order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



In  the  last analysis, if the law is flouted  and

disorder   prevails,  then  the  Government   must

abdicate and allow disorder to be supreme.  It  is

hoped  that  these special legislative  provisions

will  work and operate to maintain the balance  of

these  two competing objectives, and that it  will

be  unnecessary  ever to invoke  those  provisions

meant  for the supreme crisis where order must  be

re-established at all costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if this attempt to re-establish sense and

stability  in  a  field so far left  untouched  by

detailed  legislation succeeds, if only  in  part,

then  I  think we should all be grateful  for  the

advance  the whole country would be making towards

sense  and  stability in our industrial relations.

In  the  earnest hope that the sooner  we  achieve

even  part of that objective that we have set  out

to  achieve the better it will be, we have decided

to  go  through with the Bill -  the Second Reading,

the  Committee stage and the Third Reading - at this

sitting of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Byrne, in reply?



<br><br>6.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indeed very

disappointed   with   the   performance   of   the

Opposition Front Bench this afternoon. I am indeed

very  surprised that the former Chief Minister  of

the State of Singapore -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not the State. The Colony of

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I beg your pardon, Mr Speaker - the

Colony  of Singapore, and the former Minister  for

Labour  and Welfare should have shown that he  had

paid so very little attention to the provisions of

this  Bill, which he himself said was an important

piece of legislation. What he tried to do just now

was  to pick a few holes in a few clauses of  this

Bill  and suggest to the House that the Government

had  given very little attention to these matters.

He  then expressed regret that he, as head of  the

former Government, was unable to introduce similar

legislation when his Government was in power. Then

he  passed  on the buck to the Member  for  Farrer

Park who graciously admitted that this was a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



good  Bill,  but  regretted that it  had  so  many

clauses, that it affected so many interests,  that

he  really  had  not  much time  to  consider  the

contents of this Bill, and that it would  be  most

agreeable  to  all the Members of  the  Opposition

Front Bench if this Bill could be sent to a Select

Committee  for  further  consideration,  and   for

further inaction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also noticeable, Mr Speaker, Sir, that

today  the  Member for Tanglin has  shown  a  very

great reluctance to perform.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have also allowed the

Minister  to  carry  on  up  till  now  with   his

exordium,  but I do not think he ought  to  attack

the personal conduct of Members in that way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, when I was about to

begin,  I  was  very  much  tempted  to  point  an

accusing   finger  at  the  Member   for   Tanglin

opposite, but I resisted the temptation to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I will just deal with a few of the points that were raised by the Member for

Cairnhill  just  now.  He  appeared  to  be   very

confused about the question of the appointment  of

the President of the Court. He wondered why it was

necessary  for  the  Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara   to

appoint   the   President  of  the   Court   after

consultation with the Prime Minister, and  why  it

should be left to the Minister for Labour and  Law

to appoint the Acting President. Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  have given this question of the appointment of

the President of the Court considerable attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the wording of this Bill is so

phrased  as  to  shut out the  provisions  of  the

Public  Service  Commission  in  relation  to  the

appointment  of  the President of this  Court.  It

will   be  appreciated  that  it  would  be  crass

stupidity on the part of the Government if it ever

was  tempted to let the Public Service  Commission

put  out an advertisement calling for applications

for  this  appointment. If we did so, I think  the

Opposition Front Bench might lose another Member.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will see from clause 4 of

this  Bill  that  it  is  the  intention  of   the

Government  that  the person who is  appointed  to

this high office will have the rights, privileges,

protection and immunity of a Judge of the  Supreme

Court.  The constitution of the State of Singapore

provides  that  Judges  do  not  hold  any  public

office; that they hold public office only for  the

purposes of ensuring their pension rights. It  was

very necessary, Mr Speaker, Sir, that this method

of  appointing  an independent President  of  this

Court should be adopted by the Government. In  the

case  of  the Acting President, when the President

is away, we felt that such an appointment could be

safely  entrusted in the hands of the  appropriate

Minister. In this case, the Minister will  be  the

Minister for Labour and Law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Cairn-hill has

suggested  that it would be a good  thing  if  all

those  who  serve on the committees  of  political

Parties  were excluded from either the  employers'

or  the  employees'  panel. Mr  Speaker,  we  are

always  accused by the Opposition  of  being  very

illiberal in our ideas. We are accused of  wanting

to  place shackles on trade unions and wanting  to

inhibit  political  Parties  from  functioning.  I

would suggest to the Member for Cairn-hill that it

would  be  unfair to place such a  restriction  on

persons, who are connected -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> A democratic person's rights

and privileges.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> - with political Parties, from

serving  on these panels. Mr Speaker, it  may  be

open  to  this  Government to put the  Member  for

Cairnhill  on  the employers' panel. Mr  Speaker,

surely he would not think it unfair that we should

even consider such a proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for

Cairnhill has not understood the intentions of sub-clause (2) of clause 9 of this Bill. Would it  not

be  more  appropriate  to  allow  a  member  of  a

political  Party  or  a  committee  member  of   a

political Party to serve on these panels? If  they

show  by their attitudes that they are not persons

to  be trusted, and if they show that they are not

persons  who  will  serve  impartially  on   these

panels, it could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



be  left  then  to the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  to

remove them from these panels on the grounds  that

they are not fit and proper persons to be selected

to  constitute  the court. Would  not  that  be  a

fairer thing to do? Why prejudge the issue?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will now refer to another

criticism which the Member for Cairnhill has  made

with  regard  to  clause  23  of  this  Bill.   He

expressed surprise that this clause provided  that

a memorandum of any collective agreement should be

in  writing, but did not indicate that the writing

of the memorandum should be in the Tamil, Chinese,

English or Malay language. Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

the intention of the Government to leave it to the

parties  to  express their agreement  in  whatever

language they choose. If they do so, then there is

provision  in clause 45 sub-clause (2) for  copies

to  be made of the document in the Malay, English,

Chinese  and  Tamil languages. Is  there  anything

unfair in this? Are we placing any shackles on the

parties? Mr Speaker, Sir, -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Minister - [Laughter].



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

Minister was not attentive when I said that  truly

I did not believe that it was the intention of the

Government to insist that the writing should be in

English, because it is clear from clause  45  that

all the four languages are to be used. I said that

in  order  to  make it abundantly  clear  such  an

amendment   is   necessary.  He  has   failed   to

understand.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It was an explanation and not

elucidation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker. I can very well

understand  the embarrassment in which the  Member

for Cairnhill now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



finds  himself.  He is obviously  trying  to  talk

himself out of a very difficult situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Well,

let the records show!



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it has been

remarked in this House before that the Member  for

Cairnhill has great aptitude as an angler, in  the

sense that he loves to fish in troubled waters. He

has made a reference to clause 31 of this Bill and

has  said quite blithely here - why should the civil

servants  be  put  to the trouble  of  getting  an

endorsement from the Yang di-Pertuan Negara before

a civil service issue is to be put to arbitration?

Mr  Speaker,  unfortunately for  the  Member  for

Cairnhill, I was a civil servant when he  was  the

Chief Minister of the Colony of Singapore. Amongst

my  other  duties was the duty of  drawing  up  an

arbitration  agreement  on  behalf  of  the  civil

service  with the Government of which  the  Member

for Cairnhill was the Chief Minister. Mr Speaker,

Sir, the Chief Minister understands very well that

it  is  very necessary in civil service issues  to

write   in   safeguards   into   any   arbitration

agreement, because the civil service does not  run

like  ordinary businesses in the sense that it  is

geared  to produce a profit. In the civil  service

the   Government  is  not  entitled  to  use   the

taxpayers'  funds improperly. For that reason,  it

is very necessary that no reference to arbitration

should  be  allowed which involves any expenditure

from the public funds, or which in any way affects

the  discretion of the Public Service  Commission,

unless the approval of the Head of State is  first

obtained.  That is the practice in all  democratic

countries which run or operate civil services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Farrer Park has

stated  that other members of the Government  have

referred to the discussions which the Minister has

had  with  representatives of unions, but  he  has

expressed great surprise that the Minister himself

was  silent  in  regard to these matters  when  he

moved the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



Second  Reading of this Bill. Mr Speaker, Sir,  I

am   now  going  to  inform  the  Members  of  the

Opposition  Front  Bench that  I  have  taken  the

trouble  to discuss the clauses of this Bill  with

members  of  the trade unions who have shown  more

interest  in this Bill than any of those  who  are

sitting now on the Opposition Front Bench. I  will

refer  particularly to clauses in this Bill  which

were  discussed  during the time that  I  held  my

discussions with the representatives of the  trade

union movement in the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, if you will look at clause 16

you  will see that the intention there is that the

collective   bargaining   procedure   should    be

available both to the employer and to the union of

employers. The unions complained that it would  be

unfair  to  allow  a trade union of  employers  to

negotiate  any collective agreement with  a  trade

union  of employees in the sense that the  bargain

ing  strength  of one was much stronger  than  the

bargaining  strength of the  other.  It  was  also

represented  to  me that it would  not  serve  the

interests of the economy of the State if employers

were allowed to reach collective agreements with a

trade  union  of  employees  through  a  union  of

employers. The more prosperous employers could get

themselves linked up in a union and thereby try to

get  an  agreement with a trade union of  workmen.

The  effect would be that the employer who is  not

in  the trade union of employers would not be able

to  pay  the same wages as those employers in  the

union  would  be  able to do, in  which  case  the

smaller  businessman would be put out of business.

And the result of that would be that the worker in

that  small business would lose his job and  would

be  the  person most likely to suffer. It  is  for

this  reason, Mr Speaker, Sir, that  I  shall  be

moving an amendment to this clause later on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the unions also did not like

the  provisions of sub-clause (3) of clause 18  of

this  Bill. That is a sub-clause which enables  an

employer  to  say to the Commissioner  for  Labour

that  the  workmen  in  his  undertaking  are  not

members of the trade union which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



claims  to represent them; and it also enables  an

employer  to  say to the Commissioner  for  Labour

that even though his employees are represented  by

a particular trade union which claims to represent

them,  nevertheless, in his opinion,  he  believes

that his own employees do not desire that union to

represent  them. Now, the unions were particularly

unhappy  with clause 18 (3) (b) as it stands.  The

Government  has  now decided  that  it  will  keep

clause 18 (3) (a), but delete clause 18 (3) (b) on

the  grounds  that if effect is given  to  it,  it

would  unduly  restrict the  activities  of  trade

unions  and  would enable employers to  meddle  in

trade union affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, another provision in the Bill

which gave considerable concern to the unions  was

clause  28  (b)  where  it is  provided  that  the

President  of the Court should be given  the  last

opportunity   to  try  to  effect  a  conciliation

between  the parties before he decides to refer  a

trade dispute to arbitration. Mr Speaker, Sir, it

was  pointed out that it would be unwise to allow

the  President to be in a position where he  could

conciliate and, at the same time, be the judge  of

a   Court  of  Arbitration.  In  the  process   of

conciliation,   it  is  very   likely   that   the

conciliator  forms an opinion  with  regard  to  a

dispute. That being so, he might consider that the

union  is  either unreasonable in not agreeing  to

the  terms  of  the employer, or the  employer  is

unreasonable in resisting the claims of the union,

and, therefore, it would be unfair, after he forms

such an opinion, to require him then to adjudicate

on the same issues as President of the Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Cairnhill also

referred earlier on to the provisions of clause 18

(4)  and  clause 20 (b) of the Bill. You will  see

there,  Sir,  that the Minister has the  power  to

stop the Commissioner from notifying the Registrar

of  the  Court  that  a trade dispute  exists.  In

clause  18  (4),  he  has  the  power  to  stop  a

notification reaching the. Registrar of the  Court

where  the parties have refused to negotiate;  and

in  clause  20  (b), he has the power  to  stop  a

notification reaching the Registrar of  the  Court

where a deadlock has resulted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



during  the  negotiations. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

Member  for  Cairnhill  himself  has  proposed  an

amendment  in  this  part  of  the  Bill.  He  has

suggested that the Commissioner should be required

to  notify the Court of a trade dispute where  the

parties   have  refused  to  negotiate,  where   a

negotiation  has  broken  down,  and   where   the

Minister has failed to conciliate after making  an

attempt  to do so. Mr Speaker, Sir, in discussing

this clause with the unions, they pointed out that

the  Government  was, in fact, receding  from  its

position  with regard to a union being  given  the

sole  right  to  opt to bring a  case  before  the

Arbitration Court as the employer would, under the

Party's policy statement, be required to submit to

arbitration  if  the  employees  union   requested

arbitration. Mr Speaker, Sir, the difficulty  was

to  reconcile  the bargaining position  of  unions

with the principle of compulsory arbitration.  The

unions  have  a  right to threaten  to  use  their

collective strength during the bargaining process.

They might be able, by the mere fact that they are

able  to  use this threat, to induce the employers

to  reach  an agreement with them, and  they  felt

that  that position should be safeguarded for them

in  this clause of the Bill. They recognised  also

that  it  was the Government's policy  to  promote

industrial peace with justice, and that being  so,

they  accepted the position that power  should  be

placed in the hands of the Minister to direct that

any dispute, whether an ordinary trade dispute  or

a  dispute in an essential service, should be  put

to  arbitration. For that reason, clause 28 (c) of

the Bill is to be amended as appears in the notice

of amendments which the Government has given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the unions also had a fear

that   if   the  impression  gained  ground   that

arbitration was automatic, it was likely that all

issues would be submitted to arbitration and  that

the  Court  would  be cluttered up  with  numerous

pending  issues.  And to that  extent,  the  whole

policy  of  the  Government  would  be  completely

frustrated.  It  was  for that  reason  that  they

agreed that the Minister should have the final say

as  to  whether a trade dispute should be  put  to

arbitration or not.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson has

already expressed to this House the misgivings  of

the  unions  with  regard to  the  application  of

clause  32  of this Bill which provides  that  the

Court  shall have regard not only to the  interest

of  the  persons who are affected by the  dispute,

but  also to the interest of the community and  to

the  economy  of  the  State.  He  felt  that  the

employers would try to put this to their use.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in our policy statement,  we  have

made  it clear that when an Arbitration Court  was

set up, it would be required to have due regard to

the  complexities  of our economy  and,  for  that

reason,  we  have had to tell the unions  that  we

felt  that clause 32 is vitally necessary for  the

operation  of  this  Bill.  But  we  have  made  a

concession. Instead of requiring the Court to have

regard  to these matters, we have left it  to  the

discretion of the Court to do so. The Court  will,

therefore,  be  fully  informed  of  the  position

before making up its mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Thomson has

also  referred  to  the penal provisions  of  this

Bill.  We  have taken counsel with the unions  and

after considerable discussions the Government  has

agreed  to  delete  the provisions  of  this  Bill

affecting the deregistration of trade unions.  But

the Government has decided to retain the provision

which  places  irresponsible trade  union  leaders

under  restriction against participation in  trade

union  activities if they are found guilty by  the

President of the Arbitration Court of contempt  of

the  authority of the Court. Mr Speaker, Sir,  we

ourselves on the Government side have said that we

hope  that  it will never be necessary  for  these

provisions ever to be implemented, and  that  with

the  experience gained from the operation of  this

law and with goodwill on both sides, the tradition

of  collective bargaining will be built up,  which

will  make it unnecessary for the penal provisions

of  this law ever to be applied against any  trade

union leader.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are other provisions of

the  Bill which also gave considerable concern  to

representatives  of  the  unions,  but  I  do  not

propose to take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



up  much  time by referring to them,  because  the

opportunity will be given to me to deal with these

misgivings  and fears when the Bill is dealt  with

at the Committee stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have also had discussions

with  the Federation of Employers. They have  said

in a very lengthy memorandum that they also do not

like  the  provisions  of  this  Bill.  They  have

misgivings  with  regard to certain  clauses,  and

they  frankly admit that they do not understand  a

lot  of these clauses. Mr Speaker, Sir, they  are

particularly concerned with the clause in the Bill

which  denies a disputant a right of  appeal  from

the  decisions  of the Court of Arbitration.  They

consider  that  the  disputant has  a  fundamental

right  of appeal, and they say that it might  very

well  be that the Court might make a mistake which

would   cause   considerable   damage   to   their

interests.  For  that reason they  have  suggested

that there should be an appeal from the decisions

of  the  Arbitration Court to the ordinary Courts.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I pointed out, when I moved this

Bill,  that  the Court that will be set  up  under

this  law  is  not  a  Court  of  Judicature.  Its

function will be to make an agreement for  parties

where  they  fail to agree, and as I have  pointed

out  earlier,  that  function  is  more  akin   to

delegated legislation; so that if there is  to  be

an  appeal  from the decision of the  Court,  that

appeal   must   lie   to  a  superior   Court   of

Arbitration; it cannot lie to the ordinary  Courts

of Judicature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Federation of Employers

also  told  me  that they did not  understand  the

provisions  of clause 55 of the Bill. That  clause

is designed to ensure that either party may not be

allowed  to  pick and choose the parts  that  they

agree  to accept in any award. The Court  has  the

discretion  under  that clause to  say  to  either

party,  "You  will either have the whole  of  that

award  or  no  award at all." Sir,  after  a  long

discussion  with the representatives of employers,

they  were satisfied that the Government was doing

its   best  to  provide  to  both  employers   and

employees  of  their organisations  the  machinery

whereby disputes could be settled, which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



would  otherwise result in strikes  and  lock-outs

and   other  industrial action  which  could  cause

considerable damage to the economy of our State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister just now

has given the House reasons why the Government has

decided  not  to  refer  this  Bill  to  a  Select

Committee. As the Prime Minister has pointed  out,

there  is a lot of work yet to be done under  this

Bill-regulations will have to be made,  the  Court

will have to be set up, and we will have to get on

with  the job of making this Bill operate. And  it

would not do for us to spend our time arguing  the

clauses  of  this  Bill in protracted  discussions

before  a  Select Committee, and for  that  reason

Government has decided to proceed with the  Second

Reading  and Committee stage of this Bill at  this

sitting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Mr Speaker, Sir, proposes certain

amendments to the Trade Disputes Ordinance,  which

are  associated  with  the  Ordinance  called  the

Industrial Relations Ordinance. I have  given  the

Bill  its  full title, but I intend to move  at  a

later  stage certain amendments designed to delete

those parts of the Bill which would alter the  law

relating to strikes and lock-outs in the essential

services. In particular, I shall propose that  the

paragraphs  in  page 2 of the  Bill  dealing  with

strikes  and  lock-outs in essential  services  be

deleted,  and  that clause 7 be omitted  from  the

Bill.  I  do not, therefore, comment now on  those

provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of the Bill is to add to the

types  of strikes and lock-outs which are  already

illegal - strikes and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



lock-outs  which  are  in  furtherance  of  trade

disputes  of  which  the  Industrial  Arbitration

Court  has cognizance. Such strikes and lock-outs

are  in essence directed against the Court. Quite

obviously, the  Court cannot deal  in  a  proper

atmosphere  with  issues  in  dispute,  if  those

issues  are the subject of direct action  outside

the  Court. The right to strike during bargaining

stages  are left unimpaired, but when  a  dispute

goes to Court, direct pressure should cease. Sir,

"you cannot have recourse to law and recourse  to

force  at the same time" is a simple proposition.

When  an  award is made, the Court has performed

its  task.  Of course, not every award will  give

employees  everything they would like. Indeed  it

is  sometimes said that it can never be  possible

to  give employees everything they would like  to

have,  but  the  system requires  that  employees

should  work  in accordance with  the  award.  It

therefore  requires that it should not be  lawful

to  incite  them  not to do so.  The  Bill  gives

effect  to this in the new clause 3 (c) which  it

is proposed to insert in the principal Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I commend the Bill to this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hospitals Board was established to determine

fees  on  condition  that the Minister  concerned

confirmed them earlier, and to receive such fees.

Among  its  functions, the Board is to  determine

the income approved by the Government. This Board

advises  the  Government in matters  relating  to

hospitals    under    its    jurisdiction.    The

establishment of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



Hospitals  Board was in line with the  policy  of

colonial     governments,    because     colonial

governments  used  the  experience   and   expert

services of people serving in the hospitals.  The

Hospitals   Board   played   the   role   of    a

middleman - between the colonial government and the

people  who  were  oppressed.  Such  a  role   is

outmoded now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under existing conditions, where a People's

government  is  elected to power,  the  Hospitals

Board  is outdated. This new Government has  been

elected to serve the people, and therefore, it is

necessary  for the Hospitals Board  to  play  the

role  of a middleman. The general policy  of  the

present  Government concerning  hospitals  is  to

centralise all their activities, draw  up  plans,

make inspection and control hospitals - all in  the

power   of   the   Minister  and  his   officers.

Therefore,  it  is suggested that  the  Hospitals

Board  Ordinance be repealed, and a central  body

of hospitals be established under the Ministry of

Health.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Low Por Tuck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg  to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the Exchange Control Ordinance

(Chapter  216) imposes no control on  the  import

into  or export from Singapore of Treasury Bills.

Non-resident controlled companies are free



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



to  transfer,  sell  or  do  anything  with  their

holdings   of   Treasury   Bills.   Alternatively,

residents are able to make loans to such companies

in  the  form of Treasury Bills without hindrance.

Furthermore,  transactions in or  in  relation  to

Treasury  Bills by persons who leave the scheduled

territories  either on emigration or  repatriation

are not brought under control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Exchange Control Ordinance was passed

in 1953, it was considered that, at that time, the

provisions for the control of Treasury Bills  were

not  necessary as the issue of such Bills was  not

then a regular feature of either Singapore or  the

Federation   Government  finance.   However,   the

Federation  Government  is  now  issuing  Treasury

Bills,  and  the  Singapore  Government  similarly

intends  to  issue  Treasury  Bills  in  the  near

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is considered that the time has

now  come  for Treasury Bills to be brought  under

control, and this precisely is the main purpose of

this  amendment Bill now under consideration. When

amended,  the  Exchange  Control  Ordinance   will

conform more closely to the United Kingdom Control

Act of 1947.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is also intended to effect an amendment

to  subsection  (5) of section 2 of the  principal

Ordinance  which contains a reference  to  British

subjects.  Reference to British  subjects  is  not

appropriate, in view of Singapore's present status

as  a  self-governing State, and  it  is  proposed

therefore to delete that reference, and substitute

reference  to "citizens of the State of Singapore"

instead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, opportunity is also taken to correct a

clerical  error appearing in Part II of the  Fifth

Schedule to the Ordinance.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to deal with the immediate

problem   that   has  arisen  following   on   the

Government's campaign to enforce the provisions of

the  Hotels Ordinance, 1955, by taking  action  to

cancel  the certificate of registration of  hotels

which are conducted in an improper manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the law stands at present,

it  is possible for the hotel keeper to flout  the

law  after the cancellation of the certificate  of

registration  of  the hotel, by  letting  out  the

individual rooms to prostitutes. If such rooms are

then  used  for  the purposes of prostitution,  no

action can be taken against the hotel keeper under

the  present law. The Bill seeks to change the law

by  providing that a tenant, occupier or person in

charge  of  any premises who lets the premises  or

any   part  thereof  shall,  notwithstanding  such

letting,  be guilty of an offence if the  premises

or  any  part thereof are or is used as a brothel,

unless he proves that he has no knowledge that the

premises or such part thereof are or is used as  a

brothel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where premises are used as a brothel, the Bill

provides  that the tenant, occupier or  person  in

charge  of  the  premises shall be  guilty  of  an

offence, unless he proves that he has no knowledge

of  the  use  of  the premises as a  brothel.  The

owners  or  agents of the owners of  premises  are

only   liable  if  it  is  shown  that  they  have

knowledge of the use of the premises as a brothel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "brothel" has been amended so

as  to  include not only a house or place but  any

portion of any house or place, and also to make it

unnecessary to prove contemporaneous use



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



of  the  premises for the purposes of prostitution

by   two   women   or  girls.  A   definition   of

"prostitution" has also been added.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, this Bill seeks to make

amendments  which are considered to be immediately

necessary  to  the  Women  and  Girls'  Protection

Ordinance.   The   whole  law  relating   to   the

protection of women and girls is at present  being

reviewed  as  part of the general legislation  for

the  protection of the rights of women. A Bill has

already been drafted, and I hope to introduce  the

Bill  soon.  In the meantime, it is  necessary  to

take these immediate steps to strengthen the law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 2, Sir, defines the meaning of a brothel

as  a  "house, room or place or a portion  of  any

house, room or place, which is occupied or used by

any two or more women whether at the same time  or

at    different   times   for   the   purpose   of

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I just want to point out one

thing.  Throughout the principal Ordinance,  there

is not even one instance where the word "women" is

this  section  might lead to misunderstanding  and

exploitation by unscrupulous racketeers.



<br><br>7.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will strengthen their argument that a place

is  not a brothel if it is used by women under  18

is  that there are sections where the word "girls"

is   used  without  the  word  "women".  In  these

instances,  it was intended to indicate  that  the

section refers to females under 18. That is why  I

have  thought it is very important that  I  should

put  the amendment in. I am glad the Minister  has

accepted the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am indeed most

grateful to the Member for Mountbatten for  having

pointed  out  the  difference between  "women  and

girls"  and  "girls and women". She  has,  by  her

great  interest in the definition of a  "brothel",

saved the Hon, the Chief Justice from the pleasant

or  the unpleasant duty (depending on how he looks

at these things!) of determining whether a "woman"

is  a  "girl"  or  a "girl" is a "woman"  for  the

purposes of this Ordinance. If I had that pleasant

duty to discharge, Mr Speaker, Sir, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



can  assure  the  House  that  I  would  have   no

difficulty  in placing the Member for  Mountbatten

Sir,  I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. Members can see from the explanatory

statement,  this winding up Bill seeks  to  repeal

the  War  Savings Certificates Ordinance of  1940.

The  principal Ordinance was passed on 30th August,

1940,  to  authorise the Governor of  the  Straits

Settlements to raise a loan from the public  as  a

gift to the British Government for the prosecution

of  the  Second  World War. This was  to  be  done

through  the  sale of War Savings Certificates  in

units   of  $15  each,  and  the  Government   was

authorised to sell up to $20 million worth of such

certificates.  However, only $9,724,440  worth  of

certificates  were sold from 1st September,  1940,

to   15th   February,   1942.   These   $15   unit

certificates  had a redemption  value  of  $20  on

maturity  of  10  years from the  date  of  issue.

Compound interest at 3 per cent per year was  paid

on   certificates   which  were  redeemed   before



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



maturity.  The  latest balance sheet  as  at  31st

December  1958,  shows that the biggest  liability

item   is   a  sum  of  $359,436  outstanding   to

purchasers  of savings certificates  as  repayment

for  principal sums and payment of interest  sums.

On  balance, however, there is a favourable credit

of $424,547.30 on the surplus and deficit account.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill contains provisions which are largely

procedural. For instance, clause 5 (1) of the Bill

provides   that  all  outstanding  principal   and

interest  payments due on unredeemed  certificates

shall  be  settled  within six  months  after  the

coming into operation of the Ordinance out of  the

assets  of  the  War Savings Certificates  Sinking

Fund.  Where payments are outstanding in  dispute,

the  Minister may pay the amount into court or may

make  other appropriate provisions for them.  This

is  provided for in the proviso to clause 5. After

all  claims have either been paid or provided for.

the  balance  of  the assets of  the  War  Savings

Certificates  Fund shall be disposed of  according

to the direction of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara and

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Agong of the  Federation  of

Malaya.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I have the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

recommendation that this Bill be proceeded with.

beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In successful planning for economic development,

a  country has ultimately to depend upon  her  own

resources  for  sustained  and  permanent  growth.

Singapore is no exception to this inflexible  law.

The Government is therefore constantly working out

ways   and   means  to  tap  our  own   resources,

especially  our  financial  resources,   for   the

development   of   the  State.  Last   year,   the

Government  floated successfully two fairly  long-term  loans which the Government was happy to note

were over-subscribed. I refer to the $15 million 5

per cent registered stock maturing by 1967 and the

$25  million 5½ per cent registered stock maturing

by 1979, issued in September, 1959. The Government

also  has plans to issue short-term securities  in

the  form of Treasury Bills on tap as well  as  on

tender  in the near future. To complete the  range

of securities available, medium-term securities in

the form of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



Treasury  Deposit Receipts will be  issued.  These

Treasury  Deposit  Receipts  are,  therefore,  the

subject  of  the  Treasury Deposit  Receipts  Bill

which I am now moving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aims of the Bill are: first, to enable

private  investors,  commercial  banks,  insurance

companies, investment trusts, statutory bodies and

other  similar  financial institutions  to  invest

their surplus funds in Treasury Deposit -

<div align="center"><b>CONSTITUTION OF TRADE UNIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Party

which I represent, I am taking this opportunity to

convey   some   of   its  views   concerning   the

constitution  of  trade unions in  my  adjournment

speech  in  this Assembly. Mr Speaker,  Sir,  the

time has come for us to draw the attention of  the

Government to the fact that amendments  should  be

made  to the constitution of trade unions  to  the

effect  that  all  the  personnel  managing  trade

unions  and  labour  unions must  be  citizens  of

Singapore.  Mr Speaker, Sir, as we all  know,  we

have discussed today at great length the enactment

of   trade   union  laws  in  order  to   maintain

industrial peace. As we already have our own  flag

and  our own national song, we feel that the  time

has  come  for  consideration to be given  to  the

citizens  of  Singapore to  participate  in  trade

union  and  labour union affairs. We certainly  do

not  like  to see persons who are non-citizens  of

Singapore upsetting the livelihood of our workers.

We wish for peace, progress and prosperity for our

State.  At  this  moment, we have  representatives

elected  by the people who, I am sure, are capable

of effecting a change to the constitution of trade

unions so that only citizens of Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



can  play a leading part in trade unions.  We  are

going  ahead  with  our plans to  make  Malay  the

national  language in the future.  The  matter  on

which  I am speaking is of only a minor character,

and  I  am  sure the Government will  be  able  to

resolve it without much waste of time. We do  wish

that  citizens  of  Singapore should  be  given  a

greater opportunity to lead in the field of  trade

unionism. If possible, we do not wish citizens  of

the Federation of Malaya to take an active part in

our   trade   union  affairs.  Citizens   of   the

Federation   of   Malaya  are   citizens   of   an

independent State, and we should not give them  an

opportunity  to play a leading role in  our  trade

union   activities.  We  must   also   take   into

consideration the fact that Commonwealth  citizens

should  also be excluded from taking part  in  our

internal affairs. The time has now come for us  to

take  part  in affairs which affect us.  In  these

circumstances,  Sir,  I hope the  Government  will

give  consideration  to the points  which  I  have

raised  with  a view to framing a new constitution

whereby  we  can  give opportunities  to  our  own

people -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just wondering whether

the  hon. Member is advocating legislation. If  he

is,  then this is not the time to do so. He  is  a

legislator and has an opportunity of introducing a

Bill if necessary. An adjournment speech must  not

suggest legislation.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do  not wish to introduce legislation during  this

period when I have been permitted by you to speak.

I   am   merely  drawing  the  attention  of   the

Government  to  what I have just  said  about  the

personnel  in our trade unions, in the  hope  that

they can concede to the wishes of the majority  or

the majority of the citizens of Singapore. In this

matter  relating  to  the  constitution  of  trade

unions   or  labour  unions,  we  hope  that   the

Government  will  take  a  serious  view  of   the

personnel who play a leading role in trade unions,

especially in Service trade unions. We can see  in

these  trade  unions that their  leaders  are  not

citizens of Singapore. Although the money paid  to

the Service employees is not borne by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



this Government but by the British Government,  we

all  know  that  the  majority  of  these  Service

employees   are   Singapore   citizens.   It   is,

therefore,   desirable  that   the   citizens   of

Singapore should be given an opportunity  to  take

over  the  responsibility of running their  unions

when  they  come  together  during  their  general

meetings,  and that future legislation  should  be

passed   by   this  Government  to  this   effect.

Therefore,  with  such  encouragement   from   the

Government,   I  believe  that  the  citizens   of

Singapore  will be grateful to the Government  and

that  they  will support the Government  in  other

matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, Mr Speaker, Sir, we do

not  wish  to see people, who have not  taken  out

citizenship papers, take part in running our trade

union  affairs.  What  is the  purpose  of  giving

opportunities  to  citizens of the  Federation  of

Malaya to play an important role in our unions? We

are  fit  and  capable  of administering  our  own

affairs. If there are persons in these unions with

influence  or ulterior motives, then I  feel  that

the  Government should take a more active interest

in  such affairs. These may be affairs relating to

the  security and peace of our State,  because  we

know that undesirable elements are waiting for  an

opportunity  to make use of the trade  unions  for

their  own ends with a view to grabbing  power  in

the  next  elections.  The members  of  the  trade

unions could be influenced ideologically by  these

undesirable elements. If such a state  of  affairs

exists - and the Government is fully aware of this - I

think the time has come, Mr Speaker, Sir, for  us

to  take appropriate action. We do not wish to see

such  persons interfering in our domestic affairs,

because  these  are  affairs  which  concern   the

workers  and their families. If there are  persons

who  are non-citizens of Singapore taking part  in

union activities which would result in hardship to

the  workers  and their families, the consequences

will  be  very serious. This will not only  affect

the  workers  but  also their families  and  their

dependants. But the main thing, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

is  this - let us make an effort to get rid of those

persons  who  do  not wish to become  citizens  of

Singapore or who are not brave enough to show



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



their undivided loyalty to this State. Our aim  is

to   protect  the  interest  of  the  citizens  of

Singapore. If such undesirable persons  are  given

an opportunity to play a leading role in our trade

union  activities, Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe  we

will  be confronted with bigger problems, because,

as  I have said earlier, this can be considered as

an  external threat which is in conflict with  our

own  interest.  If such a threat exists,  it  will

lead to disaster and the name of our State will be

damaged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will look into this matter

so  that we can restrict such persons who are non-citizens of Singapore - irrespective of whether they

are citizens of the Federation of Malaya or of the

United   Kingdom   and  Colonies   or   of   other

independent States -  from playing a leading part  in

trade unionism in Singapore. These persons have no

franchise and they are not citizens of our  State.

I  hope the Government will take a serious view of

this  matter  so  that  we  can  fulfil  our  main

obligation, that is, to help our own citizens.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure the

Member  for Kampong Kernbangan that the Government

is at present giving very serious consideration to

introducing a new Trade Union Ordinance to  repeal

the  present  Ordinance, and  to  give  effect  to

Government's policy with regard to trade unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has suggested that committee

membership  of trade unions should be  limited  to

Singapore citizens. That is written into the Trade

Union  Ordinance in the Federation  of  Malaya.  I

would draw the attention of the Mem-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



ber  for  Kampong  Kembangan to clause  7  of  the

Industrial  Relations Bill which  was  debated  in

this  House  earlier this afternoon. He  will  see

that  it  is  the proposal of this  Government  to

restrict participation in both the employers'  and

the  employees' panels of the Court of Arbitration

to   persons  who  are  Singapore  citizens.   Mr

Speaker, Sir, I do not propose to indicate to this

House  what the Government's proposals will be  in

regard to the new Trade Union Ordinance, which  it

is  proposed to introduce in the near  future.  It

would be premature on my part if I tried to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to remind the Member for

Kampong  Kembangan that Government does  not  look

with  favour  on  union  organisations  which  are

communal.  I  do  not propose to mention  in  this

House  the  names of unions which  restrict  their

membership to persons of a certain race. That sort

of   organisation  does  not  fall  in  line  with

Government's policy with regard to trade unions. I

am  taking this opportunity to bring this  to  the

hon. Member's attention, as he has taken some time

this  afternoon to suggest to Government the lines

on  which  it should proceed when introducing  the

new Trade Union Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is all I propose to say this afternoon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly do now adjourn.
