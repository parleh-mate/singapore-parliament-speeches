<div align="center"><b>WATER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Necessity for saving)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ivan Baptist</b> asked the Prime Minister whether,

in  view of the plentiful rain in the recent pass  and

the  likelihood  of  more rain as this  is  the  rainy

season,  there needs to be any apprehension among  the

public in regard to water rationing or a necessity for

them to save water.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development and Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development and Communications (Mr Lim Kim San) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the frequent rainfall

which   we   have  experienced  since  September   has

replenished our reservoirs which are now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>



90% full. With the coming of the North-east Monsoon

and the promise of more rain. I am glad to say that

there is no danger of water rationing in the near

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this does not mean that people can now

revert  to  wasteful  habits  in  the  use  of  water.

Whatever the weather, water conservation must be a way

of  life for us in Singapore. There is a lesson to  be

learnt  from the devastating effects of the unexpected

drought  in  Europe  in the last  summer.  If  such  a

drought could hit Europe, a place hitherto unknown for

severe  dry  spells, the chances of it affecting  this

part  of  the world are even greater. We in Singapore,

with our limited water storage capacity, cannot afford

to  wait  for a dry spell to threaten before  renewing

our  water conservation habits. Moreover, it  is  good

housekeeping to economise in the use of water which is

becoming  more  expensive to treat and, therefore,  to

consume.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, does the

Minister agree that emphasis should always be  on  not

to  waste  water? During a dry period saving water  is

essential,  but  during a period  of  plentiful  rain,

saving water males little sense.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> It is a good habit to save water. It

is  a  habit like brushing your teeth every day.  Once

you have acquired a good habit. I think you should not

drop  it.  To save water is also to save on your  F'UB

bills and water is getting more expensive to treat. We

have exhausted the normal sources of water supply  and

are going into unconventional means of obtaining water

which  is  going to be more costly. So keep  the  good

habit of saving water.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, what I feel is this. Does not the Minister think that wasting water is something that he should emphasise because in actual fact there is -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Baptist, are you asking a

supplementary question or are you expressing your

feeling?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, does not the Minister want to re-emphasise this business of wasting water rather than

saving water?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>





Because  to  save water, people may have  one  bath  a

week,  and that is not practical if there is plentiful

rain.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> It is a question of emphasis. He can

emphasise whichever way he wan!s, so long as he  saves

water.  If  one does not waste water, one  is  already

saving water. So it is a question of emphasis.  I  put

it  as  saving  water. He wants to  emphasise  on  the

slogan.  "Don't waste water." Either way, it means  he

uses less water.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>ISLAND-WIDE BLACKOUT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Action to prevent recurrence)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ivan Baptist</b> asked the Prime Minister what

caused the recent blackout that lasted for many  hours

resulting   in   trauma  for  the  majority   of   the

population, and what action is being taken  to  ensure

that there will be no distress of this sort again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San (for the Prime Minister):</b> Sir, I

think  Members of the House know that the  electricity

system in Singapore has grown tremendously in the last

10  years. Generating capacity of the system has grown

from  464 MW (megawatts) in 1966 to 1.270 MW  now.  In

the  process  of expansion the system has become  more

and   more  complex  and  sophisticated  and   certain

automatic   safety  devices  such  as   the   in-built

mechanism   of   "tripping"  has  to  be   introduced.

"Tripping" means an automatic disconnection  from  the

system in the event of a fault.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day in question a new generator of 120 MW

capacity was commissioned at Senoko Power Station  and

it was feeding 30 MW of electricity into a circuit for

distribution.  At  the  same time,  another  generator

generating  90 MW was sending electricity through  the

same  circuit.  This circuit was carrying  120  MW  of

power for distribution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just before 4.00 p.m, the burner of the boiler of

the  new  generator failed and this generator tripped.

This    tripping   automatically   disconnected    the

transmission circuit and the other generator could not

transmit power



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>



to  the  system.  The sudden loss  of  120  MW  caused

instability in the system which in turn triggered  the

tripping  of the other generators at Jurong and  Pasir

Panjang `B' Power Stations. This resulted in an island-wide blackout.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a widespread blackout it takes time to

restore  the electricity to the system. But  this  can

only  be done progressively. Within half an hour after

the  blackout,  electricity had been restored  to  the

first  areas and the situation had returned to  normal

within  6«  hours.  The  blackout  was  so  widespread

because,  for reasons of economy necessitated  by  the

high  fuel  oil price, our spinning reserve  was  less

than  the capacity of the largest generating  unit  in

operation.  However, having had this  experience  now.

the  PUB  will, in  spite of the increased  operating

cost,  be  providing  spinning reserve  equal  to  the

capacity  of the largest generator in operation  until

the  Senoko  Stage I generators, i.e, the new  120  MW

generators, are fully commissioned at the end of  this

year.  By  then, the teething problems encountered  in

commissioning  a  new  power station  will  have  been

ironed  out  and we may revert to the more  economical

mode  of operation, that is, having a spinning reserve

less  than  the capacity of the largest generators  in

operation.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, can the Minister

enlighten  the House on this point? Four cables  which

were wrongly connected had burst because the engineers

had  not  done their work properly. Have the engineers

been working well or not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I am not aware that cables had

burst  as  a result of wrong connection. As far  as  I

know,  120  MW of electricity was transmitted  through

one  circuit.  30 MW was generated by a new  generator

and, as  with all things new, there are bound  to  be

initial   teething  problems.  The  boiler   of   this

generator developed a fault and this tripped  off  the

generator. The automatic safety device which  prevents

users  from  being electrocuted and  the  system  from

being  unduly damaged, then also tripped off the other

generators.  The  blackout was  not  due  to  a  wrong

connection of cables.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, this blackout occurred on

the  eve  of  Deepavali. I would like to know  whether

this will happen again on Christmas eve?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> The timing was just accidental. Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, are there no standby

generators to cater to this sort of problem?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, there are generators standing

by.  That  is  what is meant by spinning  reserve.  To

illustrate,  let me put it this way.  You  have  a  10

horse-power car and you are travelling in  it.  To  be

sure  of  getting to the end of your journey you  have

another 10 horse-power car following you all the time.

In  case  the car you are travelling in should develop

engine  trouble,  you  can then  switch  over  to  the

reserve  car  and  continue to your  destination.  Our

largest generator at present has a capacity of 120 MW.

To enable the system to continue providing electricity

should our largest generator fail, there should be 120

MW  generating capacity standing by. This  standby  is

known  as  spinning reserve. However, because  of  the

high  cost of fuel we did not have that much  spinning

reserve.  But now, having experienced it  and  knowing

that   there  will  be  teething  troubles  with   new

generators and in spite of high costs, we are going to

provide   spinning  reserve  equal  to   the   largest

generator we have in service.

heavy rains coincide with high tides, irrespective  of

whether  there  was reclamation or not.  In  fact,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, just now on my way to Parliament, part

of  Telok Ayer Street was flooded even when there  was

no  rain.  These  are areas which are  very  low  and,

regardless  of  whether there is  rain  or  not, high

spring  tides  will  flood these areas.  We  also  had

hydraulic  model  studies  which  confirm   that   the

reclamation   will  not  in  any  way  aggravate   the

flooding. The proposed expressway itself will  not  be

subject  to  flooding as the road will be higher  than

the flood level.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Minister knows that

there is no rain today and yet Robinson Road and parts

of that area are flooded. Is there any policy to block

the water from flowing into the drains?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, as I said just now, those areas

which  I  saw today were flooded in spite of the  fact

that  there  was no rain because they are  below  high

tide level. So if we prevent the tides from flowing in

at  all  we  will  also be preventing any  water  from

flowing out. But since it is only a few days in a year

that  we have high spring tides which can cause  flood

to this area. I do no~ think it advisable to block the

drains. Otherwise for the rest of the year dirty water

will not be able to flow out to the sea from these low-lying areas.

it  is  proposed to build across the Kallang River  as

part  of the East Coast Expressway; (b) when work will

commence  and  how long it will take to complete;  (c)

whether  the proposed bridge will cost more  than  the

scheduled to be completed at the end of 1980.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bridge over Kallang Basin which is 1099 metres

is  estimated  to  cost $35.7 million  and  that  over

Singapore  River  which is 403 metres  $18.7  million.

However, the two bridges are linked and will  form  a

continuous elevated structure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed bridge over the Kallang River will not

hinder  the passage of ships to and from the shipyards

and  slipways  as  it is 29 metres  above  high  water

level.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On new medical equipment, there is need to economise

and  therefore  existing  equipment  which  are  still

serviceable  will be transferred to the new  Hospital.

Some of the more modern and sophisticated equipment to

provide  new services and to upgrade existing services

will  be bought. Among the new equipment that will  be

bought are:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) linear accelerators for the treatment of cancer;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) modern diagnostic equipment using radioisotopes

for  the  diagnosis  of various medical  and  surgical

conditions;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) modern diagnostic x-ray equipment, including the

EMI Scanner for diagnostic procedures;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) operating theatre equipment, including

monitoring  facilities, medical  gas  supply  systems.

etc, which are normally used in surgical work;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) x-ray equipment, resuscitation and diagnostic

equipment for the Accident & Emergency Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under new medical treatment and specialities, there

will be the following:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A 32-bed Day Surgery Department for patients

requiring minor surgical procedures and investigations

such  as  endoscopy  which  do  not  require  full-day

hospitalisation. As of this moment, such patients have

to be admitted into the hospital and thus they form  a

substantial number of in-patients in the hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A Cardiothoracic Surgery and Cardiology Unit

will be transferred from Tan Tock Seng Hospital to the

new Singapore General Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) An Obstetric and Gynaecology Unit and a Neonatal

Unit  will  be  located in the new  Singapore  General

Hospital.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) A Paediatric Surgery Unit, for all children

under the age of 12 who require surgery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) A Department which will provide facilities for

medical investigations using radioisotopes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) A Clinical Measurement and Health Evaluation

Unit  to  evaluate the function of the  heart, lungs,

brains, using an electrocardiography (ECG) machine and

treadmill    stress-testing    machine,    respiratory

functions, electro-encephalography    (EEG)     and

electronyography  (EMG). The Unit  will  also  have  a

considerable.  I am afraid I cannot give  a  clear-cut

answer  to the question asked by the Member  for  Bras

Basah. If there are any

Development  and Communications when  the  Pan  Island

Expressway  which is being built in parts  and  stages

will be completed and at what cost.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Punggol  is correct when he says that the Pan  Island

Expressway is being built in parts and stages. I  can

give  him  the  progress to date, and  they  are  as

follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The section from Jalan Eunos to Whitley Road, which

includes  Paya  Lebar Way and Jalan  Toa  Payoh,  has

been  completed However, a flyover at Woodsville  has

yet  to  be constructed, but financial provision  for

this  has  been included in the development programme

for 1977.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The section from Whitley Road to Adam Road is

expected to be completed around the end of 1977.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The section from Adam Road to Jalan Anak Bukit was

recently opened to traffic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction work is in progress on parts of the

eastward extension of the Expressway from Jalan  Eunos

to  the  East Coast Parkway in Changi. It is  expected

that  this section of the Expressway will be completed

by 1 980.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last section of the Expressway, which is its

westward extension from Jalan Anak Bukit to Jalan Boon

Lay  in  Jurong, is in the final stages of design  and

the first contracts on this section will be awarded in

1977. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



also  hoped  that  this section will be  completed  by

1980.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle section of the Pan Island Expressway from

Jalan  Eunos  to  Jalan Anak Bukit will  therefore  be

completed by the end of 1977. But the whole length  of

the  Expressway  from Changi to Jurong  will  only  be

completed by 1980.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of civil works of the completed sections of

the  Expressway  to date amounts to $33  million.  The

remaining sections will cost a further $117 million to

construct. The total cost of civil works for the whole

length   of  the  Pan  Island  Expressway,  therefore.

amounts to $150 million.

Regulations 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18 and 19 of the Sand

when  the  1971 Regulations were replaced by the  Sand

and Granite Quarries Regulations. 1974.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, these Regulations were deleted

because,   in  drafting  the  1974  Regulations,   the

Attorney-General had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



advised  that, it would be undesirable  to  duplicate

provisions which already existed in other legislation.

The  deleted Regulations are covered by the  Factories

Act. 1973.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, does the Minister realise that dust

pollution  is a grave problem especially in  sand  and

granite  quarries?  To workers and  residents  in  the

neighbourhood, effective control of dust pollution  is

essential. The absence of Regulations 11 and 12  would

most certainly cause this problem and, irrespective of

them being in the Factories Act, additional precaution

should be taken for sand and granite quarries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the nuisance

arising  from  quarry dust is being  looked  after.  I

think  the  Attorney-General is the correct person  to

give  advice  on  legal proceedings.  In  his  opinion

nuisance of this nature has already been looked  after

in  the  Factories  Act, 1973. There  is  no  need  to

duplicate   it  in  the  Sand  and  Granite   Quarries

Regulations. 1974.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Sir, does the Minister realise that the

Factories  Act  does  not provide  for  pre-employment

medical examination? Regulation 13 says that no person

suffering from a pulmonary disease is to be recruited,

and  silicosis  is  a  pulmonary  disease.  Could  the

Minister show how it would be ensured, in the  absence

of  this Regulation, that no person suffering  from  a

pulmonary  disease  is recruited  into  the  sand  and

granite quarries industry?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I do not think the Member is

quite correct, because under Regulation 32 of the Sand

and   Granite  Quarries  Regulations.  1974, medical

examination is provided for. It says here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every licensee shall provide -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) every person who is employed in a granite quarry

with  a chest X-ray examination at least once a  year;

and

incinerator  will  bring; and, with  its  completion,

whether refuse dumping at the Tampines dumping  ground

will  cease altogether to ensure the return of  marine

life to Serangoon River,



<br><br><!-- Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed) (for the Minister for Law and the Environment)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the

incinerator  at  Toh  Tuck  Road  is  expected  to  be

completed by early 1979 and costs about $85 million. A

loan of US$25 million has been obtained from the World

Bank  to  meet part of the cost. Construction  .is  in

progress. Three main contracts for the civil works and

the  mechanical  and  electrical equipment  have  been

awarded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adequate safeguards against noise and air pollution

will  be  provided. The incinerator  plant  will  have

electrostatic  dust filters capable of removing  about

99%  of  air pollutants and a 150 metre high  chimney.

These  anti-pollution measures estimated to cost about

$6  million will ensure that the smoke from the  plant

will comply fully with the Clean Air Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conserve energy, the waste heat from the plant

will be used to generate 11 MW of electricity. Part of

this electricity will be used by the plant itself  and

the  surplus power sold to the Public Utilities Board.

The plant will also have facilities to recover ferrous

metal from the refuse.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swamp land for dumping of refuse is scarce; the

incinerator will reduce the volume of refuse it  burns

by  90%  and is the best way of disposing the  growing

volume  of  refuse. At present about 2.000  tonnes  of

refuse  is  disposed of at our dumping  grounds.  This

quantity is expected to increase to 2,300 tonnes a day

in  1979  when the incineration plant is commissioned.

The  plant will be able to burn 1,200 tonnes of refuse

a day, and the rest will continue to be disposed of at

the  two existing dumping grounds at Tampines and  Lim

Chu Kang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dumping ground at Tampines is provided with

proper  earth bunds to prevent solid waste from  going

into  the Serangoon River. The refuse is covered  each

day  with  earth to minimise pollution.  As  such  the

dumping  ground should not have too serious an  effect

on the marine life in the river.

a hawker site in the Silat Square area in place of the

previous hawker site which had been converted  into  a

<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Chor Yeok Eng) (for the Minister for Law and the Environment)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  as  the  Member  for Anson is  doubtless  aware.

Kampong  Silat  Housing Estate has  only  446  housing

units.  There  are  two Housing and Development  Board

markets, namely. Kim Tian Road Market with 164  stalls

and  Jalan  Bukit Merah Market with 138 stalls  and  a

private  market with 71 stalls at Nelson  Road.  These

three  markets are only a quarter of a mile away  from

the housing estate. In addition, a new market-cum-food

centre with 135 stalls has been completed recently  by

the  HDB at Telok Blangah Rise about half a mile  away

from the housing estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all these facilities and the small

population in the estate, an additional site for

hawkers is not required. The 21 hawkers at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>



Silat  Square  together with 14 other hawkers  in  the

vicinity  have been given stalls in the Telok  Blangah

Rise  Market on 1st May, 1976, in accordance  with  the

policy to resite hawkers in open spaces within markets

and food centres.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir.can the

Parliamentary Secretary please explain further? He has

said that there are markets and hawker stalls all over

Singapore. But what I am asking is that the people  in

the  Silat Square area should have a hawker centre.  I

want   to   know  whether  that  can  be   done.   The

Parliamentary  Secretary says that  there  are  hawker

centres  everywhere.  Yes, there  are  hawker  centres

everywhere in Singapore. But I want a hawker centre in

the Silat Square area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, if the Member

wants  to  know whether there will be a hawker  centre

there,  my  answer  is no, because there  are  already

three  markets  in that estate. There  are  more  than

enough  stalls  in the three markets. Several  hawkers

have  already  moved  into the  market  at  the  Telok

Blangah  estate. There is no need for  another  hawker

centre.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, can the Parliamentary

Secretary  tell  me  what are  the  criteria  for  the

building of hawker centres?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, my answer is

that  it depends on the population and the development

needs of the area concerned. I have just said that  21

hawkers  from  the  Silat  estate  have  already  been

allotted new stalls in the Telok Blangah market. Where

is  the need to build another market, considering that

there  are  three markets and hundreds  of  stalls  to

serve  the small estate at Silat Square area? To build

another market there will be a waste of public funds.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, my question is this. I want

the  people  in  the Silat Square  area  to  have  the

benefit  of  a  market  where they  could  get  things

easily.  There  may be a market in the  Telok  Blangah

estate.  But  how  far is Silat Road  from  the  Telok

Blangah estate? The people, want to get their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>



foodstuffs or any other things easily. Are  there  any

supermarkets to be built in that area?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, if we accede to

the  request  of  the Member for  Anson  and  build  a

supermarket  outside the house of every  resident,  it

would  be ridiculous. Nobody can do that. Since  there

are three markets in that vicinity, what more does the

Member want?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I am not talking about

that. There was previously a hawker site in that area.

But  it has been converted into a car park. Why?  That

is what I want to know.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, it is because

we feel that the site is not suitable for a market. We

have  built several markets in that vicinity. We  have

also  moved the hawkers into the new market. The  site

on  which the stalls had been demolished can be put to

better use.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, may I know what is the

population in Silat Square area? The people there  are

not  served by market stalls. I want to know  what  is

the population in that area.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr P. Govindaswamy. I think the answer

Development  and Communications if he  will  ascertain

from the Housing and Development Board whether it will

seek ways and means to improve its maintenance service

so that complaints of defects and normal wear and tear

of its flats can be attended to more expeditiously.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, over the years, the

Housing   and   Development  Board  has   continuously

introduced  new  measures to improve  its  maintenance

service  and  to ensure that repairs are  carried  out

promptly.  Previously  only one  term  contractor  was

appointed to undertake specific categories of  repairs

for all properties in HDB estates. Now the HDB estates

are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>



grouped into three main zones, each zone with one term

contractor  to  perform specific  repairs.  Each  term

contractor will therefore work on a smaller  area  and

is  thus able to render faster repairs. When one  term

contractor  is  unable to fulfill his assignment  fast

enough,  arrangement  is made for  a  contractor  from

another  zone to provide the necessary backup  service

to complete the works expeditiously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Board has set up a Special Action Unit

to detect and monitor any shortcomings of its services

to  the  residents so that instant corrective measures

can  be  taken. There is also an Essential Maintenance

Service  Unit which provides round-the-clock  services

for  breakdowns in essential services like lift break-down, sanitary chokes and electrical faults.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain types of repairs which necessarily

take  a longer time to complete, e.g., defective doors

and  windows  in  the  older  buildings  have  to   be

individually  measured and hand-made as the  standard-sized  mass-produced windows and doors cannot be used.

In  a number of instances repairs were delayed because

no one was in the flat when the workmen called.

caused  to the public by the chaotic traffic condition

due to the recent severe floods.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in consultation with

other  relevant Departments, the Police has identified

areas prone to floods and traffic congestion following

heavy  rainfall. It has drawn up some diversion routes

to  by-pass  these  areas. Motorists  have  also  been

advised  what  they  should do in case  of  heavy  and

incessant  rain  leading  to extensive  flooding.  The

information  has already been given wide publicity  in

the press and over



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>



television and radio. Briefly, motorists are urged not

to   use   their  vehicles  when  there  is  extensive

flooding. If they have to use their vehicles they  are

advised to plan their routes in advance and listen  to

radio reports on the flood and traffic situation so as

to  avoid  the flooded areas. They are asked to  drive

carefully and observe diversion signs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During incessant and heavy rain the Police will

monitor  the  flood  and traffic  situation  and  give

frequent   situation  reports  over  Radio  Singapore.

Similar  announcements  will  also  be  made  by   the

Rediffusion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police personnel in the Divisions and the Traffic

Police have been briefed on the diversion routes drawn

up  for  them to direct traffic during severe flooding

of  the  roads. Directional signs have been  made  and

they  will be placed at strategic junctions  to  guide

the motorists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As before. Police Reserve Units have been assigned

to  respond to calls for rescue operations. They  will

be  deployed  to  remove fallen trees and  other  road

obstructions and assist commuters and motorists.  Now,

more  Police Reserve Units will be deployed  for  this

purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police has also been given authority by the Road

<div align="center"><b>(Entry into Britain)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr P. Selvadurai</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs and Education if he will enlighten this  House

as  to  how Mr Tan Wah Piow, who had absconded  before

reporting  for  National  Service, managed  to  enter

Britain;  whether  Mr Tan had valid travel  documents.

and if so, how were they acquired, if not, how was  he

allowed  entry  into Britain in June. 1976;  and  what

action, if any, the Government intends to take against

Mr Tan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, soon after Tan Wah

Piow absconded from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



National  Service  in  October 1975, our  Immigration

Department  established from their  records  that  his

Singapore  (International) passport had  expired.  His

passport  was issued on 4th March, 1969. Its  validity

was extended on 13th March, 1974 to 18th October, 1974

with  a  clearly impressed endorsement that no further

extension could be made except by the office of  issue

which  is the Immigration Department. This was because

Tan Wah Piow was in the call-up age and had to produce

to  the Immigration Department an Exit Permit from the

Ministry of Defence before any further extension could

be  considered.  No application was  received  by  the

Immigration  Department for an extension  beyond  18th

October. 1974.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 21st October, 1976, the press reported Tan Wah

Piow's  appearance in London. It stated that  Tan  Wah

Piow  had  entered  the U.K, on a Singapore  passport.

Since  Tan  Wah  Piow's passport had expired, it  was

evident  that he must have tampered with  his  expired

passport.  We requested and obtained from the  British

authorities  photostat  copies  of  Tan   Wah   Piow's

passport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British authorities have now given us a

photostat copy showing an endorsement on the last page

of  Tan Wah Piow's passport dated 24th October, 1974,

purporting  to extend the validity of his passport  to

4th March, 1979. The photostat showed it to be forged.

Evidence of the forgery include the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the signature appearing on that endorsement is

not   that  of  any  of  the  two  officers  who  were

authorised to sign such endorsements in October 1 974;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) contrary to the established practice of the

Immigration  Department,  the  endorsement   did   not

indicate that a fee for the endorsement was paid; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) contrary to the established practice of the

Immigration  Department the endorsement did  not  show

the  number  of  the  required Exit  Permit  from  the

Ministry of Defence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How Tan Wah Piow was allowed to enter Britain, I do

not  know. Photostat copies of Tan Wah Piow's passport

showed  that he did not go directly from Singapore  to

the  U.K.  He  could  not have got  through  Singapore

airport  or any other checkpoint undetected  with  his

expired passport. According to the press. Tan Wah Piow

claimed  he slipped into Malaysia. We do not have  any

other  evidence  of  this for  his  passport  was  not

endorsed  either in Kuala Lumpur or Penang airport  or

any other exit checkpoint in Malaysia. The endorsement

of  the passport showed that he arrived in Thailand on

12th June, 1976, and stayed there until  23rd  June.

1976, when he flew off from Bangkok. He then proceeded

to  Amsterdam before arriving at London on 30th  June.

1976.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was reported that he entered U.K, and was given a

permit  to stay for six months. It is well known  that

those  who wan~ to visit the U.K, for six months  have

to  apply to a British embassy or high commission  for

an   entry   certificate.  The  grant  of   an   entry

certificate is not automatic, and it is unlikely  that

a forged passport extension would go unnoticed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what action the Government intends to take.

the  question is whether we should have him extradited

and  on  what grounds. Let me recount Tan  Wah  Piow's

position.  He was convicted for rioting and  sentenced

to  12  months' imprisonment. He has served his  term.

Immediately after his release, he was granted, at  his

request,   three  days'  compassionate  leave   before

reporting for National Service. He absconded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the law, absconding from National

Service is not an extraditable offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we have now evidence from a photostat given by

the  British authorities that he has committed forgery

with   regard   to  his  passport.   Forgery   is   an

extraditable offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we should await the decision of the British

authorities as to whether they will be prosecuting Tan

Wah Piow since he has used an expired passport with  a

forged extension to enter the U.K. I am advised this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



is  a  criminal  offence under  British  law.  If  the

British  authorities decide to overlook  this  offence

and  we  decide to ask for Tan Wah Piow's extradition,

we  shall  request  British  cooperation  to  give  us

evidence  as to when and how Tan Wah Piow entered  the

U.K, and  that  he used his expired passport  with  a

forged extension.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may recall that when Tan Wah Piow failed to

report   for  National  Service,  the  Police,   after

consulting the Ministry of Defence, offered  a  reward

of  $50  for  information leading to  his  arrest.  If

anything, he is now worth less.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Kuo Chuan):</b> The Minister's answer

has interesting implications, Sir. Can he now tell  us

how it was possible for Mr Tan Wah Piow to move in and

out  of  several  countries  and  entered  the  United

Kingdom,  without  difficulty, on an expired  passport

with  an obviously forged extension? He must have  had

backers not only to foot the bill for his journeys but

also to get through Immigration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> It is reasonable to infer that

Tan  Wah  Piow  received help to make his  journey  to

London  and to obtain an entry certificate to stay  in

the  U.K, for six months on a passport with a  forged

extension.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, although Tan Wah Piow

is  no loss to Singapore if it is finally decided  not

to extradite him, will not this encourage other youths

who  are  liable for national service  to  follow  his

footsteps,  falsely endorsing an expired  passport  in

order to escape national service?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, there may be a few wayward

youths  who may try, but for them to succeed in  going

through British immigration they must have backers who

are  capable of helping them. Every year thousands  of

our  youths report for national service. They  have  a

stake in the future of Singapore and are willing to do

their  share to defend that stake. I believe few would

think  of escaping national service, much less forging

passport  endorsements  with  very  little  chance  of

escaping detection either on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>



departure  from  Singapore or on  arrival  in  London,

especially without an entry permit.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, the Minister has just said that

for  those  few  wayward youths to  succeed  in  going

through British immigration with forged passports they

must  have "backers" who are capable of helping  them.

Would  he  not think that it is more likely  that  the

"backers" must be "under obligation", rather than just

being capable of helping them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, perhaps the Member for

Punggol  may  be  right there. However.  I  am  in  no

position to say further to what I have already stated.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Sir, will not Tan Wah

Piow's  backers,  as they have been  described  by  my

colleague,  the  Member for Kuo Chuan, whoever  these

shadowy   individuals  may  be,  feel  encouraged   to

continue  their  disruptive  tactics  if  he  is   not

extradited to face charges in Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, it is of little consequence

how  Tan  Wah Piow's backers feel on this matter,  The

question  is,  are  they  in a position  to  influence

others in Singapore to act like Tan Wah Piow? I  would

think they would not meet with more success than  they

have had with Tan Wah Piow. The political situation in

Singapore   does  not  favour  the  clumsy  disruptive

activities of types like Tan Wah Piow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, can the Minister throw some

light on this mystery? Tan Wah Piow entered the United

Kingdom  through London on 30th June, 1976, and  was

given six months' stay. He must have his passport with

him  like any other visitor. What puzzles me is  this:

how could the British authorities readily get hold  of

his   passport  to  make  photostat  copies?  Can  the

Minister throw some light on this matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, to state the fact. The

photostat copy was provided 20 days after we requested

for it from the British authorities. However. I am not

in  a  position to say when such a photostat copy  was

made.

handwriting or by rubber stamping?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, by both. It has got to be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the completion of the Phase I passenger

terminal together with supporting facilities, such  as

the  air  traffic  control  tower,  freight  terminal,

parking aprons, hangar. Changi Airport is expected  to

become operational by the latter part of 1980.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the first runway and its supporting

facilities are targetted for completion by the  latter

part  of 1980, the second runway at Changi Airport  is

scheduled for completion only in mid-1982. During  the

interim  period from 1980-82, Paya Lebar Airport  will

be  used to cater for the over-spill of civil aircraft

traffic  which could not be handled by Changi  Airport

with  only  one  runway.  A new  direct  express  road

linking Paya Lebar Airport to Changi Airport is  being

built. This will provide a fast and efficient flow  of

passengers  and  vehicles between  the  two  Airports.

After  the  second runway at Changi  is  completed  in

1982,   Paya  Lebar  Airport  will  be   used   as   a

supplementary  airport  to  Changi.  Nonscheduled  and

other  charter flights could also be handled  by  Paya

Lebar Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two parallel runways to be built at Changi

movements  per hour. Presently, there are 22  aircraft

movements per hour at Paya Lebar Airport, and this  is

projected  to  reach about 48 movements  per  hour  in

1992. Therefore, two runways at Changi Airport  would

be  able  to  meet  the needs of  peak  hour  aircraft

movements  well  into  the  next  century.  There  is,

therefore, no plan to build a third runway  at  Changi

Airport in the 198Os.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be two major expressways linking Changi

Airport  with  the main city areas, as well  as  other

parts  of  Singapore.  The  East  Coast  Parkway  will

provide a freeway link between Changi Airport and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>



city.  Construction  works are  in  progress  and  the

Parkway  leading to Changi Airport is expected  to  be

completed  by  mid-1978. Changi Airport will  also  be

linked  to  the  other parts of the island  through  a

section of the Pan-Island Expressway which is expected

to  be  completed  by early 1 980.  A  new  link  road

connecting  Changi Airport to Paya Lebar Airport  will

also   be  built  and  this  is  also  scheduled   for

completion   by  early  1980.  Changi  Airport   will,

therefore,    have    an   efficient    inland    road

transportation  system,  so  that  there  will  be  no

congestion on the access roads to the new Airport.

<div align="center"><b>(Measures to ease and Decision on MRT)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Mr P. Selvadurai</b> asked the Minister for National

Development and Communications (a) what measures other

than  the  imposition of taxes on motor cars, petrol.

diesel   oil  and  the  implementation  of  the   Area

Licensing  Scheme  his  Ministry  will  be  taking  to

further  ease our transport problems; (b) whether  any

decision  has been made by his Ministry  on  the  long

proposed and long awaited Mass Transit System; and (c)

if   the   proposed  Mass  Transit  System   will   be

underground, on the ground or above ground  and  what

parts of the Island it will connect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our transport

problems are mainly due to the limited amount of  road

space  available  and  the large  number  of  vehicles

competing  for  the  use of the  limited  road  space.

Measures taken to reduce these problems include:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) undertaking road improvements and using better

traffic management techniques



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>



to minimise bottlenecks and increase road capacity;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) improving public transport service and

encouraging  commuters  to use  public  mode  of  mass

transportation since the private motor cars do not use

the road space as efficiently;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) giving priority to public transport and goods

vehicles on our limited road space especially  in  the

Central Business District; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) introducing higher vehicle taxes and licence

fees to restrain the growth of motor cars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures introduced over the past few years

have  enabled  us  to ease traffic congestion  on  our

roads.  Latest figures show that the entry of  private

cars  into  the Central Business District  during  the

morning peak hours from 7.30 am, to 10.15 am. Ms  been

reduced  by  75% compared to the level  prevailing  in

March  last year before the introduction of  the  Area

Licensing Scheme. Car pools account for 49% of private

cars entering the Restricted Zone as compared with 23%

in  July last year. This is an encouraging trend which

shows that motorists have responded favourably to  our

encouragement of a more efficient use of private cars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although traffic outbound from the Restricted Zone

in  the  evening has increased by 12% over  June  last

year, observations  have  shown  that  congestion  is

localised and of short duration caused mainly by cross

town  traffic.  The situation will  be  monitored  and

measures will be taken to improve the traffic flow  as

and  when necessary. In the meantime our efforts  will

be  directed towards further improvement of the public

transport services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Mass Transit System, a draft

final Report of Phase II of the Mass Transit Study was

submitted  by the Consultants in March this year.  The

World Bank, which is the executive agency for UNDP, is

currently reviewing the Report. We expect the Bank  to

complete its appraisal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>



soon and the Phase II Report finalised shortly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile plans for the coordination and integration

of  the  MRT into a comprehensive land use  scheme  in

keeping   with  the  overall  island-wide  development

Concept  Plan are being examined. Since implementation

of  the  MRT  will  affect many other sectors  besides

transport,  careful consideration has to be  given  to

not  only'  its  costs  but its likely  influence  and

impact   on   development   planning,   locations   of

employment and residential centres, commuting  habits,

and  the  economy in general. The existence or absence

of the MRT will determine to a large extent the nature

of  the urban structure including the Central Area  in

the nineties and beyond. It is for this reason that  a

land use and transportation plan is being drawn up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MRT cannot be considered solely as a

transportation project. A decision on the MAT can only

be made after all factors have been carefully weighed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the Phase II MAT study, a total of 44.6 km

is  envisaged  for the Full System, of which  17.6  km

will  be  underground and the remaining 27 km will  be

either at grade, depressed or elevated. There will  be

31  stations  with 1 5 built underground or  depressed

and 16 at grade or elevated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since underground lines and stations are much more

expensive   than  surface  structures,  a   deliberate

attempt  is made to reduce costs by having the  trains

operated   at   or   above  groun‡l   level   wherever

engineering  construction permits and wherever  it  is

environmentally  acceptable.  Owing  to  the  built-up

nature of the City Centre, all the tracks and stations

will have to be underground in the Central Area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Full System, which assumes an inverted h-shape,

will   connect  the  Central  Area  with   Queenstown,

Clementi  New Town. Jurong Town in the west.  Geylang,

Bedok  New Town in the east and Toa Payoh, Ang Mo  Kio

New  Town  in  the north. Stations at the  extremities

would  serve other population centres beyond the  line

through the use of feeder bus services. An example  is

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>



Bedok  Station will also serve residents  in  Tampines

New  Town. About 50% of both population and employment

are  expected to be located within 1 km on either side

of the MAT line.

<div align="center"><b>FLOODS AND DRAINAGE PROBLEMS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Law and the Environment)</b></div>



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> In the last decade Singapore has

seen  a  boom  in the building construction  industry.

Many   new   roads   and  highways  have   also   been

constructed. Hills have been levelled and  swamps  and

low-lying  areas, which served as flood  basins, have

been  filled  in.  As a result, rain water  no  longer

seeps into the ground as much as before, but runs  off

rapidly  and  sometimes causes floods.  When  a  heavy

rainfall coincides with a high tide, especially a high

spring  tide, floods occur in some areas and sometimes

even in areas which were never flooded before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of the canal near the Turf Club to

divert flood waters from Bukit Timah to Ulu Pandan has

alleviated  but  not  eradicated flooding  along  that

major trunk road. The construction of another canal to

divert  flood  waters in the Bukit  Timah  canal  from

Whitley  Road  to  Sungei Whampoa is  therefore  being

reconsidered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second canal will also be constructed along

Orchard  Road to alleviate flooding along  that  road.

The  canal  will  be  covered  over  and  used  as   a

pedestrian mall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year Government approved a five-year Drainage

Development  Programme  costing  about  $148  million.

Under this plan, drainage work has already started  on

the  widening and concrete lining of drains and canals

in  the  Kallang,  Ulu  Pandan. Pang  Sua,  Bedok  and

Geylang Serai areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing drains and canals as well as those under

construction will be sufficiently large to  cope  with

average rainfall. It will not be economical both  from

the project cost and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>



land  use  aspects  to build extra  large  canals  for

exceptional storms that may occur infrequently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite all that is being done to alleviate

flooding, we cannot eradicate floods completely.  More

rain  is expected in the next month or so, and if  the

rain is heavy and coincides with a high tide, flooding

will  occur. But our floods do not last long and  will

not reach the proportions of a disaster.

<div align="center"><b>FINANCIAL PROCEDURE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>First Reading</b></div>

<br><br>3.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to introduce a Bill intituled  "An

Act  to amend the Financial Procedure Act (Chapter  68

of the Revised Edition)".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.



<div align="center"><b>Second Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Second Reading, what day?

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Now, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certificate of Urgency signed by the President in

respect  of  the  Bill, laid upon  the  Table  by  the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typed copies of the Bill distributed to Members.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 17 of the Financial Procedure Act (Chapter

68  of the Revised Edition) provides, inter alia, for

an Establishment List to be presented to Parliament at

its  annual  Budget  session. The Establishment  List,

which  forms  part  of the Estimates  of  Expenditure,

shows, in  respect of each Head of  Expenditure,  the

authorised number and grades of posts as well as their

salary  codes  and serves as the control document  for

the Government's establishment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The format of the Establishment List was designed

for  a  system  in  which  officers  filled  posts  in

accordance  with their grades or were paid  allowances

for  the additional responsibility of acting in  posts

higher than their own grades. However, a decision  has

been made recently to abolish acting allowances and to

introduce  a  system of responsibility allowances  and

merit  promotions, whereby  promotions  will  now  be

decided  on  the  basis  of the  merit  of  individual

candidates and will no longer depend on the number  of

vacancies  in  the various grades of appointment.  The

Establishment  List in future should  no  longer  show

grades of appointments under Heads of Expenditure.  It

is intended instead that the authorised manpower under

each  Head  of  Expenditure be arranged  according  to

Personnel Groups. Each Personnel Group will comprise a

single  recruitment grade and a number of  promotional

grades. The Establishment List will show the number of

posts approved for each Personnel Group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable the new format to he adopted for the FY 77

Establishment  List,  section 1  7  of  the  Financial

Procedure Act will have to be amended. The substantial

amendment is in respect of subsection (3) of section 1

7  which stipulates that the Establishment List  shall

show   the   public  offices  under   each   Head   of

Expenditure.  This  subsection  will  be  amended   to

provide that the Establishment List should show  under

each  Head  of  Expenditure the political appointments

and  the  number  and  categories of  personnel  whose

salaries  are  to be met from the allocations  in  the

Budget.  The  existing  requirement  that  all  public

offices  or  posts  be  identified  in  full  in   the

Establishment List will be deleted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is being taken to amend also the

other   subsections  of  section  1  7.  The   present

subsection 17(2) in effect specifies that there  shall

be  two  types  of  subheads in  the  Main  Estimates,

namely, subheads showing expenditure on the  manpower

requirements  in  the establishment in  that  Head  of

Expenditure  and  other operating expenditure.  It  is

proposed to delete this subsection to provide  greater

flexibility in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>



deciding upon the structure of individual subheads  in

the Main Estimates. Under the programme budget system,

which my Ministry proposes to introduce in FY 78, each

subhead  will show the total expenditure  required  to

carry  out  a  particular  activity  and  the  present

categorisation of expenditure estimates into  EOM  and

OOE subheads will be dropped. The other amendments are

to   the  wording  and  the  numbering  of  the  other

subsections  of  section 1 7 and do not  affect  their

substance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments are required by law to be enacted and

brought  into  force  before the FY  77  Estimates  of

Expenditure are presented to this House next year. The

administrative requirements in the preparation of  the

FY   77  Budget, however,  limit  further  the   time

available.   Expenditure  proposals, including   the

extensive  changes to the manpower  component  of  the

Budget document, have to be submitted, scrutinised and

discussed,  before the final drafts are  submitted  to

the  Printers for first proofs. If the whole budgetary

process  is  not to be seriously disrupted, therefore,

the  amendments  should be enacted  and  brought  into

force  as  early as possible. There may not be  enough

business  or  enough  time to  make  it  possible  for

another  sitting  to  be  held  well  before  the   FY

estimates  are presented next year. It is  accordingly

necessary  to take the Bill through all  stages  on  a

Certificate of Urgency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in

my capacity as Chairman of the Estimates Committee.  I

must  express my regret that the Minister for  Finance

seems  to be trying to ram this Amendment Bill through

the  House  without prior consultation or extending  a

courtesy  to  the Estimates Committee. I would  rather

prefer  that  sufficient  time  be  extended  to   the

Estimates Committee and that particulars of any change

be  submitted  to  that Committee.  On  that  courtesy

Members  of the Estimates Committee would be  able  to

air their views,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



and  indeed, this was the practice before.  I  suppose

there must be a good reason why this has not been done

this time. I do hope that the Hon. Minister would bear

my suggestion in mind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I take the Member's

point  and  apologise  to him  and  to  the  Estimates

Committee.  These  amendments  are,  however, mainly

technical, and in the ordinary way I would  not  take

the   Bill  through  all  the  stages.  But  in   this

particular  case I do not think they  are  matters  of

policy. They are just technical amendments to be  made

to  the Budget documents. I will, however, consult the

Estimates Committee on the nature of the format and so

on before these are finalised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

<div align="center"><b>INFECTIOUS DISEASES BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The control and prevention of infectious diseases

into  Singapore have been regulated by the  Quarantine

and  Prevention of Diseases Act of 1915,  the  Leprosy

Act  of  1949 and the Diphtheria Immunization  Act  of

1962. The  purpose  of  this Bill  is  to  bring  the

provisions of the old Acts under one cover and at  the

same  time to provide more effective measures  against

the  spread of infectious diseases. The need for  this

Bill is substantiated by the outbreak of two epidemics

in  1975  - a malaria epidemic and a typhoid epidemic.

Investigations showed that the outbreak of malaria  in

the  Whampoa area was due to a single patient who  had

been  infected  by  the disease when  he  was  outside

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As facilities for travel become easier and

immigration  controls  are more  relaxed,  it  becomes

essential  for  Singapore to be vigilant  against  the

importation and spread of infectious diseases  in  the

Republic. At present, diseases which must be  notified

by  medical practitioners include cholera and typhoid,

plague,   smallpox, yellow   fever,   chicken   pox,

diphtheria,     leprosy, malaria, poliomyelitis,

tuberculosis and typhus. Under the provisions of  this

Bill, the  schedule of notifiable diseases  has  been

widened  to include infectious hepatitis, encephalitis

and  venereal diseases, Although private  doctors  are

required to notify cases of venereal diseases, they do

not  have to reveal the names and particulars of their

patients.  The reason for such a step is to  encourage

infected  persons  to  seek  treatment  by  their  own

doctors as early as possible. In this way, it is hoped

that  the spread of sexually transmitted diseases  can

be  voluntarily  kept under control  without  patients

being fearful that they will be publicly embarrassed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The control of infectious diseases within Singapore

will  be  administered  by  the  Director  of  Medical

Services, whilst the prevention and  introduction  of

such diseases, in particular cholera, typhoid, malaria

and dengue haemorrhagic fever, into Singapore will  be

administered by the Commissioner of Public  Health  in

the Ministry of the Environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 of the Bill empowers the Director of

Medical  Services to prohibit any person from carrying

on any occupation, trade or business if in doing so he

will cause the spread of the disease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House are aware of the "Combat

Infectious Diseases Campaign" carried out in September

this  year, during  which the  public  attention  was

focussed   on   tuberculosis,   food-borne   diseases,

malaria,   dengue  haemorrhagic  fever, leprosy   and

venereal diseases. The campaign has been successful in

educating the public into the causes and effects posed

by these diseases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from legislative measures, I believe that an

educated  and well-informed public is a more important

factor in controlling the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>



outbreak  of  epidemics and assure a high standard  of

health in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in

support  of the Bill. To describe the introduction  of

this Infectious Diseases Bill as timely might well  be

the   understatement  of  the  year.  This  piece   of

legislation  is  really long overdue as  the  existing

Quarantine  and Prevention of Diseases Act which  this

Bill seeks largely to replace was first introduced  in

1915. Many of the references in the original Act  are

therefore  completely out of date, even to the  extent

of retaining quaint colonial overtones.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in the section in the old Act devoted

to the interpretation of terms, much space is taken by

reference to animals, carcass, cattle, dairy,  fodder,

litter, and so on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Corpse!



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Yes. Again, oddly, an immigrant in the

old Act is characterised as



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(a) any person not being a first or second class

passenger  arriving in the waters of  Singapore  in  a

ship with the intention of landing in Singapore;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) any person arriving at any local area n

Singapore as a third class passenger in a train;'



<br><br>Apparently  at  that time they did  not  believe  that

first  and  second  class  passengers  could  transmit

infectious diseases. Or again,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(c) any person arriving at any local area .n

Singapore on foot in a bullock-cart, hire gharri ...'



<br><br>and  so on. For the benefit of the younger members  of

this  House  whose  experience may not  have  included

acquaintance  with the term "gharri", it  means  horse

cart.  This Bill, therefore, seeks to replace  an  old

outmoded  colonial piece of legislation with something

more related to our present circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some of the classic diseases which the old

piece  of legislation was particularly exercised over.

such  as  small-pox  and plague, have  been  virtually

eliminated we must always keep our defences up against

the  risk of introduction of infectious diseases  from

outside  Singapore. Though we do not  have  immigrants

arriving on foot, in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>



bullock-carts or in gharries (we have emigrants  going

out with forged passports!), modern modes of transport

and  the  large  influx and movement of  tourists  and

those  on  business  have made Singapore  one  of  the

busiest  crossroads  of international  travel  in  the

world. There always remains the risk of diseases being

introduced without prior warning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern international traffic is so intensive that it

is not possible to set up any kind of cordon sanitaire

of  the  good old days. Quarantine laws have therefore

to be updated in keeping with contemporary conditions.

For,  not  only do we have the better known infectious

diseases  to  guard against, but there  are  also  new

exotic   but   nonetheless   very   dangerous    viral

afflictions, outbreaks of which have been noted in one

or  two countries, both developed and under developed.

Powers to tackle such diseases, even if these ailments

are  not  presently  subject to  international  health

regulations, have been incorporated in this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should remember. Mr Speaker, Sir, that Singapore

is  one of the healthiest countries in the world where

environmental conditions are concerned and  we  should

continue  to keep it that way. Our people are provided

with  safe  drinking water, modern  sanitation  and  a

clean environment. The inculcation of better standards

of personal hygiene and public health has been part of

the  continuing  public education  programmes  of  the

relevant Government departments, programmes that  have

been carried out at community centres and through mass

campaigns and in other ways. Where infectious diseases

have occurred sporadically, our constant vigilance and

effective  surveillance have paid dividends  in  early

detection and immediate action and treatment to ensure

that the diseases are brought under control quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has often enough been stated that our best assets

and  prime resources are people. It is important  that

every  effort  be made to safeguard their  health  and

protect them from avoidable infection: this especially

so  in  view  of  the  fact of the close  relationship

between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>



our   relatively  high  standard  of  living  and  our

achievement in the field of public health. I  am  sure

Hon.  Members  who  have recently so  enthusiastically

played  their part in the "Combat Infectious  Diseases

Campaign"  will support fully this move to update  the

laws relating to the control of infectious diseases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the Minister has pointed out, it is not

enough  merely to pass laws and implement them at  the

official  level.  For  the  effect  of  laws   to   be

successful,   it  is  necessary  to  have   the   full

cooperation of the population. Although the  ensurance

of   clean  water  supply  and  modern  sanitation  to

households   have  eliminated  many  of   the   common

infectious  diseases  such as  cholera, some  enteric

diseases are still prevalent. Therefore, standards  of

personal  hygiene  have yet to be  raised  higher  and

should  there be any unfortunate infection  occurring,

prompt   reporting   from  the  public   and   medical

practitioners, and  general  public   alertness   are

equally essential for halting the spread of infectious

diseases, for notification is one of the keystones  of

our  programme  of  protection of our  people  against

infectious diseases.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have nothing

particularly to add to what the Member for Katong  has

said except to thank him for the historical references

that  he  has made. It sounds amusing in these  modern

times. I am glad I am receiving his support.

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honourable Members of the House are aware that

Government  has  given several fiscal  concessions  to

help  develop  Singapore  as a  financial  centre  and

promote  the  Asian Dollar Market. In my  last  annual

Budget Statement, I announced more concessions to  the

same  purpose. The concessions relating to estate duty

are,  first,  that  non-resident deposits  with  Asian

Currency Units and approved Asian Dollar Bonds held by

non-residents  will  be exempt from  Singapore  estate

duty   with  effect  from  1st January, 1976, and,

secondly,  that  Singapore Government tax-free  bonds.

held  by  non-residents, will  also  be  exempt  from

Singapore estate duty from the same date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Estate Duty Act by

inserting a new section 1OA to provide for these  two

concessions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Mr Hon Sui Sen].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill  be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Asian Development Bank

Act  by  adding  thereto a new section 9A  which  will

exempt the Asian Development Bank and the issue by the

Bank  of  shares, debentures, bonds, notes  and  other

securities from the requirements of the Companies Act.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian Development Bank (referred to as "the

ADB")  has  so far not borrowed from the Asian  Dollar

Market,  although it has issued bonds in  the  capital

markets   of   New  York,  Tokyo.  Zurich,  Frankfurt.

Luxembourg  and Vienna. Before the Bank  can  consider

floating a bond in Singapore, it will be necessary  to

remove certain legal constraints which arise from  the

broad  definition  of  the term "corporation"  in  the

Companies Act. Under the Act, a "corporation" includes

any  body corporate whether domiciled in Singapore  or

abroad.  Although  the ADB is not  a  Company, it  is

deemed  to  be  a  Corporation under the  Act  and  is

therefore required to comply with the requirements  of

the  Companies Act in the event of a public  issue  of

its securities in Singapore. However, certain sections

in   the   Companies  Act  are  not  appropriate   for

application  to  the  Bank  as  an  inter-governmental

organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to facilitate the entry of the ADB into the

Asian Dollar Market, it is proposed to amend the Asian

Development Bank Act of Singapore so that the ADB will

be  deemed not to be a Corporation within the  meaning

of the Companies Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Hon Sui Sen].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.
