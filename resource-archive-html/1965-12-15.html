Question [14th December, 1965],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the following Address in reply to the speech

of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara be agreed to: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Legislative Assembly of Singapore express

our  thanks  to  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  for  the

speech which he delivered on behalf of the Government

at  the  opening  of  the  present  Session  of  this

Assembly.".'. ---- [The Prime Minister].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The debate can now resume.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker.  Sir,  the policy speech  delivered  by  His

Excellency  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in this  House

has  enumerated  the new policies and programmes  for

our   nation-building.  All  these   programmes   and

policies represent a challenge. They outline our aims

and  tasks for nation-building, that is, to  build  a

multi-racial, democratic socialist society  which  is

fair and just. The task of nation-building is not  of

the  Government  alone. It is also the  task  of  all

patriotic citizens. All people should be mobilised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opening of the present Session is a new page in

the history of Singapore. It has ushered in a new era

in  the  history  of Singapore as an independent  and

sovereign country. It has ushered in an era in  which

we should all contribute our best towards building  a

prosperous  and happy nation. What is regrettable  is

that  when  such  an  era is being  ushered  in,  the

Barisan   Sosialis  Members  are  not   sharing   our

sentiments and the sentiments of the people when they

resort to boycotting this Session or Parliament. This

is  understandable  from their philosophy - subversion

against  our nation. We condemn the Barisan  Sosialis

action  in boycotting the Parliament and in resorting

to  anti-national activities. As Assemblymen  elected

by  the people, their basic duty is to speak for  the

people  and to voice the intentions and the  will  of

the  people in this House. Yet they have gone out  of

their way to say that our independence is phoney  and

that  our sovereignty is only superficial. More  than

100  nations throughout the world have recognised  in

as  an  independent  and sovereign country,  although

ours  is  a small country. This can be seen from  the

keen welcome extended to our Goodwill Mission to

Afro-Asian countries led by our Deputy Prime Minister, Dr

Toh  Chin Chye. The talk by the Barisan Sosialis that

Singapore's independence is false should be condemned

by all the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, what has made the case of the

Barisan  Sosialis so sad is the Fact that the  people

have  not  paid  any attention to their  shouting  of

slogans. Their boycott has caused no surprise because

all  the  people  have  come to  realise  that  their

performance   and  the  shouting  of   slogans   that

Singapore is a neo-colonialist country created by  an

imperialist  plot  have  been  seen  through  by  the

people. Now the people are discerning. In the end, in

the  course  of  history, such a hunch  of  political

adventurers   will  be  buried  by  the  overwhelming

strength of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task ahead of us is to build a multi-racial,

multi-lingual, multi-cultural,    multi-religious

society - fair and just - in which everybody can get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



a fair share of the facilities and benefits offered

by the country and where nobody will he discriminated

against  by  others.  This has  all  along  been  our

objective, in fact, since 1959 when our Party came to

power. This policy has been implemented ever since we

have been in power. It is the one best fitted to  the

multi-racial   character   of   our   society.    The

intelligent  leadership and policy of the  Government

have  rallied the people closer together.  They  have

set  an  objective for all the people to strive  for.

All  patriotic citizens should seize this opportunity

to  do  their  best  in this work of nation-building.

This policy is the only correct one that can lead our

country towards a happy and prosperous society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Chinese are the majority in Singapore,

our  policy is based on multi-racialism. This is  the

basis  of  our  policy in nation  building.  We  have

recognised Malay, Chinese, Tamil and English  as  the

four  official  languages, with Malay as  the  common

national  language. In fact, this humane and  correct

policy  will  not  only  bring about  prosperity  and

stability to our nation, but it is also one that  has

the  popular support of the people. From this we  can

see that the policy of nation-building based on

multi-racialism is one that is acceptable to all. It is the

only  correct  one. It is also a humanitarian  policy

which can lead to the happiness and prosperity of our

country.  In  Switzerland, where the same  policy  is

pursued, we also see peace and happiness. The  events

in  Rhodesia  and  South Africa  and  in  some  other

countries, on the contrary, are not very enviable for

us  to  emulate.  There  is discrimination  in  those

countries. They are in a state of turmoil and we  can

see sanguinary fratricidal activities going on there.

We  want  to  remind  the racial extremists  of  such

racial  inequality  and the tragedy  that  is  taking

place  there. They should reconsider their  attitude.

They  should  open their eyes wide and  see  what  is

taking  place  in South Africa, Rhodesia  and  Cyprus

where  there are racial disturbances. These conflicts

are a great tragedy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. I shall now touch on the Five-Year Plan as contained in the policy speech of the Yang di- Pertuan Negara. The task ahead is for a peaceful reformation of our society. After seven years of continuous improvements in building and construction, we have achieved certain objectives. These

achievements  have  won  the  general   applause   of

international   circles.  They  have  acclaimed   our

achievements. Even our Minister for Finance, Mr  Lim

Kim San, was acknowledged for his meritorious service

in   nation-building  by  being  presented  with  the

Magsaysay Award.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy is good for our society. Under this

policy a high living standard for our people has been

brought about. From 1961-64 we implemented the  first

Five-Year  Plan.  We  spent  about  $870  million  in

economic     development, housing,     industrial

development, public administration, social  services,

and  other services which have given a great  impetus

to  the  progress of Singapore. From 1961 there  have

been  annual increases in revenue and expenditure  on

development is also increasing. In 1961 the  sum  was

$230  million, and in 1964 it was $280 million. There

was an increase of 7 per cent. Additional sums are to

he  allotted for the additional one year to the First

Plan.  Large  sums have again been allotted  for  the

next  Five-Year  Plan which will he used  for  social

reforms,    housing,    urban    redevelopment    and

industrialisation    which    will    create     more

opportunities of employment, and which will  lead  to

the modernisation of our City State. Undoubtedly this

Five-Year   Development  Plan  can  be  expected   to

succeed.  This  will further raise  the  standard  of

living  of  our  people who are  already  enjoying  a

comfortable standard of living, just as what was said

in the policy speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;British bases now in Singapore are only a temporary

measure   for   our  own  defence.   Therefore,   our

Government is contemplating the implementation  of  a

volunteer  force in order to defend our  country.  No

matter  how  the Barisan Sosialis and  their  stooges

boycott  us,  the  people will pay no  heed  to  such

foolish antics.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures strongly reflect the fact that our

nation  is  recognised as one having a good standing.

The  people understand very well that it is the  duty

of  everybody to contribute his bit to the  continued

progress  of his country. For that purpose,  all  the

people  should volunteer to join the People's  Forces

in  order  to  defend our country,  so  that  we  may

survive.  There is a Chinese saying that  it  is  the

duty  of every citizen to see that his nation exists,

and   this  kind  of  patriotic  act  is  the  surest

guarantee of our continued survival and the existence

of our nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this newly independent country of

ours has given all the people new tasks to perform in

order  to  build a model country in which  all  races

will  have equal status. The minority races will have

special safeguards in the Constitution. Everybody can

play  his  part in nation-building. Every able-bodied

person and youth should brace himself for the task of

nation-building  and  render  his  services  to   the

country to the best of his ability, whether it is  in

the   fields  of  commerce,  education,  agriculture,

defence,  or  in  any other field of human  activity.

Everyone can contribute his hit to enable the country

to  march  forward to become a modernised and  highly

industrialised  country which  will  bring  about  an

affluent  society for all the two million  people  of

Singapore --- a new model society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara for his speech, and I support the motion.



<br><br>2.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  this  is  the First Parliament  of  independent

Singapore, and I join my friends in thanking the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara for his Address delivered  in  this

House. In his Address, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara has

said  that equal treatment will he given to all races

and  all language streams, and also that a Commission

will  be  appointed to look into the  rights  of  the

minority  races and to find .out their  problems.  No

country  in  the  world has only  one  race  for  its

population. At one time or other different races have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



lived  in these countries and different cultures  put

into  practice. Finally, as the days go by, all these

different cultures are integrated and become one. For

example, take Russia or the United States of America.

In  these  countries there are people who speak  many

languages and who belong to many races. Countries  in

Asia,  Africa and Europe are no exception either.  We

can even take our neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia.

They  have people of different races and of different

cultures.  It is also the case with Singapore,  which

now  has  attained full independence. It  has  got  a

multi-racial population. We, the Government, can  put

into practice proper programmes and adopt a policy of

mutual   understanding  and   tolerance.   By   these

policies,  we  can  have  a nation  of  peaceful

co-existence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a small island and our people have to

depend  on  trade.  We  have to  admit  that  we  are

enjoying  a high standard of living and, at the  same

time, our population is increasing. So the Government

has a duty to increase the facilities for the people.

In  education, housing, and in the industrial  field,

we have achieved progress through our first Five-Year

Plan.  At  the  same  time when  we  talk  about  our

progress, we have also to look into the defects.  The

Government has to find out the defects and  work  out

remedies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Tamil secondary school in Singapore. It

is  the only Tamil secondary school and is called the

Umar Pulavar Secondary School. The children who leave

it after completing their studies are not able to get

equal    opportunities   for   jobs   in   Government

departments.  If  the reason for this  is  the  lower

standard  of education in this school, the Government

should  find  out  the  defects  and,  if  necessary,

introduce a new syllabus, thereby giving such

school-leavers  equal  preference with  children  who  leave

schools in other streams.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our housing programme is praiseworthy. But the

Housing Board is adopting certain policies which  are

not  practicable. For example, take a family  of  two

boys,  two  girls, and a mother. They take a  Housing

Board flat



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



under  the  name of one of the boys and live  for  15

years.  As the days go by, the two boys are  married,

and  one  of  them is quick enough  to  buy  a  house

through a loan from the Government. Since the Housing

Board  flat  was acquired through him,  he  writes  a

letter to the Board saying that he has bought a house

and requesting the Board to change the tenancy to his

brother  who  is going to live there. But  the  Board

says,  "According to our rules, if a  tenant  buys  a

house  of  his own, he has to vacate the  fiat  as  a

whole  with  his family." "This is impossible,"  says

the  tenant. "I can move into my own house only  with

my  wife and children. I can't take the whole  family

in,  my  brother and my mother." But the Board argues

that  they  can  change the tenancy  only  under  two

conditions  - one is should the tenant die,  and  the

other should the tenant leave the country. Other than

these  two  conditions,  they  will  not  change  the

tenancy to any other person. So we have certain rules

which are not practicable, and I request the Board to

change  them, so that they could he put into practice

and  help  to  raise the standard of  living  of  our

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I wish to touch on foreign policy. We are

adopting a non-aligned policy in our foreign affairs.

This  was  stated by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.  For

example,   we  are  friendly  with  our  neighbouring

countries and we show our goodwill to them.  This  is

our desire. This is important for the progress of our

people  and  country as a whole. Now  we  are  in  an

atomic  age, and we can only survive if  we  adopt  a

neutral  policy. Afro-Asian countries and  India  are

adopting such a policy. Our Government has adopted it

in  world  politics. It will be independent  in  such

policies.  If  we put into practice our policies,  we

show  no partiality towards West or East. We are  not

bound  by  any  of these countries.  In  our  foreign

policy  as  regards  Vietnam and  the  Indo-Pakistani

conflict, we are neutral and we closely go  with  the

Afro-Asian countries. By adopting this policy, we can

create more opportunities for the trade of our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



country.  Most  of  our people depend  on  trade  and

industries for their livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Jurong industrial complex, there are many

factories   coming  up  and  more  goods  are   being

produced.  We have to search for outside markets  for

these products. There is no Common Market going to be

established  with  Malaysia,  so  we  have  to   find

external markets for the good of our people. We  have

to  live, so the only way is to have a neutral policy

with  all the countries and establish trade relations

with countries like America, Russia and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, our Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign

Minister and the State Minister for Education went on

a  tour.  A  good reception was given to  them.  This

reflects the correctness of our policy. Next year  we

are   going  to  send  trade  missions  to  different

countries. This shows our victory in this field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan are boycotting this Parliament now. They

say  we should be friendly with Afro-Asian countries.

In  fact,  we are friendly with Afro-Asian countries.

Not  only  that, but we go even beyond that.  We  are

adopting the neutral policy of these countries and  I

would like to tell these people this, in fact, it  is

the Barisan who adopt a particular group policy. They

say  that  we  should  he  friendly  with  Afro-Asian

countries but they do not have the foresight  of  the

Afro-Asian countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been accepted as an independent

country  by  the United Nations. When our  delegation

went  to  the  Afro-Asian countries  to  explain  our

independence,  they  respected  the  independence  of

Singapore  and  gave  a  red carpet  welcome  to  the

delegation.  But the Barisan here are boycotting  the

Session  of  this Parliament. This shows how  defunct

they  are in their policies. They do not know how  to

respect their own country's independence. They do not

understand  the independence of their own country.  I

say  to  them that they should learn from  the

Afro-Asian  countries to respect Singapore's independence.

We  are  trying  to he friendly with  Indonesia,  our

biggest neighbour. We are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



prepared  to  sell  to Indonesia,  which  needs  them

urgently,  food and medicine. Recently the Indonesian

Foreign  Minister, Dr Subandrio, has  expressed  his

desire to have talks with Singapore. In future, there

is an opportunity for better relationship between the

peoples  of  both the territories. One day  Indonesia

and Peking will realise the status of our independent

country.  When that time conies, I do not know  where

the  Barisan will go and hide themselves. Our foreign

policy  will  always take into account not  only  the

welfare  of  our people hut also the welfare  of  the

people in Malaysia.



<br><br>3.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are

indeed  very grateful for the opportunity to he  here

today  to  express our thanks to His  Excellency  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara for his Address at the opening

of the present Session of this House. Grateful indeed

we  ought to be for our very presence here,  for  the

political developments in the last two years ---  two

very  eventful  years --- took such a rapid  and  rigid

course   that   even  the  then  Central   Government

contemplated  repressive measures which  were  openly

admitted  without  reserve by the Prime  Minister  of

Malaysia,  Prince Abdul Rahman, on the day we  became

independent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not know whether we can regard ourselves

as unfortunate, for we happened to assume the role of

speaking  the minds of the people and, therefore,  we

were supposed to be the ones that were repressed. But

one  thing we are fortunate in - and I think the people

across  the Causeway should also share in it  ---  is

that   these  repressive  measures  never  became   a

reality. Because if they did, then it would throw the

whole  country  into  chaos and  confusion,  and  the

existence  of this House and the Members  here  would

have become a mockery of democracy, a term which  has

a  different  connotation in the minds  of  both  the

feudal reactionaries ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have indicated to the House

that that is a line which the Chair will not accept.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> The term "democracy" has a

different   connotation   in   the   minds   of   the

communalists and the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the intensity of the political struggle

between the P.A.P. and the ultra-communalists in  the

last  two years was not only a bitter battle  to  win

and  capture the hearts and minds of the  people  for

our  survival alone, but was also a conflict  of  the

basic political philosophy between the Right-wing and

the progressive democratic Socialists, in our way, we

believe that we can succeed and we have succeeded  to

a very large extent in proving to the people that our

method  is the best alternative in achieving a better

deal in life for the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in whatever direction the political

development in our country may take, we, the  P.A.P.,

are  always alive to the challenges that confront  us

from  time  to  time;  and for these  challenges,  we

sought  for  and  obtained  new  approaches  and  new

solutions. In this gruelling struggle, we have  never

lost  sight of our objectives and obligations to  the

people of Singapore, i.e., to build, in the course of

five,  ten  or even 20 years, a multi-racial  society

founded  upon the principles of democratic socialism.

We  are caught, as in every developing country in the

world,  in  a  dilemma;  that is,  in  our  political

approaches, the Government must be ideological and as

pragmatic  in  its  administration.  There  are  some

political   Parties  which  cannot  adopt   a   fixed

political  ideology  for  their  party  lines.   Some

political Parties are openly anti-Communist  and,  at

the  same time, resist the idea of socialism, for  it

was  branded as a foreign ideology. And at  the  same

time,  they  refuse to be called capitalists.  So  if

they are anti-Communists, reject socialism and refuse

to be called capitalists, what are they?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the struggle was in fact the result of rising

fear  of  the  traditionalists. It was  the  fear  of

progress, the fear of new ideas, the fear of a better

deal for the people, the fear of a better alternative

which  inevitably must result in higher  demands  and

expectations  from the people. For us, these  demands

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



expectations are to be welcomed, because  we  believe

it  is  only  with  the political sophistication  and

maturity of the people that a nation can survive  and

progress.  We  can  afford  to  make  this  statement

because,  with our determination, our dedication  and

our  dynamism  which is so apparently absent  in  the

leadership  in  the  neighbouring countries,  we  can

meet, to a fairly adequate extent, the immediate  and

the long-term requirements of our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to the traditionalists, our

progress  and  achievements  must  be  resisted   and

halted.  But  they were not the only  ones  who  were

envious  and  frightened  of  our  success.  For  the

Communists  and  the pro-Communist Barisan  Sosialis,

our  success would mean that the democratic socialist

way  in  nation-building  was  far  better  than  the

Communist-Marxist  idea of armed  revolution  -  that

destruction   must  necessarily  be  a   prelude   to

construction. En all these struggles, the  Communists

and   the   front-line  expendables  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis  found  themselves in a  state  of  complete

indecisiveness and, therefore, inspiration would have

to  be  sought from somewhere outside Singapore.  But

this inspiration was not forthcoming and neither  was

this  arrangement satisfactory because, at this  very

moment,  the  two reluctant Members  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis, the Member for Nee Soon and the Member  for

Toa Payoh are now being chased from pillar to post by

the anti-Communist army quite near to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our struggle in the last two years can be

generalised  into two fronts. On the  one  hand,  the

ideological  front and, on the other,  the  pragmatic

front. The temporary impotency of the Communists  and

the  Barisan Sosialis gave us good time  and  a  good

opportunity to concentrate our efforts in  our  fight

with  the  communalists and the traditionalists.  For

the  P.A.P. in Singapore, politically our  base  has

been  secured. And to the Communalists, there is only

one  avenue  open to them. They know that politically

they  can  never control Singapore. Our  people  with

progressive  ideas, our people with  higher  demands,

require



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



an  administration  that will bring  better  results.

Therefore,  the  political  arena  of  Singapore  was

totally  hostile  to them. And, therefore,  the  only

avenue   left   to  them  was  by  way  of   economic

strangulation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not wish to touch on the pros and cons of

Malaysia. I personally feel that the concept and  the

basic  principles  which brought about  Malaysia  are

still  valid  at this very moment. However,  when  we

were  a  member in Malaysia, as I said  earlier,  our

progress was not to be tolerated. And in this action,

they  paid a high price  - turnover tax, crown cork

tax,  profit tax and a whole host of others - at  the

expense of even the sufferings of their own people - our  people. Sir, in sentiment, I cannot  regard  the

people across the Causeway as a separate people.  And

they  introduced  all these taxes even  knowing  full

well that their own people would suffer.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member is referring to

present  measures taken by the Malaysian  Parliament,

he is completely out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, I was referring to

the  taxes imposed while we were a member in a larger

family.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Then the Member is in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> And just because we criticised

the undesirability of these taxes, we were branded as

subversive. Now that Singapore is no longer a  member

State  of a greater family, Malaysia, all these taxes

were  dropped for they are no longer valid and useful

with the P.A.P. now confined and localised to a small

island of 224 square miles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, independence on the 9th of August caught both

the  Right-wing and the Communists by  surprise.  For

the  Barisan  Sosialis,  new instructions  could  not

reach  them in time and they are now facing a

three-level  split,  a  split in the higher leadership,  as

acknowledged by Mr Lim Ching Siong that  Singapore's

independence is genuine and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



that  they must accept the situation and channel  and

redirect their struggle within an independent nation.

Another  split  is among the front-line  expendables,

that  is,  the present Barisan Sosialis leadership - third-class  heroes  they are  -  that  Singapore's

independence is phoney, and for that matter they must

boycott  Parliament sittings and even elections.  But

some  Members  of the Barisan Sosialis  may  be  more

practical,  for  even at this moment  when  they  are

boycotting Parliament, the usual allowance will still

go  to  them and they will accept them with open  and

willing hands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, they are now caught in a dilemma, as was the

case with the M.C.P. in the year 1957, whether or not

to  acknowledge  the  Pan-Malayan Independence,  with

Singapore's  independence - and  the  Right-wing  also

found  themselves in difficulties, some  of  them  in

respect of their livelihood. For example - I  would

ask  your  guidance, Mr Speaker, if I am allowed  to

refer  to a former Chief Minister of this House  -  a

former Chief Minister from 1955 to 1959 who said that

he  was  the only saviour for the people of Singapore

and that Singapore was his only country. So many good

words had been uttered, so many good things had  been

said,  but  two or three days after independence,  he

found  himself forsaking the people of Singapore  and

willingly   accepting  the  citizenship  of   another

country.  Does  it  mean that  within  two  days,  he

suddenly  lost his love for the people of  Singapore,

after  so many good things had been said? He  is  now

enjoying a good position as a High Commissioner for a

foreign  country. Sir, "loyalty" is a  very  abstract

term. As I have said, to the Communists, to the

Right-wing  and to us, it might mean different things,  but

definitely it does not mean that if one's  rice  bowl

were  to  be  broken  tomorrow  or  next  week,   lie

therefore would forsake his citizenship and  loyalty,

would  assume  citizenship of  another  country,  and

would pledge his allegiance to another country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours is an open society. We prefer and we believe

in  open  argument, a frank expression of  ideas  and

opinions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This House itself is a public forum for the elected

representatives of the people to come and  voice  the

grievances of the people they represent. In  the  ten

years from 1955 to 1965 - and from 1959, the first time

the P.A.P. came to power up to the present time -  we

have  fought  the  colonialists, the Communists,  the

Right-wing  opportunists, the  communalists  and  the

feudalists and even a combination of some of them, as

we  have  seen in the Hong Lim by-election. Sir,  the

Hong Lim by-election could have probably changed  the

entire course of history of Singapore. Had the P.A.P.

lost the Hong Lim by-election, then I would say, as I

have  said  earlier,  that  it  might  have  led   to

repressive  measures, and therefore the existence  of

this  House  would no longer be regarded  as  useful.

However,  each phase and each struggle  gave  us  new

strength,  dedication and renewed conviction  in  our

beliefs,  and  I do not believe that  any  amount  of

suppression, threats, such as one voice, one race and

one   religion,  meaningless  demonstrations  by  the

Barisan  Sosialis and bomb explosions  or  even  race

riots - we experienced two race riots in 1964 -  can

deter us from our set course to nationhood. We do not

submit to any intimidation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with independence, we are now faced with a

heavier  burden, but we can bear it. In three  years'

time, Singapore will prosper. In the short period  of

three to five years, we will set the right foundation

for  our new nation. We do not ask for anything  more

than  the  right of our people to determine  our  own

destiny  and to live our own way of life,  unmolested

and  unhindered  by anybody in this  region.  We  are

small in every respect, in terms of population, area,

natural resources and, therefore, we have no capacity

to  attack others, and it is not our intention to  do

so,  but we must have the capacity to prevent  others

from  attacking us. On the other hand, we cannot bear

the  tremendous expense of raising and maintaining  a

full-scale army and, therefore, we have the  idea  of

building  up a big people's force, a volunteer  army.

As  the  Prime Minister has said, the world does  not

owe us a living, and we also do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



owe  the  world a living. We want to be friends  with

all.  The  friends  of another  country  may  be  our

friends too, but the enemy of another country may not

necessarily  be regarded as our enemy. To  those  who

have  a  special and vested interest in the political

stability of this region, I say that they really have

something to ponder on. But it would be naive for  us

to  believe  that we can survive on our  own  without

subjecting ourselves to the influence and development

of neighbouring countries, it is in our interest that

we  wish to see Malaysia succeed and prosper, because

we believe that if a volcano erupts 250 miles away in

Kuala  Lumpur, the lava will come down to  Singapore,

but  that  does  not mean that we will  beg  for  our

survival on bended knees. And to those who think they

can  sink us by hostile acts, we say, "Think  again,"

because  Singapore will not be the only one to  sink.

In  this  sinking  ship, you carry along  the  entire

feudal  system,  the  entire old  social  order.  But

whatever happens, Singapore is bound to be a catalyst

that  will  start  a chain reaction  throughout  this

region,  whether for prosperity or for chaos.  If  we

succeed, so will this region. If we fail, then I  say

that  those who have special interests in this region

will   have   to  sit  down  and  recalculate   their

obligations in this area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our foreign policy, we have adopted a non-aligned stand and I am given to understand that there

is  a  motion in the House in the name of  a  Barisan

Sosialis Member to urge the Government to be friendly

with  Afro-Asian  countries. Sir,  we  are  not  only

friendly  with  Afro-Asian  countries,  but  we   are

accepted  as  a  member of the Afro-Asian  camp.  Our

Goodwill Mission first to the United Nations and then

to  the Afro-Asian and Eastern European countries  is

sufficient  proof  to the Barisan Sosialis  that  the

independence   of   Singapore   is   not   a   phoney

independence  and a neo-colonialist  and  imperialist

plot.  Even Russia, who, according to some pro-Peking

elements  in  the Barisan Sosialis, are  revisionists

but by no means neo-colonialists, accepted Singapore.

What else do they want?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with growing recognition from countries in the

world, our international position is strengthened and

consolidated.  While we find more  and  more  friends

coming to our aid, we still find opposition among the

Barisan  who  say  that Singapore's  independence  is

phoney and a neo-colonialist plot. But we have passed

through difficult periods since independence. On  9th

August  there  were  some high hopes  in  the  former

Malaysian  Government  - before  9th  August  were

still  a  member State - the then Federal leadership,

and even the Barisan Sosialis had hopes that we would

he  caught in a difficult position to explain to  the

world the existence and the necessity for the foreign

bases   in   Singapore.  However,   that   hope   and

expectation  did not turn out to he in their  favour,

because  not  only the Afro-Asian countries  accepted

the existence, and the necessity of the existence, of

the   foreign  bases  in  Singapore  to  protect  our

national  integrity, but they have also gone  a  step

further to justify the necessity of these bases. Even

Zambia,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.  When  Zambia  ran  into

difficulties   with   the   neighbouring    Rhodesian

Government,  the Zambian Government openly  requested

troops  he  sent, not to protect them but  to  attack

Rhodesia. But the British bases in Singapore are  not

meant to attack anybody. As I have said, they have no

capacity  to  attack anybody. They exist here  solely

for   the   purpose  of  defending  the   territorial

integrity of Singapore. But I agree we cannot  depend

forever  on  others  to defend  us.  If  the  Barisan

Sosialis  feel that the British bases should  go,  we

say yes. But not now. In the long run, yes. We cannot

depend  on  others  forever. If  they  can  give  the

Government a scheme or a plan to settle or  to  solve

the   consequential  situation  arising  Out  of  the

withdrawal of the British bases, then we say  we  are

prepared   to  consider  it.  Think  of  it.   40,000

employees,  and if each one has a family of  five  to

feed,  that means 200,000 mouths to feed.  This  will

also  affect  taxi  drivers,  provision  shop-owners,

domestic  servants under the employ of  British  army

personnel,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



and  a  whole host of other  incidental  and

related trades. If the Barisan Sosialis can give us a

solid   plan  which  can  cope  with  this  kind   of

situation, where we have 200,000 hungry stomachs  and

hungry  mouths to feed, then we say we will  consider

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whatever our shortcomings, whatever our

difficulties  in  the years ahead, we  are  confident

that  in  ten years we will build up a new generation

of  people under a multi-racial, multi-religious, and

multi-cultural  setup. But there is one  fear - not  a

conscious fear though - whether or not our success

in  ten  years will be regarded as a threat  or  even

subversive   to  the  leadership  of  a  neighbouring

country.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Did the Member say "country" or

"countries"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Country. These are not

exaggerated or empty assumptions. As I said  earlier,

the  success of one country is hound to cast  shadows

on  the  success or failure of another  country,  let

alone when these countries are so nearby to us. In  a

short  time to come, our industrialisation  programme

will  succeed,  and we must succeed. To  the  Barisan

Sosialis Members, the Jurong industrial complex is  a

sham;  it  is  designed  only  to  build  up  a   few

capitalists.  But can they say that  these  factories

and  the employment opportunities for 9,000 to 14,000

people  will  he  there had we  not  embarked  on  an

industrialisation programme? They are not  there  for

nothing.  They are there as a result of the  efforts,

the determination and the dynamism of the Government.

In the next two or three years, the Member for Jurong

-  he  is not here today - will find that he will have

to face a very much different electorate from the one

lie faced in 1963. Housing and social development, as

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara has said in his Address,

will  proceed at an even faster pace. We have no fear

of the days ahead. We have calculated, considered and

set  our course. We know where we are travelling. We,

of  course, cannot re-write the history of Singapore.

For example,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



we  cannot  pretend that we were never under  British

rule;  that  we were never under Japanese occupation;

that we were never a part of Malaysia. We cannot

re-shape  history. But what is to come we can shape  and

influence.  In  the  short  years  to  come,  we  are

confident we can build up a generation and a  society

that  can  serve as an example to this  part  of  the

world.  In  ten years of the P.A.P., names have  been

called of the P.A.P. - chauvinist, Fascist. But none,

not  even the Opposition, the Barisan Sosialis or the

Right-wing,  could  accuse us of corruption.  And  we

sincerely believe and we are convinced that  with  an

honest and incorruptible administration and with  the

dynamism  of  the leadership, we can  bring  about  a

better  distribution of the country's wealth  to  the

people. We assure them, everyone of them will have  a

fair  share,  not  the way the Barisan  Sosialis  may

think - that "from each according to his own ability,

and  to  each  according to  his  need."  We  say  to

everyone a fair share. Perhaps even now some  Members

of  the Barisan Sosialis will disapprove of armed and

violent  revolution for the simple reason  that  they

may  have now more things to protect and to treasure.

Some  things  are  dear to them  that  they  have  to

protect  rather than to destroy. We call upon Members

of   the  Barisan  Sosialis  to  reconsider,  to

re-orientate their thinking and adapt themselves to  the

new  situation, and not to go along with  meaningless

demonstrations,   empty  slogans   that   Singapore's

independence  is  phoney and a neo-colonialist  plot,

but  put themselves together and perhaps in that  way

their survival could be prolonged, but not for long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with this note I would like to

associate  myself  with  the  motion  by  the   Prime

Minister,  to express the House's sincere thanks  for

His  Excellency's Speech made at the opening of  this

Session.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish

to  associate  myself  with  the  Prime  Minister  in

thanking His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



Negara for his Speech to this House last week when he

graciously  declared  this  first  Parliament   open.

Before  I  proceed to the debate proper,  permit  me,

Sir,  to make an observation on the total absence  of

the  Hon.  Members  of  the Opposition.  The  Barisan

Sosialis have pointed out in their Party organ and in

their local newspapers the reasons for their Members'

absence  and  their  boycott of  this  Session.  This

performance on their part can be construed as an  act

of   irresponsibility   to  the   constituents   they

represent. The Members elected to this House  are  to

be  the  voice  of  the people  and  to  serve  their

constituents well. Time and again, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

the Barisan Members have stressed and maintained that

they  represent  the people. Curiously  enough,  they

choose to absent themselves from attending this first

Session  of our Parliament, I really feel  sorry  for

the people who elected them, for they are now without

their  representatives to voice  their  opinions  for

them  in  this  House. Instead of bringing  up  their

arguments in Parliament and facing up to the  replies

of  Government  Back-benchers, the  Barisan  Sosialis

choose  to  use the people as the vanguard for  their

opinions.  Truth  is  what we cherish  and  truth  is

painful  to  the Barisan Sosialis. But, nevertheless,

we on the Government Benches will continue to deliver

our replies in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the Barisan Sosialis'

allegation  that  Singapore's  independence   is   an

imperialist colonialist plot and, therefore,  phoney,

let  me  say this. This allegation denotes  stupidity

oil  their  part.  For  consequent  upon  Singapore's

declaration of independence, a delegation led by  the

Deputy  Prime Minister went to the United Nations  to

seek  Singapore's admission into the world body.  And

Singapore  was  admitted  into  the  United   Nations

without   dissent,   not  even  an   abstention   nor

opposition  to  admission was encountered.  Some  116

members voted for our admission. Why is this  so?  If

the  independence of Singapore had been phoney,  then

Singapore would have been rejected on application.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when our Goodwill Mission went to

the  Afro-Asian  countries and some Eastern  European

countries   to  explain  to  them  the  circumstances

leading  to  Singapore's eviction from Malaysia,  the

Mission  found  sympathy  and understanding  wherever

they   went,  and  the  Mission  returned  home  with

success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another allegation which the Barisan Sosialis made

is  that  because of the presence of both the British

military  bases  and  some Malaysian  Army  units  in

Singapore  after  the declaration of independence  of

Singapore,  this  independence  is  phoney.  To  this

allegation it has been explicitly explained not  only

to  the  world,  but in particular to the  Afro-Asian

world,  that  the  presence of the British  bases  is

necessary for defending our territorial integrity and

national sovereignty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to quote from

today's Straits Times, 15th December, back page:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Bases: You are quite right, says Zambia



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zambia's Minister for the Western Provinces, Mr A.

B. Mutemba, said today that Singapore was "absolutely

justified" in retaining the British bases because  it

was not strong enough to defend itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added that if there were no British bases the

security  of not only Singapore but also neighbouring

countries like Malaysia, would he threatened.'



<br><br>Moreover,  talks  will he held soon with  the  United

Kingdom Government to sign a bilateral defence treaty

in which Britain would be responsible for the defence

of  the territorial integrity and sovereignty of this

island  State, and that the bases would not  he  used

for aggressive purposes, it is also a well-known tact

that  military bases for defence purposes are  highly

expensive to set up and, therefore, cannot  be  built

in one day, just as Rome was not built in a day. What

happens  if  we  ask the British to  dismantle  their

bases  when  we  are not yet formidably  equipped  to

defend ourselves? We will then fall easy prey to  our

hungry  hitter neighbours. This is what  the  Barisan

Sosialis  would  like us to be - to  be  colonialised

again. Never, I say never, will this happen so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



long as this Party is in power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the bases here employ some 40,000 workers

who, on an average, have each to maintain a family of

five. And as what the Parliamentary Secretary to  the

Minister  for Culture and Social Affairs has  pointed

out  just now, the bases have directly been a  source

of  livelihood  to some 200,000 of our population  of

1.9 million. A helpless situation is what the Barisan

Sosialis would like to see happen, so that in a

non-stable  society  where hunger exists  and  where  the

people   are  demoralised  and  angry  with  a   weak

government, they could capitalise and seize power  in

consequence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government

instituted a campaign to recruit volunteers  for  our

Territorial Army for local defence. Again the Barisan

Sosialis  came  out in open condemnation  of  such  a

campaign  and tried vigorously to get the people  not

to  join.  Posters and handbills were  plastered  all

over the place calling on the people not to join  the

Territorial Army. These posters and handbills claimed

that  the people of Singapore would not like to fight

their  own people and that they wished to eat  bread.

Did they succeed? Far from it. They failed miserably,

for   the   response  to  our  country's   call   was

overwhelming.  And I am quite positive  that  by  the

middle  of  next year our first batch of  Territorial

Army volunteers would have been adequately trained to

assist  in the local defence of our country.  Let  me

make  this point clear to the Barisan Sosialis.  They

need  not  fear,  because  the  Territorial  Army  is

intended to safeguard our national integrity.  But  I

say  this:  to  those  who  resort  to  violence  and

unconstitutional  methods,  thereby  threatening  the

security of our country, then we will not hesitate to

deal with them firmly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to dwell a little on

our  foreign policy. First, I would like to draw  the

attention of this House to the noteworthy success  of

the  Goodwill  Mission headed  by  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  to the Afro-Asian and some Eastern European

countries. The Mission took pains to explain to these

countries not only our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



problems  regarding the presence of foreign  military

bases  in Singapore but also our non-aligned  policy,

and  to win and to establish friendly ties with them.

We  are  non-aligned in any of the world  power  bloc

conflicts,  be it Western or Eastern. We wish  to  be

friends with whoever wishes to be friends with us, so

long as our domestic affairs are not interfered with.

As His Excellency has said in his gracious Address - here, I quote [Hansard, 8th December, 1965, col. 11]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Our security depends upon having the minimum

number of unfriendly countries and the maximum number

of friendly ones.'



<br><br>So  this non-aligned policy is very necessary for our

survival. Here again, Mr Speaker, Sir, may  I  quote

from  today's Straits Times on Zambia's attitude,  or

Zambia's support to such a policy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Zambia's Minister for the Western Provinces, Mr

A. B. Mutemba, ... described Singapore's foreign policy

as "practical and far-sighted."'



<br><br>He went on:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"As a young nation you could not have done

better."'



<br><br>In being friendly, we are not to be construed as meek

and weak and that the internal affairs of our country

can  be  tampered with. Non-interference in  internal

affairs should be the basis and prerequisite  to  the

establishment  of friendliness. With  this  clear-cut

policy,  we  will  maintain  our  survival  in   this

turbulent part of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some countries which have bilateral

defence treaties and which are non-aligned, and  they

have   not  been  branded  as  neo-colonialists, in

pursuing  a  non-aligned attitude we are prepared  to

accept economic, technical, military, and foreign aid

without  prejudice. You see, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  our

Government  can  only carry out policies  after  much

meticulous  deliberation  and  planning,  unlike  the

Barisan Sosialis who act on impulses. I would like to

pose this question to the Barisan Sosialis since they

have  been  shouting slogans of phoney  independence,

neo-colonialist  and imperialist plot.  What  happens

when Peking or Djakarta decides to recognise us? What

have the Barisan Sosialis got to say on this matter?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point, Mr Speaker, Sir, is about the

education system of our country. It is heartening  to

note  that  as from next year the study of  a  second

language,  beginning  with  Secondary  1,   will   be

compulsory  in  all secondary schools and  that  this

second  language will be additional to the medium  of

instruction. This is a big step forward  towards  the

building   of  a  multi-linguistic  and  multi-racial

society  in  which young students in our multi-racial

society  will  not only be able to converse  in  more

than  one  language but also write in and  understand

more  than  one language, and who will be geared  for

their future role as the leaders of tomorrow when the

responsibility of government falls squarely on  their

shoulders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, I notice, an emphasis on scientific,

vocational and technical education to meet the  needs

of  industrialisation. I think our  education  system

needs   a   careful  reappraisal   because   of   the

circumstances,  We  are developing  a  generation  of

certificate-conscious  and  utility-conscious  people

and  there is apparently little or no attention  paid

to  developing  the innate talents of  the  children,

culturally  or otherwise. Because the young  students

have so many subjects in their school curriculum  and

with  these  topics upper-most in their  minds,  they

have  practically little or no time at all to develop

their  cultural  talents,  May  I  propose  that  the

Ministry    of   Education   see   to   the    proper

channelisation  of  time  and  effort   towards   the

teaching  of the appreciation of art, music, culture,

and  the  fine  arts in the school curriculum  which,

after  all,  is  part  of the  development  of  human

personality. Although technicians and skilled workers

are  required in the industrialisation of our country

as  industry  develops, a non-Communist,  democratic,

socialist government should also see to it  that  the

citizens  also  know  how  to  enjoy  their   leisure

profitably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although Singapore is now out of

the Federation of Malaysia, I still maintain that the

people  of  both territories are still one  and  that

nothing can prevent the people from thinking  as  one

people - the people of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



both  Malaysia and Singapore. For more than 140 years

both  territories  were ruled by  the  same  colonial

masters,   shared  the  same  masters,  and   jointly

struggled for independence so as to he free from  the

shackles of colonialism. This was achieved, hut  both

were to be separated after barely two years. Both are

aware  that whatever happens in one territory,  there

will  he repercussions in the other. Both are

inter-dependent of each other on a long-term basis in order

to  survive,  for the simple reason that  the  people

share a common destiny. This artificial separation by

a  legal  stroke is not going to make the people  who

was  one, into two separate peoples. I sincerely hope

that   sometime  in  the  not  too  distant   future,

Singapore and Malaysia will be hack in one  fold  and

become one people in which a Malaysian Malaysia  will

emerge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Speaker, Sir, another point I wish to

bring   out   is  about  the  White  Paper   on   the

Government's  family planning policy. It  is  out  of

personal and religious convictions that I would  like

to deal with this. Furthermore, I feel certain that I

am  speaking  for  quite  a large  proportion  of  my

constituents who share my views on this matter.  Now,

all of us realise that irresponsible parenthood is  a

bad thing, both for the individuals concerned and for

the  State.  I  would  he very happy,  therefore,  to

support  the Government in a campaign to educate  the

people   towards  a  more  responsible  attitude   to

parenthood. But after reading this White Paper, I get

the  impression that the Government is  proposing  an

over-simplified  solution to  a  very  complex  human

problem.  There are some assumptions in this document

that  I  would  question. For  instance,  that  small

families  are  happier than large ones.  Many  of  us

here,  I  am  sure, have been happily brought  up  in

families, not of two or three children but of five or

more.  We  have  seen  the good results  of  such  an

upbringing  where children are taught discipline  and

tolerance, self-sacrifice and a willingness to  help,

in short, those virtues most needed in society today.

We  are  always  hearing about  the  unusually  large

families of 14 or 16



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



children living in miserable conditions. Let  us  not

forget  the many moderately large healthy  and  happy

families  who are living in modest comfort. My  point

is  that  it is one thing to provide advice and  help

for  those  who  wish to space their children  or  to

limit the size of their families. It is another thing

altogether  to  start a campaign aimed at  persuading

people to have small families whether they like it or

not.  The  White  Paper  constantly  says  that   its

intention is to increase the happiness of families in

Singapore. But I disagree with the view that families

of two or three children are necessarily happier than

larger families.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the White Paper states that it is the

Government's  intention to advise the  woman  at  her

request  of  the  best  available  method  of  family

planning. I have nothing against this, hut I seek the

assurance of the Minister for Health that no pressure

would  he  put on anybody to volunteer for artificial

methods  of birth control. For instance,  to  tell  a

woman,  whose  family  due to financial  difficulties

have  to  accept public assistance, that  unless  she

consents  to  family planning, she may  not  get  any

assistance  at all, would, in my opinion, be  nothing

short of moral blackmail. This would be victimisation

of  the poor. What worries me is that I do not  think

the  White Paper makes it sufficiently clear that the

Government    recognises   the    fact    that    the

responsibility for deciding on the number of children

they  want  belongs to the parents alone.  The  State

exists  to  help families, not the other  way  round.

Therefore, instead of the slogan "Family Planning for

All",  I  would prefer to see the slogan "Responsible

Parenthood for All",



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the White Paper seems to

ignore  completely the fact that there  are  tens  of

thousands  in Singapore who do not consider  most  of

the  methods  mentioned  here as  morally  acceptable

forms of family planning. They consider that marriage

is  a  noble  and demanding vocation  and  that  true

happiness in marriage requires self-sacrifice,

self-control  and  cannot he achieved just  by  mechanical

control.  Everybody must be free to  follow  his  own

conscience in this matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



But  I seek an assurance from the Minister for Health

that  doctors  and nurses in Government Service  will

not  be required to act against their consciences  by

being  ordered  to  do  things  which  they  consider

morally wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret that I do not find in the White Paper any

mention of the dignity of marriage and parenthood and

of  the necessity for a careful all-round preparation

for  this  noble  vocation. In my opinion,  too  much

stress is put on material prosperity, as if it  alone

will  bring  happiness. There is  nothing  about  the

importance of educating our people to become  morally

mature responsible citizens. All the emphasis  is  on

material happiness and mechanical control, and what I

fear  is that in lowering our population rate by  the

sort  of  campaign envisaged here, we  are  in  grave

danger  of  lowering  the whole  moral  tone  of  our

people.  We  are producing a generation of  soft  and

thoroughly selfish people, interested solely in their

own  comfort, lacking the vigour and generosity which

are  so  vital  to our nation today. If  this  should

happen, the cure, in my opinion, would be much  worse

than the disease.



<br><br>4.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj (Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department (Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed Al-Haj)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, permit me to support the Motion

moved by the Hon, the Prime Minister on the Speech by

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara to the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you will agree with me if I say

perhaps nobody, whether those inside this Chamber  or

those  outside  this Chamber, would be  surprised  on

hearing   the   formal  proclamation  of  Singapore's

independence  on the 9th of August.  However,  it  is

customary,  of course, that every marriage  sometimes

ends  up  in a divorce or breaks up, except that  the

reasons for the separation must be studied as a guide

for  our future generation, and we shall leave it  to

the  historians to find out and assess  in  the  hope

that it will be a guide for posterity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we know that Singapore with the

States  comprising Malaysia are one, not one in  name

but one from a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



historical  and  geographical  point  of  view.   The

separation of Singapore from Malaysia is a  very  sad

event  indeed. Singapore, with its strategic position

in  the  world,  is just a mere dot. Singapore  is  a

small island State and known as the smallest Republic

in  South-East Asia. As a result of the separation of

Singapore  from Malaysia, we have heard many  leaders

saying that separation of Singapore from Malaysia was

consented  to  by both parties. But, Mr  Speaker,  I

would   like  to  emphasise  in  this  Chamber   that

Singapore  was evicted from Malaysia.  If  a  husband

wishes  to  divorce his wife, he gives an  ultimatum,

"Out  you go" or "Stay in this house." If you stayed,

you  would  be faced with difficulties,  and  in  the

interest of the family or the children, you  must  go

out.  Therefore, there is no alternative for the wife

but  to leave the house at the behest of the husband.

That is the fate that has befallen Singapore. On  the

9th of August, I - and there were many others like me

in Singapore - was worried about the fate of this small

island  of ours. But after the storm has abated,  the

situation  is  clear, the spirit  of  the  people  of

Singapore,  their determination to live, to  survive,

is there. And we hope that Singapore will continue to

live  and survive on the same equal status with other

nations throughout the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go further, Mr Speaker, let me touch

briefly  on  the  question of the Opposition  Barisan

Members  who have boycotted not only the  debates  in

this   Chamber  but  also  boycotted  the  Ceremonial

Opening of the Assembly by His Excellency our Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara. This is an indication which  is  not

healthy  to  us,  because the  step  adopted  by  the

Opposition  in boycotting the Ceremonial  Opening  by

His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara as Head  of

State of this country, is an unhealthy indication, an

ill  omen, and a mark of disrespect for the  Head  of

State  and also for the Assembly. The boycott by  the

Barisan   Sosialis   and   their   unwillingness   to

participate  in  the open argument  -  they  are  not

prepared  to come face to face with the Government

means  that  they have betrayed the trust  placed  in

them by their constituents that they can voice



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



their   grievances  in  this  Chamber  so  that   the

Government   may   take   remedial   measures   where

necessary. Their avoidance of open argument is deeply

deplored by the people of Singapore who wish  to  see

Singapore  prosper as a democratic society.  What  is

the  meaning  if  this Chamber  is  empty?  Are  they

against  a democratic society? Are they to depend  on

news  items  from  the newspapers? If  they  consider

newspapers are more important than this Chamber, then

we  can  go back to the people and let the people  be

the  judges, and let them decide whether they want  a

democratic State or otherwise. This boycott is not  a

boycott of the Government alone but a boycott of  the

wishes   of   the  people  who  desire  parliamentary

democracy in Singapore. And this, Mr Speaker,  shows

that  there  are  indications of a  break-up  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis, because if they attend the debate,

they cannot see eye to eye with each other on certain

matters,  as  it has been reported in the  newspapers

that  there  are frictions in the Party  between  the

Right-wing and the Left-wing. An allegation that this

Assembly  serves no useful purpose, unlike  the  City

Council,  was voiced by the ex-Member for  Hong  Lim,

Mr  Ong  Eng  Guan, who resigned his  seat  in  this

Chamber, thereby creating a by-election which he  did

not contest. I think this was more honourable. If the

Barisan Sosialis maintain that this Assembly is of no

use,  how  is it that they contested the by-election?

But unfortunately for them, they were defeated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now they further allege that Singapore's

independence   is  phoney.  Mr  Speaker,   Sir,   if

Singapore's independence is phoney, how do we explain

the  Barisan Sosialis' attitude to all the  countries

in  this world who have extended their recognition of

Singapore's  independence? Do they think  that  those

countries which have recognised our independence  are

phoney     "independent"    countries?     Therefore,

indirectly,  they are alleging that  these  countries

are  phoney independent countries; they are therefore

denigrating these independent countries. This word



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



"phoney" has been on the lips of the Opposition  ever

since  the  formation  of Malaysia  was  mooted.  The

Barisan Sosialis have had occasion to allege that the

merger  between  Singapore  and  the  Federation  was

phoney.  This  term "phoney" is used  freely  by  the

Opposition  Members. The Barisan Sosialis sent  three

representatives  to sit in the Malaysian  Parliament.

If  it  was a phoney merger, why did they not boycott

the   Malaysian  Parliament  by  not  sending   their

representatives   there?   But   they   sent    three

representatives  to sit in the Malaysian  Parliament,

so  that they could each receive an allowance of $750

per  month,  free train tickets and other  amenities.

And  now again they say that Singapore's independence

is  phoney.  They  receive their allowance  but  they

absent themselves from this Assembly! On our side, we

receive our allowance and we attend meetings. On  the

other side, they too receive their allowance but they

absent  themselves. So, Mr Speaker,  Sir,  there  is

nothing that is not phoney. Everything that we do  is

wrong. There is a Malay song entitled, "Anything that

we  do is wrong." But the only thing that is right is

if  Singapore became a colony of a foreign country to

which the Barisan Sosialis owe their allegiance. Such

an  action  would  then he right in  their  eyes - the

surrender of our sovereignty to a foreign country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now we must be far-sighted and

look  into  the  future.  The  future  of  our  State

depends,  firstly, on the various  people  living  in

harmony,  secondly,  on  political  stability   which

ensures  industrialisation  and,  thirdly,   on   the

people's   determination  to  progress.   These   are

important  points  we  are faced  with  so  that  our

country may prosper in future. Singapore, a sovereign

and  independent  State which will be  known  as  the

Republic of Singapore is the smallest State in

South-East  Asia. It is only a tiny dot in the eyes of  the

world.  It  will be a beautiful garden in which  many

kinds  of flowers and trees will be planted. We  must

therefore  look after the trees to prevent them  from

being  destroyed by pests. We should not forget  that

there are disruptive elements who will go all out  in

future to wreck our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



harmony,  as  stated in the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

Speech:  firstly,  the  communalistic  elements,  and

secondly,  the  Communists.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the

headquarters of narrow Malay communalism  is  not  in

Singapore   but  outside  Singapore.  This   communal

feeling was fanned at the time when Singapore  was  a

member  State  in Malaysia. If you, Mr Speaker,  are

following the speeches and articles appearing in  the

Malay  language  newspapers daily,  there  is  not  a

single  day  in  which  there  are  no  speeches  and

articles by leaders outside Singapore which  whip  up

communal feelings in order to disrupt the harmony not

only  of the people of Singapore but of the whole  of

Malaysia. We are very concerned with this group which

has  its headquarters outside Singapore. On the  very

day  that  Singapore was separated from  Malaysia,  a

leader  from  the  Federation came  here  to  give  a

guarantee  to  the Malays in Singapore that  although

Singapore had been evicted from Malaysia, their  fate

and  destiny would be looked after, and that if  they

could   not  bear  the  hardships  under  the  P.A.P.

Government,  they would be received  with  open  arms

across  the Causeway into Johore. This was the  tenor

of  the  speech  made by a Malay leader  designed  to

appeal  to  Malay organisations so that  the  250,000

Malays in Singapore will go across the Causeway  into

Johore  and Singapore will appear as a Chinese  State

on  the surface. Is it his intention to create  chaos

in  this  country? I am a Malay, and I  say  that  we

Malays  have  never  migrated. I  consider  that  the

spirit of migration is a cowardly spirit. The various

races  must  live in peace and understanding.  In  my

opinion,  those  people  who  exhort  the  Malays  to

migrate are cowards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr Speaker permits me, may I relate what

happened  in the Malaysian Parliament as a result  of

the   guarantee  that  the  people  from  across  the

Causeway would be prepared to welcome the Malays from

Singapore? This concerns the movements of  people  to

and  from Singapore. In the Berita Harian of the 18th

November, there was a news item- "800 Malays will  go

to  Johore in 1965." A small headline only.  But  the

Utusan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



Melayu,  on the other hand, carried a bold  headline.

"800  to quit Singapore." Mr Speaker, this piece  of

news  item is very sensational. On the same day, 18th

November,  1965, in the Utusan Melayu,  the  contents

read  as  follows: "Kuala Lumpur, 17th November.  800

families  of  Singapore  citizens  have  applied  for

permission  to  live in Johore, in  response  to  the

exhortation  by the Prime Minister of Malaysia  after

Singapore   became  separated  from  Malaysia."   "In

response  to  the  call  of  the  Prime  Minister  of

Malaysia."  And  according to this news,  the  Johore

Government  has offered flats. The report  says  that

they  rejected  the offer because they realised  that

the  rentals  of  flats in Singapore  are  very  much

cheaper than those in Johore. They are fully aware of

that.  Cost of construction of flats is much  cheaper

in  Singapore than in Johore. But, Mr Speaker,  what

is the motive of these 800 people who will migrate to

Johore  Bahru? Are they people who work in Singapore?

Why  did  they  select Johore of all  places?  It  is

because  Johore  Bahru is separated  only  by

three-quarters of a mile from Singapore. They can  live  in

Johore  and yet work in Singapore, because there  are

no  employment opportunities for them in  Malaya.  So

the  intention is to collect revenue in Singapore and

live in Johore. But why not go to Pahang? Pahang is a

much bigger State; or for that matter in Kelantan  or

Trengganu?  It  is  because of the proximity  of  the

place.  Most of these 800 people were born in  Malaya

and  they work in Singapore as Customs officials  and

so on. Yet, it says in the newspapers that the Johore

Government  cannot  entertain applications  for  land

from  Johore citizens. Is this not a dirty  political

tactic towards the Singapore Government? Is this  not

a  dirty  tactic to divide the people of  Singapore?

800  out of 250,000 people means that the Malays  are

being   oppressed  in  Singapore?  I  say  that   the

Government  of  Singapore is giving  more  privileged

treatment  to  the  Malays  in  Singapore  than   the

Malaysian  Government  is giving  to  the  Malays  in

Malaya. These are indications that ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member has up till now been

in  order, but I am afraid he is in danger of getting

out  of  order.  If he is criticising  the  Malaysian

Government with regard to Malaysians, then he is  out

of order.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed Al-Haj -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed Al-Haj</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Nevertheless,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  headquarters

which  fanned  this  communal sentiment  is  situated

outside  Singapore,  as I have explained  and  proved

just  now.  In Singapore there exist groups  who  are

agitating the Malays to move out to Malaya. There are

such elements, yes. When they do migrate they hope to

move  to Johore in a procession. I would like to  see

whether  these  leaders  who have  called  for  their

migration will be among them. They are urging  others

to  go.  But they stay put in Singapore because  they

know they can enjoy the comfort and luxury here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Mr Speaker, the other elements who try to

hoodwink  the people, the communalistic elements  who

use  language  as an issue in order  to  disrupt  our

unity, do not come from the Malays only but also from

non-Malays. Malay, Chinese, Tamil and English are now

the  four  official languages in this  country,  with

Malay  as  the  common language. Malay has  now  been

accepted  as  the national language.  This  has  come

about  because  of the foresight of  people  who  are

aware  of this problem. Hence, we can create a  happy

and prosperous society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I think I need not elaborate on the

achievements  which we have made in Singapore.  These

are  well  known. On housing, for instance, every  45

minutes one unit of flat is being built. But  what  I

would like to say on housing is the problem which the

Housing  and Development Board is facing.  When  they

embark  upon  a  project they  face  the  problem  of

acquiring sites, especially when the sites are  being

occupied   by   squatters.  This  is   our   problem.

Obscurantist forces are exploiting this situation. If

the  sites  acquired belong to the Malays, they  will

spread   wild  propaganda  that  the  Government   is

evicting and suppressing the Malays.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



This  is the propaganda used by Malay extremists.  If

the  squatters affected are Chinese, then the Barisan

Sosialis will exploit the situation. They will  shout

at  the  top of their voice and accuse the Government

of wanting to evict the squatters. There are elements

in Singapore who are out to disrupt our unity. We pay

compensation and provide alternative accommodation to

these  squatters in such a way that they are prepared

to accept the Government's scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the problem also arises when there are

people who do not wish to see progress. They consider

flats  as pigeon-holes. They say Malays cannot  adapt

themselves  to  live  in flats.  Mr  Speaker,  I  am

astounded  at  this.  Pigeon-holes  have   now   been

converted into a haven which everyone is rushing for!

Previously they have charged that these fiats are fit

only  as  pigeon-holes. But they themselves  are  now

occupying and living in these flats. Why do I mention

this,  Mr  Speaker? We are prepared  to  accept  any

criticism or condemnation. When the Government wanted

to  sell flats to the Malays, these elements agitated

them  not  to  buy  them. But when  they  became  the

intermediaries,  they purchased the  flats  from  the

Government  and in turn sold them to the Malays.  The

middleman  gets the credit! I appeal  to  the  people

concerned to he prepared to give and take. This is  a

time  when  the  Government is  faced  with  squatter

problems, resettlement and so on. I appeal to them to

co-operate  with the Government and come  forward  to

accept Government's scheme to build flats. Then there

is  some  meaning  to it. But if  in  the  course  of

building the flats, they buy the flats and sell them,

then they become like brokers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the Speech of his Excellency the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara.  I  am  impressed  when  he

touches  upon the proposed setting up of a Commission

to  guarantee  the  rights of every individual.  This

Commission  will  hear the views of  the  minorities,

from  the  racial,  linguistic and religious  angles.

Their  opinions will be carefully considered by  this

Commission.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, when I returned from New Zealand I

read all the back issues of the newspapers. This will

be  ammunition to certain groups of people, for  they

can  charge  that the Government have  neglected  the

rights  of  the  minorities. In fact, immediately  on

separation,  the  Prime  Minister  himself   gave   a

guarantee  on  the position of the Malays  and  other

minority  groups  in  Singapore.  Therefore,  if   we

implement  this, it is not because it is forced  upon

us.  If  we  advance, it is not because we are  being

pushed by them from behind. We carry this out in full

consciousness, with a full sense of responsibility to

create a multi-racial and multi-religious society  in

our  independent State. To them, I say,  do  not  use

this  as  a  weapon  to create dissension  among  the

various  races  in our State. With a  full  sense  of

responsibility we must ponder over this for  our  own

safety and that of posterity, because our policy  now

is to survive. That is basic and fundamental. We want

to survive. And we will survive according to the real

philosophical means of survival. We cannot live  like

wild  boars.  We  cannot  depend  on  other  people's

bounty.  We cannot live like dogs or like cats  which

eat only the remnants. We want to live and survive as

an  independent  people, equal in status  with  other

independent peoples of the world. That is  our  basic

philosophy,  and we are determined to find  ways  and

means  to live and survive. For this, we are prepared

to  make  friends with anybody, provided it does  not

jeopardise our security. We are on the best of  terms

with the East European and African countries for  our

interest. Yes, we will make friends. We are not going

to  make friends with countries which are not sincere

in  wanting  to  make friends with  us.  We  must  be

careful when we shake hands with countries which  can

poison  us.  Mr Speaker, I would like  to  emphasise

that our desire is to make friends with all countries

and  to live in peace, but not at the expense of  our

birthright and our security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  expulsion of Singapore from Malaysia  four

months ago has brought us independence as a sovereign

State.  Although there was rejoicing  for  the  newly

acquired  freedom,  there was  also  uncertainty  and

anxiety  amongst many people in Singapore as to  what

their future would be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech which was delivered by the Yang

di-Pertuan   Negara  last  Wednesday in this First

Parliament  outlining the policy of  this  Government

was  most inspiring and most significant. The Address

was very brief, but it gave our people the confidence

and  hope  for  the  future as the  approach  to  our

problems    is   correct.   Faced   with   Indonesian

confrontation then and now, and an unfriendly Central

Government who simply wanted to suppress  us  in  all

forms and see us down, it is reassuring to note  that

the leaders of our people are resolute and determined

that  we  survive, that we succeed, and,  above  all,

refuse  to  be intimidated. I need not recall  events

which  led to our independence, but with independence

new problems have been brought about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to now we have been able to withstand Indonesian

confrontation.  We managed to isolate the  Communists

and  kept the Communalists down. We would be  foolish

to  assume  that  the Communists will  not  intensify

their activities to create chaos and to recover  lost

ground,  nor  can we overrule the fact that  communal

extremists   will  not  emerge  to  take   over   the

leadership of our immediate neighbouring country,  as

was  reported in the Straits Times of 14th  December,

1965   - the  Prime  Minister  of  our   immediate

neighbouring country



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



was  criticised for making a declaration to  consider

the call for the liberal use of other languages. When

such leaders do assume power, they are bound to cause

a  lot  of misery to the people, and whatever happens

in that country is hound to affect us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, when such hostile actions are

directed  against us, we must ensure that  they  will

not  succeed in a multi-racial, multi-lingual,

multi-religious society like ours, any other form of policy

pursued  to  establish a one race, one language,  and

one religion is hound to create chaos for its people.

With our independence, Mr Speaker, the prospects  of

our  succeeding  in  establishing a  tolerant

multi-racial society are much greater, and our results  and

successes  are  hound  to  have  an  impact  on   our

neighbours in contrast to what they are pursuing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in this First Session of Parliament, I

welcome the Prime Minister's call to the Backbenchers

to  perform the role of the Opposition as a result of

the decision of the Barisan Sosialis Members opposite

to boycott this Assembly. As elected Members, we have

an  obligation  to our electorate,  and  the  Barisan

Members, by staying away, have forfeited their  right

to  open  argument and open debate. What can  be  the

intentions of this boycott? Are they planning a  mass

by-election or will they resort to armed struggle?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to touch on certain subjects and policies of the Government. Housing has been a successful achievement of the P.A.P. Government in the first five years, according to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's Speech, we produced 51,000 units of low-cost housing. What was more important

was  the  scheme for home ownership for  the  people,

which has offered the public about 3,500 units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the second Five-Year housing programme; it is

stated  in  the Speech that the number of  units  for

sale to meet increasing demands will he decided upon.

Here  I  would like to urge the Minister for National

Development to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



consider  and encourage our people to own  their  own

homes,  if  it  is  within their means,  rather  than

renting them from the Housing Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One deterrent factor which prevents the people from

owning  their own homes is the cash deposit which,  I

believe, is about one-fifth of the total cost of  the

house.  A  good many people cannot afford  this  down

payment deposit, but if an arrangement can be  agreed

upon, I am sure the home ownership scheme wilI have a

great   response.  In  this  respect,  I   have   two

suggestions  to  offer to the Minister  for  National

Development. Will he consider amending legislation to

the  Central  Provident Fund  to  allow  people  with

adequate  contributions to use them as  security  for

the  down payment? The other alternative is  whether

he  will allow employers, as has been done in private

companies, to stand as sureties for the down payment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposal of the Government to

re-register the population by issuing them  with  new

identity  cards is welcome. There are in Singapore  a

great number of people who are born in Singapore with

birth certificates without their names on them.  This

problem  has caused a lot of hardship and uncertainty

to  many  Singapore  citizens who wonder  what  their

future  will be. I would ask the Minister for  Labour

to   consider   a  scheme  where  bona   fide   birth

certificate holders can have their new identity cards

registered as being Singapore citizens without having

to  go  through  the  arduous  process  of  obtaining

citizenship again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, on the establishment of missions

abroad,  I  would like to draw the attention  of  the

Minister  to the new issue of passports for Singapore

citizens   on   Singapore  becoming  an   independent

sovereign nation. We are at the present moment  still

using  pre-Malaysian passports, and visas  and  entry

permits  for permission to enter Singapore are  still

being   undertaken  abroad  either  by  the   British

Consulates or the Malaysian Embassies. I feel that to

prolong  this unnecessarily would have a  detrimental

effect  on our country. We would rather see  our  own

missions  abroad  and  our own  staff  handling  this

matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in the Speech of His Excellency

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The basic economic challenge is one of providing

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> I am drawing the attention of

the  Backbenchers on this side of the House  who  are

trade  union  leaders  and  active  leaders  in   the

N.T.U.C.  I  quote here again the same Hansard,  col.

13, third paragraph, on the same subject:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Our workers must understand that the creation of

industries  and  job opportunities will  in  a  large

measure depend upon their capacity for hard work  and

disciplined performance in factories,...';



<br><br>and I go on to the last paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This means that people with industrial capital,

managerial talent and the manufacturing know how must

be  assured of sane and stable labour conditions  and

trade   unions   do  not  indulge  in  obstructionist

policies  or stoppages of production for  reasons  of

political manoeuvre.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have quoted all these passages

in  support of Government's policy and I believe that

workers  must  sacrifice in order that other  workers

should  get  employment. It would be  reassuring  for

trade  union  members on this side of  the  House  to

support Government in that policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I wish to

associate  myself with the sentiments that have  been

expressed in thanking the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  for

delivering his policy speech.



<br><br>5.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, please allow me to express our felicitations

because in the policy speech delivered



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



by  the  Head of State, I can see that the Government

is  determined once again to implement its policy  of

equality on the matter of languages and, at the  same

time, making Malay the national language. This policy

is to the interest of our country. Not very long ago,

the  Government announced its policy of  raising  the

standard of the second language in all schools and to

train  teachers to teach the second language  in  all

the  schools. The expenditure on education has  shown

that  education plays a very important  role  in  our

Government policy. The people in Singapore are  fully

aware that our nation achieved independence only four

months   ago.  We  are  in  a  very  critical  stage.

Everything  must  be  started  afresh  and  our  task

forward  is full of difficulties. Apart from charting

a  course  for  prosperity, we  must  also  see  that

education is being promoted. In his speech, the  Yang

di-Pertuan Negara has outlined this policy,  but  the

anti-national elements have neglected  to  admit  all

the  achievements of the Government. They have  tried

every  means  to  make use of the language  issue  to

wreck the unity and solidarity of the people. Such an

act should be condemned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, education poses no problem in our

country.  All along, our Government has been pursuing

a  policy which treats the various streams of schools

equally.  Our  Government's policy on education  also

lays  stress  on technical and vocational  education.

All  this is reflected in the policy speech. From the

financial   figures,  we  can  also  see   that   the

Government has spent a lot of money on education.  It

has  not neglected its duty to nurture our youth.  It

is  prepared to shoulder more difficult burdens,  but

there are anti-national elements who try to make  use

of   the  culture  and  language  issues,  which  are

explosive  in  nature, in order to wreck  the  social

order and to undermine and topple the Government.  We

do not have to waste time by arguing with them but we

should expose their irresponsible acts and speeches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring to the incidents at the Nantah campus, we

can  see that anti-national elements have tried their

very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



best to seize any opportunity, without regard to  the

consequences,  to create chaos and  disorder  in  our

society by shouting slogans, "Anti this and that"  in

order  to create more unnecessary trouble and burdens

for  our  society.  What is more abominable  is  that

these  people are not facing reality. They are

anti-national.  Their political ideology has been  brought

into  the university campus to create trouble  there;

but  on  the other hand, they dare not explain  their

actions and the motives for their behaviour. For  the

past  few days, we have not been able to see  any  of

the  Opposition  Members  in  this  House.  They  are

ashamed of what they have done. That is why they dare

not  come here to attend the solemn sittings that are

held in this Parliament. If they are ashamed of their

acts,  it  is  some consolation for our nation.  They

have  neglected their responsibility.  Instead,  they

are  creating trouble outside the House, and they  do

not  recognise  that  Singapore  is  independent  and

sovereign. Are they really representing the interests

of  the  people or are they trying to  sell  out  the

interests of the people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must justify what I have asserted just now. Let

us  see  what  the Opposition Party has published  in

their  Party organ. These articles boil down to  this

point:  they are geared to create trouble. All  these

articles  are meant to distort facts. In the November 6th issue of Barisan - their Party organ - their

so-called  actions at the University, their  indulgences

in  all  sorts  of  irresponsible acts  such  as  the

burning  of  furniture  and  wrecking  of  university

equipment are mentioned. All these actions  on  their

part  are  meant to lead our young people on  to  the

path  of  destruction. I must stress that  while  the

nation  is  trying  to educate our  young  people  to

produce   more  talented  and  skilled  people,   the

Opposition are not only unable to help the Government

in  this respect but they also go out of their way to

spread  all  sorts of groundless rumours,  using  all

sorts  of  means to mislead those guileless  students

into  a  dead alley. This is very wrong of  them.  In

fact, the incidents in Nantah were only engineered by

a few



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



cliques  of  misguided youths, but they have  allowed

the  students  to  waste their  time  in  meaningless

activities. Apart from this, the students  have  also

wasted their parents' money and effort, and have  let

down  the general public. These young people in their

speeches  talk  about  their  being  highly  educated

people,  that  they are for Chinese  education,  that

they  are  preserving Chinese culture and  protecting

Nantah; but if they really understand what they  have

been  doing  at  Nantah,  I believe  these  so-called

highly educated people, this so-called group for  the

preservation  of Chinese culture and education  would

not  be willing to wreck their own future. They would

realise  that they are being misguided by  the

anti-national  elements among whom are some who have  been

intimidated or misguided. However, the folly of these

young  people  has been encouraged by the  Opposition

Party  from  the  beginning of  all  this  series  of

incidents. The Member for Jurong, who can usually  be

seen  at the university campus or in one of the attap

houses  near the university, and who carries out  all

sorts of activities to preserve the so-called Chinese

culture,  is regrettably absent in this House  today,

and is therefore not able to answer my criticisms. Is

he  encouraging  the  young people  to  embark  on  a

suicidal path?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, nobody will say that the Wang

Gung-Wu Report has anything wrong in it. Some of  the

students  have regarded the Report as an  indictment.

University  staff also admit that  the  Report  is  a

praiseworthy  one.  The  anti-national  elements  are

making  use of this Report to justify their  actions.

But  sonic  of  our  youths and  students  have  been

misguided  by these elements into doing  wrong  acts.

They try to explain that the Report is drafted by the

Government to change the nature of the university, to

anglicise  the  university. Such a poisonous  lie  is

spreading  like  wild  fire  in  the  campus  of  the

university.  They tried to incite the  students,  and

even to resorting to violence to intimidate the staff

of the university, in order to recover the ground, to

regain control of the university. But when they found

that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



university  authorities  were  adopting  a   rational

attitude,  hoping that the misguided  students  would

not  be  deceived by these elements, they were forced

to  stage a procession in the university, to  assault

the  parents of the students, and wreck the furniture

of  the  university.  This was  the  performance  and

behaviour of these so-called highly educated  people,

but  the real directors are the pro-Communists,

anti-national  elements, who staged this procession.  They

thought  they  could make use of the  students.  They

incited the students, turned them into terrorists and

hooligans,  and  made use of some  stupid  people  to

intimidate  other students in order to  prevent  them

from attending classes. We must praise the Government

for  its  firm and swift action in taking  action  in

conjunction   with  the  university  authorities   to

restore  law  and  order  in  the  campus.  The

pro-Communists  tried  to  make use of  the  chauvinistic

sentiments, but their attempts met with failure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to tell those anti-national and

communalist elements that the destruction  of  public

furniture  and assault on the students' parents  will

not   go   towards  preserving  Chinese  culture   or

education.  If  they continue to  try  to  wreck  our

institute of higher learning, they are bound to fail,

and  they  will  be  fully responsible  for  all  the

consequences of their acts. That is why they will not

be  able  to  face  the democratic  sanction  of  the

people.  They will not be able to deceive the  people

any  more. They have betrayed the interests of  their

electorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanyang University is now a part of our higher

education system. The Government, in implementing the

policy   of  equal  treatment  for  all  streams   of

education, has not neglected the existence of Nanyang

University.  It  also respects the  autonomy  of  the

university.  It  has  spent millions  of  dollars  on

grants  to  the  university in  order  to  solve  its

problems and to bring about improvements. This  shows

what  the Government has done for the university.  It

is  not  going to interfere with the internal affairs

of   any   university.   The   Government   has   the

responsibility to see that our institutes  of  higher

learning



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



must  function properly in educating our people,  and

not   turn   them  into  hot-beds  for  anti-national

elements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if pro-Communists and communalist

elements  try to indulge in subversive activities,  I

hope  the  Government will take  steps  to  eliminate

them.  The  two million people in Singapore  are

co-operating  with the Government and are  working  hard

for  their  prosperity, and for their  self-reliance.

The Government has outlined many policies for

nation-building.   All   patriotic   people   must   concern

themselves with all the speeches and legislative acts

of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his policy speech, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

has  expressed  the intention that we  are  going  to

build  a multi-racial society. Such a statement gives

us encouragement. Our past performance and our future

policy  show that in carrying out its social  reform,

the  Government is motivated by the interest  of  the

people.  Therefore, the Opposition  Members  of  this

House  are  trying to spread rumours. Such acts  will

not  do  them any good. Their irresponsible  speeches

will   not  be  able  to  prevent  the  people   from

supporting   the  Government.  All  their   plausible

arguments  will  not influence the people  or  affect

their  attitude  towards the Government.  The  policy

Speech  has received the support of the people.  This

shows  that the anti-national elements are doomed  to

fail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I would like to express my full support

for  the  Address  of Thanks to the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's Speech.



<br><br>6.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker,   the  mentality  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis

Members  is extremely difficult to fathom.  In  their

public manifestos and statements, they talk of  their

task to educate and free the people from ignorance so

that  they can build a new society over the ruins  of

the  old.  And  yet  in practical  life,  with  their

inconsistent   behaviour  and   their   contradictory

arguments,  they arc confusing the people  more  than

anyone else.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 9th of August when independence was forced

on us, the Barisan Sosialis Members were the first to

demand an emergency sitting of the Assembly to debate

the  separation. We told them that there  were  other

more  urgent  matters than a debate in the  Assembly.

Our country must first gain admission into the United

Nations  which  had  a  General Assembly  meeting  in

September.  Our  Ministers must he there  to  present

their case on behalf of Singapore, otherwise we would

miss the occasion. So we had to postpone our Assembly

sittings in order that the Deputy Prime Minister  and

two  other  Ministers  could proceed  to  the  United

Nations to make an appearance, and then to visit  the

Afro-Asian countries to win over their friendship and

recognition  for  our new nation. Their  achievements

have  been widely publicised in the Press, and  I  do

not wish to elaborate on them. There is no doubt that

we   have   firmly  established  ourselves   in   the

international  field. So now when the difficult  task

is  over  and  we  are  ready to  have  our  Assembly

sittings to conduct a full debate on the independence

and  the manner in which Singapore was separated from

Malaysia,  we  find the Opposition  Members  missing.

What   kind  of  a  situation  is  this?  They   were

clamouring  for a sitting, but now when we  let  them

have   a   sitting,  they  absent  themselves.   They

complained  that they were not given any  opportunity

to  air the grievances of the people. They said  that

the  Press  used to black out their statements.  They

said  that the radio was controlled by the Government

and  that there were very few Assembly sittings.  And

now  when  we arc having a full-scale debate  on  the

policy of the Government, they refuse to turn  up  to

fulfil their duties as representatives of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one hand, they denounce the independence of

Singapore  as  a phoney independence  and  a  British

plot.  On the other hand, they formed a committee  of

the  relatives of detained persons and  got  Mr  Lim

Ching  Siong's  father to sign a  memorandum  to  the

Prime   Minister  claiming  that  Singapore,   having

achieved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



independence, must release all the patriots who  were

arrested by the British during the colonial days.  At

the  time when the majority of the population  wanted

merger  and Malaysia, the Barisan Sosialis said  that

they were opposed to merger and Malaysia. They wanted

a self-governing Singapore with control over internal

security,  which  actually amounted to  independence.

Now that we have got independence, which is what they

originally  asked for, they turn round and  say  that

they  do  not  want independence but  a  merger  with

Malaya.  They  call  it a "United Malaya"  (including

Singapore). So what kind of a political Party is this

which  is  always  going against the  wishes  of  the

majority of the people? They claim to he fighters for

the  cause  of Chinese education and yet  during  the

recent   incidents   in  Nanyang  University,   their

supporters  heat  up  the  Vice-Chancellor   of   the

University  and  set fire to the  dormitory  of

non-academic   staff.   They  broke  equipment   in   the

laboratories. They defaced the wall of the university

with   their  ugly  slogans.  They  even  locked   up

Professors  in their houses in an attempt to  prevent

them  from giving lectures. There was a case in which

a teacher had to call for outside help to release him

from his house because his door was tampered with  by

students  in the night. By these and other  underhand

methods,  they were able to carry out their so-called

boycott  of classes for a few days. They finally  had

to give up the boycott because public opinion was not

with them. But their activities have put shame to the

name of Chinese education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day before His Excellency opened this

Session,  the  Barisan leader,  Dr  Lee  Siew  Choh,

announced that they were boycotting the Session.  But

when reporters pointed out to him the danger that his

Assemblymen  may  lose their seats by  doing  so,  he

replied that he had to reconsider the matter. Even  a

resolute man like him is indecisive! Probably he  has

to wait for instructions from his underground masters

or   from   his  comrades  in  the  Malayan  National

Liberation   League   in   Indonesia,    and    these

instructions  are  not yet forthcoming,  because  his

friends  in  the  M.N.L.L. are  now  busy  hiding  in

Indonesia. Such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



is  the indecisive and inconsistent Opposition we are

facing  today! They are lost souls. They do not  know

where to go from here, and so the only convenient way

out  of  this  dilemma for them would  appear  to  be

absent from the Assembly. With this tremendous amount

of  split mentality and inconsistency on their  part,

it  is small wonder that one of their leaders had  to

go  to Woodbridge Hospital to seek special treatment.

If  this  trend continues, I am afraid many  of  them

will have to follow the lead of their leader and they

will  have  to line up at the doorstep of  Woodbridge

Hospital. If that is the case, then the Minister  for

Health  will have to seek more money from this  House

to provide for more V.I.P. wards to accommodate them.

They  said in their statement that they would boycott

this  Session  because  they did  not  want  to  lend

credence  to  the  so-called phoney independence  and

help the P.A.P. Government to deceive the people. I  do

not believe this is the real reason. If that is true,

then  why  did  they ask for a silting in  August?  1

think  the real reason is that they have lost out  on

all  fronts.  They have lost in the Referendum.  They

have  lost  in the general elections. They have  lost

even in the Hong Lim by election. They have lost  out

in  all  open arguments. Furthermore, their Party  is

split,  and  there  is no unity between  their  trade

unions  and  their Party. Even their only hope, that

the P.K.I may come and rescue them, vanished with the

coup and counter-coup on 30th September in Indonesia.

in August, the Barisan demanded an emergency sitting.

Today,  four months later, they have refused to  come

to the sitting. The only difference between today and

four  months ago is that in August the P.K.I. was  at

the  peak of its influence in Indonesia. Today it  is

down  and out. And their friends in the M.N.L.L. are

in  hiding.  So  the Barisan decided to  boycott  the

Session  because they cannot echo the voice of  their

masters any more, because the masters are nowhere  to

he found.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now wish to touch upon the question of survival

which  was  very much emphasised in His  Excellency's

Speech. The obstructive forces which work against the

progress of our society stem from two sources. First,

the Communists



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



in  our country, and second, the feudalists over  the

Causeway.  We  sought  to join Malaysia  for  greater

prosperity  and security, which a small  island  like

ours  would not he able to achieve. But we were  very

soon   disillusioned.  Our  big  brothers  over   the

Causeway  turned  out to be not so brotherly.  During

the two years we were in Malaysia, instead of helping

us  with their vast resources and the potentiality of

their   markets   to   hasten  our  industrialisation

programme, they have looted and plundered -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Minister should he

more careful in the choice of his words.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> For two years they have taken

away  40  per cent of our Federal revenues  plus  our

share  of the profits in the Currency Board. But  not

one  item of development projects was carried out  in

Singapore.  Promises  they had made  before  Malaysia

were  never carried out after we had joined Malaysia.

For  instance, their promise to let us have  autonomy

in labour and education. This was solemnly guaranteed

in  the Malaysian Constitution. But on Ithe slightest

pretext,  they  tried to snatch away  our  autonomous

power in labour by proclaiming a ban on strikes under

the   Emergency  powers,  and  this  was  to  include

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another example. It was agreed before we

joined  Malaysia that for the Singapore component  of

the  Malaysian  Police  Force,  recruitment,  whether

Malays or otherwise, must be from Singapore citizens.

It  was  only fair because jobs in Singapore must  be

given to Singapore citizens, whether they belonged to

Federal  departments  or  not.  But  after  we   were

independent, we were shocked to learn that of the new

recruits in the Singapore Police Force since Malaysia

Day,  the  majority of them came from the Federation.

They  were  using  Singapore as a convenient  dumping

place for their unemployed. We are not going to allow

them to do this any more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a subsequent sitting, I will introduce to this

House a Bill to provide for the issue of work permits

to  non-citizens. The Member for Bras Basah yesterday

appealed to the Government to be lenient



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



in  the  issue of work permits. Well. I  do  wish  we

could  be  rich  enough to allow our  neighbours  and

brothers across the Causeway to share our prosperity.

But Members must realise that our rice bowl is barely

enough  for our 1.9  million or 2 million population.

If  more  people come in to share the rice-bow,  then

the  benefits  to our own people will be jeopardised.

If  we  allow more and more people to jump  into  our

small  boat,  because  life  in  the  Federation   is

miserable, then our small boat may sink and  our  own

life  may  start to become as miserable as theirs  in

the Federation. What we are now, in fact, telling our

brothers  across the Causeway is this.  Do  not  take

Singapore as your escape route from your present  day

problems. That is no solution. If you feel you should

have  a  better society and a better Government  like

Singapore, then you must stay in your own  place  and

rally  more people to light for such a goal.  If  you

try  hard  enough,  then one day  the  whole  of  the

feudalistic society will collapse and a more just and

equal  multi-racial society will  emerge.  Thenn  the

people  in the two countries, which are separated  by

artificial means, will be one again.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation of Malaysia is determined not to

allow us to prosper. On this basis, we must seek  our

own  survival.  We  do  not have  to  depend  on  the

Federation for our living, but we must warn them  not

to  block  us  from  seeking  our  living  elsewhere.

Trading  with  any  country  of  the  world  is   our

sovereign right, and I hope the Federation Government

will  not interfere in our internal affairs. They  do

not want to trade with us, and they deny their market

to  us.  That is their business. We cannot  complain.

But  do  not stop us from carrying out our legitimate

trade  with  other countries under any  pretext.  The

Deputy   Prime  Minister  of  the  Federation,   when

commenting  on  the  Speech of  our  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara,  said that lie hoped Singapore would live  on

her own, with her own way of life, and follow her own

courses.  We  are  doing exactly that.  We  are  riot

asking charity from anyone ---
