<br><br><!-- Mrs Devan Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mrs Devan Nair</b> asked the Minister of Defence

when  construction of the proposed  Community  Centre

for Moulmein will commence and the estimated date for

its completion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon) (for the Minister of Defence):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Minister has promised the hon. Member  the

last time she raised the subject that we are making a

special  effort to build a community  centre  in  her

constituency. I am glad to report that  the  work  on

site  clearance for the proposed community centre  at

the  junction  of Balestier Road and  Shan  Road  has

already  commenced and the erection of the two-storey

building  will  commence shortly as  soon  as  tender

proceedings are completed. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>



expected  that  the  project  will  be  completed  by

November this year.

<div align="center"><b>ENTRY OF WIVES OF SINGAPORE CITIZENS INTO REPUBLIC</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Relaxation of rule)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Devan Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mrs Devan Nair</b> asked the Minister of Defence if

he  will consider a relaxation of paragraph 4 of  the

Schedule  to the Immigration (Prohibition  of  Entry)

Order, 1966, to allow wives of Singapore Citizens  to

enter  the Republic though they may have been  living

separately  from their husbands for  more  than  five

years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon (for the Minister of Defence):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the Government does not  consider

that  a relaxation is necessary. The legislation  was

introduced   after  careful  consideration   of   the

implications of allowing wives of Singapore  Citizens

entry  without  control. The rule has  been  enforced

since December 1959. The Government does not advocate

and has no intention of relaxing the control. I would

urge  the  hon.  Member first, to ask  why  Singapore

citizens should go overseas to get married when there

are  so  many  healthy, well-educated and intelligent

young  women  in  Singapore? Are  they  not  doing  a

disservice  to  the  country? And  if,  after  having

married, they have remained separate from their wives

for  more  than  five years, something  extraordinary

must  have taken place. Whatever it is, it  does  not

call   for   sympathetic   consideration   from   the

Immigration authorities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  to ask the Minister of State of  Defence

whether  he is aware that permission has been  sought

to  permit those wives of Chinese immigrants who have

been  separated  from  their  husbands  who  came  to

Singapore,  say,  in  1947, to  enter  Singapore  and

whether consideration would be given to them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have

pointed  out  just now, the policy  is  that  if  the

husband  and  the wife have been separated  for  five

years  and  the  husband  is  living  here,  then  no

approval can be given for the entry of the wife  into

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think Mr Ng's question was that the

separation was involuntary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, another point

is  that if they have decided to reside in Singapore,

become   Singapore  citizens  and  have   stayed   in

Singapore,  they  should  have  made  the   necessary

arrangements  for their family, or other  members  of

their family, to be together with them. If they  have

not done so earlier and they want to do it now, I  am

afraid  that it is a circumstance beyond our  control

and it is no fault of the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> With regard to the

Minister of State's answer, suppose the wife has been

separated for five years, then her husband, who is  a

Singapore   citizen,  can  marry  another   girl   in

Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as you are

aware,  and  probably the Member for  Anson  is  also

aware,   we  have  passed  the  Women's  Charter   in

Singapore  and, therefore, marriages are governed  by

the Women's Charter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> One more question. According to

the  Women's  Charter, they should be  separated  for

seven years, and then they can claim for a divorce. I

wonder whether the Minister of State agrees with  the

seven-year period of separation.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> The amendment Bill has not been

passed yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

according to the Women's Charter, we are told that  a

man can marry only one wife. When people residing  in

Singapore applied for Singapore citizenship  and  got

it,  whether they came from India or China, and  when

they applied for an entry permit for their wife,  who

may  be  in  India  or  China, they  declare  in  the

application  forms that they are already married  and

have  a  wife. Will the Minister inform me  how  such

people  can, in those circumstances, get  a  divorce,

thereby  allowing  them  to marry  somebody  else  in

Singapore?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is not

within  my  portfolio.  I do  not  know  whether  the

Minister for Social Affairs can answer it.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Rajoo, I think we had better wait

for  the  debate  on the Women's Charter  (Amendment)

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Thank you.

<div align="center"><b>TAMIL PROGRAMMES OVER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>RADIO SINGAPURA</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Complaints about poor reception)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr S. V. Lingam</b> asked the Minister for Culture

and Social Affairs if he is aware of complaints about

the poor quality of reception on the wave-length over

which  Tamil  programmes are now broadcast  by  Radio

Singapura;  and, whether he will take steps  to  have

this wavelength altered.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am aware

of  the  complaints  about the poor  quality  of  the

reception on the wavelength 1370 k/c over which Tamil

programmes are now broadcast. For this reason, I have

made  provision last year for the purchase of  a  new

transmitter of 20 kilowatts to take the place of  the

old  one  of  only 10 kilowatts. This new transmitter

was  installed in January 1967 and the  reception  of

the Tamil programme should have appreciably improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the proposed installation of F.M. (Frequency Modulation) Transmitters in May this year for all

language  streams, it is expected that  reception  in

all  languages  would be clear.  There  is,  however,

nothing wrong with the present wavelength.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>FLOODS IN CAMBRIDGE ROAD, OWEN ROAD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AND NORFOLK ROAD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr S. Rajoo</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National Development, in view of the recent floods in

the Cambridge Road, Owen Road and Norfolk Road areas,

(a) if he will consider taking immediate steps, as  a

temporary measure, to raise the embankment and  widen

the  canal  between  Keng Lee Road  and  the  Kandang

Kerbau Police Station; and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>



(b)  whether he will consider requesting the  Housing

and   Development  Board  to  give  priority  in  the

allocation  of  the Board's flats to applicants  from

these areas who wish to move out.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the areas about

which  the  Member is worried are extremely low-lying

and densely built up and are less than two feet above

the  level  of  the  highest tide.  Therefore,  heavy

rainfall  coinciding  with a  high  tide  will  cause

flooding in these areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising the Rochore Canal embankments, as suggested

by  the  hon. Member, would mean raising the  highest

level  of  the water in the canal above that  of  the

level  in  the culverts and drains leading  into  the

canal.  Therefore, unless control flap gates  at  the

discharge ends of culverts and drains are built,  the

water  from the canal could flow into the surrounding

areas.  If  these  flap gates are  built  and  closed

during heavy rainfall, the rain water in these  areas

cannot  flow into the canal. If there is a high  tide

coinciding with heavy rainfall and the flap gates are

opened, the water in the canal will be pushed by  the

tide and flow back into these low-lying areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediate widening of the canal as suggested by the

hon.  Member would not be feasible, due to  the  fact

that  the existing roads on either side of the  canal

have  been built very close to the canal embankments.

Any  minor  widening will not do  much  to  alleviate

flooding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Bukit Timah Flood Alleviation Scheme

is being implemented to alleviate not only the floods

in  the  Bukit  Timah area, but also in  these  areas

about which the Member is worried. Work on this major

Flood  Alleviation Scheme is now in progress  and  is

expected  to  be  completed some time  in  1969.  Mr

Speaker,  that  deals  with the  first  part  of  the

question. If I may go on to the second part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some priority can be given by the Housing and

Development Board to applicants who wish to move  out

of these areas. For those already occupying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>



Housing   Board  flats,  transfers  can  be  arranged

provided  they are not, choosey as regards  location.

In the case of those who are not at the moment living

in  Housing  Board flats, they should  apply  in  the

normal  manner,  and if they are eligible  under  the

rules,  they  can  be allocated Housing  Board  flats

within  a matter of days provided again they are  not

choosey as regards location.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> A supplementary question, Sir. Can the

Minister  tell  me  a  little more  about  the  flood

alleviation scheme in Bukit Timah? If I am allowed to

ask  a second supplementary question, can he also say

where  flats are available for those people who  want

to move out?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The Bukit Timah Flood Alleviation

Scheme  is being implemented in two stages - Phase  1

and   Phase  2.  The  Government  has  approved   the

implementation of the Phase 1 Scheme at an  estimated

cost  of  $6,840,000. Approval of the Phase 1  Scheme

involves  the construction of an entirely  new  canal

which  will  divert the storm water from Upper  Bukit

Timah  and Sungei Namly catchments, starting at about

the  6th  milestone Bukit Timah Road to join up  with

Sungei  Ulu Pandan. This Phase has already  commenced

and,  as  I have said, work will be completed  or  is

expected to be completed by 1969.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase 2 of the scheme on which a firm decision has

not yet been taken would involve another diversion of

flood  waters  and would mean cutting  another  canal

starting at about the 4th milestone Bukit Timah  Road

to  join up with Sungei Kallang. This deals with  the

Member's first supplementary question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the second supplementary question is

concerned,  there are flats in Toa  Payoh,  flats  in

Redhill,  flats in Upper Changi Road and a few  flats

in  Bukit  Ho  Swee which are readily  available.  In

Upper  Changi Road there are about 400; Redhill about

250;  Toa  Payoh a few thousand; and  Bukit  Ho  Swee

about 100.

National  Development if he will request the  Housing

and  Development Board to permit a choice of locality

when  they  offer flats to applicants who  have  been

given notice to quit State land.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon) (for the Minister for Law and National Development):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, it has already been the practice of the

Housing  and  Development Board to offer to  families

who  have  been  given  notice  to  quit  State  land

alternative  choices  of  locality  where  flats  are

available.  However,  there  have  been  cases  where

applicants  insist  on  a  particular   flat   in   a

particular  estate.  Obviously,  it  has   not   been

possible to satisfy most of such requests.

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question

[13th  March,  1967], "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  another  point which I wanted to bring  to  the

attention  of  this House yesterday  when  the  House

adjourned  is  that while the Ordinance provides  for

the  security  of  jobs  of  persons  placed  in  the

national service reserve, no provision is made to the

effect  that no person placed in the national service

reserve  shall  be  prejudiced in his  employment  by

reason  only  of the fact that he is  placed  in  the

national  service  reserve for the duration  of  such

reserve services. I have in mind the possibility that

the person placed on the national service reserve may

be  placed  at a disadvantage in respect of promotion

opportunities  as a result of his military  training.

Because  of  such military training requirements,  he

may  not be able to carry out over-time work  in  his

company whenever



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>



requested  to  do so by his supervisors.  Because  of

such  a situation, the management may place him in  a

section  of the firm which does not carry much  over-time requirements and, thereby, offers much less hope

for  promotion. Even if he is not required to perform

overtime  duties, the management, at the  same  time,

may be irritated to a certain extent by the fact that

such employee is compelled to take time off from work

and  may, naturally, react to such irritation by  not

actively considering such employee for any vacancy in

a  higher  post whenever any such vacancy arises.  It

would  be a sort of half-hearted compensation,  if  I

may  say so, for such employee to be assured  of  his

security  of  employment but, at the  same  time,  to

suffer  a  certain degree of prejudice in his  career

prospects as far as his firm is concerned. I  do  not

know  whether it is implied in the assurance  of  the

Government to those who are required to be called  up

for  national service - that this assurance of a  job

to all who are called up applies equally to those who

already  have a job in a private firm,  so  that  any

person,  whose  career  may  be  prejudiced  by   his

military  duty,  will be given an opportunity  for  a

higher job which he would otherwise have obtained  if

it had not been for his national service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, on the National Service (Amendment) Bill,  I

feel  that our brave Colonel should not be afraid  of

my  raising any question on this Bill, as it concerns

the  life  and  death  of  the  nation,  and  it   is

introduced at a time when the Communist united  front

is  struggling. On the other hand, Britain is  trying

to  cut down her troops and manpower in Singapore. So

the introduction of this Bill at this juncture is  of

special significance, because it symbolises the  fact

that the people of Singapore will be able to feel and

appreciate the end of colonial rule and that  we  are

really independent in the true sense of the word.  If

we  were still under colonial rule, then our colonial

masters   would   still   shoulder   their   military

responsibilities  to protect their own  interests  in

this region. Therefore, while they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>



controlled  the military power in this  region,  they

would not be able to carry out the job properly.  For

example,  if  they  wanted  the  people  to  take  up

national   service,  they  would  meet   with   great

difficulties and troubles. That was why some 10 years

ago  in  Singapore there was the May  13th  incident.

This  took  place  in a very abnormal  situation  and

under  very strange circumstances. The facts  of  the

riots  that  took  place  then  were  distorted   and

exploited by some quarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the colonial rulers, we have inherited a

situation in which we do not have sufficient military

power. We have inherited a very weak and feeble civil

service. We have not been given a very brave,  strong

and  rugged military establishment. This Bill,  which

is  now  introduced  about a year  or  so  after  our

independence,   throws  some  more   light   on   the

independence  of  Singapore in that  we  are  now  in

charge of the defence of our own country. If we  were

still under colonial rule, we would not be given  the

full  attention  and care that we deserve.  In  those

days, our colonial masters would not be able to fully

implement national service. At that time,  a  lot  of

students   applied  for  postponement  from  military

service,  and they fought very hard to get  it.  They

thought they could get some kind of postponement. But

now,  in introducing this Bill, we have already  made

concrete    proposals    for   its    implementation.

Regulations  have  already been  drawn  up  to  grant

facilities  to those students who want to  apply  for

postponement on valid grounds. This goes to show that

an  independent government is entirely different from

a colonial government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to go on to another point. We can see that a

lot  of  people  feel  that Singapore  is  completely

indefensible.  There  is nothing  for  which  we  can

fight. We cannot hope to triumph in any battle at all

in  Singapore. Sometimes we can see in the newspapers

reports  about  military pacts entered  into  between

Malaysia   and  the  United  Kingdom.  Singapore   is

regarded as a small island, like the Isle of Man,  at

the southern tip



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>



of the Malay Peninsula. It is only a very small piece

of  land. It has no military significance and  value,

and  it  is  completely indefensible.  This  kind  of

argument  seems to have underestimated  the  military

value and strategic position of Singapore. It is  not

entirely  correct.  If it is said that  our  military

power  is not sufficient to carry out any aggression,

of  course, I will agree. In fact, it is not our  aim

to  mobilise our people in order to raise an army and

go  north,  south, east or west. We do not have  such

aggressive intentions at all. Our main aim is centred

on defence, and defence only. As a matter of fact,  a

small  island  like Singapore has,  historically,  no

intention of any aggression at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some 700 years ago there was aggression from Java,

and  recently Japan also invaded Singapore.  We  were

occupied   by  Japan  and  became  the   victims   of

aggression. But there is no intention on  our  record

to  say that we have invaded any other place at  all.

So  even if we have a strong army, we do not have any

experience of invading others, or have any aggressive

intentions. Singapore controls traffic in the Straits

of  Malacca in a region of some 600 miles. It is  the

gateway from the East to the West, and vice versa. It

is  the centre of the trade route of South-east  Asia

connecting    Australia   and   New   Zealand.    So,

strategically   speaking,  we  become   a   bone   of

contention in times of war, although we may not  have

any  aggressive intentions of any kind. But we cannot

deny,  or  under-estimate, or overlook  the  military

value  and  importance  of  Singapore  strategically.

Although we are not going to invade anybody, we  must

not be weak-kneed. We must not be cowed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the military aspect, there is also

the  social aspect to be considered. Singapore has  a

population  of  about  two million.  If  we  want  to

stabilise the situation in Singapore, we must have  a

very closely-knit society before we can survive.  The

National Service (Amendment) Bill provides a  certain

significance in this respect in that attempts can  be

made  to  mobilise the people so as to bring about  a

closely-knit society. At the same time, we have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>



to  bear in mind that we have no resources other than

manpower. The people in the age group of 18 or so are

even  more valuable in terms of manpower, and we must

make  full  use of these resources and make  all  the

people responds to the national service call. To this

extent,  I feel that if we can fully tap the youthful

energies  of  our people and make use of  the  spring

source of our nation, then it is in keeping with  the

aspirations  of our people and we can create  a  very

bright future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I wish to go into is this. Although

we call this national service, it must, of necessity,

be  connected with the nation, which, in the eyes  of

the  Communists, cannot stand on its own, because the

Communists themselves have no national consciousness.

If they are to follow Marx, Engels or anybody of that

kind, they will try to make use of class conflict  or

struggle  by  which  they will try  to  suppress  the

people and make use of the class struggle as a weapon

to  suppress the people and to destroy the nation  as

their  ultimate aim. They will start the rule of  the

proletariat instead. We must, of necessity, give vent

to  the spirit of democracy so as to protect our  way

of  life. To do this, I personally feel that we  must

take  the opportunity to review the policies  of  the

Defence  Ministry.  For example, the  inculcation  of

national consciousness is a very important job. I  do

not know whether it has already been accomplished. In

the Officers' Mess of the People's Defence Force,  we

have  not seen the reflection of society in the  rank

and  file. Although it is said that the men and  boys

are   supposed  to  have  come  from  a  multi-racial

society,  we are unable to see any Chinese  newspaper

or  national language newspaper. Nor are our military

songs  sung  in  the Malay language or  the  national

language.  In the regular forces, we understand  that

they  are using a kind of trumpet, instead of a bell,

to  inform the people of meal times. Up to date we do

not have any military songs in the national language.

So  the  People's Defence Force has not done its  own

part  in  bringing about a greater sense of  national

consciousness.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>



If an explanation can be given, I shall be very happy

to hear it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that we are Back-benchers in the

ruling Party and we have some personal experience  in

military service and we have undergone a certain kind

of  training. The people from our ruling  Party  must

set  a good example by joining national service. This

will  nail  the  lies  and the smears  of  the  anti-national  elements who say that we are hiding  behind

the  people who are used as cannon fodder. So we must

set a good example at the very beginning. We must put

ourselves  in  uniform first. From the  branches  and

headquarters  of our Party, we must come  forward  in

uniform to show the people that we are setting a good

example. I do not know whether the Minister concerned

has given some thought to this aspect so that he will

not  receive undue criticism. I hope some explanation

will be forthcoming in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, when we call up the

people for national service, we must not be very much

concerned  with  the payment of allowances  or  other

remunerations, otherwise it would appear that we  are

engaging employees to do a job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

think  national service is the necessary  preparation

through  rigid discipline, military or otherwise,  of

the citizens for duty to the nation. This service  in

defence of the community undoubtedly can be termed  a

noble duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Republic, though barely older than two years,

has  made great strides in the housing and industrial

fields,  and  socially,  too,  has  yet  to  mould  a

community  of varied racial origins into  one  nation

possessing  the  spirit  of  national  consciousness.

However,  our assets are the youths and I  think  the

Government has been wise to note this and exploit  it

to  the  country's  full benefit.  The  slogan,  "The

youths  of  today  are the leaders  of  tomorrow"  is

particularly  true.  Through  the  youths,  we   must

cultivate national consciousness and other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>



values  of  social responsibility which are essential

and   which  we  desire  to  instill  in  our  entire

community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Bill, national service means

service  in  the  Army, People's Defence  Force,  the

Special Constabulary and the Vigilante Corps. It also

sets  out the age groups to be called up and how long

they are required to serve full-time as well as part-

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amongst the number of important amendments to the

National Service Ordinance, 1952, of Malaysia in  its

application to Singapore is one in which powers  will

be vested in the Minister who may "from time to time,

by notice in the Gazette" call up youths for national

service.  Therefore,  any  proclamation  for  call-up

would  be  done  by  the  Minister  instead  of   the

President being required to proclaim it. I  shall  be

glad  if the Minister of Defence can explain why such

a prerogative will now be vested in him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point is about the age groups to be called

up.  According  to this Bill, 18 year-olds  would  be

required  to  serve  two years full-time  and  twelve

years part-time. I am glad to note that jobs would be

awaiting  them upon their completion of the  two-year

full-time  service.  This is noteworthy  in  that  it

gives security to these youths who will not be unduly

worried over employment when called upon to serve the

country for two years full-time and ultimately twelve

years part-time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would be grateful if the Minister would

kindly  inform this House how many youths  would  the

ten  per cent constitute, and what expenditure  would

be expended on this matter. Furthermore, would it not

be wiser if the Government, instead of calling up the

18  year-olds, extend the age group, say, from 18  to

25?  I  am suggesting this because, in this  way,  we

would  be able to equip our youths with the necessary

training by which the development of spirit,  bearing

and skill would be more beneficial to the country  as

a   whole   and  in  which  the  spirit  of  national

consciousness would be further instilled.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>



And  this  would meet the requirement of a small  and

newly   independent   nation  like   Singapore   - the

preparedness  that  would  ensure  the  survival  and

continued progress of the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that we know very well that a good

number  of  these  18 year-olds have  left  secondary

schools  and  many are pursuing higher education.  In

this  respect, will the Minister concerned see to  it

that  whilst  they  are undergoing national  service,

their  educational pursuits will not be impeded?  And

for  those  in  the higher institutions of  learning,

would  it  not be feasible to group these  conscripts

and  place them under centralised training at a place

closer  to  them  whereby minimum time  is  spent  on

transport so that no cause for complaint would  arise

on  the  question of their studies being hampered  or

impeded  because  they have to  spend  much  time  in

travelling to and from their place of training?  This

aspect  of  training, of course, refers  to  military

training  for  which allowances  are  paid  to  cover

transport  charges and laundry charges  for  uniforms

issued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the Bill clearly states, persons "not

being  less than eighteen years of age" and  who  are

liable  to  register  under this Ordinance  shall  be

liable  to  be called up for service in the Vigilante

Corps.  We  all know the usefulness of the  Vigilante

Corps and the notable work they have done in the past

2«   years.  The  Government,  whilst  realising  the

importance  of the Vigilante Corps, has seen  fit  to

include  service in it as part and parcel of national

service. I gather that the Vigilante Corps have  been

formed  at  community centre levels  and  that  their

duties  are mainly to patrol the kampongs  and  along

the  shores. These members are doing an admirable job

and  we  have  come across occasions  when  Vigilante

Corps  members have helped to apprehend burglars  and

thieves, prevented illegal immigrants and performed a

host  of public-spirited duties. They are doing  this

purely on a voluntary basis and this displays a  high

spirit  of social responsibility. It is also manifest

that they are not paid any allowance when they go on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>



duty   except  when  the  management  committees   of

community  centres have to foot the bill  for  coffee

and  titbits.  It has been suggested  that  Vigilante

Corps members be paid a token sum of money as enjoyed

by  volunteers  in the Special Constabulary  and  the

People's Defence Force. I support this suggestion and

no  doubt  the Minister concerned may argue  and  say

that  the Vigilante Corps members enjoy a wider range

of  recreational facilities. But I must  stress  that

the other forces have such facilities, too. Moreover,

service  in  the  Vigilante Corps would  be  national

service, too, and I think it is only fair that  those

who would be required to serve in the Vigilante Corps

be paid a nominal sum when they go on duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to the Bill in general, we all

know  that  national  service exists  in  almost  all

countries   in  the  world.  It  is  the  fundamental

responsibility of every citizen to answer the call of

national  service,  if we do not take  the  necessary

steps  to protect ourselves from the enemies  of  our

nation  in  order  to be able to live  in  peace  and

security, I do not think anybody, or any country  for

that  matter,  can guarantee our freedom,  unless  we

wish  to  be subjects of another country!  I  do  not

think this is what the people of Singapore want!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, being a small independent country,

stands on the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula and

it  is  situated  in a position of immense  strategic

importance. Therefore, it is only right  and  in  the

interests  of  the people and country  that  we  must

never  allow  ourselves to be caught  unprepared,  as

what  happened  in  the Second  World  War  when  the

Japanese  invaded Singapore. Hence the  necessity  of

having  a body of disciplined fighting force able  to

rotect life and property and most important of all -

the  survival of the country -the existence  of  this

tiny  island  State in this corner of  the  turbulent

world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a well-known fact that if a country shows

verve,  grit and determination to survive,  she  will

not  be molested. The stakes will be too high and the

price too heavy to pay if we are a passive lot.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1206</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the character of our community is such

that  Singapore is a rootless society. Her races  are

of   varied  migrant  origins.  Those  who  came   to

Singapore  more than a century ago did not intend  to

make Singapore their home and country. But they have,

over  a  period of more than a century,  left  behind

well  over two million people who today make  up  the

population of the Republic of Singapore. The rootless

and  disorganised society of yesterday will thus have

to  be  an organised society of today. This is unique

in the history of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, we are now independent and I am

sure  that  all will agree with me when  I  say  that

there is no place for us to go to if we are told  off

by   a   stronger  neighbour.  Hence  the   paramount

importance  of our Republic to organise a society  in

which  there  exists a sense of social responsibility

and national consciousness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So national service will be implemented in the very

near  future.  I  do  not  think  anybody  today   in

Singapore will be against it. More than a decade ago,

people  did  not  understand  the  reasons  for  such

service, and thus the Communists were able to exploit

the  issue, resulting in the call-up being a failure.

Today   the   situation  is  entirely  changed.   For

instance,  young  men and women  have  responded  far

beyond  expectations by joining the People's  Defence

Force and the People's Defence Force (Women). I would

therefore  suggest  to  the  Minister  concerned   to

increase  the intake to, say, 50 per cent instead  of

10 per cent of the youths to be called up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, if national service continues for ten

years  during  which time an organised  society  will

emerge, Singapore then will be a changed place  where

her  citizens  will not only live in  confidence  and

pride  but  the Republic will also last  as  long  as

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in summing up, I would urge all youths

who  are liable to be called up to rise at once  with

one  voice  and respond to this call of duty  to  the

nation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

take  this  opportunity to say a  few  words  on  the

National Service (Amendment) Bill which is now before

the  House for its Second Reading? This Bill provides

for  the  conscription of potential manpower  of  our

Island   Republic  which  has  been   hitherto   left

untapped.  True indeed that during the 140  years  of

colonial rule and the short-lived Malaysian era,  the

defence and security of this country was left in  the

hands  of  foreigners  and our one-time  compatriots.

Since  they were more interested in their own  safety

and  security  than in this country, they  could  not

take  a real interest and attempt to train our youths

to be good soldiers and defenders of this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the break from Malaysia on 9th August, 1965,

it  has  become incumbent on our people to take  over

the  responsibility of defence and  security  of  the

country.  And national service has become a necessity

to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support this Bill in full, but I have some

doubts  about  certain provisions which  I  hope  the

Minister will clarify for the benefit of the  public.

Taking into consideration sub-clause (1) of clause  5

and paragraphs (1) (a) and (b) of section 16K of Part

VIIB, clause 15, the Minister, by notification in the

Gazette,  may require a person who has attained  such

age  not  being more than 18 months below the minimum

age  for enrolment in the national service, and  such

called-up  person  will render two  years'  full-time

service under subsection (1) of section 16K. Thus the

Minister may call up a boy at the age of 16« to enrol

for national service and to do actual service between

the  ages  of  18  and 20. On the  other  hand,  this

implies that a boy in Primary I at the age of  7,  if

he  passes the annual examinations without fail  each

year,  will  at  the age of 16 or  16«  still  be  in

Secondary  IV.  Therefore, in accordance  with  these

provisions, while he is still at school, he is liable

to   be  called  up  for  registration  for  national

service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1208</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all of us at one time were school boys

ourselves.  We  know what it was  like  to  pass  the

school final examinations. The Minister's remarks  on

education  recently  notwithstanding,  this  requires

concentration of mind and body on ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Point

of  clarification, Sir. Before the hon. Member  makes

an  error on this subject and confuses everybody, may

I earnestly ask him to read the pamphlet which I gave

the hon. Members of Parliament yesterday?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the age of 16½ the obligation is not to do

national service but to register. This will give  the

Ministry  something like 18 months in which  to  plan

ahead. It is nowhere stated in the amending Bill that

youths will be called up for national service at  the

age of 16½. All that is required is that they are  to

register and to give their particulars.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Sir, my contention is that at least they

will  be  free to complete their secondary  education

before being called up for national service.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Rajoo, I think the answer to the

question  you  have  raised  is  contained   in   the

provision itself. Clause 5 introduces a new paragraph

(1) (b) which refers to persons who:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"have attained such age not being more than eighteen

months  below  the  minimum  age  for  enlistment  or

enrolment...".



<br><br>These  persons must register at 16« but  the  minimum

age  for  enlistment or enrolment is still 18  years.

The 18-month period is the period of processing prior

to  enlistment or enrolment. They have to register 18

months before that date. That is the position, is  it

not, Dr Goh?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Sir, if you are aiming at building an

equal  democratic socialist society, members  of  the

society will be given equal opportunity in respect of

places  for  Government jobs and  finding  their  own

means  of living. Assuming that each year there  will

be  about  8,000  to  10,000 youths  of  call-up  age

seeking employment, the 10 per cent elite or so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>



will  be  guaranteed Government jobs in this  manner.

This  period  of  assuring jobs for those  discharged

from  full-time  national service is supported  in  a

pamphlet  issued by the Government entitled "National

Service and You". I quote from page 21:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No person who has completed his two years' full-time service in the Army need worry about his future,

for  sufficient  numbers of  civilian  jobs  will  be

reserved for discharged National Servicemen either in

Government   service,  Statutory  Boards   or   large

business enterprises to ensure that every one gets  a

job.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this may be considered as an incentive to our

youths or an inducement to the parents to enrol their

sons  in  army  service.  But  this  will  be  unfair

treatment to thousands of other youths who  are  also

eager to seek employment, who are also loyal to  this

country,  and who have equal rights like the  10  per

cent  elite  to  be  selected for  army  service  and

guaranteed Government jobs after their discharge from

national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, qualifications for army service may differ

from qualifications for the administrative service. A

man   with   a  good  physique  and  even  with   low

qualifications  may well qualify  for  an  army  job,

whereas a man with intelligence but not with  a  good

physique  may not be selected for an army  job.  Sir,

the  present  Government system of guaranteeing  jobs

will  create a farce in our Government machinery.  In

time  to come, the intelligentsia will be out of  the

administrative  service and those  who  are  not  the

elite will be controlling the Government machinery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the circumstances, I feel that more time

and   consideration  should  be  given   to   certain

provisions of this Bill before passing them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Soo Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Soo Peng (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

introduction of the National Service (Amendment) Bill

is  aimed  at the creation of a healthy,  useful  and

dedicated corps of citizens. In the process of  their

duties,  members  serving in the various  corps  will

acquire and enhance their sense of national identity,

which  will  infuse  itself into their  families  and

neighbours, and thus multiply its effect.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, if this Bill is successfully

implemented - and I see no reason why it should not -

we  may  expect to have a new generation of dedicated

Singapore  citizens, fully conscious  of  our  needs,

effectively    and    willingly    shouldering    the

responsibility of citizenship. We live in  an  island

surrounded  by  turbulent  seas  of  nationalism  and

racialism.  The  past few years have shown  that  we,

having  no other place to go to, must and will  stand

up  and fight if our very existence is threatened  by

expansionist ambitions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill lays the cornerstone of our national

resolve  to  be mentally and physically  equipped  to

defend ourselves. A side effect of the implementation

of  this  Bill  can be the inculcation of  discipline

among our population of ages between 18 and 40.  This

sector  is  the  most physically  productive  of  our

working  population  and a more  disciplined  working

force  can but do our economy enormous good. However,

in  the implementation of this Bill, I would urge the

Minister to consider the following points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fine balance will have to be struck between the

call of duty and the compensation for those answering

the  call.  Ideally,  of  course,  all  should  serve

without recompense, but human beings, being what they

are, the thin line between enthusiasm and frustration

must  be  found  and drawn. I am confident  that  the

Ministry of Interior and Defence will, in the  course

of implementing this Bill, find this balance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like the Ministry to give serious

thought  at this stage to the problem and  not  allow

our national goal to be jeopardised by miserliness. I

note that no provision is made for allowances to  the

Vigilante Corps. I feel that the Ministry should give

further  thought  to  the  question  of  compensating

members  of  the Vigilante Corps for their  time  and

incidental expenses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parents of the old school may still feel - although such parents are decreasing year by year - that service in any uniform is reserved for the son

who  cannot do better elsewhere. This stigma attached

to the uniformed service



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>



has  to  be  forestalled and countered with  adequate

explanation. I suggest the Ministry take early  steps

to  make  known the ideals and purposes of this  Bill

through all the mass media open to the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill provides every able-bodied citizen between 18 and 40 years the

opportunity to serve his country. In this connection,

may I quote these stirring words?



<pre>

             'Breath's there the man with soul so dead

             Who never to himself hath said

             "This is my country...!"'

</pre>



<br><br>If  everyone in our country says to himself that this

is  his  country, his land and his home, and that  he

will  fight with his life for what he cherishes, then

we shall have a nation and a people who will consider

it the noblest task to defend his country. May I take

this  opportunity  to urge every person  eligible  to

serve  under  this  Bill to do so as  an  opportunity

rather  than as an onerous task. The glory  to  serve

should over-ride any discomfort of services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I heartily welcome and support

this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I rise to speak very briefly in support of this Bill.

Many people may wonder why national service is to  be

introduced in Singapore, as Singapore is only a small

nation in this world. Sir, the answer to this is that

Singapore is now an independent nation and, like  all

other   nations,  we  should  have  the   means   and

capabilities to protect and defend our nation without

having to depend much on outside help. In fact,  most

of  the countries have enforced national service. And

there  is  no  reason  why  Singapore  should  be  so

exceptional  in  this  respect.  I  must,  therefore,

praise our Government for taking such a decisive step

to  introduce this National Service (Amendment)  Bill

in order to enlist our 18-year old citizens for a two-year  full-time service in the army or for  part-time

services in the P.D.F., the Special Constabulary,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>



or  the Vigilante Corps. This decisive step has  been

taken  after  careful thought and consideration  over

the last 1½ years, and, in fact, the Government would

have  taken  this  step when it  started  to  recruit

members for the People's Defence Force last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as one can remember, when

the  National Service Ordinance was first  introduced

and came into force in 1952 by the then semi-colonial

government,  many  young  people,  particularly   the

students, fled from Singapore to the country of their

ancestors  in order to avoid being called  up.  These

students did not want to become, in their own  words,

"the stooges or ashes of the cannon of the then semi-colonial Government". There was no support at all  at

that  time  from the people, because  they  were  not

subjects  of  an independent country but were  people

living  in  the  colony  of a  foreign  power.  Since

Singapore  is  now  an independent country,  national

service    has   become   a   community    obligation

collectively  and  a  fundamental  responsibility  of

every citizen individually.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the people of Singapore have learnt a bitter

lesson   in   the   struggle   for   survival   after

independence  and they have now fully understood  the

meaning of survival. They have great appreciation for

our Government for what they have been provided with.

For  instance, equal status in the society regardless

of  whatever race they are; security and freedom  and

social  amenities such as housing, education, welfare

aid and hospital facilities, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am sure the citizens of

Singapore are prepared and ready to stand up  at  any

time  in  response to the call of the  Government  to

defend  our  nation  in  case of  emergency.  It  is,

therefore,  the  duty of each and  every  citizen  to

safeguard  all  the privileges of enjoying  the  many

social  amenities  with  which  the  Government   has

provided  them. Moreover, national service  gives  an

opportunity  to  young people  of  various  races  to

intermix and mingle with one another through training

so  that  they may know one another better.  Besides,

the training



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>



teaches  them how to handle arms. Besides this,  they

will  also learn to be patriotic to the nation.  What

is  more important is that these young citizens  will

be  taught to understand their social obligations  to

the nation and will learn how to cultivate a sense of

national consciousness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is the opportune time for us

to  test  whether  our citizens' loyalty  is  to  the

country  of  their birth or to the country  of  their

ancestors. Our Government has already assured us that

no  person who has completed his two years' full-time

service in the army need worry about his future,  for

the Government will reserve sufficient jobs either in

Government   service,  statutory  boards   or   large

enterprises  once  he  is  demobilised  from   active

service. If he wishes to further his studies, a place

will  also  be  found for him in  an  institution  of

higher   education.  We  understand  also  that   the

Government  is  about  to  introduce  legislation  to

control  employment  in  the private  sector  and  to

compel  employers  to  take  into  employment   those

citizens  who  have served their two years'  military

training.   With  all  these  assurances   from   the

Government,  I am sure that not only citizens  in  my

constituency  will  give  full  support  to  national

service,   but   also  all  the   people   in   other

constituencies will similarly pledge their support to

our Government in introducing this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I urge this House to give its

fullest support to this Bill.



<br><br>3.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  if  the people in  our  multi-racial,

multi-religious  and multi-cultural society  wish  to

live  in  amity  and harmony in an  equal,  just  and

democratic  society  in this  Republic,  then  it  is

important to have national service which, in essence,

means  to  be  prepared  in an emergency.  We  cannot

depend  solely on outside forces for our  protection.

We cannot allow ourselves to be caught unprepared. We

cannot   depend  on  aid  solely  on  the  basis   of

agreements on paper. My reason for saying so is  that

every  country attaches the utmost importance to  its

integrity.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>



Therefore,   the   citizens   are   responsible   for

safeguarding  the  new  independent  Republic.  Every

citizen  I  refer  to,  Mr Speaker,  is  a  citizen,

whether he is a Minister, a Member of Parliament, the

child  of  a Minister or of a Member of Parliament  -

they  cannot be exempted. What is more, the  children

of  Mr Speaker himself or the people of the Republic

of  Singapore. In short, from the highest  strata  to

the lowest strata; not from the lowest to the highest

strata, as has happened in bourgeois countries. For a

small and newly independent Republic such as ours, it

is  a heavy and important responsibility, because the

time  will come when the preparedness of the citizens

will depend on our continued prosperity and survival.

In  these circumstances, it goes without saying  that

training is vitally important to inculcate the spirit

of  national consciousness, which is for the  purpose

of  creating  a new, strong and tugged society  which

has its own self-respect. Of course, the training  is

not  only in the skill of using weapons but  also  in

other  modern  technical skills like  transportation,

communications, repairing electrical  equipment  etc.

In addition, there is training in good discipline.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every country in this world needs one

another.  National service is a social responsibility

and  the  fundamental duty of every  citizen.  As  we

protect ourselves, our families, and our friends from

destruction  and loss, likewise we have a  collective

responsibility to safeguard and protect our  Republic

from our enemies so that we can forever maintain  our

peaceful  way of life. In addition, national  service

will   also   further  cement  the  close   ties   of

relationship between us. It is a real test  of  those

among   our  citizens  whether  they  have  undivided

loyalty  and allegiance to the Republic and have  the

interest  of  the Republic at heart.  Those  who  are

indifferent  to what is happening around  us  do  not

deserve  to  enjoy  the  privileges  enjoyed  by  the

citizens  of the Republic, as mentioned by  the  hon.

Member for Geylang Serai yesterday in his adjournment

speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that there are hon. Members who

are not aware of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>



achievements or progress made in the People's Defence

Force  when  they say we have no songs to  prove  the

progress  of  the  P.D.F. We have our  songs.  As  an

example, I recite one or two lines which read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`P.D.F. is the People's Defence Force - Serve the

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People's Defence Force - excellent service, full of

spirit, to serve the spirit and soul, prepare to  die

for the sake of the country.'



<br><br>The last verse of the People's Defence Force:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Singapore is our mother land, must be protected

collectively, and be prepared to destroy our enemies...'



<br><br>That  is  the song of the People's Defence Force.  So

hon.   Members  must  know  what  progress  has  been

achieved  by  the People's Defence Force.  Hence  the

introduction of the National Service (Amendment) Bill

in order to get a mandate from Members of Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  the National Service Bill,  which  has

been  introduced,  is good for a  young  nation  like

Singapore,  because we have to train our  youths  and

inculcate  in them a sense of responsibility  towards

the  defence of the country. Ours is a small country.

Although  it  has  no  natural  resources  as   other

countries  have,  nevertheless  Singapore   has   its

prosperity and wealth which our citizens can well  be

proud  of.  Every  citizen  of  Singapore  should  be

conscious of his responsibility, and not just live as

a   temporary   resident   without   any   sense   of

responsibility towards the nation, as happened during

the colonial era. Singapore is now an independent and

sovereign   State.   Therefore,   the   attitude   of

transience must be abolished. Every citizen must give

his  undivided loyalty to the country.  The  National

Service (Amendment) Bill is appropriate. It has  been

introduced at an opportune time. I am quite sure  the

youths  of  Singapore  will be  proud  to  have  this

opportunity  to serve the country. We  must  remember

that the gangsters in this country are the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>



products  of  the colonial era, because the  colonial

administration  was indifferent towards  our  youths.

Hence   they  became  dead-end  kids  and   took   to

gangsterism.  Such people will endanger the  country.

They are the remnants of colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at Japan, for instance. Her youths have

been  asked to do compulsory national service. So  we

find  that every Japanese citizen is full of national

consciousness, wherever he may be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sense of responsibility towards the defence of

the  country  can  be inculcated  in  the  people  of

Singapore, who should owe undivided allegiance to it,

through  the National Service (Amendment) Bill  which

is introduced in the House.



<br><br>3.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Devan Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Devan Nair (Moulmein)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  wish  to participate in this debate  on  the

National  Service  (Amendment)  Bill.  I  have   many

reasons  for  expressing my pleasure  in  this  Bill.

Through  national service we inculcate pride  in  our

country. We acknowledge our self-respect. If  we  are

self-centred and do not have regard for the interests

of  the  nation,  we will never prosper.  But  if  we

regard our own interests as closely intertwined  with

those of the nation, that will also take care of  our

own  self-interest. But we must have regard  for  the

interests  of the people at large, and  that  is  the

spirit  we must inculcate in our people. The National

Service (Amendment) Bill, I believe, will be of great

help in developing this spirit. If we help ourselves,

God  will  help  us too. But to defend ourselves,  we

must  have sufficient training and this Bill  enables

us to have such training. This Bill is essential.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young people who take up national service will not

only  get military training but also training as good

citizens, and the sense of social responsibility will

be inculcated in them. Parents, particularly mothers,

must  encourage their children to join up. I  support

this Bill wholeheartedly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, most

Members  have  spoken in support  of  this  amendment

Bill.  So  I  do  not want to make a long  speech.  I

merely want to comment on certain good intentions and

objectives of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be praised that it provides for the

training  of young people, because this  is  the  age

when they attain the peak of their health and this is

the  opportune  time  to turn their  aspirations  and

habits   into   the   right   direction.   Otherwise,

everything might be wasted. Therefore, parents should

give  their full support to this Bill and  get  their

youngsters   to  take  up  national  service.   Every

individual should live as a good citizen of Singapore

and  so  ensure  a good future for him  and  for  the

community. This is an opportune way to do it, just as

it  is  done in Western countries. Whether  they  are

multi-lingual nations or not, they induce  people  to

go  for national service, and we can see the benefits

they  achieve  from this. In Eastern countries,  this

type  of national service is not very common. Yet  we

have  decided to pass this Bill. Therefore,  it  will

make us the envy of countries in South-east Asia, and

they will also speak encouragingly about us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not intend to use national service to fight

against other countries or to occupy them. We  merely

want  to  strengthen our defences  and  the  fighting

power and the character of our youth. That is why  we

have  introduced this Bill and are going to implement

it. As good citizens of this country, it is necessary

for  us to have national service so as to improve our

defences  in future. In the First World War,  we  all

remember  the Japanese invaded Russia. In the  Second

World  War,  the Japanese also had to  fight  against

other countries. It is because their youths had  been

properly  trained through national service that  they

were  able  to defeat their enemy. In the  same  way,

every citizen of an independent nation should take up

compulsory national service training. The  fact  that

this  Bill only gives an opportunity for training  to

the  18-year  olds draws one comment from  me.  There

should also be an opportunity for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>



higher  age  group to get this training  and  thereby

attain good health and proper training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wholeheartedly support this Bill and I hope the

people   will  also  fully  support  the   provisions

therein.



<br><br>3.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Chew Chin Han -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chew Chin Han (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, since

Singapore's  independence and  after  its  separation

from  Malaysia, we have come to realise  that  as  an

independent  country  we  cannot  rely  purely   upon

another country or countries to protect us in case of

war,   invasion   or  other  forms  of  disturbances.

Experience  has  shown  that it  is  better  that  we

protect  ourselves than for us to  be  protected,  to

save ourselves rather than to be saved, to fight  and

struggle  for our own survival. Since we do not  wish

to  be  a satellite country or a protectorate of  any

other country, every Singapore citizen should realise

that  to  have full sovereignty, the most fundamental

thing  is  to know how to govern and how  to  protect

ourselves.  There is a Chinese proverb, Mr  Speaker,

Sir.  May I quote it in Chinese first? Yuen sui  chew

pu te chin huo. Translated, it means that if there is

a fire in the neighbourhood, the waters from the land

further away cannot reach and stop the fire in  time.

For  example, if there were a fire at Jalan Besar and

we  were  to  wait  for the fire brigade  from  Kuala

Lumpur,  I  am sure the whole of Singapore  would  be

totally  engulfed even before it arrived  from  Kuala

Lumpur. Therefore, we would have to use our own  fire

brigade. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. This is the Member's maiden

speech. Members should listen to it with courtesy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Chew Chin Han -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chew Chin Han:</b> it is quite all right, Sir. Our

country  is  small,  but our  citizens  are  of  high

spirit,  progressive, industrious and can  stand  any

form  of hardships. The introduction of this National

Service  (Amendment) Bill at this  juncture  is  very

timely.  This Bill is to show to all nations  of  the

world  that we are a determined group, consisting  of

different races and living under a democratic  system

of equality and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>



unity.  Our  country is at present  undergoing  great

changes, and organisation is rapidly taking place  in

various  phases. Most important of all,  we  like  to

show  other  countries that we are definitely  not  a

warlike people or a warlike nation.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>

<br><br>3.57 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead we are people of a peace-loving nature and

are  trying  to train ourselves to guard against  any

enemy.  As  other  hon. Members have already  pointed

out, the Japanese invasion of Singapore at the end of

1941  has  taught  us a lesson - a  bitter,  sad  and

heartbreaking   lesson   indeed,   a   lesson   which

unfortunately  cost  thousands of  lives.  The  total

number of Japanese soldiers who invaded Singapore was

only 100,000, but they swept through the majority  of

the  countries  in South-east Asia  like  wild  fire;

whereas  the  total  number of  British,  Australian,

Canadian, Indian, Malay and Gurkha soldiers  totalled

about  600,000,  which was more than  six  times  the

strength of the Japanese invaders. Before the fall of

Singapore, our so-called protectors had claimed  that

Singapore  would never perish. On the  contrary,  the

fact  was  they  retreated and  surrendered,  leaving

Singapore  in  the hands of the Japanese.  The  enemy

brutally   slaughtered  thousands  of  our  citizens,

including  infants, and also raped many  women.  Many

people  suffered  from  their  tortures.  During  the

period  of the enemy's occupation of Singapore  of  3

years  and  8  months, we lived  in  great  fear  and

hardship, suffering torture and starvation.  We  were

living  practically between life and death  and  felt

more dead than alive. I am repeating this story in  a

somewhat   different  fashion  in  order  to   remind

everyone  that  from this bitter lesson  we  have  at

least  learnt  two things. Firstly, it is  imperative

that we must know how to govern ourselves and how  to

protect and safeguard ourselves. We cannot rely  upon

others,  though sometimes they may have fought  well,

maybe for themselves. Secondly, the size of the  army

is not necessarily the important factor in winning  a

war. It is the spirit of fighting, the fighting for a

cause. Moreover, it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>



the well-trained, well-organised and intelligent army

that  always  wins. The National Service  (Amendment)

Bill   not   only  provides  the  necessary  military

training,  such  as  how to use firearms,  etc.,  and

teach  us  how to defend ourselves, but  it  is  also

designed  to  train and organise our  people  into  a

tough,  well-trained  and alert  community.  It  also

gives  our  new  society confidence and self-respect.

Furthermore,  it is educational. It is the  beginning

of  a  new  era.  It is giving us  a  new  phase  and

eventually  it  will  synchronise  with  our  present

industrial  revolution. The essence of  the  Bill  is

that  it is well planned and designed. We have  often

heard  of some so-called brave people saying, "If  we

are invaded, we will fight to the last man." That  is

equivalent  to  the Chinese saying,  "Chiaw  tu  chen

cher".  But history and time have shown that fighting

to  the  last  man or "Chiaw tu chen  cher"  may  not

necessarily be the best policy when fighting  a  war,

unless  we have been well organised and well  trained

beforehand,   otherwise  we   will   be   sacrificing

ourselves,  and  fighting to the  last  man  will  be

meaningless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am all for the National Service (Amendment)

Bill.  We  are a very young nation and this  Bill  is

most essential. I hope that eventually the provisions

of  this Bill will be extended to cover the older age

groups  and those under 18 years of age on a slightly

different  pattern. We might as well start with  them

when they are young, just like the boy scouts or girl

guides.  We may call them "young Guards". Our  "young

Guards"  will  be  entirely different  from  Hitler's

trained youths in Europe when he made use of them  to

invade  other countries. Ours will be different  from

the  Red Guards. Our youths should be trained in such

a  way that everyone must have a concept of his  duty

and  responsibility  to  his  country.  He  must   be

intelligent  and know how to fight for  his  country,

and  he must always be in a state of preparedness and

alertness.  The  old Chinese saying that  "Good  boys

should  never  be  soldiers" is  entirely  wrong.  It

should be discarded completely in the 20th century.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another saying "i tai Pu lu i tai" which

means  that  the  next generation is worse  than  the

previous one. This is also a fallacy because  in  our

well-planned  and  well-trained  society,  the  newer

generation must always be better than the old one.



<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Sir,  I support the National Service (Amendment) Bill

which has been introduced by the Minister of State of

Defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As national service is vitally important to an

independent  and  sovereign State like  Singapore,  I

would remind parents and youths, who are required  to

undergo  national  service, to be  on  guard  against

misleading   propaganda   from   subversive   Barisan

Sosialis  elements  and  others  who  owe  a  divided

loyalty to the country in their own interest  and  in

the interest of foreign countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be proud to accept our responsibilities as

loyal  citizens in the interest of peace,  prosperity

and  well-being  of  our  independent  and  sovereign

Singapore. We should not constantly depend on others.

The object of national service is not to invade other

countries,  but it is solely for our defence  against

foreign countries and quell internal disorders caused

by people who do not owe their loyalty to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly support this Bill. As hon. Members

and  the citizens of Singapore are aware, many things

have  taken  place since we achieved independence  -

racial  disturbances, troubles caused by  undesirable

elements,  and  so on. For this reason,  I  urge  all

youths  to  take  up national service  as  loyal  and

responsible  citizens  of independent  and  sovereign

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Sir, if this National

Service (Amendment) Bill were to have been brought up

in  this  House  some ten years ago,  of  course,  my

colleagues  and I would have condemned  it  bitterly.

But  the position now is entirely different from that

of  the  old  colonial days when we, as nationalists,

refused to accept national service under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1222</b></font><br><br>



the  colonial regime, because we felt that  under  no

circumstances  should we serve any  foreign  colonial

master.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>4.07 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, today Singapore is an independent Republic

accepted  by  more  than 110 nations  in  the  United

Nations. Today, we are the sons of the soil  of  this

country;  we  are the masters; we are the  owners  of

this  country. All the prosperity and  all  the  good

things of life that we enjoy at the moment must never

be  given away. If we want to keep all these  things,

we must have efficient security measures in the sense

that every citizen must be well trained physically in

the handling of weapons and must cultivate a sense of

national  consciousness, civic-mindedness and  social

obligations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when this amendment Bill is passed, the youths

will be brought into the services. They will no doubt

be instilled with the spirit of comradeship, loyalty,

discipline and a love of their nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, national service is a patriotic duty. No one

in  his right mind will be against it except the - if

I  may be permitted to use this word - "traitors"  to

the  nation. The Barisan Sosialis and racialists  who

owe  their  loyalty  to other countries  will  oppose

national service. As many of my colleagues have  said

in  this  House, the Barisan Sosialis will carry  out

their  campaign  against this Bill.  Sir,  they  have

already  started  to  do this in  its  Chinese  Party

organ,  the No. 219th issue dated 5th March, 1967.  I

consider  this  an  act  of  high  treason  and   the

Government should take immediate action to smack them

down!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment Bill was well received by the

people  in its First Reading on the 27th of February,

1967, because the masses understand the importance of

having our own forces to look after our security  and

the well-being of this country. We cannot rely on so-called  help from our neighbour. We can remember  how

we  have been taught a severe lesson and given bitter

treatment  by  foreign troops during the disturbances

in 1964. It is still fresh in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>



my  mind  and  in  the minds of  all  the  people  of

Singapore.  I have grounds to substantiate  the  fact

that  the people are with the P.A.P. Government.  For

instance, we launched a campaign for our citizens  to

join the People's Defence Force and the response  was

extremely good. They understand and realise what  the

Government  is  doing  and what they  themselves  are

serving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is gratifying to know that the Minister has

recognised the important part played by the Vigilante

Corps in maintaining the peace and well-being of  our

State,  and  its  inclusion into this  Bill  is  very

encouraging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am a little disturbed over the terms of

punishment in the Bill. To my mind, this Bill  is  of

paramount importance to the security and survival  of

the  Republic  and,  as such, the punishment  of  six

months'  imprisonment and $2,000 fine is too lenient,

because  we  know that we are not dealing with  loyal

citizens but with traitors of the State. Sir, when we

deal with them, we must deal with them hard!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as many of my colleagues said in this House

yesterday and today, we are a very peaceful and happy

population. We do not want to build a big army  which

may  disturb  or scare our neighbour.  But  I  cannot

agree with some of my colleagues who have stated that

we  should  have  50 per cent conscription.  I  fully

agree, however, that we must take joint steps so that

our neighbour will not be disturbed by our actions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not enough for 49 out of the 51 Members

of  this  House  just simply to pass  this  amendment

Bill, but it is the duty of Members of Parliament and

leaders  of  communities to drive home to the  people

the  importance  and value of the  implementation  of

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to endorse my wholehearted support of

this National Service (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, although the whole world is singing  of

peace,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>



the  establishment  of a military power  and  regular

forces  is  still necessary so that it is  even  more

important  for citizens to undergo military training.

As Singapore is an independent sovereign Republic, we

must, like most small nations in the world, have some

form  of military organisation in our midst.  As  our

island is of strategic importance in South-east Asia,

we  cannot  afford  to rely on  our  allies  for  our

security all the time. The strength of our country is

insignificant   when  compared  with   the   military

strength of the world powers even if we mobilise  our

whole  population. In any case, it is  better  to  be

armed  than  to be completely unarmed and  be  caught

unawares.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From an economic point of view, Mr Speaker, we are

unable  to  raise  a  very big regular  armed  force.

Neither have we the military strength to do so.  But,

strategically speaking, we must try to  mobilise  our

people  to  do part-time or other forms  of  military

training,  and the National Service (Amendment)  Bill

will provide this opportunity to do so. We shall then

seize  the  opportunity to make use of our youths  in

military  training over a short period and  to  train

them  to accept a disciplined way of life. They  will

be  trained  in the use of arms and, when  necessary,

they will be mobilised and called up for service.  So

our  youths  owe a duty to society to  join  national

service and they will not, by so doing, increase  the

burden  on the country. On the other hand, they  will

lend  military  significance to the  defence  of  our

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, after some form of military

training,   the  youths  of  our  country   will   be

discharged  and revert back to their  jobs  and  take

part  in  productive activities. After such  military

training,  which is very useful, our youths  will  be

trained to become more useful citizens. They will  be

more productive because they are disciplined and that

will  be of benefit to society. Youths under the  age

of   21   constitute  a  great  percentage   of   our

population, and they must respond to the call of  the

nation.  If  we can give proper military training  to

them,  then in time of necessity they will be  called

up into the regular armed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>



forces  or be placed in reserve, and because  of  the

special  training that they have received, they  will

also  be better able to serve society in the economic

field  by  raising their productivity. All those  who

are in the age groups liable to be called up will  be

given ample opportunity to receive military training,

and  it  is  a  good  chance for them  to  train  and

strengthen  themselves. They will be able to  improve

their  health and become more alert, thereby becoming

better  youths. So national service will be  used  to

train our people, and our youth particularly, into  a

disciplined  force.  They will forever  be  ready  to

respond to the call of the nation. Furthermore,  they

can give even greater impetus to economic development

and industrialisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Singapore is a multi-racial society.

If  we want security, we must be able to see that the

various  races  live in peace. To  maintain  law  and

order,  we  must  ensure that the  various  races  be

tolerant  with  one  another and not  interfere  with

their respective ways of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the implementation of this Bill, all young

people  of  various races and from various  walks  of

life  will be receiving similar military training  in

the  same surroundings. They will be living the  same

life  in  the  army or in the national service  camp.

They  will be receiving disciplinary training and  be

inculcated  with the sense of national  consciousness

and of social responsibility so that they will become

better  citizens in future. If all our citizens  have

national  consciousness and a great sense  of  social

responsibility,  then we will be certain  that  there

will be no more trouble in a multi-racial society  in

future,  and  the development of our nation  will  be

carried  out  more  effectively and  efficiently.  We

shall  be  able to unite and withstand  any  possible

foreign  aggression instead of having  a  feeling  of

helplessness and despair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we must not stress too much on the

military aspects of the training. We must, apart from

military   training,  pay  some  attention   to   the

cultivation  of a good physique and good  health  and

strong character in our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>



people, so that they will become a live force in  our

nation.  It  is  not  necessary  that  we  must  have

soldiers in our country. What we want are persons who

have national consciousness and some form of military

training and knowledge. The young people must be made

to  realise  how they can behave properly in  society

and  to discharge their social obligations and  their

duties  as  citizens. Therefore, they must always  be

prepared  for any form of call-up, and they must  all

stand  on  their own feet and take part  in  economic

activities.  In this way, they will  be  able  to  do

several things at the same time. They can help in the

economic development and defence of our nation and in

the  maintenance of social order as  well.  From  all

aspects, we can see that national service is of great

benefit   to  our  society  after  we  have  achieved

independence.  I  therefore  support   the   National

Service  (Amendment) Bill and I appeal to all  people

in  Singapore,  particularly those  youths  who  fall

within  the age group and who are liable to be called

up,  to  respond  to the call of the  nation  and  to

support the implementation of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I repeat once more - I support the

Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  sure  the  question of the  necessity  of  having

national  service is on the lips of a lot of  parents

and  a  source of malicious propaganda by the enemies

within the Republic. We in Singapore are now enjoying

a  period of peace and relative prosperity, and it is

the duty of our citizens to see to it that this state

of  well-being is ensured not only for themselves but

also for their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must we, as a nation, depend on the protective

shade  given of by the defensive umbrella of a  major

power'?  Are  we  going to be militarily  weak  or  a

submissive  nation,  or are we  going  to  build  our

muscles? Every citizen must realise by now that Great

Britain  will not be able to look after our  military

needs  forever. The introduction of national  service

is,  therefore, a very wise and timely  move,  as  it

will stimulate our citizens to wake up and value this

land of ours as their motherland. They should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1227</b></font><br><br>



be  proud  that  their  teenage  sons  are  going  to

spearhead a new generation of Singaporeans  who  will

know how to protect and, if necessary, defend what is

rightly theirs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am not particularly happy to see the

division  of national service into four kinds,  as  I

feel   our  young  citizens  should  be  given  equal

treatment. They should all undergo the same  form  of

service,  namely, military training -  part-time  for

two  years. There is nothing like a spell of military

training  and discipline to build up a new generation

of  tough, self-respecting and dedicated citizens. By

putting  all  of  them through  the  same  mill  will

subject  all  the  races to the same environment,  so

that  there  will  be  a  togetherness  not  only  in

military training but also in the love of the nation,

a  better understanding of social obligation, and the

development of civic-mindedness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-time and identical military training for the

draftees for the first two years will thus allow them

to  complete their schooling or to go and  find  jobs

for  themselves. In this way, the Government will not

be  obliged  to guarantee jobs to a small section  of

our national servicemen. My own feeling is that if we

are going to introduce national service, we should go

all out and put every one of our young men through  a

period  of military training. I know we may not  have

enough facilities at the moment, but we should try to

rectify this. Military instructors should be employed

from  the United Kingdom or elsewhere, and army camps

should  be  constructed to meet the  demands  of  the

thousands of draftees per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no shortcut to perfection, and it is by

toil,  sweat  and  tears that we can  develop  a  new

generation of loyal citizens, a generation  who  will

come  to appreciate what is being done today  by  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not suggesting that our

national  service should stop at a  stage  after  two

years  of part-time military training. It should  not

be  so.  Once  our young men have undergone  military

training, they should go on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>



reserve   list  and  carry  on  with  their  national

service,  again on a part-time basis, in  either  the

People's Defence Force, the Special Constabulary,  or

the Vigilante Corps, until they reach the age of 40.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, may I make a plea on behalf of

the  Vigilante Corps? I feel that the members of this

Corps should be paid an allowance whenever they go on

duty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  ever  since 9th  August,  1965,  when

Singapore  proclaimed its independence to the  world,

the  three  important  problems confronting  it  have

been:  (1)  how to stabilise our political situation;

(2)  how  to  develop our economy;  and  (3)  how  to

strengthen  our  national  defence.  The  first   two

problems  have been solved in the short time  of  one

year  by the far-sighted leadership of the Government

and   with  the  backing  of  the  people.  We   have

accomplished  much during this short  period  of  one

year.  Now  that we have achieved this,  how  are  we

going to protect the fruits of our achievements? That

is  why  the  Minister of Defence has to  table  this

National   Service  (Amendment)   Bill   which   will

consolidate  our  achievements  and  strengthen   our

national  defence. Everyone is aware that  externally

and  internally there are two kinds of people who  do

not like to see Singapore succeed. The first class of

people are the racial extremists. They do not like to

see  the success of a multi-racial society. They like

to  impose their will upon others. They are  bent  on

deceiving the people. The second class of enemies are

the  open-front organisations of the Communists. They

fear  that  our success and happiness will  not  help

them   to   incite  the  people  to   overthrow   our

Government.  Because of the existence  of  these  two

kinds of people, we find it necessary to seek a  more

stable  political  situation, and  further,  to  seek

greater  security for our nation, and  to  strengthen

the  nation's defences so that the lives and property

of our people may be protected and safeguarded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore of today is not

like what it was when it was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1229</b></font><br><br>



under British colonialism. The Singapore of today  is

a Singapore which belongs to all the people here. The

people must not be indifferent, self-centred and self-seeking. They must organise themselves to look  after

their  own  interest. There is a Chinese saying  that

the  existence of a nation rests on the shoulders  of

the  people. It is the duty of everybody to see  that

the nation survives. That is why those people who are

liable to be called up must take this opportunity  to

do  their  part. Under the leadership of  the  P.A.P.

Government,  Singapore has won independence  and  has

enhanced its position internationally. It is  playing

a  more  important  role  in world  politics.  It  is

occupying a very important and strategic position  in

South-east Asia. In view of this, we must set up  our

own  defence system. We must not continue to rely  on

foreign troops to safeguard our country. We must,  as

a  Republic  and as a people, express our loyalty  to

the nation and give our lives to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not forget that during the Second World

War,  the  Japanese swept into Malaya and there  were

two disturbances in 1964. These disastrous historical

lessons have taught us that it is not wise to rely on

other  people's troops. We would be merely humiliated

and  maltreated by other people. Even our very  lives

and property will not be safeguarded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in this Republic are enjoying security,

the  educational facilities, housing and other public

amenities which are being provided by the Government.

They  must meet their obligation to protect  whatever

they are enjoying at present, and to ensure that  the

nation  will  not be invaded by others. The  National

Service (Amendment) Bill is only a further measure to

prepare our young people to be rugged, brave,  imbued

with  self-respect,  and well  equipped  with  modern

weapons  and  dedicated  to  the  protection  of  our

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues have already said that national

service   is  not  a  unique  thing.  Many   advanced

countries also have national service. However, I hope

the  Minister will take note of one point;  that  is,

that those people who are in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1230</b></font><br><br>



possession  of the blue identity cards and  who  fall

within  this  age  group, if they have  acquired  the

necessary  qualifications  for  citizenship  and  are

desirous of becoming Singapore citizens, should  also

be  called  up to take up the national service.  This

will show whether they are loyal to our nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I wish to express my full-hearted support

for this Bill.



<br><br>4.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I would like to air my  views  on  the

National Service (Amendment) Bill. This Bill is  very

important  to the defence of our country.  Since  9th

August,  1965,  Singapore  has  been  an  independent

sovereign country. Soon after that, Singapore  joined

the  United  Nations and ranks equally with  all  the

other  nations  in the world. Only a  minority  group

amongst our people do not recognise the fact  of  our

independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Singapore has become an independent

sovereign  country, and because of  this  status  the

people  of Singapore have become the masters of  this

place.  They have entered a new phase in the  history

of  Singapore.  To the people of Singapore  who  once

lived under colonial rule, independence, liberty  and

sovereignty  are precious. They have to  cherish  and

protect them. In order to achieve this, we must first

protect  the  lives of the people; secondly,  protect

the  integrity of the country; and, thirdly, maintain

the  sovereignty of the country. In order to  achieve

these  three  objectives, we must  at  least  have  a

national force capable of defending ourselves against

any  foreign invasion or internal subversion. If  our

defence  system has to depend on other countries  and

not  on our own strength, then the sovereignty of our

country  would,  of  course,  be  in  the  hands   of

foreigners. We would then enjoy independence in  name

only,  and  the  fate  of the country  will  be  very

precarious indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this, soon after our independence our

country  announced a kind of national service  scheme

to enable our people to serve voluntarily in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>



People's  Defence Force. There has been keen response

to  this  call from people in all walks of  life.  As

citizens of the independent Republic of Singapore, we

have  the  duty to respond to the call to  serve  the

country.  Our Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries

and Members of Parliament have set a good example  to

the  people  by  joining the volunteer  forces.  Last

year,  when our Members of Parliament paraded through

the  streets on National Day, they were applauded  by

the  people  who  watched the  parade.  This  was  an

encouraging sight to all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Service (Amendment) Bill is in keeping

with  the interest of our country, and I am  sure  it

will  receive  warm  support  from  all  citizens  of

Singapore. It will afford an opportunity to patriotic

youths  to serve the country. They will be inculcated

with a sense of discipline, of national consciousness

and  patriotism. It will also enable  our  people  to

take  up  arms in the defence of our country  and  to

maintain  a  strong defence force  to  safeguard  the

country  and train a rugged and closely-knit  society

which will endure forever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Defence has announced in this House that soon the Government will enrol youths of a stipulated age group to serve full-time for two years, and also to serve 12 years part-time in the Vigilante Corps, the Police Force and the People's Defence Force. From his statement, we can see that

the  Government has also taken into consideration the

interests  of  those  who have  been  called  up  for

service.  For  instance, to all those who  have  been

affected  by the call-up, after two years of training

the  Government will guarantee that they will be able

to  return  to  their jobs in Government departments,

statutory boards and private firms. Part-time service

will  only  be  undertaken in their  spare  time  and

during  the  week-ends. The Bill also  provides  that

employers  should give every facility to  youths  who

have  been  called  up  so  that  they  will  not  be

inconvenienced. As for those youths studying  abroad,

their  call-up will be deferred. All those called  up

will not suffer any disadvantage.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1232</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like the Minister to consider

certain  points.  National service should  not  cause

poor youths, who are good in their studies or who are

seeking  to  further  their studies,  to  lose  their

opportunity. At the same time, it should not  provide

any  opportunity  for  the  rich  to  evade  national

service. We know that the Government will select  ten

per cent - the elite - from the people who are called

up  to serve in the regular army. This age group will

coincide  with the age for schooling and some  youths

will  have to depend on scholarships and other  forms

of  financial  aid in order to carry  on  with  their

higher  studies.  If such youths  were  selected  for

national  service, they would lose their  opportunity

and  the means available to them for further studies.

Thus this may lead to a shortage of personnel in some

fields.  On  the  other  hand,  students  from   rich

families can afford to and may want to study  abroad.

They  may  get deferment in call-up, and  after  some

time,  when they have grown up beyond the  age  limit

stipulated  by  the  law, they will  escape  national

service.  So  I  would  like  the  Minister  to   pay

attention to this and I hope that he will see  to  it

that the youths are well advised to register for this

national service. I appeal to them to respond to this

call.



<br><br>4.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the National Service  (Amendment)

Bill  has been introduced into this House. This  goes

to  show that the Government of Singapore is  a  very

responsible  and  good one. Under  the  guidance  and

through  the efforts of the Minister of Defence,  the

Bill  has been introduced in time. Generally,  it  is

true  with all countries that irrespective  of  their

different conditions they have worries of some  sort.

Especially  in the middle of the 20th century,  there

have   been   great  policy  changes  and   political

repercussions throughout the world. If  such  radical

changes  in national policy were in the hands  of  an

irresponsible  government, the people will  lose  the

safeguards to their lives and property,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1233</b></font><br><br>



and  the  security  of  the  country  will  also   be

endangered. Our country will be affected if there are

any  political  changes  and repercussions  in  other

countries.  Politics is a dynamic phenomenon.  So  if

anything   were  to  happen,  then  a  peaceful   and

prosperous country might overnight become a conquered

country  living under the rule of another. This  will

chill  one's  bones  and it is  really  something  we

should watch out against.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours is a newly independent emergent country. We

have mobilised all our people and have gone through a

long  period  of  struggle  to  achieve  our  present

independent  status. The People's  Action  Party  has

acquired independence for the people of Singapore.  I

believe  it  has lived up to the aspirations  of  the

people. It has implemented various measures for their

benefit,  brought  about freedom  and  equality,  and

provided  what the people want. It is the first  time

in the history of Singapore that the people have such

a  capable, strong and efficient government with such

verve and spirit and achievements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people may say that in a democratic country,

the  demands  of the people are more  than  those  in

other countries. Therefore, the facilities of such  a

country  must  be more advanced and progressive  than

those provided by the other countries. There are many

countries  which  call  themselves  democratic,   but

because  of  the emptiness of the leadership  who  is

devoid  of  capacity  and efficiency  and  the  right

attitude,  such  countries, after a long  rule  under

such  leadership, have fallen into  a  mess  and  the

people  are  in dire poverty and struggling  in  deep

waters and have become completely disillusioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must give credit to our Minister of Defence who

has  drafted  this far-sighted scheme in  time  which

will  provide an opportunity for our youth to receive

training and so put our country always in a state  of

preparedness.  The National Service (Amendment)  Bill

is  not what the Barisan Sosialis think. It is not  a

means  to make cannon fodder or running dogs  of  our

people.  Our  society  and our  political  entity  is

formed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>



by  the  will  and  energy of our people  and  is  an

expression  of the idealism and will of  our  people.

Every citizen has a say in the administration of  the

Government.  Yet  there are some people  who  disdain

government  policies and have caused difficulties  to

the  society and the Government. But if the  policies

are  carried out with full conviction and  force  for

the  good of the country, the Government will be able

to  overcome all difficulties. The force of a  united

people  is like running water which cannot be stopped

by the meagre strength of the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government will not treat the people just like

sheep.  If  it  has  good policies and  an  efficient

administration, the people will certainly support  it

until  success  is achieved. We should all  recognise

that  the  object  of  the Government's  policies  is

directed at the interests and welfare of the  people.

The  debate  today on this Bill could  actually  have

been   dispensed  with  as  the  people   have   full

confidence  in this government. Why do we now  debate

it? In actual fact, the Minister could have set up  a

committee  to  implement  it.  But  because  we   arc

democratic, we must go through the democratic process

in  respect of every policy and measure affecting the

people,  and  so we have to spend some time  studying

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill is based on the interest of all the

people.  There are various opinions existing  in  our

country.  Some people may think that though  national

service  is  very  good,  it  is  better  that  other

children  should be called up and that their children

must  be  exempted.  That  is  not  practicable.  The

proposition advanced by the Barisan Sosialis  is  not

to  want any national service at all. They incite the

people  against it and would rather see  the  country

subject  to others. The Government has the means  and

capacity  to  take strong measures  to  expose  these

destructive elements. In order to practise  democracy

and efficient government, we should afford the people

an  opportunity  for discussion. This,  at  the  same

time, will see the government through any crisis.  We

believe we can achieve this in our country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill has also something to do with the other

aspects of our lives and aims, because it will ensure

that   the  achievements  in  our  culture,  economy,

education,  health and construction can  survive  and

endure.  We  are  living not only in  a  multi-racial

society but also in a society where there is equality

of  opportunities and services, including equality of

religion, economy and education. The people no  doubt

can  have  many wants and opinions. For instance,  we

want  better  social services, houses, and  a  higher

level  of education. We want to develop industrially;

we  want better health amenities and a better  living

standard,  etc.  All  this our  Government  has  been

trying  to achieve for the people. Together with  the

concerted effort of the people, it has been  able  to

overcome difficulties and carry out various plans and

measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other than the daily problem of livelihood, there

are other problems. For instance, whenever there is a

fire or a flood in any area, the Government, together

with   civic   organisations,  is  able  to   provide

immediate relief to the people affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that we have good living conditions. We

should  not  allow  our paradise  to  be  invaded  by

anybody.  We  must also look after the interests  and

survival  of the country and not just after  our  own

self-interests. We must not feel complacent  for  the

present  and ignore to watch out for any  pitfall  in

the  future.  The  National Service (Amendment)  Bill

will  create  a grand and open path for us  to  tread

upon, a path which will lead to a better future. This

Bill will better equip the people to face the present

and the future so that it will bring about a sense of

confidence  in  survival and  a  new  spirit  to  our

people,  and  we can all push out our chests  in  the

Singapore  of  the 20th century and  live  and  march

towards  a  better future with courage and  hope  and

confidence.  The introduction of this  Bill  at  this

juncture  is  most appropriate. Sir, I  support  this

Bill.

<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, almost 26 years ago when

the   British  capitulated  to  Japanese  troops   in

Singapore, Singaporeans of our generation learned  of

what  can  happen  to a people in  a  country  caught

unprepared  and unaware of the external possibilities

in  politics  and  in war. By an  ironical  twist  of

history,  the people of Singapore were to be reminded

of  this  same possibility less than three years  ago

when riots took place in Singapore, but this time  an

internal problem made possible and caused by external

circumstances. In between this period,  we  have  had

armed   Communist  insurrections,  Communist-inspired

violence  and unrest engineered by local  stooges  of

foreign manipulators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weapons of destruction now at the disposal of

several  nations  are  too  terrifying  if  not   too

advanced for small nations like ourselves, regardless

of  whether they are developed or under-developed, to

join  the  arms  race. Today, jet fighters  and  jet-fighter bombers are said to be inadequate for the new

situation and scope of total war. Singapore alone  in

any case cannot defend itself from nuclear attack. Be

that  as it may, we are living in an era when peoples

and  States  are faced with newer types of aggression

and   foreign   intervention.   For   some   nations,

international   subversion   has   today   become   a

convenient    substitute   for   outright    external

aggression.  It is in this context that  we  see  the

introduction of national service in the  new  setting

of our independent and sovereign status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However much our adversaries - and here I refer to

the Communists and their front organisations like the

Barisan  Sosialis  - might attack  national  service,

they know that this time we mean to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>



be prepared against any possible emergency they might

raise.  With  the  passing of  the  National  Service

(Amendment) Bill, we are witnessing the opening of  a

new  chapter in our history. We are moving into a new

era  of  new possibilities and we should be alert  to

the  new dangers in the region and further afield  in

the   world.  There  are,  on  the  other  hand,  the

possibilities of new alignments and new alliances  as

we  pursue  our  policy of non-alignment  and  as  we

cultivate for ourselves the maximum number of friends

in  peace  and  in  war.  There  is  an  air  of  new

consciousness among the people of Singapore. There is

a  new  spirit of multi-racialism which is unique  in

this  part of the world. This has been made  possible

by  our  internal policies which deliberately try  to

remove  contradictions among the various  linguistic,

cultural,  religious and racial groups.  Even  today,

our  armed  forces  have, as its  head,  a  Eurasian.

Brigadier Campbell is no more Chinese than  I  am  an

Eskimo.  But he is there. That is the new  spirit  we

have  started and that is the new spirit  which  will

radiate  in  the years ahead with our people.  I  can

mention  many other cases in various other Government

Ministries and departments where, despite the Chinese

majority in our Republic, people have come up on  the

basis of merit. But I need not go into this now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National service in our Republic will serve as a

catalyst  in  building  a nation  out  of  our  young

people.  It will teach our people that it is possible

to  share a common destiny, different and diverse  as

we  are  racially  and in other respects.  It  is  an

opportunity  to share common experiences and  thereby

foster  the  feeling of living as one people  in  one

Singapore community. It is an augury for the  greater

success  of our policy of multi-racialism in a  world

filled  with  racial intolerance, racial bigotry  and

racial discrimination.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support the Bill in principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the duty of every citizen to ensure the

security  of his country and I am happy to note  that

the Government is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>



introducing   national  registration   to   give   an

opportunity  to  all  the  citizens  to  serve  their

country in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Minister pointed out yesterday, we all

know that it is quite difficult to defend our country

without external aid in case of a big-scale war,  but

we  cannot have it as an excuse for not developing  a

defence force and I welcome the idea of regional  co-operation in defence, as suggested by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I went through the pamphlet entitled "National

Service  and You". On page 2 of the booklet,  mention

is  made  about the allowances payable to  those  who

take  part  in  parades and it is  also  stated  that

members  of the Vigilante Corps are not paid anything

for  taking part in national service. Sir, I  do  not

agree  on this point. It may be true that members  of

the  Vigilante  Corps  have  their  training  in  the

vicinity of their homes. I think allowances are  paid

to  national  service  men to cover  not  only  their

transport   expenses  but  also  to  meet  incidental

expenses such as refreshments and laundry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to request the Minister to

consider  paying  an  allowance  to  members  of  the

Vigilante Corps also. The quantum may not necessarily

be  equal to that paid to other branches of' national

service.



<br><br>5.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  fully  support  the  National Service  (Amendment)

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Bill as a whole, every one can

understand that it is meant to defend our territorial

integrity  and  sovereignty against any  invasion  or

subversion. All independent countries, whether big or

small,  know that the successful defence of a country

is   the  means  of  preserving  their  independence.

Service  to  the country is not only a glorious  task

but  it is also a great contribution by a citizen  to

his country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is a newly independent country and

our   citizens   have   a  duty   to   shoulder   the

responsibility of defence of our country.  Since  the

history of man,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>



in  whatever  situation,  place  and  development  of

society,  the  duty  to  protect  one's  country   is

absolute.  This  is true in all cases,  be  it  in  a

capitalist   country   or  a   dictatorial   country.

Singapore has struggled to get rid of colonialism  at

great  sacrifice  and  in the end  we  have  achieved

independence. Independence, sovereignty  and  "master

of  ourselves" mean that we have to decide our future

for  ourselves.  This also implies that  we  have  to

manage our own defence problems. Therefore, following

the  independence of Singapore, the defence  of  this

country will naturally fall upon the shoulders of all

our  citizens.  We cannot deny that  Singapore  is  a

small  country with very limited economic  resources.

Therefore, it is quite a problem to build up a  large

standing army in the economic sense. But we  have  to

train  and  prepare our citizens in military  affairs

and  some  of them in military training so that  they

can take up arms in the defence of their country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows that the National Service

(Amendment)  Bill is very necessary  at  the  present

juncture.   Ever  since  the  last  time   when   the

Government  called  upon  the  people  to  join   the

Vigilante  Corps, the people have duly  responded  by

also joining the People's Defence Force. This goes to

show  that they have a clear understanding  of  their

duty  to  the country. I am confident that they  will

also  respond well to this call to serve the  nation.

We  cannot depend on those who only want to enjoy the

benefits and rights given by the country hut who  are

not  willing  to shoulder their responsibilities  and

carry   out  their  obligations.  So  this  Bill   is

necessary  to ensure the survival of our country  and

it is the duty of every citizen to ensure this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that in the implementation of the call-up,

we will pay attention to the fact that it will not be

carried   out  to  the  detriment  of  our   economy.

According to the Bill, all youths in the age group of

eighteen will be called up. Some of these youths  are

at  an  age when they are about to enter Universities

after  leaving higher secondary schools. I feel  that

higher education is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>



important  to  the youths as well as to the  country.

Therefore,  we must provide some means  of  resolving

the problems of those youths who are attending higher

education.   For  instance,  in  the  University   of

Singapore  and Nanyang University, there are  several

periods of long vacation in a year and perhaps we can

make use of these periods to call them up for intense

military  training - say, for a total of  three  or

four  months of the vacation periods. The  Government

has already allotted four recruiting centres. I think

they  are not enough, and I suggest that the  Defence

Ministry   should  consider  an  increase.   If   the

community  centres in the various constituencies  can

be  made  available, it will be most ideal.  It  will

then  be  convenient to most of the called-up youths.

Also   the  community  leaders  living  around  these

community  centres  can also come  out  to  help  and

simplify matters.



<br><br>5.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I would like to say something  on  the

National Service (Amendment) Bill. I support  it.  We

know that it is very meaningful as well as important.

But some people do not want to join national service.

Do  they  still believe in the old saying  that  good

boys  should not become soldiers? I will  go  a  step

further  and  say  that women  should  also  take  up

national  service because they are also part  of  our

population.  They  should  also  shoulder  the   same

responsibility as men, to be soldiers and defend  our

country.  We should not forget that this old  Chinese

saying,  that  good boys should not become  soldiers,

was  evolved when soldiers were meant to protect  the

interests  of  the emperors and not the interests  of

the   country.  Therefore,  the  people   then   were

unwilling to become soldiers. That is the reason that

brought  about this saying. But now the situation  is

different. In China today the people glorify the fact

that  they can become soldiers. So it seems  that  at

present  China  is  a country where  everybody  is  a

soldier. In the Middle East countries such as Israel,

every man and every woman is a soldier.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to lend my support to the National

Service (Amendment) Bill. I stress the point that not

only men but also women should join national service.

This  is  not  with  the intention  to  invade  other

territories  or to rob others of their property.  No.

This is only in keeping with our national policy.  We

have  to  have  our  own national  defence  force  to

maintain  our  internal  security  and  also  prevent

foreign  aggression, and we will maintain  a  neutral

position  by making as many friends as possible  with

other   countries.   It  is  very   significant   and

meaningful that we have this national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this Bill.



<br><br>5.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chor Yeok Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chor Yeok Eng (Bukit Timah):</b> (In Mandarin): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  living  in an independent  democratic

country   such   as   ours,  we   know   that   every

conscientious citizen should love his country. It  is

especially true with a country which has achieved its

independence at the sacrifice of much blood and sweat

of its people. Therefore, the people should value the

fruits  of independence more. On the other  hand,  we

should   also  discuss  the  prerequisites   or   the

attributes   of   a   State.  The  prerequisites   or

attributes  of  a  State  are  firstly,  the  people,

secondly,  territory, and thirdly, sovereignty.  With

these three prerequisites a State can he founded; not

otherwise.  These  are the three prerequisites  of  a

State.  If  we hope to protect them, we as  a  people

have  to  form  our political parties  from  which  a

government  will be formed which will set up  various

institutions  dealing  with administration,  defence,

foreign  affairs,  finance,  etc.,  with  a  view  to

protecting  the lives and property of the people,  to

maintain  law  and  order,  to  preserve  territorial

integrity, and to protect its sovereignty against any

invasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve this grand ideal in the present

situation   which   exists  in   our   country,   the

introduction of the National Service (Amendment) Bill

in  this House is most appropriate and timely.  As  a

representative  of  the people  in  this  society  of

parliamentary democracy, it is my duty,  in  addition

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>



serving my Party, to serve the country and the people

loyally. That is my duty. And it is also my  duty  to

bring the voice of the masses into this House so that

their  desires and ambitions can be heard. This House

will  formulate laws to meet the needs of the various

sections  of the people, especially today when  there

is   no   Opposition  in  this  House.  This  unusual

phenomenon - the absence of an Opposition -  has  been

created  by  the  irresponsible Opposition  who  have

abandoned  their  duty  to the  people.  Under  these

circumstances, we have an added burden  and  a  moral

responsibility  to discharge. Unfortunately,  certain

sections  of  the  public  have  levelled  criticisms

against  us and not against those Opposition  Members

who  have abandoned their duty. This amendment  Bill,

on  the  other hand, will take all manner of pretexts

out  of  the hands of the Opposition who will try  to

make  use  of  any  opportunity to  carry  out  their

nefarious designs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to add some supplementary views. We

know  that  in  the history of man  there  have  been

ideas,  slogans or certain fancies which  are  rather

rich  in  emotional content and which,  if  swallowed

wholesale,  may cause difficulties and  troubles.  We

have  seen certain events in the history of man which

have  been  brought about by such  factors.  We  also

realise that all men must have worries of some  sort.

They  must have some consideration for something they

do.  The  time  is  appropriate  for  us  to  prepare

ourselves for a rainy day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a representative of our honest people, I have

the  duty  to give a very frank and plain explanation

to  the  people to enable them to prepare  themselves

for the sacred task of national defence. I would like

to  make  some propositions for the consideration  of

this House:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) During the call-up period of registration for

national service, there may he some families with two

or  three  members  who are poor.  In  such  a  case,

perhaps  we  may  consider relaxing certain  measures

such  as  deferment of call-up. We should  give  more

sympathetic consideration to such cases.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Students who are attending universities,

colleges,  or secondary schools -- we can  give  them

certain consideration to enable them to continue with

their studies and defer their call-up until they have

completed  their  studies. In  other  words,  we  may

perhaps postpone their call-up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) I would also appeal to employers to co-operate

with  those  youths who are called up and  to  accord

them  some facilities and convenience, otherwise such

youths  may  meet with certain difficulties.  I  hope

that employers are judicious and patriotic and may be

able  to accord these facilities and co-operation.  I

appeal  to  them  earnestly  to  co-operate  in  this

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I express my support for the National

Service (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Minister of Defence may be happy to

hear   that  there  are  so  many  unanimous   voices

supporting  the Bill. It seems that there is  general

agreement  on this Bill. Everybody agrees  that,  for

the  sake  of  national defence, every  conscientious

citizen  should  have  the  duty  and  obligation  to

support  this  Bill and take up national  service  to

defend his country. As ours is an independent country - for that matter, a very small one - we cannot  rely

on foreign forces to defend ourselves. This task must

devolve  on our own people. Dependence on others  for

our  defence  will  be detrimental  to  our  dignity.

National  service will give the youth an  opportunity

to  serve  the  country. Nobody  can  deny  that  the

majority  of  our people have been staying  here  for

many  generations. Many of them have been  born  here

and  have  been  brought up here, and their  fate  is

inseparably bound up and intertwined with the fate of

our country. We have a common destiny. There are some

people  who  are citizens of Singapore, their  hearts

are  not  with  Singapore, and in a  national  crisis

these  people  may perhaps want to  escape  to  other

countries. If we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>



had  to  rely on foreign forces and these  people  to

defend  ourselves,  then it would  be  to  no  avail.

National  service will provide military  training  to

the  youths  who have been called up, and  will  give

them  a  sense  of pride. This military service  will

also  make  the  parents  of  such  youths  proud  of

themselves and proud of their children, because  they

have  the  opportunity  and  the  glorious  task   of

defending  the  people and the country.  As  a  small

country,   we   have  no  intention   of   committing

aggression  against any other country. But  when  any

country intends to invade us or threaten us, we  must

have  the  means  to  see ourselves  through  such  a

situation.  We cannot tolerate others to  invade  us.

Our people are youthful, with much energy and spirit,

and  we should not stand any aggression. The national

service  we  provide  now is not  the  same  as  that

provided during the colonial regime. At that time the

people   opposed  national  service  vehemently   and

brought  about various riots and violent events,  and

many  youths  went  to China and other  countries  to

escape   serving   their  colonial  masters   through

national service. But national service today is meant

to  provide the means for the people to defend  their

own  country. Only when a country exists can a family

exist.  The country must come first. This  should  be

the  thinking  of  our people. In  order  to  make  a

country strong, we must make our people strong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the passage of this Bill, I would like to

raise a few suggestions to the Minister in charge  of

it.  When  some students are attending  colleges  and

universities or secondary schools, it is necessary to

see  to  that  their call-up will  not  impede  their

studies.  I agree to what the Parliamentary Secretary

has  said  just now, that we should make use  of  the

long   school   vacations  to  give  them   full-time

training.  As for those who join national service  of

their  own  accord, the Ministry should recruit  them

whole-heartedly without any reservation. I understand

that  when  such people wanted to join  the  People's

Defence  Force or the other services in  response  to

the   government's  call,  their  applications   were

rejected, perhaps for minor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>



physical   reasons.  But  this  would   deter   their

enthusiasm.  They wanted to join these  services  not

because   they  wanted  to  solve  their   employment

problem.  They  merely wanted to avail themselves  of

the opportunity to serve their country. So I hope the

departments  concerned will recruit as many  of  such

people  as possible who have volunteered to join  the

services  of  their own accord. Sir, I  support  this

Bill.



<br><br>6.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. A. Gonzales -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. A. Gonzales (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, over a year ago, a call was made to our

citizens  to  come  forward to  serve  in  the  armed

forces. The response was better than expected and  we

now  have  a volunteer force larger than we ever  had

before  or even dreamed of having. A large number  of

the  force is, however, made up of citizens from  the

lower  income groups who came out of their  own  free

will to serve the nation when the call was made,  and

I take off my hat to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where were the young men from well-to-do families,

the young intellectuals and those with long hair-dos?

They  were  satisfied with sitting back  and  saying,

"Well, there are enough stupid chaps willing to  join

up.  Why should I?" They were willing then to let the

stupid  chaps  do  the fighting should  the  occasion

arise  and  to protect them if trouble arose.  And  I

think they still have the same view today as they had

over a year ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National service has not come too soon. It is time

that  every citizen realized that he has  a  duty  to

ensure  the  security and well-being of his  country.

Our thinking a year ago and our thinking today is the

same.  As  a small nation, we know that it is  beyond

our   resources  to  have  a  large  standing   army.

Experience has shown us that it is pointless. What we

need  is  a  small  but tough, well  equipped,  well-trained and disciplined force imbued with the  spirit

that  this is their country and that they will defend

it  with  their lives. The plan, therefore,  to  have

full-time  military service for  a  small  number  of

people is a good one. As in the past, a larger number

will be asked to serve on a part-time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>



basis in the People's Defence Force, the Special

Constabulary  and the Vigilante Corps.  Let  us  not,

however, get the idea that by serving in the People's

Defence  Force, we will be serving in a less superior

unit  than by being a regular or serving as  a  full-time national serviceman. The greatest mistake we can

make is to belittle the part that the volunteer plays

in  the  defence of his country. He is just  as  well

trained,  although his period of training is  just  a

few  hours  a  week.  It should be appreciated  that,

after  a full day's work, he is prepared to sacrifice

a   few  hours  of  leisure  by  going  for  military

training.  It  would appear that in our eagerness  to

introduce  national service, we are forgetting  those

that are serving as volunteers. For instance, Sir, in

clause  2  (a) of the Bill, the definition of  "armed

forces" says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"armed forces" means any force constituted under

the  provisions of the Singapore Army Act, 1965,  and

includes the Peoples Defence Force constituted  under

the  provisions  of  the Peoples Defence  Force  Act,

1965;'.



<br><br>This,  I take it, covers those at present serving  as

volunteers in the Peoples Defence Force. New  section

2lA  in clause 20, however, does not appear to  cover

volunteers as regards pay or leave, but only those in

the  national service reserve. The reason,  I  think,

Sir,  is  the fact that several volunteers have  lost

their  jobs for serving their country, and  the  more

fortunate  are  paid for attending parades.  I  would

like  the Minister's assurance that this new  section

2lA  covers the volunteers now serving in the Peoples

Defence Force. If it does not, all that we are trying

to  build up will be in vain. Those who have come  of

their own free will to serve the nation are not  even

protected by law and they will, therefore, lose faith

in the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other things which we have to guard

against,  and  that is to consider one  unit  of  the

armed  forces more superior than another. By this,  I

do  not  mean  that there should not be a distinction

between  the various services. For example, the  army

or  the navy. What I mean is that there should not be

a  distinction between a regular soldier, a  national

serviceman, and a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>



volunteer  in regard to the uniform he  wears  and

the  accessories. We are endeavouring  to  have  a

closely-knit society in Singapore. Let us now take

this  opportunity, with national service, to build

up  an  army where every soldier, irrespective  of

which  unit he belongs to, can say with pride,  "I

am a member of the Singapore Army," and not, "I am

only   a   national  serviceman,"  or  "I   am   a

professional  soldier." Sir, I hope  the  Minister

will  bear this in mind whenever he is advised  to

create a distinction between the various units  in

the armed forces. I would, in concluding, say that

I fully support the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  introduction of  the  National  Service

(Amendment)  Bill is a very serious  matter  which

will  affect  the  lives of our  youths  and  will

change  the whole character of our people and  our

Republic. I support this Bill and I am proud to be

associated   with  its  introduction.   No   self-respecting  country  can  depend  or  continue  to

depend  on outside forces to protect it.  National

service  will provide an opportunity to  integrate

the  various races of our citizens into a closely-knit  society. It will bring together  our  youths

from  all  grades. Whether they are rich or  poor,

whether they come from wealthy merchants or  shop-keepers,  they will have an equal opportunity  and

play their part in the building of our nation. The

introduction  of  this Bill  is  most  significant

especially  at  a  time when the British,  through

their representatives, are urging their Government

to  consider seriously to reduce or withdraw their

security commitments in this area and in  the  Far

East.  It  is likely that in the near  future  the

British Government will hold discussions with  the

Singapore   Government   en   the   reduction   or

withdrawal of their armed forces. I am  glad  this

Bill,  which  has been introduced, will  give  cur

Minister of Defence pride in the discussions as we

will   not  be  found  wanting  in  the  will   or

determination to organise our people to defend and

to protect our own country.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1248</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is an honour to take up

national service, and to ensure that the scheme is

successful,    parents    should    give     every

encouragement  to  their  children  to   take   up

national  service. In the implementation  of  this

Bill,  I  would  urge  the  Minister  to  exercise

extreme  firmness in dealing with those who  evade

or  attempt to evade national service. But I  also

do  hope  that  the  Ministry's  staff  should  be

considerate   and   fair   where   fairness    and

consideration are merited.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

an  accepted principle throughout the  world  that

the  privilege of citizenship carries with it  the

liability to engage in military training  for  the

defence  of  the  country. It is clear  that  this

principle  does  not  need  any  elaboration.  But

before  I  go  further, I would  like  to  make  a

passing  reference to the very few of  our  people

who  consider that we are not, in fact, a free and

independent country. Logically, these  people,  if

they  possess pink identity cards, should exchange

them  for blue ones. For then they would  have  at

least  a  little  ground  to  object  to  military

training  in defence of the country.  In  fact,  I

should say they would then have no right at all to

raise their voices for they are not citizens.  But

for  those of our citizens, our able-bodied  young

men,   they  will  have  to  have  the  sense   of

responsibility    to   defend    the    democratic

institutions  upon  which  the  liberties  of  our

people depend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question may be asked, how far are we

justified  in calling upon the individual  citizen

to  make  a personal sacrifice for the benefit  of

the  State? Can we admit in any circumstances that

there  should  be compulsory national  service?  I

will  just quote a couple of examples in reply  to

them. We all do accept compulsion in taxation, for

we  look upon it as necessary and inevitable if  a

government  were  to  carry  on  its  business  of

governing  the  country. Again, we accept  without

any question the principle of compulsory insurance

of motor vehicles for very obvious



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1249</b></font><br><br>



reasons. So, when it comes to the question of  the

State's actual security and existence, no  one  in

his  right  mind should question the necessity  of

compulsory national service. It has been said that

"Civilisation is in itself an admission  that  the

interests of the individual must be subordinate to

`those  of  the community." We cannot wait  for  a

national  disaster to occur before compelling  the

citizens  to  take  their share  in  the  duty  of

defence.  If  it were so, then it  would  be  like

trying to organise a fire brigade after a fire had

actually  started. We cannot leave  democracy  and

progress   at   the  mercy  of  indifference   and

irresponsibility.  We must  realise  that  in  the

modern  world, even the best of social  conditions

can  easily  be upset in a day or two  unless  the

country  in  which they exist is  able  to  defend

itself.  Those of you who have studied the history

of  South  America know that in ancient  Peru  the

peonle  had  realised the condition of  socialism.

But  we know how easily a few armed invaders under

the  Spanish  conquerors over-ran the country  and

over-threw their socialism at a touch.  Mind  you,

the  Peruvians  outnumbered the  Spaniards  by  at

least  a  thousand to one, but the Spaniards  were

armed  and  know how to use their arms, while  the

Peruvians had no arms to speak about, or  at  best

they  merely had an army in name. The fate of  the

Peruvians  suffices to show that  even  a  perfect

social  and  industrial system, if not efficiently

organised and defended, may go down easily  before

an armed and trained invader.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, I can just imagine that a very small

minority  of  our people will make a hue  and  cry

against  national  service,  saying  that  it   is

undemocratic.  Let me ask them, is there  anything

undemocratic  in the proposal that every  citizen,

to  whatever class of the community he may belong,

and  irrespective of race, should  have  the  same

liability to serve the State under exactly similar

conditions? In fact, I would say that this is  the

very  essence of true democracy. Every young able-bodied man should be proud to take his place as  a

member  of  the  thousands of fellow  citizens  in

defence of his country and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>



bear  his  share  of the country's  burdens.  This

proposition will certainly meet with the  absolute

approval  and  wholehearted support of  all  loyal

citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practical side of national service, that is,

the  drill  parades, the training in  the  various

aspects  of  self-defence and discipline,  are  in

themselves  good  for  the character  building  of

every individual. This is only by the way, for the

cardinal principle in national service is that  it

is the duty of every citizen to submit to whatever

sacrifice (if you can call it `sacrifice') he  may

be  called upon to make. As a matter of fact,  the

provisions  in  the Bill, the so-called  sacrifice

which  the individual citizens are asked to  make,

are  little  enough  compared with  those  of  the

advanced  countries of the world. I  am  sure  the

young able-bodied citizens of our country will not

consider it a sacrifice when they are called  upon

to  serve the country under the provisions of this

Bill.  The  very  great  majority  of  them   will

certainly accept their responsibility and consider

it  a  privilege to be able to take an  honourable

part in the defence of their country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old out-dated idea that we are sojourners in

the  land  of our adoption can no longer  prevail.

For  if  we  consider our welfare and  prosperity,

indeed  our  very  existence,  and  if  we  are  a

reasonable  and  thoughtful  people,  it  must  be

considered  an obligation and indeed  a  privilege

for  everyone who is able to learn to  defend  the

country  in  case  of  a national  emergency.  The

solution,  for  the  continued  existence  of  our

democratic  institutions, indeed our very  freedom

and  liberty, rests in armed strength and  not  in

unarmed weakness.



<br><br>6.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  may I, first of  all,  express  my

thanks  and appreciation to Members of  the  House

who  have made so many useful contributions in the

course  of  this debate. I think I am  in  general

agreement  with them as regards the necessity  for

taking  the measures that we have to. Some Members

have raised a number of points and have brought to

my  attention some problems which they think might

arise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1251</b></font><br><br>



in the course of the implementation of the Ordinance,

and these points deserve comment from me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Member for Telok Blangah has asked

whether, if in future persons in military service are

victimised  in some way or other because they  cannot

do  overtime  as a result of military training,  some

safeguards   cannot  be  found   to   protect   their

interests.  The answer is, of course, in  two  years'

time  when these national servicemen, i.e, the  full-time  soldiers, go into the reserve and get  employed

under  this Scheme of Direction of Employment,  there

will   be   no   inducement  for  the   employer   to

discriminate  against the reservists, because  if  he

does so and the reservist leaves his employment, what

he will get as replacement is another reservist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Merah has brought up a theme

very  close  to  my  heart, that is  the  singing  of

military songs by our soldiers. In fact, some  months

ago,  I asked the professional officers to produce  a

song-book,  but  because they  were  trained  in  the

British  tradition, they could not see  why  an  army

should  have  a song-book. However, the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Culture is producing  a

song-book  for the Vigilante Corps. There  are  about

100  songs  one third in the national language,  one-third  in  Chinese and one-third in English.  So  the

Vigilante  Corps will have a song-book  before  long,

and  I  think, when the soldiers see that, they  will

insist  that  their professional officers  produce  a

song-book which will be as inspiring.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Merah objects to the practice

of  blowing  a  trumpet In the Infantry Regiments  to

announce  meal-times. I myself  cannot  see  anything

wrong with it. If you do not have a trumpet, then you

must have gongs or sirens or you let off fireworks. I

do  not  know  what the point is, whether  meal-times

should  not be announced or should be announced  with

the use of some other instrument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b> rose ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Member for Bukit Merah

wants to make a point of clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am not opposed to

the  blowing of a trumpet. But I would like  to  know

whether  the blowing of a trumpet or a bugle  without

military songs will be appropriate in the situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Are you going to have solos or

accompanied bugle playing?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> We will see to it that the

trumpets and bugles are properly tuned!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol has raised a number of

important points. First, with regard to clause 5,  he

asks,  "Why should the Minister and not the President

issue  the notice in the Gazette requiring people  to

register?"   This,   of   course,   is   a    routine

administrative  matter  and  it  is  not  the   usual

practice  to saddle the President with administrative

measures  of  this kind. He asks, "Why not  bring  in

youths  from  the ages of 18 to 25 into the  national

service?" And in this, he is supported by the  Member

for  Anson. The answer is that the exercise  will  be

bogged  down by the sheer numbers involved.  In  each

age  group, you roughly have anything between  19,000

and  25,000, and if you extend it to say eight years,

you  may  have  to deal with something  like  120,000

persons.  We have neither the staffing, training  nor

physical  resources to cater for national service  on

that scale, nor is it necessary really to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payment of allowances for the Vigilante Corps

is  supported  by the Members for Punggol,  Havelock,

Joo Chiat and Aljunied I am still of the opinion that

service  in the Vigilante Corps is voluntary  and  it

should  be  made  voluntary.  I  will  try  to   make

arrangements for free bus travel for those  who  have

to attend training classes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has some curious notions

about  what sort of people would be required to  join

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>



full-time  army.  He  thinks  it  will  be  the  less

intelligent  and  not the more  brainy  type.  I  can

assure him that those joining the army will not  only

have  muscles but will also have brains. So  I  think

the fear that he has expressed that the personnel  in

Government  service will be less and less intelligent

is groundless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Joo Chiat has put forward a novel

proposition that, instead of asking the youths to  do

four  different kinds of service, they should all  do

the  same  service  for two years and  all  part-time

service.  This is not practical, because  if  you  do

this, then you will not have an army because an  army

must  be  manned by full-time personnel. One  way  of

getting  everybody to do the same thing would  be  to

get  everybody to do full-time military training  for

two  years, as it is being done in several  countries

like  Switzerland, Sweden, Israel and others. But  we

have  worked out the cost of this exercise and it  is

something  that the Republic just cannot  afford.  In

ten years' time, this kind of thing is guaranteed  to

make us completely bankrupt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has made a very useful

suggestion and that is that if in future non-citizens

apply for citizenship, they should be required to  do

military  service. I think this is  a  very  valuable

suggestion which the Government will bear in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development is doubtful whether four registration centres would be enough and he thinks that all community centres should be mobilised into service. The point is that during the 16 days in which young men will be registered, there will be

only 600 a day, and to deal with such a number a day,

four   registration  centres  would   be   sufficient

provided  that  boys of 18 turn up on  the  scheduled

dates.  If,  of  course, they  all  turn  up  on  one

particular  day,  then the whole  exercise  would  be

busted. That can happen whether you have four centres

or more than four centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru suggests that women

should  participate in national service. I  must  ask

him to remember that the national service we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>



have  here  is compulsory and not voluntary.  Anybody

who  is asked to join the full-time army and does not

do  so  goes  to  gaol, and I do not  think  we  have

reached  the stage where we will tell women,  "Unless

you  do  this, that or the other, you will spend  six

months  in  gaol." [Laughter] This is not a  laughing

matter at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Timah makes a plea for

families who may have two or three members called up.

I  do  not see how this can happen unless, of course,

they  are  twins  and  the  particular  parents   are

unusually  prolific. Of course, in  the  law  itself,

there  is  allowance  to  exempt  or  defer  national

service on the ground of hardship where hardship  can

be proved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Timah and the Member for Ulu

Pandan make a plea on behalf of students who are  now

studying  in universities and ask that their  service

be deferred. I will lay them a bet of 100 to one that

there  is  no  student in Nanyang University  or  the

University  of  Singapore who is liable  to  national

service because this concerns only people aged 18 and

those  in the universities are at least 19, 20  years

old or more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Ulu Pandan wants to retain voluntary

participation in the Vigilante Corps and the People's

Defence  Force, and I think he has a valid point.  We

will,  of course, try to take in people of other  age

groups who want to join up. But in the first phase of

national  service,  I think the whole  administration

will  be  very hard put to it just to cope  with  the

18,000  or  so  who  will have to do  their  national

service  this year. So when the machinery has settled

down   and   we  have  more  resources  by   way   of

instructors,  barracks and classrooms, we  will  bear

his suggestion in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens expresses the hope

that  we will not forget the P.D.F. - those who  have

volunteered so magnificently in the last year  and  a

half and at some sacrifice. I assure him that we have

the  highest  esteem  for these volunteers  and  that

their  interest  will  be  protected  in  every   way

possible. As regards uniforms, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>



absolutely accept his proposal that uniforms should

be the same for all units, with, of course,

differences in formation signs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens also asks whether

section  21A  covers the present P.D.F.  Section  21A

does  not  cover the present P.D.F. -  that  is,  the

obligation of the employer to grant leave to those on

the  national  reserve to enable  them  to  do  their

annual  training.  So  the answer  is  `No'.  But  my

Ministry'  is  thinking of amending the Ordinance  to

give  members of the P.D.F. - that is, the  volunteer

members - the same kind of cover and protection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member for River Valley has asked me

to deal firmly with evasion. I can give him an

assurance that this is very much in my mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Dr Goh Keng Swee]

insert "expression".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That will be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 8 to 14 inclusive ordered to stand part of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 -



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 9, line 35, at end, to insert a comma.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the first amendment to this

clause  is  considered necessary because, after  some

experience now with the training in the P.D.F., it is

found that week-end training is not really the answer

in  terms of efficiency and economy. During the week-end, considerable time is wasted in travelling to and

from   camping   sites   and  training   areas,   and

comparatively   little  time  is  spent   on   actual

training.  A  continuous period of  in-camp  training

during the first six months would, therefore, he much

more  effective from the training point of  view  and

would  also  enable recruits to gain an insight  into

camp life at an early stage of their training.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment is considered necessary

because of the first amendment, and the third

amendment is merely a matter of drafting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is purely a typographical amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 21 stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my attention

has  been drawn to paragraph (g) of clause 21,  which

is  to  allow for the serving of notice to  a  person

displaying the notice "at some public place". What is

intended  here  is  to  display  a  notice   of   all

undelivered  notices served on persons  at  community

centres nearest to the address of the person on  whom

the notice is meant to be served.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a regrettable fact that in Singapore the

postal   service   does  not  reach  a   considerable

proportion  of  residents. In the  rural  areas,  for

instance, there is a large number of attap huts whose

numbers  are  either  unofficial  or,  if  they   are

official,  they do not run serially. There have  been

cases where the same set of numbers appear along  the

same  road  at  different places.  In  the  slums  of

Chinatown,  many families may share the same  address

and  when  the  postman delivers  a  letter  to  this

address, it is by no means certain that the addressee

will get the letter or the notice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In serving a notice to national servicemen or

persons  liable  to national service,  every  attempt

will be made to reach them personally, either by post

or  by  personal messenger. The method  of  informing

people  of their national service liability  provided

for  in paragraph (g) of clause 21 will be used  only

as a last resort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House takes note of the Report of the

Statement  by  the  Minister  for  Law  and  National

Development made at the sitting of this House on 21st

December, 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in my Statement made in this House on

the 21st December, 1966, I set out Government's views

on  the recommendations of the Commission, and  I  do

not propose at this stage to say anything further.  I

do hope that most Members of this House will speak on

this  motion  and  let  their  views  be  known.   In

particular, I hope that Ministers will also take  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1259</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Tang See Chim in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Report

of   the  Constitutional  Commission,  1966,  can  be

described as a very valuable and far-sighted historic

document   ever   presented  to  this   House   since

independence.  Most of the recommendations  contained

in  the  Report have been accepted by the  Government

and  are  intended  to  be written  into  our  future

Constitution.   The  majority  of  the   constructive

recommendations will undoubtedly become the basis  of

the  new Constitution of our independent country, and

this Constitution will become an example, we hope, to

independent countries in this part of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should say that the Constitutional Commission

have  lived up to the expectations of all the people.

They  have recognised our present situation and  have

recommended the constitutional provisions which  take

into  account  our  ideal for a multi-racial,  multi-religious,  and  multi-cultural  society,  and   have

provided   safeguards  to  be   entrenched   in   the

Constitution.  This will provide for  the  peace  and

security  and  for the maintenance  of  law  in  this

society   and   ensure   the  perpetuation   of   our

independent Republic. Compared with other  countries,

ours  is one that is standing on firm ground and  our

Government is one that is working for the benefit and

in  the  best  interest of the  people,  leading  the

country  on to the correct path towards a better  and

brighter future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would not like to touch upon every aspect of

this   Report.  I  will  merely  touch  upon  several

important points in the recommendations, namely,  the

setting  up  of the Council of State, the  Ombudsman,

and provisions to be entrenched in the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Constitutional Commission, after

considering all factors, have suggested for inclusion

in  the Constitution provisions for the setting up of

an   advisory  body  called  the  Council  of   State

comprising 21 members to guard against the passage of

any    discriminatory   legislation   affecting   the

interests  of  any minorities with  a  view  also  to

ensuring



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>



that, in the present situation where the House has no

effective  Opposition,  the  Council  of  State   can

provide some supervision over Government legislation.

In  other words, this Council of State may be able to

exercise  the duties that an Opposition Party  should

exercise  in this House. This Council of  State  lies

somewhere  between Parliament and an Upper House.  In

our  country, this institution will be something like

the  House of Lords of the British Parliament. As far

as  I  understand, the British House of  Lords  is  a

characteristic monarchic institution in  that  it  is

merely  an  aristocratic Council for the  purpose  of

emplacing people who have contributed to that country

and  providing  them with a means  of  livelihood  in

their  old age. The House of Lords actually  has  not

much  power  or effect over the passing of  laws.  So

there has been controversy over the need of the House

of  Lords.  Some people have proposed its  abolition,

but without avail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the present situation obtaining in our country

is  different.  Because of the  inefficiency  of  the

Opposition  and  their  boycott  of  this  House,   a

situation is created where we should have somebody to

take  their part, hence the Council of State.  As  to

the  merits and demerits of this Council of State,  I

will touch on several points. We find that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The composition of this Council of State,

according  to  the Report, should be of citizens  who

have   contributed  to  public  service,   and   have

distinguished themselves in their own walks of  life.

We  have  general agreement on this point. Inevitably

there  can  be diverse views in the Council,  and  if

their  views differ from the views of the people,  we

doubt  whether the views held by the members  of  the

Council  can  be representative of the views  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The number of members in the Council is 21.

With  such a large number of members, it will be very

difficult  to  arrive at unanimous agreement  in  any

matter. I feel that if such a situation happens, then

this   House  will  be  faced  with  various  diverse

opinions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The Government will incur additional

expenditure by setting up this Council. For instance,

if every Councillor were to draw $500 allowance every

month,  the Government would have to spend more  than

$100,000  every year. Whether this is  worthwhile  or

proper will have to be considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Constitutional Commission, in considering

the setting up of this Council, took into account the

present  situation  in the House where  there  is  no

Opposition.  When  there is  an  Opposition  in  this

House, what would be the position of this Council  of

State?  This  might be an interim measure recommended

by  the  Commission.  But nobody can  guarantee  that

there  will never be an Opposition in this House.  So

we  should consider this point and see whether it  is

appropriate to have such an institution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I would touch upon is the system of

Ombudsman.  The tasks of this Ombudsman are,  namely,

to    supervise   the   administration   of   various

administrative institutions and deal with  complaints

against  them. In principle, this system is  laudable

because  the  Ombudsman  can  supervise  the  various

administrative  organs and make them  more  effective

and efficient.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>7.09 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This system has been in practice in Sweden for more

than  100 years. In the British Commonwealth, Britain

has  only  recently considered the adoption  of  this

system.  In 1962 New Zealand made use of this system.

So  far this system is still in an experimental stage

there and the result is still not known.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Britain adopted this system by an Act in 1966. But

so  far it has still not put it into practice.  Other

Commonwealth  countries  like  Australia,  India  and

Canada, whose history of independence has been longer

than  ours,  have not adopted this system.  Singapore

has been independent for not more than two years.  It

would be appropriate if we were to describe it  as  a

baby. For a baby to learn every act of a grown-up  is

not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>



logical.  Therefore, the Government can  only  accept

this  suggestion in principle. This  is  the  correct

attitude. Let us look at the results of the countries

which  are implementing this system before we  decide

to  adopt it. Let us see during the next five or  ten

years what contribution this system can make in other

countries. If it is practicable, then we can consider

whether  the  same  results can be  achieved  in  our

country.  This  is  another  point  that  merits  our

consideration,  not to say that our  environment  and

our  situation  and  position are entirely  different

from   those  obtaining  in  New  Zealand  and  other

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though at present we do not have the Ombudsman, yet

we  have  the Central Complaints Bureau.  People  can

lodge  their  complaints about administrative  faults

with  this Central Complaints Bureau with a  view  to

redressing  their grievances, if they could  not  get

their  remedy  at  the courts. This Bureau  would  be

something  like  an Ombudsman. The  Director  of  the

Central  Complaints Bureau has powers and  facilities

similar  to those provided for the Ombudsman,  except

the  power  to call for evidence and witnesses.  When

necessary,  he can suggest to the Prime  Minister  to

adopt certain measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fifth chapter of the Report, three methods

are  suggested  in  relation to the  entrenchment  of

certain  provisions in the Constitution.  Firstly,  a

Bill  altering the Constitution should not be  passed

unless  it  is expressly stated therein  that  it  is

introduced  with  a  view to making  such  amendments

only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Bill amending the Constitution

should, in the final voting, have received at least a

two-thirds   majority  of  the  elected  Members   of

Parliament before it can be passed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, any provisions amending the Constitution

should  be presented and approved by the majority  of

those  who  are  qualified to vote, both  inside  and

outside  the  House. The Government has  adopted  the

second  method, which is the most appropriate in  our

present situation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1263</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Moment of Interruption. Mr Ho,

this is a convenient point in your speech to adjourn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House do now adjourn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<div align="center"><b>URBAN AND RURAL SERVICES PROJECTS</b></div>



<br><br>7.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the present Government

should  be  commended for its efforts  to  raise  the

standard  of  living  of  our  multi-racial,   multi-cultural and multi-religious people and to give  more

prosperity   and   happiness,  be  they   in   social

activities  or development projects. We can  see  for

ourselves that many schools have been built to  cater

for  the  increasing number of the country's  school-going children; factories have been set up to provide

more  employment  to  our  school-leavers;  old   and

dilapidated  houses have given way to  modern  multi-storey  flats in order to solve the housing  problems

faced  by  our people. At the same time, drains  have

been  constructed, whilst the smaller ones have  been

widened  to  alleviate flooding and prevent  stagnant

waters  from  becoming places for mosquito  breeding.

Many  new roads have been constructed and small  ones

widened  to cope with the increased volume of traffic

in our Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projects carried out by Government in urban

areas  so  far have been successful and  are  gaining

momentum. Every State guest from abroad and  tourists

alike who call at Singapore are truely amazed by  the

various Government projects. It is even more  so  for

those who have been here previously so that they  can

compare the state of affairs obtaining then and  now.

But Government projects in Kampong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1264</b></font><br><br>



Kembangan Constituency, which is a suburban area,  is

a  matter of regret to me. I have stated earlier that

Government's effort to uplift the living standards of

the  people  is praiseworthy, regardless  of  whether

they  live in the urban or rural areas, so  that  the

standard  of living of the people in the rural  areas

will  be at par with that of the people in the  city.

On  the contrary, the livelihood of the people in the

kampongs,   specially  those  in  Kampong  Kembangan,

leaves much to be desired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kampong Kembangan Constituency is a low-lying area

and is easily flooded when it rains. There is no need

to  wait  for the rain to fall throughout  the  whole

day;  it  suffices if there is a heavy  downpour  for

just one or two hours, and Kampong Kembangan will  be

flooded.  Mr Speaker, Sir, I have raised the  matter

in  this  Chamber  in  December 1965.  I  quote  from

Hansard, Volume 24, No. 14, column 823:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'....when the rain falls for a short while, the

Kampong  Kembangan area is flooded  and  animals  and

plants  are destroyed. Now is the best time  for  the

Minister  for Law and National Development  to  visit

Kampong Kembangan Constituency, because it is now the

rainy  season, and he will be able to see for himself

the condition of the drains in this area.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the earth roads become uneven and are

impassable to traffic. The Minister of State  on  one

occasion  visited Kampong Kembangan  to  declare  the

official opening of National Language Month.  He  was

travelling  in  a  big Jaguar car as  though  he  was

travelling  in  a  sampan. When the sun  shines,  the

laterite  roads become dusty and the houses, clothing

and  food are covered with dust. This matter has also

been  raised  by me in December 1965.  I  quote  from

Hansard, Vol. 24, No. 14, column 825:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Now I would like to talk about the roads in Kampong

Kembangan which are very bad. You can say that 90 per

cent  of  the  roads there are earth roads.  When  it

rains, the roads become muddy...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the drains become breeding grounds for

mosquitoes. The water is stagnant, and during the hot

weather rubbish is dumped into the drains.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1265</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Kampong Kembangan is a low-lying area, it

follows  that  the  projects required  to  raise  the

living   standard  of  the  people  there  would   be

proportionately higher. But, unfortunately, the funds

provided  for Kampong Kembangan arc not  enough.  For

this   year,  the  provision  for  Kampong  Kembangan

amounts to $60,000 only. Applications have been  made

repeatedly  and during the Prime Minister's  tour  of

the  Kampong Kembangan Constituency. Up  to  now  the

drains and roads have not been made up yet. The Urban

and   Rural  Services  Committee  have,  on  so  many

occasions,  visited the constituency; questions  were

raised  in  this  House.  Nevertheless,  the  efforts

carried  out were practically nil. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

this House has been informed why the roads could  not

be  made  up, because the land on both sides  of  the

roads  to  be made up belongs to private owners.  For

this reason, the roads were made up under section 19,

L.G.I.O.,  which requires the landowners to  pay  the

cost  of making up the roads. On the contrary,  there

are many roads in Jalan Alsagoff which have been made

up according to kampong standards. Even more strange,

the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the  Minister  for

National Development has said - I quote from Hansard,

Volume 25, column 114:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`However, as the frontages are not yet well

developed,  these roads have been given low  priority

and may not be made up until 1968.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cite an example, Mr Speaker, Woo Mun Chew Road

and  many other roads in Siglap, where the laying  of

sewers  has  just been completed, have  already  been

made  up; whereas in Kampong Kembangan the laying  of

sewers  was  completed two years ago  and  the  roads

until today have not been made up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is obvious that there is

discrimination here. The people in the kampong do not

get  proper  or  adequate treatment  as  compared  to

people who live in the built-up areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are numerous earth drains which are full of

grass  and unattended to and water is unable to flow.

When I referred the matter to the authorities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1266</b></font><br><br>



concerned, the District Office passed it  on  to  the

P.W.D. which  in turn passed the buck  to  the  Work

Brigade, and in the end nothing was done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the large drain at Jalan Ang Teng from

Jalan  Pagak right up to Jalan Taugeh and finally  to

Geylang  River. I referred the problem to the  proper

authorities  in 1963 for action to be taken  to  help

the  residents  against  the flood  menace.  When  it

rains,  the vegetable gardens and poultry are  ruined

by  the  floods  because the water  in  these  drains

cannot flow smoothly. A large number of the residents

in this area depend for their livelihood on vegetable

gardening  and  poultry  rearing.  Mr  Speaker,  the

Member for Bukit Merah, who previously resided  here,

will  corroborate what I have said. He has experience

of how the residents here are suffering from this big

problem. I have already taken up the matter with  the

responsible  authorities. I made  a  site  inspection

with  the Work Brigade Engineer and later on  with  a

P.W.D. Engineer. I also had occasion to accompany the

Secretary,  U.R.S.C. But sad to say, the problem  has

not  yet been tackled up to today. Here I fail to see

equal  treatment  to the haves and to  the  have-nots

being  practised in the attempt to raise  the  living

standard  of the kampong people to the same level  as

that  of  the people in the urban areas, about  which

the Government has been trumpeting so loudly.



<br><br>7.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

regarding  the  problems raised  by  the  Member  for

Kampong Kembangan, as representatives from the  rural

areas  we have the same feeling. For example,  during

the  floods  last month many places  in  the  kampong

areas  were  flooded.  Many  vegetable  gardens  were

flooded;  poultry died and losses were incurred.  The

Urban  anti Rural Services Committee should pay  more

attention  to  these problems and  should  visit  the

rural  areas. Low-lying areas must be protected  from

floods.   There  should  be  an  overall  scheme   to

alleviate the flood situation so that people  in  the

rural areas would not be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1267</b></font><br><br>



faced  with the menace of floods, because they  would

incur losses as a result of flooding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I believe that many rural toads

have  not been properly made up. They are in a  state

of  disrepair.  I do not say that the  Government  is

discriminating against the rural areas. We know  that

it has treated the rural areas and the urban areas on

the same footing and it is trying its best to improve

the  living  conditions of the rural areas.  However,

because this is the heritage of colonialism, there is

a  wide  gap  between the rural areas and  the  urban

areas in living standards. I hope the Urban and Rural

Services  Committee will provide more  funds  to  the

rural areas for their projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in the Jurong area only $91,000 has

been  allotted.  Such a tiny sum of money  cannot  be

used  to  develop that area. Therefore, as  a  Member

from  the rural area I have the same feeling. I  hope

the  Urban and Rural Services Committee will increase

the  funds for projects in the rural areas to  enable

them to carry out their construction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that construction work in the

rural  areas  should  be speedily  carried  out.  For

example,   last  October  I  asked  the   authorities

concerned  to  repair a toad. But after  five  months

nothing  has been done and no reply at all  has  been

given.  There is a delay in carrying out construction

work  in the rural areas. I hope the Minister or  the

Parliamentary  Secretary will pay more  attention  to

the projects which are to be carried out in the rural

areas.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hup Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hup Teck (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I share the sentiments expressed by the

Member for Kampong Kembangan, because my constituency

is  also  a  rural  area and I  know  very  well  the

situation  that is generally common in all the  rural

areas.  Fortunately, the Chairman of  the  Urban  and

Rural Services Committee is here to listen to what  I

have to say and do something about it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1268</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not say that the Government is discriminatory

in  its  treatment of the urban and rural areas,  but

there  are many things which have to be improved  and

need  carrying out in the rural areas. There are  not

enough funds to carry out the projects. For instance,

the  supply  of electricity, water and light  is  not

provided  in some rural areas because of  a  lack  of

funds.  Also certain rural roads have been  neglected

by  the  Government ever since it came to power.  The

idea  of  electing a representative in this House  is

that  he  should  do something constructive  for  his

constituency. We will be approaching 1968  soon  when

Members of Parliament will have to stand for election

again. The present is a testing period for us. It is,

therefore, necessary for us to see that the supply of

water, electricity and gas is facilitated.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I generally try to give the

Minister  or  Parliamentary Secretary 12  minutes  to

reply,  although there is no fixed rule about it.  I,

therefore, propose to ask the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the  Minister for National Development  to  reply

now.



<br><br>7.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that during the last six or seven

years,  very  many  development  projects  have  been

carried  out  in  Singapore, as anyone  can  see.  In

addition  to  the building of schools, factories  and

multi-storey  flats, electricity and  water  supplies

have  been extended to kampong areas, roads have been

made  up in the kampongs, and street lights have been

installed  in  the kampongs. All these projects  have

been  carried  out  for the benefit  of  the  kampong

people.  For  projects carried out by the  Urban  and

Rural Services Committee, a total sum of. $22 million

had already been spent from 1961 to 1966. Out of this

amount, $1 million was spent on Kampong Kembangan  as

compared with $0.66 million spent on the neighbouring

constituency, Geylang Serai. From this figure, it can

be  seen that Kampong Kembangan Constituency was  not

neglected,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1269</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about the other

constituencies?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Sir, Kampong Kembangan

Constituency and Geylang Serai Constituency are below

sea  level  and, therefore, flooding occurs  when  it

rains  for a long time. I think there are two methods

of  alleviating the floods in these areas. The  first

method  is to fill up both these areas, to make  them

higher  than sea level, and the second method  is  to

pump  out  the flood water from these areas into  the

sea.  However,  these two methods are very  expensive

and  virtually impracticable as they would entail the

wholesale shifting of houses to allow the work to  be

done.  One  method of alleviating  the  flood  is  to

destroy and clear overgrown vegetation from drains so

that    storm-waters   can   flow   freely    without

obstruction. This work is usually carried out by  the

Work  Brigade which, unfortunately, has been  reduced

in  size to some 500 members and they have some other

important  work  to attend to. But I suggest  to  the

Member for Kampong Kembangan that the people in  this

area can do a lot by self-help and community work ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> --- in the spirit of gotong

royong.  I will quote one instance. Recently in  Choa

Chu  Kang, the residents of Ama Keng did a very  good

job of repairing Ama Keng Road (8th m.s. to 9th m.s.).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Rome was not built in one day. [Interruption]

Improvement  works  in  Singapore,  in  like  manner,

cannot  be completed within a short period.  It  will

take  a number of years before all improvement  works

in Singapore can be completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few Members representing rural constituencies

have  complained  that  the funds  allocated  to  the

constituencies are insufficient. Sir, the  allocation

of  funds  to each constituency was worked out  by  a

Committee of experts ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not so expert!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> --- and the funds were

allocated on the basis of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1270</b></font><br><br>



size  of  constituency,  of population,  and  so  on.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Parliamentary Secretary

listened to the two previous speakers on this  matter

in silence, and I think they and their friends should

reciprocate. Mr Ho.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> So if Members representing

rural constituencies feel that the funds allocated to

them  are  insufficient, I would suggest to  them  to

make  out a case to the Minister for Finance.  If  he

agrees,  my  Committee  is willing  to  provide  more

amenities  for  the people living in  the  rural  con

stituencies.   In  any  case,  funds   allocated   to

constituencies have been decided and it is up to hon.

Members to make recommendations to the Government  on

which  projects should be carried out first. As  soon

as the Government receives such a list of priorities,

I  can  assure them that all the projects recommended

by them will be carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> But the funds are insufficient!



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hup Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hup Teck</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  are  not directing our complaints at the Chairman

of  the U.R.S.C. We know very well that the Committee

has  its own difficulties because the funds allocated

for  the  rural areas are insufficient. Our intention

is to paint a picture of the general situation in the

rural  areas  for the information of the Chairman  of

the  U.R.S.C., so that he will be able to  find  some

way  of resolving the problem. I only hope that  this

Committee  will be able to improve the conditions  in

rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to

take  up  one or two points on what the Parliamentary

Secretary  to  the  Minister  for  Law  and  National

Development has said just now. How is the  allocation

of  funds  to  constituencies arrived at?  I  believe

there is a scheme whereby such allocation of funds is

to  be  extended  over a period of, say,  six  years.

Therefore, if, for example, Kampong Kembangan were to

be allocated $90,000 this year ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1271</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> $60,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> --- or $60,000 to be more correct,

then  in 1968, 1969 and 1970, Kampong Kembangan  will

still  get a sum similar to that allocated  for  this

year.  I  am  not trying to support the Parliamentary

Secretary, but I am just trying to clarify one point.

As  it stands over a period of years, I am sure  that

not  only  the Constituency of Kampong Kembangan  but

also  the outlying areas wilt ultimately benefit.  As

was  said, "Rome was not built in one day." I am sure

that  all  Members will have beaming  faces  in  this

House  when, after a period of five years,  they  can

stand  up  and  say, "Well, I have done  a  good  job

because   over  this  period  of  years,  big   rural

development   projects   have   been   carried    out

systematically in my constituency."



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> On a point of clarification. I think

the  Parliamentary  Secretary has  not  answered  the

Member  for  Kampong  Kembangan on  the  question  of

delayed implementation of the projects that have been

agreed upon by the Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Parliamentary Secretary

has said that he will look into it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I think some Members of this House are

directing their complaints to the wrong source. It is

not  the Chairman of the U.R.S.C. who is responsible.

It is the Minister for Finance.
