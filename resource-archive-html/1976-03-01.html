<div align="center"><b>PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Stranded pilgrims)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap</b> asked the Minister for Social

Affairs whether he is aware that on the 9th and 10th November,

1975, about  300 pilgrims to Mecca were stranded without  the

promised  air  flights because of the failure  of  two  travel

agencies  to provide the aircraft; if he can inform the  House

of  the reasons for such failure on the part of the two travel

agencies;  and  what steps his Ministry and the  Majlis  Ugama

Islam  Singapura  are  taking to prevent  repetition  of  such

situations  in  the future so as to avoid great  inconvenience

and hardship to pilgrims.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr

Speaker. Sir, as in previous years. Haj pilgrims made  private

arrangements with travel agents to proceed to Mecca by air. It

came  to  the  notice of the Ministry a few  days  before  the

scheduled  departure of two groups of Haj  pilgrims  that  the

pilgrimage  flights  for the 9th and 10th  November  would  be

delayed  due  to  the  non-availability  of  the  planes.  The

Ministry  immediately initiated investigations. It  was  found

that the two travel agents who were responsible for these  two

groups  of  pilgrims, together with other parties  responsible

for  chartering  and providing the planes, had mishandled  the

flight  arrangements.  In  view  of  the  circumstances,   the

Ministry  intervened and, with the assistance of the Singapore

International  Airlines, arranged a number of SIA  flights  to

transport  all  the  pilgrims to Jeddah  in  time  to  perform

pilgrimage.  Return  flights  were  also  arranged   for   the

pilgrims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future, all pilgrims whether they intend to travel to

Mecca  by  sea  or  air, will be required to register  at  the

Pilgrimage Office of the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura,  at  Em

press  Place.  They will be issued with Pilgrim  Passes  which

will entitle them to medical and welfare services during their

pilgrimage. The Ministry is now making plans for pilgrim



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



chartered flights to and from Mecca to be coordinated by  MUIS

with the assistance of the Singapore International Airlines.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>TEMPORARY OCCUPATION LICENCES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Transfer fees)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Law and the

Environment  what  is  the  justification  for  charging   the

transfer  fee  of  $500  in  respect of  Temporary  Occupation

Licences  held  by  farmers in the rural  areas;  if  he  will

consider waiving such fees in all cases where the transfer  is

from  parent to son or from one member to another in the  same

family,  and  if he will also consider continuing to  maintain

the  same  rate of T.O.L, fees in all such cases  of  transfer

within the same family.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Land Office has, since 1962, been

charging  a  fee for transfers of holdings held  on  Temporary

Occupation  Licences. The transfer fee then was $100  for  the

first  acre  and $50 for every additional acre or part  of  an

acre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The imposition of a transfer fee is designed to discourage

frequent  transfers  of such holdings and the  abuses  arising

therefrom.  It is not unusual for large sums of  money  to  be

paid  as  consideration between licensees and  purchasers  for

transfers of such holdings. The highest amount ascertained  by

the  Land Office was $15,000 per acre for an area of 2.2 acres

of land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1973 there were 330 applications. In 1974, the number was 439.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deter too frequent applications and to prevent

speculation, the transfer fee was revised in October  1974  to

$200 for the first acre and $100 for every additional acre. In

addition,  on approval, the Temporary Occupation Licence  fees

were revised. For holdings in the rural areas, the revised fee

is  $72  per  acre  per annum. That these  increases  are  not

excessive  is  borne  out by the fact  that  applications  for

transfers increased from 439 in 1974 to 552 in 1975.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer fee of $500 quoted by the Member for Jalan Kayu

refers  to one particular farm lot with an area of about  four

acres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the current practice, the transfer fee may be waived

and  the  old  rates  of  Temporary  Occupation  Licence  fees

retained, at the discretion of the Licences Committee where it

is  ascertained that hardship will be caused to  the  next-of-kin, especially those in receipt of public assistance from the

Social Welfare Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of the Member for Jalan Kayu's representations,

I  have  directed the Commissioner of Lands and  the  Licences

Committee to liberally allow waiver of transfer fees  as  well

as  retention of the old rates of Temporary Occupation Licence

fees,  where  investigations reveal that the circumstances  of

any particular case so warrant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, on the face of it, it

sounds very good. But it is still rather vague to me. In this

particular instance, the Minister does seem to be aware of the

circumstances. Would he, therefore, consider that that

particular case warrants a waiver of the transfer fee?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I will have to look further into the

circumstances of the particular case. I cannot give the Member

a direct answer except for the little facts that I know at the

moment, that is. $500 quoted refers to a farm lot with an area

of about four acres, which is quite considerable.

<div align="center"><b>(Improvement of traffic system)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and

Education whether, in the light of rapid population build-up

in Seletar Hills Estate, he will direct the relevant

authorities to give urgent attention to improving the traffic

system at the Seletar Road/Via Chu Kang Road/Jalan Kayu

junction with a view to minimising the increasing number of

collisions between vehicles some of which have resulted in

deaths and serious personal injuries recently.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir. Police records show that 22 accidents

took  place  at this junction in 1 973, 9 in 1974  and  18  in

1975. Of the 49 accidents, 2 were fatal. 4 resulted in serious

injuries  and 13 involved slight injuries only. The  remaining

30 accidents were minor and did not result in any injury.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Works Department plans to widen Yio Chu Kang Road

and  convert  it  into  a  dual lane-carriageway  with  centre

dividers  in 1977. This project when completed will  make  the

above-mentioned junction safer for motorists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Sir, we cannot just wait until 1977

because  in the meantime cars seem to crash into one  another.

As  an  interim  measure,  can the  Minister  not  direct  his

department to give the situation further consideration  as  to

whether some short-term preventive measures can be taken?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, that has been considered and the

answer is that the only way in which the problem can be solved

would  be  as stated in my answer just now. However,  we  will

look into it further. Perhaps we may put up some traffic signs

to  make  motorists  aware of the dangers at  that  particular

junction.

<div align="center"><b>POLICE LONG SERVICE AND GOOD CONDUCT MEDALS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Criteria and procedure)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and

Education  what  are the criteria adopted in  deciding  on

the  awards of the Singapore Police Long Service and  Good

Conduct Medals and what procedure has been established  to

ensure impartiality and objectivity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the Singapore Police

Long  Service  and Good Conduct Medal Rules.  1974, stipulate

that  the  Medal may be awarded to officers of  the  Singapore

Police  Force who have completed 12 years' continuous  service

and have a good record of conduct in the Force. The assessment

of an officer's conduct is guided



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



specifically by a set of criteria laid down in Police  General

Order  A58  dated 6th December, 1969. The Order sets  out  the

mode of assessment of character and conduct. It also lays down

the  types of offences which would disqualify an officer  from

consideration,   differentiating  between  major   and   minor

offences. In addition, the award of the Medal is withheld  for

those officers who are under disciplinary investigation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criteria adopted in deciding on the award of the

Singapore Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal are  more

or  less  parallel  to those in respect of the  award  of  the

Singapore  Armed  Forces Long Service and Goad  Conduct  Medal

which   are  spelt  out  in  Government  Gazette  Notification

(Subsidiary  Legislation  Supplement)  No.  S  57  dated  16th

February, 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commanding Officers and officers-in-charge of Divisions

and  Units  make  the first recommendation  of  award  to  the

Commissioner   of   Police.  The  recommendations   are   then

considered  by the Commissioner of Police and the Ministry  of

Home  Affairs  before they are put up to me  for  concurrence.

They  are  then  sent up to the President for final  approval.

This  procedure that has been established ensures impartiality

and objectivity.

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars of Graduates in 1975)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and

Education if he will ascertain from the Industrial Training

Board the breakdown figures of students who successfully

completed the various Industrial Training Board courses in

1975  and  the number of the graduates who have obtained

employment in the jobs for which they have been trained.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Mr Chai Chong Yii) (for the Minister for Home Affairs and Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

a  total  of  4,230 students successfully completed Industrial

Training Board courses in  1975. Of these, 367 completed the

Industrial Technician Course; 2,860 completed the Trade I course; 294

completed the Trade II course; 537 completed the Artisan Course and 172

completed the Hotel and Catering course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not known at present how many of these have obtained

employment  in  jobs  for which they  have  been  trained,  as

surveys to ascertain these will only be mounted in the  course

of  this  year. A survey, however, was conducted on those  who

completed their training in 1974. Of the 3,217 surveyed, 2.646

responded and out of these, 1,079 were called up for  National

Service.  960  were  employed and 607 did not  indicate  their

positions  one way or the other. Of the 960 who were employed,

806  (or  84% of those employed) found employment relevant  to

their training.

Minister  of State for Education, can he say whether  the  ITB

have  received a copy. I do not know whether he wishes  me  to

repeat them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 1975 the Member will see from page 62 (Table 3.4, cols. 151-2.) that investment

commitments  came to $400.4 million, of which  $267.3  million

were from foreign companies and $133.1



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



million  from  local investors. They were for 54 projects,  of

which  27 will be wholly foreign-owned. 21 joint ventures  and

six  wholly locally-owned. The figures used are for investment

commitments  as  the  indicator of our results  in  investment

promotion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investment commitments comprise the amount recorded by the

Economic   Development   Board,  which   foreign   and   local

industrialists have firm plans to spend on fixed assets in new

projects   and   expansion  of  existing  plants.   Investment

commitments  for  1975 fell short of our previous  record.  In

1974,  investment commitments came to $821.8 million, of which

$678.4  million are foreign and $1 43.4 million  local.  These

were in 56 projects, of which 28 were wholly foreign, 20 joint

ventures and eight wholly local.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recovery in the world economy, entrepreneurs, both

foreign  and local, will be more prepared to invest.  Together

with  reinforced promotion efforts. I expect the  results  for

this year will improve.

<div align="center"><b>LAND TITLES (STRATA) (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(As reported from Select Committee)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.



<br><br>2.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b>

Mr  Speaker. Sir, I beg to move,  "That the Bill be now read  a

Third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Titles (Strata) (Amendment) Bill was committed to a

Select  Committee  on 19th August, 1975. The Select  Committee

received nine representations and heard oral evidence from all

the  representors. Some of the contributions were valuable and

a  number  of  suggestions  have  been  accepted.  The  Select

Committee's Report was published and presented to  this  House

on 16th February, 1976, as Paper Parl. 1 of 1976.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill, as now tabled before the House, incorporates

the  amendments  which  have been recommended  by  the  Select

Committee. I will not burden Honourable Members with technical

details but would like to draw their attention to a number  of

amendments and new provisions in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee decided to add a new section 15E to enable a

subsidiary proprietor of a strata lot in a subdivided building

to  make  an  application to the court to direct a  management

corporation or management corporations to -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) transfer a part of the common property; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) accept a transfer of any land or part thereof or any lot

so that the land or part thereof or lot shall form part of the

common property; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) amalgamate the common property of two or more management

corporations.



<br><br>It  was brought to the Committee's attention that many members

of   some  management  corporations  are  apathetic  to  their

responsibilities, and it was therefore felt necessary to allow

a  dissatisfied subsidiary proprietor to apply  to  Court  for

redress.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also decided to amend clause 17 to make it an

offence  for a subsidiary proprietor to refuse to comply  with

the  by-laws set out in the Second Schedule to the Land Titles

Act.  The  maximum punishment for contravention is a fine  not

exceeding  $1,000. It was brought to the Committee's attention

that  life  in  a multistorey building would be unbearable  if

there  were persistent violations of these by-laws which  were

enacted to ensure the comfort and well-being of the occupants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also decided to add a new provision in the Bill

to exempt an instrument of transfer lodged pursuant to the new

section 32B, 32C or 32D from payment of stamp duty. This  will

lessen  some of the financial burdens which a developer  would

have  to bear when he makes a transfer of the interest in  the

land  on  which  flats have been built to the  owners  of  the

flats. In all such cases the value of the developer's interest

in the land is nominal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 25 has been amended to empower the Commissioner of

Buildings   to  have  more  effective  powers  to  deal   with

management  corporations which are not  run  properly  and  to

empower  the  Minister to make regulations  to  prescribe  the

composition of the management council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also decided to add a new provision to prohibit

developers  from  levying  maintenance  charges  without   the

approval  of the Commissioner of Buildings from the  time  the

building  is  completed  until such  time  as  the  management

corporation  takes over the maintenance of the building.  This

would prevent any attempt to impose excessive charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members are aware that in many high-rise buildings there

are  multi-storey car parks. In all these buildings which have

been  completed before the introduction of the Bill, the  car

parks are owned and controlled by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



the  developers  who, at the time of the sale of  the  housing

units  in the building, did not pass on the construction costs

of  the  car  parks  to  the purchasers.  A  new  transitional

provision  in  the  Bill  provides that  in  respect  of  such

buildings  used wholly or partly for industrial or  commercial

purposes  and  which have been completed,  or  where  planning

approval  was granted, before the enactment of the  Bill,  the

competent  authority  shall  not  require  the  developer   to

incorporate  any  car parking space therein  as  part  of  the

common  property  of  the building if the developer  does  not

agree to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Third time and passed.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move, the motion* standing in my name as it appears on the Order Paper.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The motion reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the

Foreshores Act (Chapter 270), approves  the  reclamation by

Government of approximately 13.6 hectares (34 acres) of the

foreshore and seabed at Pasir Panjang as shown hatched pink

on the  plan  marked  as  "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN  NO. 15/75",

which is deposited in the Land Office. Singapore.'

<hr>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you may recall that this House previously approved the

reclamation  at Pasir Panjang which was carried out  in  three

phases  as shown edged orange (Phase I), green (Phase II)  and

purple  (Phase III) respectively on the plan marked  as  "LAND

OFFICE  RECLAMATION  PLAN  NO. 15/75", a  copy  of  which  is

displayed in the Library of this House for the information  of

Honourable  Members. All these reclamations have already  been

completed. The land reclaimed in Phase I has been allocated to

the   Port  of  Singapore  Authority  for  development  of   a

warehousing  complex, that in Phase II will also be  allocated

to  the Authority for port operations and warehousing, and the

land



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



reclaimed under Phase III will be developed by Government (the

Ministry of National Development) for recreational purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Port of Singapore Authority now proposes to reclaim

another  13.6 hectares (34 acres) of the foreshore and  seabed

fronting the Phase II reclaimed land as shown hatched pink  on

the  plan  to  provide  the necessary deep  water  berths  for

conventional  ships requiring a draft of  32  feet  for  tying

alongside  the  wharves for loading with a one-foot  underkeel

allowance.  The  reclamation  profile  will  also  present   a

continuously  straight wharf frontage with the land  reclaimed

under Phase I, which is essential for the safe navigation  and

berthing  of  ships. Additional berths will be  available  for

coastal ships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclamation, which will be undertaken by the Port of

Singapore Authority as agent of the Government, is expected to

take about three years to complete at an estimated cost of $32

million  which  will include the cost of construction  of  the

wharf wall, Fill required for the reclamation will be obtained

from the dredging of Sisters Shoal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On completion of the reclamation the reclaimed land will be

alienated  by  the Commissioner of Lands to the  Authority  on

suitable terms and conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Parliament, in accordance with section 4 of the

Foreshores  Act  (Chapter 270), approves  the  reclamation  by

Government  of approximately 13.6 hectares 134 acres(  of  the

foreshore and seabed at Pasir Panjang as shown hatched pink on

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'That this Parliament pursuant to Section 7 of the Civil List

the  said  Act be varied by deleting the figures "$187,050",

"$823,250", "$200,170" and "$17,750" appearing in the second

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is proposed to increase the provisions for the Privy

Purse  by  $21,150 and the salaries of personal staff  by  $71

.150.  The increase is largely required to meet the  1975  NWC

wage supplement and the annual increment of salaries of staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase under Class III expenditure is mainly required

to   meet  the  cost  of  repairs  of  furniture  and   higher

maintenance  costs. For Class IV, however, a lesser  provision

is now required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, necessary to vary the provisions in the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the "Privy Purse" from $187,050 to $208,200;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for "Salaries of Personal Staff" from $823,250 to $894,400;

Members  my  Economic  Survey  of  Singapore   1975.

Members   will  perhaps  have  noted   the   further

improvements   to   the  Survey   making   it   more

comprehensive    and,    I    trust,    also    more

comprehensible.  The  ample statistical  information

presented  should enable Members, if they  interpret

them differently, to reject my conclusions. They can

reach   their  own  conclusions  of  the   economy's

performance in 1975 and the prospects for 1976. I do

not  propose in this Budget Statement to go over the

ground  covered in the Survey. But it may be helpful

to   Members  if  I  touch  on  selected  topics  of

relevance for

1976.



<br><br><i>Singapore's Economy in 1975</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1975 was a year of world-wide recession with the

major  OECD  countries suffering on  the  average  a

decline  in  growth  of 2'/4%. In the  circumstances

Singapore's real growth of 4.1% may be considered  a

fair   performance,  though  it   is   disappointing

compared  with the double digit rates of  the  early

Seventies. At current prices, the growth  was  9.0%.

The  difference of about 5% between the  two  rates,

the  GNP  deflator,  reflects the relatively  stable

prices  in  1975. This is welcome relief  after  the

steep price increases of 1974. On the other hand, it

could be also a measure of sluggish demand in 1975.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recession, the worst since the Great

Depression,  grew more serious in all industrialised

countries for the first half of the year.  Our  open

economy  registered  this decline.  The  diversified

nature  of our markets and products which had  stood

us   in   good   stead   against  adverse   external

developments  in other years, in this instance,  was

not able to counter a simultaneous decline of almost

all  economies  of  the  industrial  countries.  And

further the loss of the markets in Vietnam, Cambodia

and  Laos  did  not  help. The  severest  effect  on

Singapore's  economy was a decline in  manufacturing

output,  which  was counterbalanced,  to  a  limited

extent, by a stimulation of growth in the  services

sector.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately by mid-i 975, economic recovery was

spearheaded by the United States. This recovery  was

followed, somewhat hesitantly, by Japan and West



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



Germany.  The advances in industrial production  and

increases  in imports reflected the turn  around  of

activities to meet increased demand. However, it was

largely   through   the  build-up  of   inventories.

Consumer spending, the driving force behind  earlier

recoveries of the 1960's, was relatively  weak.  New

long term fixed investment was also weak. There  was

excess  productive  capacity in  all  industrialised

economies.



<br><br><i>Prospects for 1976</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest OECD reports forecast growth in the

major  industrialised countries at  4'A%  for  1976,

nearly  the  rate  in  the  second  half  of   1975.

Similarly, increase  in  volume  of  world   trade

(exports  and  imports) in 1976 is  expected  to  be

about 6%.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these forecasts are realised (and we have been

disappointed  before), they will stimulate  our  own

economic  revival.  A word of caution  is, however,

necessary.  Not all industries will benefit  to  the

same extent. There may be special, or local, factors

which  affect  particular industries.  For  example.

because  of  the  appearance of new or  more  direct

sources  of  supply to their established markets  in

Japan,  Hong Kong or Vietnam, the petroleum refining

industry  may  suffer still from a lack  of  demand.

Similarly, the glut in tankers and larger ships  has

led  to small new orders. Japanese shipbuilders  are

diversifying their activities. Our ship and oil  rig

building  and  repair  industries  are  feeling  the

increasing  pressure  of their  fierce  competition.

Petroleum    refining   and   transport    equipment

industries   are   our  two  largest   manufacturing

industries.  They made big contributions  in  recent

years  to  growth  of our GDP.  In  1976  we  cannot

expect,  for several years, a return to the  era  of

rapid expansion, in a period of high oil prices  and

energy conservation.



<br><br><i>Economic Policy for 1976</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What remedies can we prescribe for our economic

ills  in  1976?  The answer must be  the  tried  and

tested  mixtures. In the last two years of recession

we  have, nevertheless, pursued policies which  will

result in relatively



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



high  rates of growth. These policies have yet to yield  their

full  results. With increasingly difficult economic  problems.

the  Government will have to play a greater role  in  ensuring

orderly  economic  development,  in  stimulating  the  economy

without  rekindling  another bout  of  inflation.  The  public

sector  will continue to provide the necessary facilities  and

services necessary to sustain growth. The private sector  must

redouble   its   efforts   in  increasing   and   diversifying

production, and in securing new markets. It may be  useful  to

review existing Government measures.



<br><br><i>Industrial Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our policy for industrial development remains the

diversification,  restructuring  and  modernisation   of   our

manufacturing  industry.  We must get  higher  technology  and

skill-intensive  industries  to  set  up  in  Singapore.   The

Economic  Development Board has deployed its senior  staff  in

the  field.  Their  effectiveness has resulted  in  investment

commitments  for  1975  of  $400  million  despite  world-wide

recession.  This  amount  is less  than  commitments  of  $822

million for 1974 and $944 million for 1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the difficult economic conditions of last year,

we  cannot  really complain. With excess industrial production

capacity   and   high   unemployment  in  the   industrialised

countries,  most enterprises concentrated on their  home-based

production.  Greater effort is necessary  to  achieve  results

comparable to the early 1970's, before the oil crisis. The EDB

Head  Office  will  be  strengthened  to  help  investors  get

production started expeditiously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our development as a services centre for technical know-how

and  finance  has widened our field. Our supporting  services,

including  comprehensive  financial  facilities,  have   often

settled  hesitations  in  new  investments.  The  Jurong  Town

Corporation  (JTC)  has now an adequate supply  of  industrial

land  and  factories  with  all  utility  services  ready  for

allocation.  JTC  took  the slack of the  last  two  years  to

prepare for renewed demand.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our object to get skill-intensive industries has had some

success.  Investment commitments in 1975 were made  mostly  in

technically  more advanced metal engineering  industries.  The

expected  value added per worker for these new industries  has

increased to $43,000 a year, compared to $33,000 a year in the

last  few years Similar increases in expected value added also

obtain  for other industrial groups, particularly in transport

equipment and petroleum processing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Capital Assistance Scheme, a special fund has been

set  up  for  skill-intensive industries bearing higher  risks

than  those normally acceptable to financial institutions,  We

have  to  date approved loans of $6.1 million to five projects

with  a  total fixed investment of $30.7 million. They are  in

precision  engineering  and  metal  fabrication  and  have  an

average value added per worker of $50,000, compared to $17,000

for existing industries. We get these industries through joint

ventures with foreign companies possessing the technical know-how.  Introduction of new skills to local enterprises  through

joint  ventures  with foreign partners is promising.  Over  30

projects are now under active negotiation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I announced additional tax incentive measures for

industry.  These  have been implemented. Seven  projects  with

total fixed investments of $134 million have been approved for

pioneer  status,  with tax exemption periods beyond  the  five

years  allowed  previously. The Economic Activation  Committee

remains  ready  to help industries over the recession  to  get

industrial production to full capacity.



<br><br><i>Trade Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our trade development policy has to be adjusted to support

our  other  activities, especially those in the  manufacturing

and  services  sectors.  For example, we  are  paying  special

attention  to  the  establishment of  enterprises  engaged  in

warehousing, servicing and maintenance of equipment. They will

meet demand for such services in Singapore and in the region.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are increasing our trade development efforts. Our

Commercial  Secretaries' Service has been expanded to  provide

our  manufacturers  and  traders  with  more  information  and

contacts.  In  1975,  we sent six major missions  to  over  12

countries.  Thirty  foreign missions came to  Singapore.  More

missions will go in the coming year to follow up the  work  of

earlier missions. The Export Credit Insurance Guarantee Scheme

has  been  finalised. The Export Credit Insurance Corporation,

with  an  initial paid-up capital of $30 million, will  start

operation this June. The MAS facility for rediscount of export

bills  provided  last  year  enabled  our  manufacturers   and

exporters   to  lower  costs  of  export  and  hence   secured

additional export markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government can only facilitate the primary task

of  our traders and manufacturers themselves. The Chambers  of

Commerce  and  the  Singapore Manufacturers' Association  must

seek and identify new outlets. They must go out and sell their

goods and services.



<br><br><i>ASEAN Economic Cooperation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it may not be inappropriate if I refer here to the

recent  Conference of ASEAN Heads of Government  at  Bali.  In

economic  matters,  the Conference agreed  on  cooperation  in

priority   supply  and  purchase  of  food  and   energy,   in

establishment  of agreed industrial projects, in  preferential

trading  arrangements particularly for the  products  of  such

ASEAN  industrial  projects,  in  stabilisation  of  commodity

prices and in a unified approach by ASEAN member countries  to

other countries or regional associations. Compared to advanced

regional  groupings  like  the EEC, the  agreement  for  ASEAN

economic  cooperation now embodied in the Bali Declaration  is

but  a  skeletal framework. This will need time to  flesh  out

with  the  substance  of  ASEAN projects  and  other  economic

measures.  Unlike the more ambitious resolutions of the  Group

of  77 developing nations for a new world economic order,  the

aims  of  the ASEAN agreement are modest and should be capable

of quick realisation. If we make even moderate progress in the

next few months to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



get  this agreement implemented, the ASEAN countries will have

moved from discussions to conclusions and from good intentions

to  concrete steps for implementation, even if they are  small

steps  up  what  is a difficult road to greater  economic  and

political cooperation for the good of all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures to implement the agreement reached in Bali can

be  the  first  steps  in regional self-help.  They  can  also

increase  ASEAN's  total  bargaining  strength  vis-a-vis  the

industrial  giants  of America, Japan and  the  EEC  and  with

Australia and New Zealand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we implement these few limited ASEAN measures, we shall

generate  confidence in our people and in  each  other  member

country  in  ASEAN. We hope that economic ties  between  ASEAN

member  states  will  now  grow  as  fast  as  their  economic

relationships with the EEC. Japan and the United  States  have

been  developing. If the mood in Bali prevails, it will be  to

the good of us all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I speak on behalf of my colleagues and myself when I state

that  the Singapore Government stands ready to concede as much

as it gets from the first set of measures. We cannot afford to

lose the momentum generated at Bali through lack of vision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My counterparts in Indonesia. Malaysia, the Philippines and

Thailand   and   I   have  established  a  realistic   working

relationship. Now it is up to all of us representing the  five

member  countries  and our officials to  press  ahead  in  the

spirit of amity and cooperation.



<br><br><i>Construction</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year I announced that public sector construction would

be   increased.  Much  planning  and  design  for   additional

development  projects  were completed  in  1975,  Construction

started  towards the middle of the year. Construction of  many

projects will continue through 1976 and beyond. Public  sector

development  expenditure  in 1975 increased  by  34%.  Largest

increases  were  in  utilities, transport  and  communication,

industrial estate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



development  and public housing. In spite of the  construction

sector's  small share of total GDP, it accounted for 20.3%  of

total  increase of GDP in 1975. Furthermore, such construction

took place at a time of stable or declining prices. So it  had

no  inflationary effects. For 1 976, both the  Government  and

the  Statutory  Boards  will press on with  their  development

programmes.



<br><br><i>Manpower Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industrial training must be expanded. We must have enough

trained   workers  for  industries  when  they   resume   full

production.  My  Ministry estimates that, for economic  growth

rates of 7-10% in 1976 and 10-13% per year in 1977-80, we need

an  average annual addition of 3.000 relevant professional and

technical  graduates,  2.600  technicians,  and  about   7,300

skilled  workers.  Our  training institutions,  secondary  and

technical,  and tertiary, have to plan to meet these  manpower

needs,  in  types  of professional, skilled  and  semi-skilled

workers for the industries likely to be in production.  A  sum

of  $23.4  million  has been approved for industrial  training

conducted  by the private sector in Joint Industrial  Training

Centres  and other training schemes. Disbursement is  expected

to be made within the next four years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent changes in the education system give it a

technical  bias, with more facilities for industrial training.

Vocational  training  and the Industrial Training  Board  will

inculcate  attitudes  of  care  and  precision  essential  for

success in climbing up the technological ladder. There will be

more  blue-collar jobs, and young Singaporeans must be trained

to do them well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers already on the job, have to improve their skills and

increase  work  discipline.  Employers  should  improve  their

personnel management. Increased productivity depends  on  both

workers and employers. Management in the Statutory Boards, and

in  Government, must make more optimal use of manpower through

improvement in the administrative and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



management structure. A recent analysis by my Ministry  showed

that  both the Government and Statutory Boards have  been  too

lavish  in their use of professionally and technically trained

men,   This  has  to  be  reversed.  Our  policy  is  to  keep

establishment strength in the public services to a minimum  in

order  that more professional and technical men can  join  the

productive private sectors.



<br><br><i>Wages Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anticipation of more modest growth rates, and with

inflation now under control, there has to be an adjustment  in

our  wage  policy. Everyone will have to be prepared for  much

smaller  increases than in the years before  the  oil  crisis.

There  can be little or no increase in wages without increases

in productivity. We cannot afford to blunt the competitiveness

of  our exports. The past method of negotiating wage increases

on  top of NWC recommendations must be reviewed. Too many wage

agreements  have  sought to circumvent NWC recommendations  by

fringe benefits. They have included a funeral grant of  up  to

$1,000  on  each  death  of a member in  the  family,  laundry

allowance,  tea allowance, meal subsidy, shift duty allowance,

attendance and transport allowance, savings account of  5%  in

addition  to CPF employers' contribution. In toto,  these  so-called fringe benefits have a heavy impact on costs. The  time

has come for the National Wages Council to consider whether it

should  not  include  all forms of wage  increases,  including

annual  increments, incentive allowances and bonuses,  in  the

computation of the annual NWC wage supplements, to arrive at a

single  total  annual wage increase. The present  practice  of

having  separate increases spread throughout  the  year  under

different   descriptions  is  deceptive.  If  these  practices

continue, Singapore labour will be the most expensive in  East

and  South-east Asia, outside Japan. Unfortunately, we are not

more hardworking nor more sk lIed than people in Korea. Taiwan

or Hong Kong.



<br><br><i>Monetary Policy</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our monetary policies were geared to provide more funds to

stimulate productive activities. This was done whilst ensuring

a healthy position on balance of payments and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



reserves. The freeing of bank rates last year made for a  more

rapid adjustment of domestic interest rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With further expansion of the money supply in 1976, the

productive sectors should have finance at reasonable  interest

rates.  Of  course,  there  will  be  suitable  safeguards  to

maintain  monetary stability, and sufficient  flexibility  for

rapid  adjustments to changes in world currency  exchange  and

interest rates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made major changes to liberalise our foreign

exchange   controls.  Included  in  the  list  of   `scheduled

territories'  now, are all ASEAN countries.  We  have  removed

restrictions  on  the flow of currency notes  and  raised  the

ceiling for investment in specified currencies and securities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are giving priority to the development of the forward

foreign exchange market. With floating exchange rates, traders

need  a good forward market for safe and favourable cover.  We

are  also  nurturing the bond and capital markets. To increase

competitive efficiency, banks and other financial institutions

have  been encouraged, by liberalising conditions under  which

they  operate,  to  provide  more  competition  in  rates   of

interests  and  discounts.  All  Acts  and  regulations  which

inhibit  such competition amongst financial institutions  will

be amended.



<br><br><i>Tourism Development</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the recession, our tourist sector has continued

favourable   growth  in  1975.  Both  the  Singapore   Tourist

Promotion  Board and the Sentosa Development Corporation  have

more  funds  for  further tourist facilities and  attractions.

Their  effort will, doubtless, be reinforced by the activities

abroad, of airlines, hoteliers and travel agencies.



<br><br><i>Final Remarks on Economic Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the world economic uncertainties and the need to

shelter  our  domestic economy from adverse external  factors.

our  long  term  aim  is still high rates of  economic  growth

through  industrialisation, and through  improving  technical

know-how and services.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



The  current upturn in the industrialised countries will  help

our  economic  growth. But harder work  from  our  people  and

greater  vigilance from entrepreneurs and administrators  will

be  required  since the oil prices have gone  up  five  times.

Improvement  in the quality of our workers through  education,

training   and   retraining,  must  be   matched   by   better

entrepreneurs  and  managers. Through continual  modernisation

and   innovation,  management  must  improve  production   and

administration, financial control and personnel management and

marketing methods. Increases in productivity are the result of

judicious  capital investment and good management, matched  by

high  skills and discipline from the workers. In this  way  we

shall  maintain the competitive edge of our goods and services

in  the  international market against the  tough  and  spartan

societies of Korea and Taiwan and the hard driving competition

of Hong Kong. Life has always been harsher in these countries.

The  result is hardy and industrious workers capable  of  long

hours of work and sustained discipline. We can pay our workers

higher  wages and have them enjoy a higher standard of  living

only  if they use our better location and more advanced social

and  industrial infrastructure to advantage. Our entrepreneurs

and  managers must be adequately recompensed for capital  they

bring.  The  enterprise with which they use this  capital  can

raise  the  sophistication in technology  and  skills  of  the

manufacturing  and servicing sectors of our economy.  This  is

our answer to our tough and hardy competitors.



<br><br><i>The FY 76 Budget Estimates</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I now turn to the Budget Estimates. The

Main Estimates of Expenditure are a realistic forecast of  the

sums  of  money  likely to be spent in the  forthcoming  year.

Apart    from    unusual   unforeseen   expenditure,    actual

disbursements  over the years have grown  at  a  steady  rate.

Therefore,  for  FY  76,  excluding  the  allocation  to   the

Development Fund, the estimated expenditure of $5,089  million

compares with $4,335 million for FY 75 and $3,381 million  for FY 74.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Administration's ability to use budgetary allocations

effectively depends on the civil service which must have  able

administrators,   supported   by   qualified    and    trained

professional staff. Appendix A of the Establishment List shows

the vacancy position in the civil service at the beginning  of

December  1975. There are big shortages of Division I officers

in  the  Ministries  of Defence, Health, Foreign  Affairs  and

Education. Recruitment is progressing satisfactorily.  On  1st

February 1976, the overall position in Division I had  dropped

to  2.414 vacancies. To meet numbers required of graduates and

trained  teachers in Education, the Universities and Institute

of  Education and Junior Colleges will expand their intakes of

students in the forthcoming year. Hence their increased budget

allocations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget also provides a very high proportion of total

expenditure  to Social and Community Services, almost  40%  of

the  Budget. Housing, at $854 million, is almost 1 7% of total

expenditure. Expenditure on Education will be $555 million  or

nearly 11% of the total expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next largest sector of public spending is on economic

services, about 30% of total expenditure. $780 million are for

industrial  and commerical development, second largest  single

item  after Housing, 1 5.3% of the total expenditure. Of this.

$338.4   million  (43.4%)  will  be  loans  to   Jurong   Town

Corporation and $292.9 million (37.6%) loans to industrial and

commercial enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For transport and communications, from the FY 75 $176.5

million vote, provision is made for $332.2 million for FY  76.

an  88.2% increase. The building of Changi as a double  runway

international  airport  takes almost $130  million  for  1976,

whilst  $60.34  million are for projects at Paya  Lebar.  Paya

Lebar will continue as the main airport until both runways and

all facilities in Changi are ready by 1982.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For tourism, $10 million for Fl' 75 is increased to $30

million for FY 76. Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC)  will

develop  tourist  facilities  on Sentosa  and  other  offshore

islands,  to build beach bays, jetties, shelters, showers  and

other recreational facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the central core of the Administration which

provides the General Services. From $160.9 million for  FY  75

for   General   and  Financial  Administration  and   Economic

Regulation and Foreign Affairs, an increase of 9.7% to $1 76.5

million for FY 76 is provided. This is a modest percentage  of

total allocation to these support and general services. It  is

not  in  the  interests of efficiency and productivity  to  go

below  this  figure. Indeed, the level of  efficiency  can  be

raised  by  training  and personnel selection  programmes.  An

Establishment  Unit  has been set up in the  Prime  Minister's

Office  to  monitor the careers of all Division I officers  in

the  civil service. This PMO Establishment Unit will seek  out

high  calibre officers especially in the 25-40 age  group,  to

fill a gap caused by many promising officers in the 30-45  age

group  leaving the service during the years of rapid  economic

growth,  when the government service was under the constraints

of  wage  restraint  and could not compete  with  the  private

sector.



<br><br><i>Revenue</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the question of financing the proposed

expenditure.  The Treasury Memorandum (Paper Misc. 4 of 1976.) compares  the  latest

revised  revenue estimates of FY 75 with revenue collected  in

FY 74. It also shows the yield we expect in FY 76.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total estimated revenue of $3,108 million for FY 76

represents  an increase of 6.7% over the revised estimate  for

FY  75.  Revenue in FY 74 was 1 5.2% more than that in FY  73.

The  revised estimate of revenue in FY 75 is 13.9%  more  than

revenue  in  FY  74. The decline in the rate  of  increase  in

revenue is inevitable. The economy slowed down in 1975.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income tax is the largest single source of revenue. It will

be particularly affected by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



recession  since collections are based on the previous  year's

earnings  not those of the coming year. For FY 76, income  tax

is expected to yield $1,200 million, barely 9.1% more than the

revised  estimates for FY 75. However, it is  expected  to  be

about 39% of total revenue for FY 76.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total revenue estimate of $3,108 million, at existing tax

rates, covers the estimated recurrent expenditure  of  $3,104

million.  There  will  be  a small  operating  surplus  of  $4

million.  Members should note that in the estimated  recurrent

expenditure  is  $625 million which goes  to  the  Development

Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development expenditure of $2,610 million, 43% more than

the revised figure for FY 75, will be financed by proceeds  of

new  loans totalling $1,280 million, both domestic and foreign

and  by  $625  million to be transferred from the Consolidated

Fund.  Investment  income  and  repayment  of  loans  made  to

statutory boards and companies in the past will also  make  up

total  development estimates. These sources  are  expected  to

cover  about  88%  of  estimated development  expenditure.  An

overall  deficit  of  $309  million  can  be  met  wholly,  if

necessary, by drawing down the Development Fund.



<br><br><i>Tax Changes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have considered a number of tax proposals. The amount of

revenue Government requires each year for recurrent as well as

development   expenditure  is  increasing  rapidly.   But   to

stimulate the economy it is necessary not to reduce purchasing

power.  I  have  therefore decided to propose only  one  small

increase in tax amounting to about $10 million per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Import duty on cigarettes will rise from $38 to $43 per

kilo. Excise duty will rise from $3.50 to $3.70 per kilo. Duty

on leaf tobacco will rise from $32 to $35 per kilo.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revision of duty will come into effect today. We are

allowing for a 8% drop in consumption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duty increase on a non-essential, indeed poisonous and

anti-social,  item like tobacco will not affect  the  cost  of

living of sensible people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 34</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The habit of smoking has been only slightly diminished in

its rise in consumption by price increases. Despite the ban on

advertisements,   and   the  well   proven   health   hazards,

consumption has gone up, although at a slower rate, especially

in  the more expensive imported cigarettes. What is deplorable

is  that the young are being seduced into smoking. We may  not

change  the  habits of the veteran smokers, who believe,  like

some of my Cabinet colleagues, that they are immunised against

lung  and  other pulmonary diseases since decades  of  smoking

have done them no harm. I wish them continued good health. But

the  young must be spared this dangerous habit. The weight  of

medical  authorities in the West are agreed that the risks  of

cancer in lungs and nasal passages increase immeasurably  with

smoking.



<br><br><i>Tax Concessions</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a number of Tax concessions to develop

Singapore further as a financial centre and promote the  Asian

Dollar Market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, fees, interest or commissions received by Asian

Currency  Units  for advising, confirming or refinancing  off-shore  letters of credit will be taxed at the reduced rate  of

10%  under  Section 43A of the Income Tax Act. This concession

will take effect from the Year of Assessment 1977.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, non-resident deposits with Asian Currency Units and

approved  Asian Dollar bonds, held by non-residents,  will  be

exempt from Singapore estate duty with effect from 1st January

1976.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, Singapore Government tax-free bonds, held by non-residents, will also be exempt from Singapore estate duty from

1st January, 1976.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after the food and commodity shortages,

price  increases and unstable exchange rates, and the measures

we  were forced to take over the past two years since the  oil

crisis, the financial policy outlined in this year's Statement

is  a relatively unexciting one. Perhaps this is just as well.

We  need a period of consolidation, for steady, unflagging, if

slower growth. We

<div align="center"><b>ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Acting Appointments)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Prime Minister if he will

state the number of posts in the various grades, including the

superscale  grades, of the Administrative Service  which  were

held  in  an  acting capacity on 1st February, 1976, grouped

under convenient periods during which the posts were so held.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> The number of posts in the various

grades  of  the Administrative Service which were held  in  an

acting capacity as on 1st February, 1976 is as follows:



<pre>

      4 in the grade of Permanent Secretary. Grade `C'

     14 in the grade of Deputy Secretary. Grade `E'

     16 in the grade of Deputy Secretary, Grade `G'

     43 in the grade of Principal Assistant Secretary

     56 in the grade of Assistant Secretary

 and 13 in the grade of Administrative Assistant.

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The acting appointments of the grades mentioned are

normally  approved  by  the Public Service  Commission  for  a

period of 6 months or a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of acting appointments in the Administrative

Service  has increased in recent years. This is because  there

are   not   enough   mature  officers  to   fill   the   posts

substantively. Many promising officers in the 30-45 age  group

had  left the service to join the private sector in the  years

of  rapid economic growth. Hence the present exercise  to  try

out able young officers in senior positions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Present position of Acting Appointments held by Administrative Officers is as follows:



<pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister's Office, with the Public Service

Commission   and  the  Establishment  Division.  Ministry   of

Finance, are in the midst of an exercise, selecting able young

officers  to  act  in exacting posts. Those who  rise  to  the

challenge will have their promotions accelerated. The task  is

to  identify talent, stretch them, and widen their  experience

through  a wider spectrum of postings. As such officers  prove

themselves,  they will be promoted and made to act  in  higher

posts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next few years, we should throw up enough officers

of  high  calibre, whose grasp of our  economic,  and  social

problems, and whose administrative capacities are such as will

enable  them  to  fill  very senior positions,  despite  their

relative youthfulness. The number of acting appointments  will

gradually decrease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of this programme depends on the PSC, with the

help of the Head of the Civil Service and the senior officers

being able to identify these able officers. And these young

officers who prove their ability and show promise of greater

capacity should not lose their balance. Then they will rise

rapidly and win the respect and confidence of their

contemporaries and even their seniors. We must fill this gap

between the few able senior officers now in the "A", "B" & "C"

superscales who are carrying a disproportionate share of the

responsibilities and the lower superscale and upper-time scale

officers.
