<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Ong Chit Chung</b> asked the Minister for Foreign

Affairs whether he will give the House an update  on  the

latest   developments   in  (i)  the   Singapore/Malaysia

bilateral talks on water; and (ii) other bilateral issues

in the package of negotiation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs  to  clarify  (a)  whether,  under   the

provisions   of  the  1961  and  1962  water  agreements,

Malaysia  has  any legal basis to ask  for  (i)  a  price

review  of  raw water after failing to do so in  the  two

years,  1986  and 1987, or (ii) a price  revision  to  be

backdated  to 1986 and 1987 and (b) if not, why Singapore

is prepared to consider a price review now.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can I have your permission

to take the first two Questions together?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Thank you. Mr Speaker, Sir, I

believe these two Questions are timely as they enable  me

to  brief  the  House on the state of play since  I  last

spoke  on this subject at the sitting on 23rd July  2002.

There  have been quite a number of developments and  much

has  been said.  I hope Members will bear with  me  as  I

take them through these developments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key developments have been:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second Ministerial Meeting in Singapore from 2-3rd September 2002;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM Goh's meeting with PM Mahathir in Putrajaya on

8th October 2002;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exchange of letters between PM Mahathir (7th October

2002) and PM Goh (14th October 2002); and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior officials' meeting in JB from 16-17th October

2002.

I will touch on each of these developments.

<br><br><i>Second  Ministerial Meeting in Singapore, 2-3rd September 2002</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On <i>price revision of water under the current

Agreements:</i>  In  July  2002 I  informed  the  House  that

Singapore's  position is that the  1961  and  1962  Water

Agreements  do  provide  for a  review  after  25  years.

However, if Malaysia wanted a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>



price  review, this should have been undertaken  in  1986

and  1987.  Notwithstanding the fact that it is 15 to  16

years   late,  we  told  the  Malaysians  at  the   First

Ministerial  Meeting  in  KL (1-2nd  July)  that  in  the

interest of making progress in our package talks, we were

prepared  to  consider Malaysia's request to discuss  the

price revision but as part of the package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the September Ministerial meeting in Singapore,

the  Malaysians  presented a formula for pricing  current

water,  which  in  effect, was based  on  our  peg  price

formula meant for future water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked them to justify this in relation to the

specific clauses in the two Agreements which set out very

clearly  the factors and criteria.   They have not  given

us  an answer.   They have also not given us an answer to

our  question on which provision in the Water  Agreements

authorised their claim for retrospective application.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reiterated our position that Johor should have

invoked  the  review clauses in 1986 and  1987  and  that

Johor  has lost its right of review.  If Malaysia insists

on  a review outside the package, Singapore will have  to

challenge every aspect of Johor's claims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia insisted that Johor had not lost its right

of  review  and  that  the matter of  price  revision  be

discussed  between  both sides but not  as  part  of  the

bilateral package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the supply of future water, Malaysia indicated

that "the detailed discussions (on a new water agreement)

should  be undertaken two years before the expiry of  the

<br><br>1962&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agreement."  As Members know, for Singapore, a  key

element of the package is the long-term supply of  water.

To  say that we should talk about this issue only in 2059

was  not  realistic and showed that they were  not  being

serious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia also wanted to delink the proposed bridge

to  replace the Causeway from the package.  We  explained

that  we saw no need for the bridge but were prepared  to

go  along  and  spend  several  hundred  million  dollars

provided it is part

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>



of  the package.  The Malaysian side wanted to delink the

bridge from the package even though the bridge was listed

as  a  package item in PM Mahathir's letter of 4th  March

2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On POA, Malaysia indicated that the KTM station

would remain in Tanjong Pagar.  While the Malaysians  did

not question the legal validity of the POA, they took the

position  that the POA would become operative only  after

the  KTM  vacates  the Tanjong Pagar  station.   This  is

contrary  to the fact that the POA is a G-to-G  agreement

which  took  effect and became operative on the  date  of

signing (ie, 27th November 1990).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On CIQ, Malaysia reversed its earlier position to

relocate  its CIQ to Johor.  Malaysia now wants  to  have

its rail CIQ in Tanjong Pagar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the Second Ministerial Meeting, both

sides agreed to have a meeting at the officials' level to

focus  on  the water issue on the understanding  that  it

would be part of the package and without prejudice to our

legal position.

<br><br><i>PM's meeting with PM Mahathir on 8th October 2002</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM Goh visited KL to participate in the World

Economic  Forum  meeting (7-8th October  2002).   PM  Goh

requested a meeting with PM Mahathir which was  fixed  on

8th  October 2002.  They discussed terrorism as  well  as

the on-going package negotiations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM Mahathir said that Malaysia wanted to "decouple

the water issue" from the other items in the package.  PM

Mahathir added that if both sides could resolve the water

issue,  the other issues could then be resolved.  PM  Goh

explained why all items had to be taken as a package.  If

water were taken out of the package, then Singapore would

have less leeway to make concessions on other issues, for

example, the POA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On revision of price of water under the current

Agreements,  PM Goh said that Singapore was agreeable  to

discuss this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>



but  as  part  of  the package.  The two Prime  Ministers

expressed hope that the officials meeting to be  held  on

16-17th October would make progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately after the meeting on 8th October 02,

Foreign  Minister Syed Hamid announced to the media  that

Singapore had accepted "Malaysia's prerogative to  review

the  water rates" and that Singapore had agreed to delink

water  from the package. This was a gross distortion,  as

the  two  Prime Ministers never discussed  the  issue  of

legal  right  of Malaysia.  PM Goh had only agreed  to  a

discussion  of  price revision of water as  part  of  the

package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press Secretary to PM therefore clarified on 8th

October 2002 that the legal point about Malaysia's  right

to  review the price of water had not even been discussed

by  the  two  Prime Ministers.  Singapore's position  was

that Malaysia has lost the legal right for reviewing  the

price  of water under the current Agreements 15-16  years

later  but  Singapore was prepared  to  discuss  a  price

revision as part of the bilateral package.

<br><br><i>PM  Mahathir's  letter of 7th October and PM's  reply  of 14th October 2002</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 10th October, two days after PM Goh's meeting

with  PM Mahathir, he received a letter from PM Mahathir.

It  was  dated 7th October, that is, one day  before  his

meeting with PM Goh, and sent by a Third Party Note dated

9th  October from Wisma Putra which we received  on  10th

October.  In his letter, PM Mahathir told PM Goh that  he

was discontinuing the package.  He wrote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The approach that both sides had adopted so far in

dealing with the outstanding issues in a package, has not

yielded  any  meaningful  results.   In  view  of   this,

Malaysia  has  now  decided to  discontinue  the  package

approach  and  to  give  the highest  priority  to  first

resolving the long-delayed water issue, particularly  the

price   review  of  raw  water.   Once  this   issue   is

satisfactorily and amicably resolved, I am confident that

Malaysia and Singapore would be able to move forward much

faster  in  finding  solutions to the  other  outstanding

issues that stand in the way of our bilateral relations."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>



Members   should  note  two  important  aspects   of   PM

Mahathir's letter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the letter was dated 7th October, ie,

written one day before PM Goh met PM Mahathir.  But  this

letter was never mentioned at the meeting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the discontinuation of the package was a

unilateral  Malaysian decision.  It was  not  a  proposal

that was put to PM Goh for consideration.  PM Goh was not

asked if he agrees with this new approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM Goh replied to PM Mahathir's letter on 14th

October  2002  to remind PM Mahathir that they  both  had

agreed on a package approach, as PM Mahathir himself  had

acknowledged  in his letter, and this was  why  Singapore

had  been  prepared to make concessions.   But  now  that

Malaysia  has unilaterally discontinued the  package  and

wants  Singapore to deal with the water issue separately,

trade-offs  would no longer be possible  and  each  issue

would  have to be dealt with individually based on  their

stand-alone merits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM Goh said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As you wrote in the opening sentence of your letter

of  7  October, you and I had reached a decision  'on  27

December  1998  in Hanoi for Malaysia and  Singapore,  to

resolve, once and for all, the outstanding issues between

our  two countries in a package.'  In other words, we had

agreed  to trade-off, in a package, the benefits to  each

other  from  the  various  issues,  namely,  water,  POA,

airspace, CPF and the bridge to replace the Causeway."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM Goh added:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I had been prepared to make concessions in varying

the  POA  with  extra pieces of land, allowing  an  early

withdrawal of CPF deposits, and building our part of  the

bridge  to replace the Causeway at our expense, as trade-offs, so that you could give us airspace and future water

at  a  fair  price.  Regarding water, you had written  in

your  letter of February 2001 that Johor believed that  a

fair price for raw water was 60 sen".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing, PM Goh stated:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Since you now want to deal with the water issue

separately  and  discontinue the package approach,  these

trade-offs  are no longer possible.  And as  the  package

deal  is off, I have instructed my officials to deal with

water  and  the other issues individually and separately,

on their stand-alone merits, and no longer

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>



as  a  package.   I  hope  our officials  can  make  some

progress at their coming meeting with your new approach".



Since  PM  Mahathir had not mentioned the  fact  of  this

letter  when  the two Prime Ministers met on 8th  October

2002, PM Goh in his reply said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Had you, at our 8 October meeting, told me that you

had  already written and signed this letter on 7 October,

I  would have elaborated on the pros and cons of your new

approach.   We  would then have jointly  decided  on  the

basis upon which our officials would negotiate."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have referred to this

correspondence  at some length because  there  have  been

many statements in the Malaysian media and from Malaysian

politicians  that  have deliberately misrepresented  what

transpired  at  this  meeting  between  PM  Goh  and   PM

Mahathir. Here is a sampling:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM Mahathir was reported to have said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is very clear. As I understood it, Goh Chok

Tong  agreed that there should be a review and a  formula

to determine the price of water." and "Singapore's denial

of what had been agreed would only complicate the talks."

[Utusan Malaysia, 12th October 2002]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign Minister Syed Hamid was reported to have

commented on Press Secretary to PM Goh's clarification on

8th October 2002:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We think our comprehension of the language (sic

English) is very reasonable (but) every time we  come  to

an  understanding,  they  later deny  it."  [New  Straits

Times, 14th October 2002]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These statements have impugned PM Goh's integrity

and  imply  that PM Goh was not telling the  truth  about

what  transpired  during his meeting  with  PM  Mahathir.

Singapore's leaders stand by their words. It  is  in  our

fundamental  interest to preserve our  credibility.   The

Malaysians also alleged that the package was discontinued

because  Singapore  always wanted to  discuss  the  water

issue  only, as can be seen from the quotes that  I  read

out.   It was Malaysia that unilaterally discontinued the

package.     And it was Malaysia that wanted  to  discuss

only water.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Senior  Officials'  Meeting in Johor  Baru  from  16-17th October 2002</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although PM Mahathir's letter announcing the

discontinuation of the package came just days before  the

Senior  Officials' meeting of 16-17th  October  in  Johor

Baru  on  the  water issue, our officials still  attended

that  meeting in good faith.  We were prepared to discuss

all aspects of the water issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, at the Johor Baru meeting, Malaysia was

only  prepared  to  engage in discussions  on  the  price

review  of current water, as evident from the wording  of

their  agenda  and the banner.  They amended  these  only

after  we  protested  and stressed that  the  discussions

should also be on treated water and the future supply  of

water to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia presented the same pricing formula for

current  water  as  at  the Second  Ministerial  Meeting,

namely, the price of raw water today as the average  cost

of  desalinated water and NEWater less the treatment cost

in  Johor.  We took the position that Malaysia  had  lost

the right of review, and even if Singapore was willing to

consider such a review, it would have to be based on  the

express  provisions  or  factors  listed  in  the  review

clauses.   The  Malaysians again could not justify  their

pricing  formula  for  current  water  under  the  review

clauses in the existing Water Agreements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reminded them that the provisions in the Water

Agreements  allow for a price review using the  rise  and

fall  in  the purchasing power of money and the rise  and

fall  in the cost of labour, power and materials for  the

purpose  of  supplying  the  water,  and  there  are   no

provisions for retrospective payments.  Since PUB  incurs

all  these costs, the only relevant factor is the  change

in  the  purchasing power of money.  Using the  Malaysian

Consumer  Price  Index  (MCPI), we  calculated  that  the

revised price of raw water would be no more than  12  sen

per  thousand gallons.  But we made it clear to them that

the  12  sen was not an offer but a calculation based  on

the  review  clauses.  The Malaysians asked if  we  could

consider going

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>

beyond  the  figure of 12 sen.   They  pointed  out  that

Singapore  had  previously  offered  45  sen.   We   said

Singapore could not go beyond the review clauses  and  we

had no leeway to make any concessions because the package

is off due to PM Mahathir's letter of 7th October 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On treated water, we informed the Malaysians that if

we  applied  the MCPI to the review of price  of  treated

water,  we  would  get a figure around RM2  per  thousand

gallons.    Again, we made it clear that this was not  an

offer.  It was our calculation going by the terms of  the

review clauses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On future water, ie, post-2061, the Malaysians

actually  were  not interested or serious in  wanting  to

have  any detailed discussions.  They continued  to  take

the  position that both sides could discuss the issue two

years  before  the  expiry of  the  1962  Agreement.   We

stressed  that  this was not a realistic  proposal.   Our

position  is  that  current water and  future  water  are

linked  and  we  cannot discuss price review  of  current

water now and future water only in 2059.  It is difficult

for Singapore to agree to Malaysia's proposal because  we

need  to  plan  our  long-term  needs  well  in  advance.

Singapore  would need to work out in detail  the  complex

issues  involved  in regard to a future water  agreement,

including water demand management, capacity building  and

technological advances.

<br><br><i>Price Review</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng has asked questions specifically on the

review  clauses in the Water Agreements.   She  wants  to

know whether Malaysia has any legal basis to ask for this

price review after failing to do so in 1986 and 1987, and

if  they have any legal basis also to backdate such price

revision; and if not, she asks why is Singapore  prepared

to consider a price review now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My answer is that we have been advised that they do

not have a legal basis.  I do not want to go into all the

legal arguments

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>

here.   But  let me say that we have taken legal  advice.

That  is  why we maintain that they have lost  the  legal

right.   And  even if they have the right to  review  the

water  price  now,  there  is  no  legal  basis  in   the

Agreements to backdate it.  We also added that  if  there

were  to  be  any  review, it must logically  also  cover

treated water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they have no legal basis, Ms Irene Ng asks: why

are we prepared to discuss it?  Well, Sir, the answer  to

that  question is that they have said it is important  to

them.   We  said:  alright,  we  understand  that  it  is

important to you and we are prepared to discuss  as  part

of the package but not as your legal entitlement.  In the

same  way  as we do not have a legal right to  insist  on

airspace rights and we do not have a legal right  to  ask

for  water supply after the expiry of the 1961  and  1962

Water Agreements when they expire in 2011 and 2061.   But

let  us,  nevertheless, take the approach  of  trying  to

accommodate each other's concerns as best as we  can  for

reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our position on price review is clear. Malaysia has

lost its right of review.  If Malaysia claims that it has

the  right  now  to  invoke the review clauses,  we  will

contest it.

<br><br><i>Concluding Remarks</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, from what I have said, Members can

see  that  there have been many twists and turns  in  our

negotiations with Malaysia.  If I may sum up:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, both Prime Ministers agreed on the package

approach  in  1998  to  resolve the  outstanding  issues,

including  the long-term supply of water, CPF,  POA,  CIQ

and airspace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, the Malaysians wanted to include the bridge

to replace the Causeway.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we said we are prepared to spend several

hundred millions to build our part of the bridge as  part

of the package, they said the bridge is no longer part of

the package.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000, they said price revision of water under the

current  agreement (which was never part of the  original

package  agreed by PM) should be included in the package.

In  February  2001, Malaysia had informed us that  "Johor

believes that a fair price would be 60 sen".  We had then

counter-proposed 45 sen for current water and 60 sen  for

future  water.  An in-principle agreement was reached  on

this in September 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in its letter of 4th March 2002, Malaysia

changed  its position and tabled new proposals, including

raising  the  price of current raw water  to  RM3.   This

meant  that they rejected our 45 sen offer.  Consequently

it was no longer on the table.  We have told them so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the Malaysians wanted water to be taken out of

the package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, six days before the Senior Officials'

Meeting,  we  received PM Mahathir's letter stating  that

the "package is discontinued."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then at the Johor Baru meeting (16-17th October

2002),  Malaysia went further to take the  position  that

the  water  issue  involves only the  price  revision  of

current  water  and  that, as  far  as  future  water  is

concerned,  we  can  discuss this  two  years  before  it

expires in 2061.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, at present, Mr Speaker, because Malaysia has

unilaterally  called  off  the package,  the  concessions

which  Singapore was prepared to offer, for  example,  on

the  POA, the bridge, the CPF, are off and each issue has

to be discussed and agreed on its stand-alone merits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the usual barrage of accusations,

allegations as well as threats continue to be  hurled  at

us.   This  includes the threat last week that  they  can

enact  a new law to render the Water Agreements null  and

void.    As   usual,  we  are  also  accused   of   being

"insincere",  and  that we are told to  be  "sincere"  by

accepting  their demands.  As I have repeatedly  said  in

this  House, we should take the Malaysian criticisms  and

attacks  against us in our stride.  There is no  need  to

over-react to these pressures and efforts to intimidate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>

us.   We  will continue to state the facts and stand  our

ground, in a quiet but serious manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think it is a pity that they have taken

matters to this point.  We have expended a great deal  of

time and effort in trying to reach a win-win solution for

both  sides.  Since December 1998 when PM Goh agreed,  at

the  request of PM Mahathir, that the outstanding  issues

be  discussed  as  a package, we have  had  three  Senior

Officials' Meetings in 1999, and two Ministerial Meetings

this  year.  Senior Minister had visited KL twice (August

2000  and September 2001) to see how to move the  package

forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, let me say that the sooner we can put

these  issues behind us the better.  As PM  Goh  told  PM

Mahathir  on  8th  October 2002, Malaysia  and  Singapore

really face very serious problems in the region posed  by

terrorism.   It is in the interest of both  countries  to

settle  these bilateral issues so that we can  deal  with

the  real  threats and problems that confront us  in  the

region.

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> Sir, first, I want to

thank the Minister for a very comprehensive answer.  Very

clearly,  the twists and turns in the Malaysian  position

have  made negotiations extremely difficult.  Try  as  we

must and try as we will.  In this context, I want to  ask

the  Minister  what will happen next in our negotiations.

Will there be further Senior Officials'

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>



Meeting  or  Ministerial  Meeting?   And  what  will   be

Singapore's position and approach in these future  series

of meetings?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, to answer Dr Ong Chit Chung,

I  would  say  that  the  ball is  in  Malaysia's  court.

Because at the Second Ministerial Meeting in Singapore in

September,  Foreign Minister Syed Hamid said  that  after

the   Senior  Officials  reported  the  outcome  of   the

discussions to the two Ministers, both sides  would  then

decide  on a date for the next Ministerial Meeting  which

Malaysia  would be prepared to host.  He said this.   But

we  have not heard from Malaysia on any follow-up meeting

to  discuss  the water and other issues after the  recent

Senior Officials' Meeting in Johor Baru.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Singapore is concerned, we stand ready to

meet  them  to  discuss the water issue  further  and  to

continue the negotiations.  But I should stress that  the

negotiations  cannot be on the basis  that:  please  show

your  sincerity by caving in to our demands.  If you want

to  talk  about water, I think Malaysia has  to  be  very

serious.   We  understand  Malaysia's  priority   is   to

increase the price of current raw water.  That is why  we

have  said  that  we  are prepared to discuss  the  price

revision  of  water, even though our stand is  that  they

have  lost the legal right.  But they, at the same  time,

must show seriousness in discussing future water and  not

fob  us  off by saying that we can discuss this in  2059,

just  two  years  before the expiry  of  the  1962  Water

Agreement.  So I would say Singapore's position  is  that

we  are  committed to seeking a solution to  resolve  the

water  issue and other bilateral issues but we cannot  go

by  vague assurances from Malaysia that it is prepared to

supply future water to Singapore because, as I have said,

we  must plan our long term water needs in advance.   And

we  have to work out the details years before the  expiry

of  the  2062  Agreement, issues  such  as  water  demand

management and capacity building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to what our approach will be, from my main

answer, it is quite clear that by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>



abandoning   the  package,  Malaysia  has   fundamentally

changed  the  basis of the bilateral talks.   Singapore's

position  has  always  been on the  basis  of  a  package

approach  and, in his letter of 14th October 2002,  Prime

Minister  Goh  made  it  clear that  since  Malaysia  had

decided to discontinue the package, each issue will  have

to  be discussed on its stand-alone merits, and it is not

possible to maintain our previous concessions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in future, Singapore has no choice but to deal

with  the water and other issues individually on a stand-alone basis.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Marine Parade):</b> Could I ask the

Minister  what is Singapore's position with regard  to  a

preposterous  statement made by a Malaysian  Minister  by

the  name of Mr Rais Yatim, that Malaysia would  enact  a

local law to make the Water Agreements null and void?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I think honourable Members will

recall  that,  last week, my Ministry actually  issued  a

statement  on those remarks by Minister Rais Yatim.   The

Ministry  of Foreign Affairs statement pointed  out  that

what  Minister  Rais Yatim said was not  in  accord  with

repeated assurances by Malaysian leaders that they  would

honour  the  1961 and 1962 agreements until the  date  of

expiry.   These assurances actually date back many  years

ago  and  have been repeated very recently.  In fact,  in

1988, Prime Minister Mahathir said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We cannot set aside the treaty (referring to the

water  agreements) as it is an agreement between the  two

countries registered with the United Nations.  We  cannot

break our word."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is from Malaysia's Business Times of 23rd

January 1988, also carried in Singapore's Straits Times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, this year, Dr Mahathir said in the New Straits

Times  of 3rd May that Malaysia was "bound" by the  water

agreements and "cannot just break the agreements".  Prime

Minister Mahathir also said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fact is, according to the agreements, we,

Malaysia, must supply them with water.  We will continue.

We promise them that we will supply them with water."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Foreign Minister Syed Hamid, in his opening

statement at the talks held in Kuala Lumpur in July 2002,

said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Malaysia has repeatedly said that it will honour

the  1961 and 1962 agreements until their expiry in  2011

and 2061 respectively."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"During the Separation of Singapore, Malaysia did

not  propose  for  the agreements  to  be  reviewed.   It

continues  to honour the agreements, and such  commitment

is further reinforced when Malaysia signed the Separation

Agreement in 1965."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in answer to Mr Ravindran, I would say that

these  clearly are then legally binding agreements  which

were  guaranteed  by  both  governments  under  the  1965

Separation Agreement.  And, as Prime Minister Goh said in

Parliament  in April this year, the Separation  Agreement

is fundamental to Singapore's existence as an independent

nation  and  has  been registered at the United  Nations.

So,  any attempt to repudiate the guarantees set  out  in

the  Separation Agreement, any attempt to vary the  terms

of  the  Water Agreements without the express consent  of

both  governments,  will  be  a  serious  breach  of  the

Separation Agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his specific proposal of enacting a law, let me

say  that  Malaysia cannot enact a domestic law to  avoid

meeting  its international treaty obligations.  Actually,

this  is  a  very established principle of  international

law.   If a country can get out of one treaty obligations

through the use of domestic law, it signals to the  world

that  it  can  and will do so for any other international

agreements,  and  this will destroy the sanctity  of  all

international agreements.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Will the Minister

comment  on our position in referring the water issue  to

international arbitration, as has been proposed  by  some

Malaysian leaders?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Indeed, Sir, I have noted that

both Foreign Minister Syed Hamid and the Menteri Besar of

Johor have referred to this.  I believe that is what  has

prompted Mr Sin's question.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign Minister Syed Hamid did say that if the

talks on water ended in a stalemate, his government  will

refer the matter to the Permanent Court of Arbitration at

The  Hague.   Johor Menteri Besar Abdul Ghani  also  said

that the Water Agreements provided an option for Malaysia

to refer the matter to the Permanent Court of Arbitration

if the talks failed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if both sides cannot agree through negotiations

on  the water issue, then we are ready to have the matter

referred to the PCA for international arbitration.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</b> Can I ask

the  Minister if the price review clauses provided for  a

review after 25 years, have the Malaysians ever explained

why  they  did  not raise the issue of price  review  all

these years and why have they only done so recently?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> They have not explained officially

why  they  did  not raise it before.  I think  honourable

Members would have noted that they have publicly admitted

that it was not a mistake and it was not an oversight but

a  deliberate move.  Johor State Assembly Speaker, Zainal

Abidin  Mohd  Zain, said in the State Assembly  that  the

Johor  State  Government had not made a  mistake  in  not

pressing for a review in 1986.  He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"There was no point in doing so because Johor was

dependent on Singapore for its treated water supply,  and

Singapore would have also increased its price of  treated

water sold to Johor."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

This was in the New Straits Times of 3rd July this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Mahathir also said that Malaysia did not revise

the water pricing when it was due then because it thought

that  Singapore  would also revise the price  of  treated

water  supplied to Malaysia.  This was in  Bernama,  11th

October   this   year.    In  other   words,   they   had

deliberately, as a matter of conscious policy, chosen not

to  review  the  price of water in 1986/1987.   Actually,

even up to the point of the 1990 Agreement concerning the

Linggiu  Dam  and related matters being signed,  Malaysia

did not raise any issue concerning the price of 3 sen per

thousand gallons of raw

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>



water.   I  think  the  reason was  obvious.   Johor  was

benefitting handsomely from the 50 sen it was  paying  to

Singapore for treated water under the 1961 and 1962 Water

Agreements.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> In view of the twists

and  turns  on  the issue of the ongoing negotiations,  I

would like to ask the Minister what is his assessment on:

1)  the  overall current relations between Singapore  and

Malaysia;  and,  2) what is the medium-term  prospect  of

Singapore  and  Malaysia reaching a  mutually  beneficial

agreement?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the water

negotiations or the package negotiations are only one  of

the facets of our overall relations with Malaysia.  It is

not the sum total of our relationship with Malaysia.   As

Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the other day,

we  will persevere and try to have discussions going but,

if  we  cannot  agree, it does not mean the  end  of  the

relationship.    There   are   other   aspects   of   the

relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the medium-term prospect of resolving this?

It   is   very  difficult  to  predict.   I  have  stated

Singapore's  readiness  to continue.   Like  all  Foreign

Ministers, I think one has to be optimistic, whatever the

obstacles and hurdles, and we will persevere as  best  as

we can, but it must be on a certain basis.  It must be on

the  basis  of  reciprocity, it must be on the  basis  of

mutual  benefit, and it cannot be on the basis of a  one-sided approach to the negotiations.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee (Sembawang):</b> Could the Minister

comment on reports that Malaysian leaders have said that,

yes,  they are prepared to supply water to us,  but  only

for human consumption and not for ships and industry?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Actually, if one studied the Water

Agreements,  there is no such restriction  stipulated  in

the  Water  Agreements.  For today, I have brought  along

several quotes on various matters.  I have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>

a  quote  here  which shows that Prime Minister  Mahathir

himself has admitted as much, because he said at a  press

conference with Senior Minister Lee on 4th September 2001

and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Malaysia's policy is to supply Singapore with water

for  the needs of the people of Singapore, including  the

industries.   We will not cut off water for  so  long  as

Singapore needs the water.  Whatever may be the terms, we

will  negotiate the cost, the price and all that [he  was

referring to the negotiations on future water] but  there

will be no cutting off of water supply to Singapore."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr S Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we seem

to   have  accepted  the  unilateral  decision   by   the

Malaysians  to discontinue the package negotiations,  and

the  Minister's account of the negotiation on  the  water

issue  individually  appears to sound  intractable.   The

question  is:  is it worth our while perhaps  to  have  a

cooling-off period, giving the Malaysians time to reflect

on  the  value of the package negotiations and the merits

of that, and then to revisit the matter?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> As I said, the ball is in their

court.   Foreign  Minister Syed  Hamid  did  say  at  the

conclusion of the last Ministerial talks that  after  the

officials have reported, Malaysia is prepared to host the

next  Ministerial meeting.  So, how quickly they  respond

to us will depend on whether they also want a cooling-off

period or not.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister

to  confirm whether the Malaysians are buying more  water

than  what  they  are obliged to buy under  the  existing

Water  Agreements with Singapore.  Secondly, if so,  what

is  the  price,  as well as the quantity  that  they  are

taking  which is extra, ie, beyond what they are  obliged

to take?  Thirdly, can the Minister confirm whether it is

true  that  the  Malaysians are actually  buying  treated

water  at  50 sen from Singapore and selling  it  to  the

Malaysian  public  at  about RM4  and,  in  the  process,

profiteering  at Singapore's subsidy, and  then,  at  the

same  time,  attacking Singapore that  we  are  the  ones

profiteering at their expense?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> A lot of allegations have been

made about Singapore profiteering, selling to industries,

profiteering  from the treated water.  We have  made  the

facts  known before.  The first point to realise is  that

what Malaysia does not say is that the raw water that  we

get  from  them is not drinkable as such.  It has  to  be

treated.   And when it is treated, it is at the  cost  of

RM2.40  per thousand gallons, and we sell it to Johor  at

50  sen.  Therefore, Singapore is really absorbing RM1.90

of  the cost.  Malaysia then sells this treated water  at

RM3.95  per  thousand  gallons.   So,  we  can  make  the

calculations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the Member's question, Singapore is

only  obliged, under the Agreements, to sell  17  million

gallons  a day (mgd) of treated water.  That is  what  we

are  obliged  to.   But  Malaysia buys  well  above  that

amount.  They buy 37 mgd of treated water, well above the

amount  that  Singapore  is  contracted  to  provide  and

calculations make it clear as to why they are doing that.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Sir, we know that

there  are a lot of accusations that the Malaysians  have

given.  One of the things that the Malaysians had alleged

is  that the 3 sen price was fixed by the British in 1927

because   they  favoured  Singapore.   Can  the  Minister

clarify   whether  there  is  any  basis  for   such   an

allegation?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, there is no basis. We have

also, at one previous occasion, rebutted this point.  The

Members are right.  Malaysia has repeatedly said that the

Water  Agreements, including the 3 sen price, was settled

by  the British who favoured Singapore.  Dr Mahathir, for

example,  had said that the Water Agreement drawn  up  by

the  British  was  in  favour of  Singapore  because  the

British advised the Johor government then.  This  is  not

true.   As  we  have  pointed out in our  own  MFA  press

statement in January 2002:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Tebrau and Scudai Rivers Water Agreement and

the  Johor River Water Agreement were signed by the Johor

State  Government and the City Council  of  Singapore  in

1961  and 1962 respectively.  By then, Malaya was already

an independent and sovereign

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>



nation.   Singapore  had achieved  self-government.   How

could  the  British play any role in an  independent  and

sovereign  Malaya?  Would the federal  government  of  an

independent  and sovereign Malaya allow the  Johor  State

Government  to  sign  any  agreement  that  was   against

Malaysia's national interest?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add two further points. Firstly, Malaysia

had  agreed in 1965, when we separated, to guarantee  the

observance of the Water Agreements, and this guarantee is

enshrined  in the Separation Agreement.  Secondly,  Johor

confirmed  the price of 3 sen in 1990 when it signed  the

agreement  with PUB for the construction of  the  Linggiu

Dam.   Had Johor exercised its right to review the  price

in  accordance with the agreement in 1986 and  1987,  the

PUB  would  have  taken that revised price  into  account

before  proceeding to invest in the building of  the  dam

and  all ancillary works that actually amount to some S$1

billion.   Therefore,  it is simply ridiculous  to  claim

that  the British fixed these Water Agreements in  favour

of Singapore against the interest of Johor.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Speaker, I would like to go

back  to  the earlier response by the Minister.  I  would

like  to  ask the Minister whether or not we are  selling

the  Malaysians, for the amount that is in excess of  our

obligations under the Water Agreements, treated water  at

a  price  of  50  sen per thousand gallons.   If  we  are

selling  them  at  50 sen per thousand  gallons  for  the

amount  that  is in excess of our obligations  under  the

agreements, why are we not selling them at a price  which

is sufficient for us to cover our cost of treatment?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Then we will be accused of

profiteering, will we not?

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> I would like to ask

the  Minister  whether  in the treaty  agreement  between

Singapore  and  Malaysia  that  was  established  by  the

British,  were there any treaties that were  biasedly  in

favour  of  Malaysia, for instance, the use of rail  road

land   in  Singapore  where  Singaporeans  had   no   say

whatsoever on the use of the land as long as it  is  used

by Malaysian railway?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> That is a good point which I will

consider using in future negotiations.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> I would like to ask

the  Minister  whether  he could  clarify  on  the  Water

Agreement on the Linggiu Dam.  Could he throw some  light

on  it  and whether this Water Agreement would  have  any

impact on our future discussions?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> If the Member is interested in

further  information  and details of  the  terms  of  the

agreement, I would be happy to provide her with the facts

later.  I do not have the agreement with me here.  On the

second  part of her question whether the agreement  would

have an impact on future discussions, no, because what we

are  discussing now are really agreements for  supply  of

water  after  the expiry of the 1962 Water Agreement  and

the  Malaysians on their part want to discuss  the  price

review  of  current water under the 1961 and  1962  Water

Agreements.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister  whether the Malaysians are well  aware  of  the

development  of NEWater and that it is now acceptable  in

Singapore and whether they have factored this into  their

negotiations.   Also,  have  they  taken  note   of   our

announcement earlier that when the first Water  Agreement

ends  in  2011, we are prepared to let it lapse  and  not

pursue further?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Yes, they know of our plans. In

fact,  in  the July talks in Putrajaya, we  gave  them  a

briefing  on the whole NEWater process and  so  on.   But

whether  they  have factored it or not, we do  not  know.

But the point is that their formula for current water  is

based  on  our formula, which is meant for future  water.

The answer to your question is, yes, we have given them a

briefing on our NEWater plans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, since the

Malaysians have made the unilateral decision to drop  the

package approach and we are also quite

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>



comfortable that we do not need the renewal of  the  2011

supply,  why  do we not make a unilateral  decision  down

here  not  to  talk  about water anymore  with  Malaysia?

Because we are leading them on by making them think  that

there  is room for price increase when actually  that  is

not  in  our agreement.  So we might as well end it  down

here and say that we will talk about other things but not

water.  Would the Minister consider that?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> So long as it is possible to

continue the talks, I think my position would be:  let us

continue  the talks.  I do not think we have reached  the

position that Singapore should take the approach  of  not

talking.   For  example, take the  situation  when  Prime

Minister   Mahathir's   letter   came   on   unilaterally

discontinuing the package. We could have decided and said

that, in that case, we are not going to Johor Baru.   But

I  think, in good faith, we showed that we are reasonable

and  went  to Johor Baru to discuss both aspects  of  the

water  issue.   This  has been our approach,  as  Members

would  have  seen in this whole saga, that although  they

said  that  we  have been unreasonable and we  have  been

delaying,  the  facts that I have unfolded  today  should

make  it  clear to everyone that we have gone  the  extra

mile.  We have tried to accommodate their concerns.  They

are  the  ones  who  keep changing  the  goalposts,  keep

changing  the parameters. The package - did  not  include

the  bridge,  then it is included, then it is  out;  then

never  included raw water, price revision in; then  water

is  out,  and  even  when it is out,  it  is  only  price

revision, and future water discussed after some of us  or

most  of  us are dead.  So, the point I want to make  is:

as   far   as   there   is  scope  for  discussions,   my

recommendation is we continue to talk.  But it must be on

a basis of reciprocity and with the objective of having a

mutually beneficial pact.

<br><br><!-- Mr Arthur Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Arthur Fong (West Coast):</b> May I ask the

Minister,  in  view  of the recent revelations  that  the

Jemaah Islamiyah is actually playing on the sentiments of

both countries and amongst them, the water issues and all

that, with these constant flip-flops

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>



on  the  Malaysian  Government  side  and  the  newspaper

reports from time to time in Malaysia playing on this, is

that  not  still  playing into the hands  of  the  larger

Jemaah  Islamiyah plans?  Can the Government  impress  on

the media to be more responsible?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> That is the ideal solution. In

fact,  that  is  the message which we have  been  giving,

which  Prime  Minister Goh conveyed to Dr  Mahathir  that

there  are very major and serious issues confronting  the

region,  confronting Malaysia and Singapore, and  instead

of  keeping  this  on the boil and being  unresolved,  we

should  really join forces together with other  countries

in  the  region to address these bigger issues.   Let  us

hope that this approach will also be a shared view by the

leaders of that country.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> The Minister has

made  it clear that the 12 sen figure being bandied about

is  not  an  offer  put on the table by  Singapore.   But

Malaysian leaders have said that Singapore has  cut  back

its  offer  from 45 sen to 12 sen.  I have two questions.

First,  does  the  Minister sense that  there  is  a  big

communication gap between Malaysia and Singapore when  it

comes to negotiations?  Second, is Singapore prepared  to

put  an  offer  on  the table for water  if  Malaysia  is

prepared to consider, for instance, future water?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Some of these are hypothetical and

I  do not want to speculate too much.  The  answer to the

second  part  of Ms Irene Ng's question is that  we  have

made  it clear what our position is on current water  but

we  have  also  said  that the two issues  are  linked  - current  and  future water.  But they will have  to  show

that  they are serious in discussing future water  if  we

are to advance or make any progress.  For so long as they

say:   future  water, please take our assurance  that  we

will  continue to supply you water, but we can only  talk

about  it  in 2059, then it is really not practicable  to

talk on that basis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, I

would like to ask the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>



Minister  that upon lapsing of the first Water  Agreement

in  2011,  what is the amount of treated water  Singapore

will remain obligated to supply Malaysia?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> That reminds me that I have

forgotten  to answer Dr Ong Chit Chung's question.   Yes,

we  did  indicate to them that, as far as the 1961  Water

Agreement is concerned, we can let it lapse, if need  be.

When  we talk about future water, that is the 1962  Water

Agreement, which will be our basis of negotiations,  then

it  is  water  after  the expiry of 2062  deadline.   The

answer  to  your question is whatever are the  provisions

for  supplying  of  water under the  current  agreements,

after  the  1961 agreement, we will continue to  provide.

We will keep our side of the bargain.

<br><br><!-- Dr Warren Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Warren Lee:</b> Would the Minister comment, if we

pursue  the  question  of negotiations  and  come  to  an

agreement, whether such negotiations and agreements would

not suffer the same fate as the 1990 POA?  How sure would

we be that any bargain struck would be kept?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would not want

to  venture into speculation as to "what if" and  so  on,

because  it does not really aid our discussions  on  this

matter.  We have to proceed on the basis, and that is the

only basis that we can proceed, whether on this agreement

or  any  other agreement, when an agreement is concluded,

we  must  expect that it will be honoured and  its  terms

fulfilled.   We will fulfill our part of the bargain  and

we  expect any other countries with which we have entered

an agreement to observe the provisions of the agreement.

by the Australian Government after the Bali bomb incident

on 12th October 2002.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Foreign

Affairs  has  raised  the issue several  times  with  the

Australian  government  through its  High  Commission  in

Singapore  and  directly with the Department  of  Foreign

Affairs  and  Trade  in  Canberra.  We  have  asked   the

Australians  to  explain the basis  on  which  they  have

concluded that Singapore is a country with high  security

risk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Australians have admitted that they do not have

any  new intelligence to suggest a greater security  risk

in  Singapore.  The information available is of a generic

nature  indicating that there is a greater likelihood  of

terrorist  incidents in Southeast Asia in general.   This

was  well  known prior to the 12th October Bali terrorist

attack.   The  Australian High Commissioner in  Singapore

has  admitted that Australia did not have any information

relating to a specific threat in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the Bali terrorist attack in which so many

Australian  citizens  tragically lost  their  lives,  the

Australian government is politically compelled to be seen

to  be doing something.  As Prime Minister Goh Chok  Tong

said,  while he could "understand why the Australians  do

so, because they are looking at the whole region ....  it

is totally unfair to put Singapore on the list".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are puzzled and disappointed that in the absence

of  specific  intelligence on a threat in Singapore,  the

Australian   government   has   reacted   in   such    an

undifferentiated way.  We have told the Australians  that

this  could be counter-productive.  Terrorism is a global

threat.  Post 9/11, this global threat has certainly been

enhanced.  Indeed, the media has reported the presence of

JI  cells in some of Australia's major cities.  We do not

think  that   undifferentiated and  alarmist  assessments

serve   to   advance  our  common  commitment  to   fight

terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to press our concerns home to the

Australians.  The Australian

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>



government has told us that they understand our  concerns

and they will keep the matter under review.  We hope that

the   Australian  government  will  correct  its   travel

advisory as soon as possible.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, what would be the impact on

Singapore  in terms of perception by the other countries,

because  we are being listed by Australia as a  high-risk

country?

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in terms

of  the  economic  impact,  I will  leave  it  to  Senior

Minister  of State Tharman as he will be answering  after

this and he will go into greater detail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short answer is that it is unhelpful. It

creates  greater uncertainty in the region.  I think  the

war  against terrorism is one that should be  fought  not

just  through  guns  but  through  butter.   And  it   is

important  that one does not over-react and  be  alarmist

about  it,  because it erodes confidence in  the  region.

What  is  critical  for the economy is  confidence.   And

having  an  alarmist assessment of the security situation

in this part of the world is, as I said, unhelpful.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, has the Australian

government  responded to our concern  that  we  impressed

upon them?

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat:</b> As I said, they have

taken  note of our concern.  What is important is for  us

to  continue to press our concerns and to make it  public

that  we think their assessment of the security situation

in  Singapore  is  unwarranted.  I think  there  are  two

metrics   here  in  which  we  can  assess  the  security

situation  in  a  country.  One is  whether  or  not  the

security agencies are on top of it.  And in our case,  we

believe   that   our  security  agencies  have   severely

disrupted the JI network in Singapore.  The other  metric

is   the  extent  of  the  resident  terrorist  asset  in

Singapore, whether it is high or whether it is  low,  and

this  is  related  to  the first  metric.   Our  security

agencies  are effective and they have severely  disrupted

and crippled the terrorist network.  And I would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>

think that it is much safer than in a place which has not

done so.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Minister for

Trade  and Industry on the Ministry's assessment  of  (I)

the  impact  of  the Bali bomb blast on South-east  Asian

economies  in  general  and  the  Singapore  economy   in

particular;  and  (ii)  the  outlook  for  the  Singapore

economy in the next six to twelve months.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Minister for Trade

and  Industry, in view of the weak flash estimates of the

gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  figures  for  the  third

quarter, whether he will give an update on the status and

outlook  of  the Singapore economy and what measures  are

being undertaken or considered to stimulate the economy.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mdm Halimah Yacob</b> asked the Minister for Trade

and  Industry  what is the Ministry's projection  of  the

economic outlook for the fourth quarter of this  year  as

well as for next year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam (Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam) (for the Minister for Trade and Industry):</b> Mr Speaker, could I have your permission

to  take  Question Nos. 4, 5 and 6 together as  they  are

related?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, the outlook for the

Singapore  economy is now weaker and more uncertain  than

it  appeared just a few months ago, in the middle of this

year.   Developments  in  the region  and  in  the  world

economy  are now less favourable in a number of important

respects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the US economy, which remains the main driver

of  global growth, is losing momentum.  US consumers, who

have so far held up the US economy, are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>



beginning to spend less.  Consumer confidence in  the  US

in October, if we go by the latest indicators, was at its

lowest  level  in  nine  years.  Taking  their  cue  from

consumers,  business investments in the US  remain  weak.

New  orders  for  durable goods  fell  by  nearly  6%  in

September,  which is the sharpest decline in  10  months.

The  outlook  for  the US economy has therefore  weakened

considerably.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, our other major markets like Europe and

Japan  are  experiencing very slow  growth   -  close  to

recession  -  due to their structural problems, and their

structural inhibitions.  China, while growing rapidly, is

still  a relatively small source of international demand.

Therefore,  with  no  major engines  driving  the  global

economy, Singapore cannot expect to avoid slow growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third factor is the weaker outlook in the

infocomms sector  -  basically, the PC and communications

industry   -   which  has  direct  knock-on  effects   on

Singapore's exports.  In the US, new orders for computers

and  electronic  products fell by  6%  in  September    - again,  the  most severe decline in about  a  year.   The

global  semi-conductor market, which bottomed  out  early

this  year and began recovering in the first half of  the

year,  is  now softening.  Forecasts of growth in  global

semiconductor  sales for 2002 are down  to  2%  or  less.

Growth  in 2003 is expected at about 9%, but this is  far

below  the 22% that was predicted just a few months  ago.

Even  then,  there is downside risk in the industry.   An

absolute contraction in global semiconductor sales, which

is  a bellwether for the electronics industry, cannot  be

ruled out next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further downside is the potential impact of a

US-Iraq  war.   However,  in the  event  of  a  quick  US

victory, the consensus is that higher oil prices will not

be  sustained, and the impact on the global economy  will

be contained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fifth negative is the recent terrorist attack in

Bali.   It has cast a shadow on the economic outlook  for

the  region  as  a  whole.   The travel  and  hospitality

industries will have to brace themselves for a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>



drop  in  tourist  arrivals over  the  short  term.   The

immediate impact on arrivals has not been major,  but  it

will  be  evident over the next couple  of  months.   The

consequences  will be broader, and more serious,  if  the

Bali  attacks  lead  to  a  sustained  fall  in  investor

confidence in the region.  It is too early to assess  the

impact,  especially as events in Indonesia and  in  ASEAN

continue  to  unfold.   The ASEAN region  has  underlying

economic strengths, and initial assessments of the damage

may  well prove exaggerated.  But confidence matters, and

investors will believe in the region only when  they  see

credible efforts to deal with the terrorist threat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, fortunately, some bright spots in

Singapore's  economic  outlook.  Our  exports  to  China,

including electronics exports, continue to grow  rapidly.

Our  chemicals and biomedical industries are  also  doing

well, although growth fluctuates from quarter to quarter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the recovery in the Singapore economy this

year  has  been  narrow-based and uneven.   The  external

environment  has weakened considerably in recent  months.

This  has  also  muted  expectations  of  a  recovery  in

consumer  confidence  and  in  domestic  spending.    The

manufacturing recovery is slowing, while growth  in  most

of our services industries remains weak.  It is therefore

likely that growth for the year will fall below the  3-4%

range that we had forecast in August.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outlook for next year is uncertain. But there

is  more downside than upside on the horizon in the world

economy,  at  least  for  the  first  half  of  2003.  We

therefore  do  not expect robust growth in the  Singapore

economy  next  year.  MTI is watching these  developments

very  closely.   We will review and announce  our  growth

estimate  for  2002 and the forecast for  2003  when  the

results  for  the  full third quarter  are  out  in  mid-November.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee asked about economic stimulus

measures.  Some of the measures implemented in July and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>



October  last  year  are still in place.   These  include

rebates on personal, corporate and property tax, JTC  and

HDB  rental  rebates, support for worker training.   They

also  include rebates on service and conservancy  charges

and  rentals, which were extended for five more years  in

this  year's  Budget as part of the GST  offset  package.

The   second   tranche  of  the  New   Singapore   Shares

distributed  last  year can be withdrawn  from  tomorrow.

And personal and corporate tax rates will be reduced with

effect from Year of Assessment 2003, which will not  only

give an immediate boost to individuals and companies, but

also,  more fundamentally, help Singapore to become  more

competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we announced the $11 billion off-budget package

in October last year, we did not expect it to be followed

by a quick recovery.  We stated then that we expected the

economy  to  take  some time to pick  up.   Indeed,  last

October  and  subsequently in November, we  had  forecast

that  growth for this year would be between -2% and  +2%.

Compared  to this, the actual out-turn for this  year  is

likely to be a little better than we had expected a  year

ago  when the stimulus package was introduced.  We cannot

overcome   the  weak  global  and  regional  environments

through  a further domestic stimulus package, or increase

Government  spending each time there  is  a  dip  in  our

growth figures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, MTI is monitoring the economy closely. If

conditions  continue to weaken over the next few  months,

the  Government will consider extending various  measures

to   help  businesses  and  Singaporeans  tide  over  the

difficult period.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, in view of the fact that the

Singapore economy depends to a certain extent on tourism,

I  would  like  to  ask the Minister whether  the  recent

events  in  Bali  have  affected the  number  of  tourist

arrivals in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Visitor arrivals for the

first nine months were

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>



slipping.  It was already fairly weak.  Before  the  Bali

attack  in  October, we were actually seeing a  recovery.

Visitor arrivals in the first 12 days of October,  before

the Bali terrorist attack, were actually growing at about

15%  year on year.  Remember, of course, that the  fourth

quarter  of  last year was a very weak period in  visitor

arrivals, coming after the September 11 attacks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is too early to tell what the impact of the Bali

attack  will be.  We have seen some fall off in arrivals,

some  fall  off in the number of meetings and conferences

that  had  been  organised, but  have  subsequently  been

cancelled.  So far, the impact is not major but we expect

there will be contractions in the next few months.  Since

the  Bali  attack, we still have positive  year  on  year

growth in visitor arrivals, something like 11%.  But that

is largely because of the weak base in the fourth quarter

of last year.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Sir, could the Minister

tell  us what is the amount of investments that has  been

committed  for next year, and how does that compare  with

this year?  Secondly, based on what he has just described

for  our  economic  outlook for next year,  what  is  the

Minister's  assessment of the impact  on  jobs  for  next

year?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Sir, on the first

question,  we  continue  to  have  a  healthy  investment

pipeline.   Confidence in Singapore  is  strong,  because

there  is  confidence  in our economic  fundamentals  and

there  is  confidence in the Government, as well  as  the

people  of  Singapore.   Our  ability  to  respond   with

difficult  measures,  and to adjust when  necessary,  has

been  registered  on  investors.   So,  the  EDB  in  its

contacts  with foreign investors has found that there  is

still  a  certain commitment to Singapore, a  recognition

that we are competitive and that we will make adjustments

to  ensure that our investment environment is a  superior

one.  I do not have the exact numbers for the commitments

for next year, but they remain healthy.  And, indeed, for

this year, it remains healthy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Member's second question, I believe the

Minister  for Manpower will be taking a question  shortly

on  the  unemployment situation.  So, it is best  that  I

leave it to him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Senior Minister in his

answer says that it is too early to assess the impact  of

the  Bali bombing on the economy.  I would like  to  know

from  him when he thinks he will be able to make a proper

assessment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, just to

clarify that I am not the Senior Minister, but the Senior

Minister of State.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of November, MTI will issue its

revised  forecast for 2002 and estimates, as best  as  we

can, for 2003.  To be absolutely frank, the impact of the

Bali  bombing  is  an  ongoing matter.   It  is  a  fluid

environment.   There is going to be no easy  quantitative

estimate  of  the impact.  We know how many  tour  groups

have  been  cancelled,  how many  conferences  have  been

cancelled,  and  so  on.  That is finite.   But  how  the

situation  is  going  to unfold in the  region  is  still

highly  uncertain.  And confidence is, by its nature,  an

intangible.   We  cannot put a  number  on  it.   My  own

assessment is that, as Mr Raymond Lim has also  said,  we

should  not  over-react,  we  should  not  overstate  the

impact.   There are certain underlying strengths  in  the

region,   and  obviously  the  competitive  strength   in

Singapore.   But we have to watch the situation  closely.

Confidence  will  be  shaped by how  governments  in  the

region respond to the terrorist threat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I would

like to ask the Senior Minister of State, in view of  the

bleak  outlook  that he has just portrayed  to  us,  what

would   the  unemployment  situation  be  like   in   the

forthcoming quarter and next year.  And in view  of  this

weaker  economy,  should  the Government  not  reconsider

continuing  with the Economic Downturn Relief Scheme,  in

the  light that there may well be a continuation  of  the

downturn and more help will be needed by the people?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> On the first part of Mr

Leong's question, again, as mentioned, I will leave it to

the  Minister  for Manpower who is going to  address  the

issue of unemployment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second part of his question with regard to

the EDRS, as I have explained, we should not react by off-Budget packages or stimulus measures every time we see  a

dip  in  the  growth  numbers.   We  are  no  longer   in

recession.  We are going through a dull recovery, but  we

have  to  prepare  for  what might  be  a  long  haul,  a

difficult  period  where the numbers  fluctuate  somewhat

from quarter to quarter, and we have got to adjust to the

situation.   The  EDRS has served its  purpose.   It  was

introduced at a time of severe economic difficulty and it

has   served   its  purpose.   I  think  we  should   not

institutionalise   it.    In   fact,   we   should    not

institutionalise any relief scheme.  We should retain our

ability to respond where really necessary, and respond in

a  focused  fashion,  and make sure that  we  are  always

helping those who are truly needy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to monitor the situation carefully.

We  cannot  say for sure how the economic situation  will

unravel  in  the coming months.  So, we will continue  to

watch  it  carefully.  If the situation gets much  worse,

then  Government will have to consider what  measures  to

introduce.  But I do not want to jump the gun on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are needy can get help. As all of us

know,  they  can  go  to their MPs,  and  those  who  are

assessed  to  be  truly  needy and  are  trying  to  help

themselves will receive help from us.  The CCCs are quite

willing  to  extend  assistance,  case-by-case,  to   any

Singaporean who is needy.  So, we are very mindful of the

fact  that  Singaporeans are going  through  a  difficult

period  and some are in need of help.  We should continue

to  help  them.  But let us not institutionalise  schemes

which were intended to serve a one-off purpose, like  the

EDRS.

<br><br><!-- Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin (Nominated Member):</b> Because

of the heightened security in the port, especially in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>



United  States, and the transportation of goods, I  would

like  to ask the Senior Minister of State what impact  it

will  have on the local businesses and what measures  the

Ministry  has  taken,  or  is  going  to  take,  to  help

alleviate the higher cost of business.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> I take it that the

Member is referring to the US West Coast port strikes and

the aftermath of the strikes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an impact. Fortunately, a good part of our

exports  are  not  bulky.  They are  transported  by  air

rather  than  by sea.  So the composition of our  exports

has  fortunately  allowed  us to  avoid  a  major  impact

arising  from the West Coast port strikes.  But  what  is

more important is how it is going to play out in the  US.

The  stay order that the court has issued is for 90 days.

That  takes  them past the congressional  elections.   It

will  be  interesting to see, and we will want  to  watch

very closely, what happens after that cooling-off period.

Productivity  is  down  very sharply  in  the  US  ports.

Latest  news  indicates that it is down about  25%.   So,

things are moving slowly, goods are being jammed up,  and

they  are not reaching the stores in time for the festive

shopping  period.  That could weaken the US  economy  and

have repercussions on us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the direct impact of the West Coast port strikes

is  not  very  significant because we  were  transporting

principally by air, various electronic components and  so

on.  But there could be an indirect impact, depending  on

how  this  plays  out in the US, how it affects  consumer

sentiment, and how it affects business investment.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, in order to counteract the misconceptions and the

over-cautious attitudes of some countries in the  region,

like   we  have  just  heard  earlier  about  Australia's

situation,  what  measures would the Senior  Minister  of

State  and  his Ministry adopt to actually  publicise  to

help  travel  agencies and conference  groups  that  have

already  planned for conferences to be held in  Singapore

next

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>



year,  for instance, so that they can go out and  correct

the  misconceptions  and to indicate  that  the  security

situation in Singapore vis-a-vis the region is still very

secure for us?  This will, therefore, counteract some  of

these  negative images that possibly would  be  portrayed

out in the press.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</b> As Mr Raymond Lim

indicated, STB is stepping up its marketing, particularly

in  Asian countries.  Apart from the Australians, and  we

have   seen  some  cancellations  of  Australian  groups,

conference groups, meeting groups, and so on,  there  has

not  been  a  gross misconception on the  part  of  other

countries  so  far  as we can tell.  I  think,  over  the

months, people will get more discerning.  Certainly,  our

economic agencies and STB, in particular, will drive home

the point that we are a secure place, we have taken quick

measures  and,  indeed,  ASEAN by  and  large  is  taking

measures to address the problem.  But there is a limit to

what  marketing can do.  Ultimately, people will  believe

in  the region, they will believe governments, when  they

see actions being sustained.

<div align="center"><b>GOODS AND SERVICES TAX INCREASE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Deferment of implementation)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mdm Halimah Yacob</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  and Minister for Finance whether the Government

will consider deferring the date of implementation of the

Goods  and Services Tax (GST) increase from 3% to 5%,  in

view  of  the still uncertain economic outlook  for  next

year.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang) (for the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the Budget Statement in May this

year,  external conditions have been more difficult,  and

Singapore's economic recovery less vigorous than  we  had

hoped.   This uncertain environment makes it more  urgent

and  crucial  for us to restructure and reinvigorate  our

economy.   We cannot delay reducing our direct taxes,  in

order to boost businesses, retain

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>



talent,  and generate economic growth and jobs.  We  have

already  lowered corporate and top personal tax rates  to

22% this year, and committed to lowering them further  to

20% within three years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in GST on 1st January 2003 is an

integral part of this tax restructuring package.   If  we

cut  direct taxes now, but postpone raising the GST until

later,  the  Government will not be able to  balance  its

budget,  or  adequately  provide  Singaporeans  with  key

public  services,  such  as  education,  healthcare   and

defence.  Hence, we cannot defer the increase in GST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For households, the additional GST that they have to

pay  will  be  fully  neutralised  by  the  comprehensive

package  of offsets, including the Economic Restructuring

Shares (ERS), rebates for service and conservancy charges

and  rentals, and increased subsidies on state  education

and healthcare.  The value of the assistance package will

be   enough  to  offset  the  increase  in  GST  for  all

households  for  at least five years.   For  lower-income

households,  the  package is worth  up  to  10  years  of

increased  GST.  A few households may find  the  standard

offset  package inadequate, but they can  turn  to  their

Citizens  Consultative Committees (CCCs)  for  additional

help through the CCC Assistance Scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are proceeding with the tax changes while

buffering  their  impact  on Singaporeans,  in  order  to

strengthen  ourselves to compete in this  very  difficult

environment.     I   understand   and   empathise    with

Singaporeans'  worries  over the  economic  and  regional

outlook,  especially in the wake of the recent  terrorist

attack in Bali.  We cannot, however, avoid tightening our

belts and cutting back on less essential spending.  But I

assure  Members  that the Government will  do  everything

necessary  to help Singaporeans tide over this  difficult

period, especially lower-income families in genuine need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to predict with any certainty now

what  next  year will bring.  By the time of  the  Budget

Speech next February,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>



we  will  reassess  the position and decide  what  fiscal

measures will be necessary.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</b> Sir, when the GST increase

proposal  was  made, I think one of the  assumptions  was

that  the  economic situation will be  much  better  next

year.   In  view  of the scenarios that  have  just  been

painted  and  the  fact that the economic  situation  and

outlook  next  year will still be quite  uncertain,  will

this  not  form the basis for the Government to  consider

deferring the GST for at least a few months?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> When the Deputy Prime Minister

raised  the  issue  of  the GST in Parliament  this  year

during the May Budget speech, we made it very clear  that

we face very difficult times.  And it is because of these

very difficult challenges that we need to restructure the

overall  tax regime of Singapore.  As it turns  out,  the

situation  is indeed very difficult, more difficult  than

we  have  envisaged, and, therefore, I think it makes  it

all  the  more  urgent  that  we  pursue  with  this  tax

restructuring.

<div align="center"><b>PREVENTION OF CORRUPTION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investigation officers in Corrupt Practices

Investigation  Bureau (CPIB) have played a  key  role  in

combating  and  curbing  corruption  in  Singapore.   The

success in this vital task over the years has resulted in

a  corruption-free public service and has made  Singapore

attractive to foreign investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition of the vital role played by the

investigation officers in CPIB, the salary schemes of the

junior   and   senior  Corrupt  Practices   Investigation

Officers have been pegged to the junior and senior Police

Officer  schemes  respectively in  order  to  make  their

salary terms attractive enough to recruit and retain good

officers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>



When  the  Ministry  of Home Affairs  Uniformed  Services

(HUS) implemented a superannuation scheme in the form  of

an  HUS  Invest  Plan in October 2001,  CPIB  sought  and

received  approval from the Public Service  Division  and

the Finance Ministry to implement a similar scheme to the

CPIB Investigation Officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed superannuation scheme for the junior

and senior Corrupt Practices Investigation Officers would

provide for the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Lowering of the current compulsory retirement

age  from  62  to  55  years for both junior  and  senior

officers; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Implementing a CPIB Invest Plan to build up a

superannuation fund to help them transit out  of  service

earlier than other civil servants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale for the CPIB Invest Plan for the CPIB

officers  is  similar  to  that  for  the  Home   Affairs

Uniformed Officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retirement age for the new CPIB officers has

been lowered from 62 to 55 years because they need to  be

physically fit, agile and alert, especially when  dealing

with  suspects who resist arrests.  There are a few desk-bound  officers in CPIB to which the older  investigating

officers could be re-deployed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exemption under the Retirement Age Act has already

been  obtained from 1st November 2001 to provide for  the

new  CPIB  officers to retire at the age of 55.   Serving

officers  can  choose to opt into the new  superannuation

scheme  with  the  lowering of the compulsory  retirement

age.   The  CPIB  Invest  Plan under  the  superannuation

scheme  will  have  to be implemented with  retrospective

effect  from  1st  November  2001,  in  tandem  with  the

effective date of the lowering of the retirement age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mechanism of the CPIB Invest Plan is also

similar  to that of the HUS Invest Plan.  Apart from  the

full  CPF contributions, CPIB will, under the CPIB Invest

Plan, contribute an amount based on the percentage of the

officer's  monthly salary into a Retirement Account  kept

for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>



officer,  which is 6% monthly for both junior and  senior

CPIB officers starting from the 7th year of service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, junior officers will receive retention

payments  in a separate Retention Account.  The retention

payments  will  be credited into the officer's  Retention

Account  on  satisfactory  completion  of  each  year  of

service  during the officer's first 10 years of  service.

The  payment  is  one month of salary for  each  year  of

service  during the first six years.  In the 7th  to  the

10th year, this payment increases to 1.5 months of salary

for each completed year of service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The funds in the officers' Retirement and Retention

Accounts  will be pooled to form an invest fund known  as

the  CPIB  Invest  Fund.  The CPIB Invest  Fund  will  be

managed  by professional fund managers.  Based on returns

from  investments,  dividends will be credited  into  the

individual accounts of the officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accumulated amounts in the CPIB Invest Accounts

can  be withdrawn by the officers progressively.  If  the

officer resigns prematurely, CPIB will retain part of the

amount  in the officer's account.  The officer  can  only

withdraw the full amount in his account if he serves  the

full  career with CPIB when he retires at the age of  55.

CPIB  expects the progressive withdrawal feature  of  the

CPIB  Invest Plan to enhance retention, thus  helping  to

attract  good  quality officers to join and  remain  with

CPIB for a full career.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it would not be cost effective for CPIB to set up

a  special  machinery  to manage  the  CPIB  Invest  Fund

because  of the small approved establishment of  62,  the

Home  Affairs Ministry has acceded to CPIB's  request  to

pool  the  CPIB Invest Fund with the HUS Invest Fund  for

management  by the HUS Board of Trustees.  The  Director,

CPIB, would be made a member of the Board of Trustees  to

oversee  the interest of the CPIB officers.   This  would

require  consequential amendments  to  the  Home  Affairs

Uniformed Services Superannuation Act 2001 and associated

Regulations.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1344</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the Home Affairs Ministry is

taking   the  opportunity  to  amend  the  Home   Affairs

Uniformed  Services Superannuation Act 2001 to offer  the

HUS Invest Plan to junior intelligence officers recruited

from  outside the Home Team.  Previously, the HUS  Invest

Plan was only available to intelligence officers who were

already  the HUS Invest Plan members in their  respective

Home  Team  Departments  before they  were  appointed  as

intelligence  officers.   The  proposed  amendments  give

similar terms to what is available for officers appointed

to  other Home Team Departments, that is, the HUS  Invest

Plan   can  also  be  offered  to  intelligence  officers

recruited from other departments in the civil service, or

from the open market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill will provide for the following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The legislative framework under the Prevention

of  Corruption Act for CPIB to implement the CPIB  Invest

Plan;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Amendment of the Home Affairs Uniformed

Services  Superannuation  Act 2001  to  provide  for  the

management of the CPIB Invest Fund;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Amendment of the Pension Fund Act to allow for

the  accrued  pension  benefits of the  CPIB  pensionable

officers  who have opted for the CPIB Invest Plan  to  be

transferred  from  the Pension Fund to  the  CPIB  Invest

Fund;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Amendment of the Home Affairs Uniformed

Services Superannuation Act 2001 to offer the HUS  Invest

Plan  to  junior  intelligence  officers  recruited  from

outside the Home Team.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<div align="center"><b>ESTATE DUTY (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Budget speech this year, the Deputy Prime

Minister  and Minister for Finance announced a series  of

measures to promote the spirit of philanthropy among  our

people.  One of these measures requires a change  in  the

Estate  Duty  Act.   With effect from 1st  January  2002,

administrators and families of deceased individuals  will

be  allowed to donate the estate of their next-of-kin  to

Institutions of Public Character (IPC) and the  value  of

the donation will be exempt from estate duty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to this change, it was possible to apply for

exemption from estate duty for such donations on a  case-by-case  basis.  But to make the process less  cumbersome

and more transparent, donations from estates to IPCs will

be  exempted automatically as soon as they are made on or

after 1st January 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment to the Act is a policy change

introduced to encourage more foreigners to hold Singapore

dollar  denominated  assets.  A non-domiciled  individual

who passes away on or after 1st January 2002 will not  be

subject  to  estate  duty on the  value  of  his  movable

assets.   This  is  an initiative to improve  Singapore's

position as an international private banking centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two amendments in this Bill are

consequential non-budget related amendments to  the  Act.

First,  the  term "National Museum" in the  Act  will  be

replaced  by "Approved Museums" as the "National  Museum"

is  no  longer in existence.  Secondly, the administrator

of  the  Technopreneur Home Office  (THO)  Scheme  is  no

longer the National Science and Technology Board but  the

Economic Development Board.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Andy Gan Lai Chiang (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The move to refine the Estate Duty Act by amending

section  11  to provide that estate duty be  exempted  in

respect of any movable property passing on the death of a

person  dying on or after 1st of January 2002 who is  not

domiciled  in  Singapore at the time  of  his  death,  is

laudable, as it will encourage foreigners to invest  more

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is necessary to draw more expatriates to

put  their money into our banking sector, we should  also

bear  in  mind  the  effects of the Estate  Duty  Act  on

Singaporeans.  While foreigners are building their wealth

with  no  fear  of  having  to  pay  estate  duty,  those

domiciled in Singapore have to prepare for another  round

of  taxes  on  their estate before the beneficiaries  are

able  to  receive the proceeds.  As we aspire to  improve

our economic well-being, more and more citizens may reach

the  tax  range of the Estate Duty Act, as their  assets,

both  movable and immovable, build up over their lifetime

and,  in  the  course of which, they already  pay  taxes.

Having  to  levy  estate duty on top of that  is  a  very

traumatic  way for the Government to raise money  from  a

family  which, while suffering from the loss of  a  loved

one,  also has to cope with the uncalled for hardship  to

pay  estate  duty.  This is especially so in a  depressed

market and the family suddenly has to sell its assets  to

raise cash to pay the estate duty, plus interest on  late

payments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it can also be said that most people do not have

to  worry about estate duty, as there is an exemption  of

$600,000  in  respect  of the deceased's  movable  assets

which  include CPF money, plus an exemption of $9 million

in  respect of all dwelling houses.  Thus, if during  his

lifetime, a person plans his estate in such a manner that

what  he  leaves  behind  is within  the  limits  of  the

exemption granted,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1347</b></font><br><br>



his  estate would not have to pay any duty.  However, the

fact remains that the surviving family members will still

be required to file a return to prove that the deceased's

estate is fully exempted from estate duty.  And that is a

long tedious process by itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 35 of the Act requires the personal

representative to file particulars relating  to  all  the

properties of the deceased, including the value  thereof,

in respect of which estate duty is payable.  Furthermore,

under  the Estate Duty Act, the Commissioner is empowered

to  assess the estate of a deceased person, even when  no

estate  duty  return  is filed.  In  the  meanwhile,  the

beneficiaries,  if  dependent on  the  deceased's  money,

could not use it for their day-to-day purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong for a taxpayer to pass his

assets  on  to his loved ones without being taxed  again.

Hence, many are at a loss as to why such a discriminatory

taxation   law   still  exists  when  the   majority   of

Singaporeans has been spared such an ordeal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which may be of interest in

determining  the benefits of keeping the  law  on  estate

duty  is  the  question  of the  amount  of  estate  duty

collected  each  year,  as  compared  to  the   cost   of

collecting it.  If the sums collected do not justify  the

cost  incurred,  and  if  the  amount  is  negligible  as

compared  to  other  forms of taxes, then  we  should  be

looking  at also extending section 11 of the Estate  Duty

Act  to  resident  taxpayers who are Singaporeans.   This

will  help  alleviate the burden of taxes on  those  with

substantial  movable assets that are above the  exemption

limit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should have tax laws that not only

encourage  the  creation of wealth  but  also  discourage

measures  taken in avoiding estate duty, especially  when

Singaporeans have to resort to transferring their  wealth

to  other  countries like Malaysia, India and  Australia,

where estate duty has been abolished.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the amendment with the

hope that this action by the Government will be the start

of  a series of bold steps to examine the Estate Duty Act

again  and,  perhaps,  at the next Budget  exercise,  all

Singaporeans can look forward to the day when they can be

spared  the  trauma of having to live with this  form  of

outmoded tax law.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Andy

Gan  for  his  comments.  I think there are three  issues

that he raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, a very fundamental issue, is should there be

estate duty in Singapore.  This is a continuing debate  - whether  or not we should have a death tax regime.   Most

countries  do have it - the UK, USA, Hong Kong,  Ireland.

They  have  either inheritance tax or estate duty.   Some

countries do not have an inheritance tax or estate  duty,

but they have a gift tax, ie, those who receive them have

to  pay a tax on the gifts that they are given.  So  this

is  a  fundamental issue:  when somebody  builds  up  the

wealth  and  you  transfer the wealth as an  inheritance,

whether that should be taxed.  As I said, a few countries

have  dispensed  with this tax, but the majority  of  tax

regimes  still  continue  with  this  tax.   So  we  will

continue to review this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is whether or not we should treat

immovables  and movables differently.  In Singapore,  our

estate  duty  is  already  very benign.   Immovables  are

exempted up to $9 million, ie, if you have properties  in

Singapore,  only  properties above $9  million  would  be

subject  to  estate  duty.  For movables,  the  exemption

limit  is  $600,000.   The exemption limit  for  movables

covers  both  movables in Singapore as  well  as  outside

Singapore.  So it is not true that Singaporeans can avoid

estate  duty  by  investing  in  movable  assets  outside

Singapore.   The tax treatment for movables  is  anything

above   $600,000,  both  within  Singapore  and   outside

Singapore.  So, that is the second clarification I  would

like to make.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third clarification is how do we treat people

who  are not domiciled in Singapore.  That is section  11

that  Mr  Andy  Gan refers to.  For people  who  are  not

domiciled  in  Singapore,  the estate  duty  only  covers

immovables  in Singapore, because we want  to  make  sure

that  foreigners who buy property, the property  will  be

subject  to  a  tax  above  the  exemption  limit.    But

foreigners  who are not domiciled in Singapore  are  only

taxed  for movables within Singapore.  So they could  put

their  movables  outside Singapore,  and  that  would  be

outside  the  ambit  of our tax.  So, to  encourage  such

foreigners  not to keep their movables outside  Singapore

but  to  encourage  them to invest  in  Singapore  dollar

denominated assets, this is the reason for the section 11

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we are making this change with

respect to foreigners is because, for foreigners, we  are

already  not  taxing them on movables outside  Singapore.

Therefore, we are now also exempting them on movables  in

Singapore,  so that it is a level playing field,  and  we

hope  that they will in fact invest in Singapore  assets.

That is the reason for the change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I take note of Mr Andy Gan's comments, and I am

sure this whole debate on estate duty will continue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].

<div align="center"><b>PROPERTY TAX (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Second Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Second Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill will amend the Property

Tax  Act  to  give  legislative effect to  the  following

measures:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) To change the billing cycle for property tax

from twice a year to once a year in January;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) To abolish the practice of opening up the

Valuation  list,  in  the month  of  August,  for  public

inspection and objection;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) To allow taxpayers to lodge objections on the

annual  value of their properties at any time within  the

current year;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) To allow the Comptroller to impose a penalty

not  exceeding  5% of the amount of outstanding  property

tax  immediately upon the expiration of the  time  period

stipulated for payment; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) To establish a Street and Building Names Board

which  will determine or alter the name of any  building,

estate or street.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now explain the main amendments in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, property tax is payable half-yearly in

advance in the months of January and July.  Clause  3  of

the  Bill  amends section 6(2) of the Act to provide  for

property  tax to be payable yearly in advance in January.

Property  tax  bills will then be sent out  only  once  a

year.  This will bring about cost and manpower savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxpayers paying their property tax through GIRO

will  not  be affected, as they are already paying  their

property tax payments in 12 equal, interest-free, monthly

instalments.  Hence, IRAS will encourage those  taxpayers

currently paying their tax by cash or cheque to pay their

tax  through  GIRO  by sending them a package  containing

information of how to effect payment through GIRO.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment is on objections to the

Valuation  List.  Currently, the Valuation List  for  the

ensuing  year  is  open  to  the  public  in  August  for

inspection.  Any owner aggrieved by the inclusion in  the

Valuation  List  of any property or by the  annual  value

ascribed to a property may, at any time within the period

allowed for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>

inspection  of  the Valuation List, write  to  the  Chief

Assessor to object.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As taxpayers are informed of the annual values of

their  properties  through their property  tax  bills  or

valuation  notices,  there is  no  need  to  publish  the

Valuation List for the public to inspect.  Thus, clause 5

of the Bill removes this practice.  Clause 7 introduces a

new section 20A to the Act, which will allow taxpayers to

object  to  the Chief Assessor with regard to the  annual

values  ascribed to their properties at any time  of  the

year.    If  the  Chief  Assessor  rejects  a  taxpayer's

objection,  the taxpayer may proceed to lodge  an  appeal

with  the  Valuation Review Board within 21 days  of  the

service  of the notice of the Chief Assessor's  decision.

This   amendment  effectively  gives  the  taxpayer  more

flexibility to lodge an objection to the annual values of

their properties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next change is on the penalty for non-payment of

tax.   Under the current Act, if the property tax remains

unpaid  at the end of January or July, a notice would  be

served on the person liable.  The taxpayer is required to

pay  the  outstanding tax and a fee for the cost  of  the

notice within 15 days from the service of the notice.   A

penalty  may only be imposed upon the expiration  of  the

requisite 15 days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage property owners to pay their taxes on

time, clause 16 introduces a new section 36 to the Act to

impose  a penalty at the point the payment is due  rather

than  upon expiration of the notice demanding payment  of

outstanding tax. The penalty will be capped at 5% of  the

amount   of  outstanding  property  tax.   However,   the

Comptroller  will be given the discretion  to  waive  the

penalty   imposed  on  late  payment  where   there   are

exceptional circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Street and Building Names Board (SBNB).

Currently,  the  Minister for Finance  has  authority  to

determine or change the name of any street, building  and

estate.  He is assisted in this task by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>



an   advisory  committee.  In  practice,  most   of   the

applications  for  names submitted to the  committee  are

straightforward,  and  the  committee's   recommendations

could  be accepted without any amendment.  Hence,  clause

18  amends section 49 of the Act to establish the  Street

and  Building  Names Board and to vest in the  Board  the

authority to determine or alter the names of any  street,

building  and  estate.  The Chairman and members  of  the

Board  will  be  appointed by the Minister  for  Finance.

There  will  also be an avenue to appeal to the  Minister

for Finance, against decisions made by the Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.

<div align="center"><b>ARMS AND EXPLOSIVES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill amends the Arms and Explosives Act to

give  effect to the Convention on the Marking of  Plastic

Explosives for the Purpose of Detection.  As the Act  was

last  reviewed  in 1973, my Ministry has also  taken  the

opportunity to fine-tune some provisions to keep them  up

to  date.   I  shall first cover the amendments  to  give

effect  to  the  Convention on  the  Marking  of  Plastic

Explosives for the Purpose of Detection.

<br><br><i>Convention  on  Marking  of Plastic  Explosives  for  the Purpose of Detection</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Convention addresses the need to mark plastic

explosives  for  the  purpose  of  detection.    Unmarked

plastic explosives are hard to detect because they elude

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1353</b></font><br><br>



x-rays,  as  well  as  metal and most  vapour  detectors.

Marking  plastic explosives enables vapour  detectors  to

pick up the presence of such explosives. This Convention,

concluded  in 1991, was set against the backdrop  of  the

blowing  up  of  Pan Am flight 103 in  the  air  on  21st

December  1988.   The British Air Accident  Investigation

Branch  concluded  that  the  crash  was  caused  by   an

explosive  device that was intentionally detonated  while

the plane was in flight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is acceding to the Convention to show our

support for the fight against terrorism.  This Convention

protects  international civil aviation by  requiring  the

marking  of  plastic explosives for detection  so  as  to

prevent  the  use of such explosives for  terrorists  and

other  unlawful purposes.  In acceding to the Convention,

we  join  85  other  countries which  are  already  State

Parties  to  the  Convention  to  combat  terrorism.   In

addition,  Singapore has already acceded  to  four  other

international  conventions on  civil  aviation  security,

namely, the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts

Committed  on  Board  Aircraft, the  Convention  for  the

Suppression   of  Unlawful  Seizure  of   Aircraft,   the

Convention  for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts  against

the  Safety  of Civil Aviation and the 1988 Protocol  for

the  Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports

Serving International Civil Aviation.

<br><br><i>Amendments to Give Effect to the Convention</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key obligations of the Convention are for State

Parties to adopt measures to prohibit the manufacture  of

unmarked plastic explosives and to impose strict  control

over  the  movement of such explosives.   The  Convention

also requires State Parties to destroy, consume, mark  or

render  permanently  ineffective all stocks  of  unmarked

plastic  explosives  within  3  years,  if  not  held  by

military  or police authorities, and within 15 years,  if

held by military or police authorities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends the Act by inserting a

definition of an "unmarked

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>



plastic explosive" as any plastic explosive that does not

contain  a detection agent.  A detection agent means  any

substance  that enhances the detectability of  explosives

by   vapour  detection  means.  Clause  23  of  the  Bill

introduces a new Schedule that lists the detection agents

and specifies the minimum concentration level that should

be present in plastic explosives.  Clause 20 introduces a

new  section to empower the Minister for Home Affairs  to

amend the Schedule by order published in the Gazette.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to meet the obligations under the Convention,

clause 4 of the Bill makes it an offence for a person  to

manufacture, possess, transfer, import or export unmarked

plastic  explosives.  A person convicted of any of  these

offences  would  be  sentenced to a  fine  not  exceeding

$10,000  and imprisonment for a term not exceeding  three

years.   Exceptions  to  this  are  made,  however,   for

unmarked   plastic  explosives  used  for  research   and

development,  testing, training or for  forensic  science

activities.   Exceptions  are also  made  for  authorised

military  and police personnel to destroy, consume,  mark

or  render permanently ineffective the existing stock  of

unmarked  plastic  explosives  within  15  years  of  the

Convention  coming into force.  These grace periods  will

allow  time  for  the existing stock of unmarked  plastic

explosives to be destroyed, consumed, marked or  rendered

permanently  ineffective.  These exceptions  are  all  in

accordance with the Convention.

<br><br><i>Amendments to update the Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I now briefly outline other

amendments  to fine-tune the existing provisions  in  the

Act.

<br><br><i>Definition of "Arms" to include "Noxious Substance"</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Act defines "arms" as including

firearms, automatic guns, and any other kind of gun  from

which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged

or noxious fumes emitted.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>



The  current definition does not include guns  which  can

discharge  noxious substances which are  non-gaseous  but

could  also  produce a noxious effect.   For  example,  a

pepper  spray  discharges noxious  substances  and  falls

outside the existing definition of "arms" under the  Act.

Clause  2 of the Bill addresses this by amending the  Act

to  include  "noxious  substance" in  the  definition  of

"arms".

<br><br><i>Manufacture, Dealing in and Export of Noxious Substance</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the inclusion of noxious substance, clause 6 of

the  Bill  amends  the  Act to make  it  an  offence  for

unauthorised possession, manufacture, import  and  export

of noxious substances.

<br><br><i>Appointment of Licensing and Assistant Licensing Officers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Act currently empowers the Minister to

appoint  a  Licensing  Authority.  Over  the  years,  the

workload   of  the  Licensing  Authority  has   increased

substantially.  Clause 7 of the Bill therefore amends the

Act   to   empower  the  Minister  to  appoint  Assistant

Licensing  Officers  to  assist  the  Licensing  Officer.

However,  the  Licensing  Officer  will  remain   overall

responsible.

<br><br><i>Deposit of Guns, Arms or Explosives</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, any person whose licence to possess

a  gun,  arms  or  explosive  has  expired  or  has  been

cancelled or suspended, is required to deposit  the  gun,

arms or explosives at a Police station.  This arrangement

is  not satisfactory.  Police resources are unnecessarily

tied  up  to  receive and safekeep such  guns,  arms  and

explosives when it could be better utilised in performing

Police   core  functions.   The  Police  will   therefore

outsource  the  receipt and safekeeping function  to  the

Commercial  and  Industrial Security Corporation  (CISCO)

which has the capability to perform this task.  Clause  9

of the Bill amends the Act to require any person

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>



whose  licence  to possess a gun, arms or  explosive  has

expired,  or has been cancelled or suspended  to  deposit

the  gun,  arms  or  explosive with CISCO  or  any  other

auxiliary  police  force  which  is  authorised  by   the

Licensing Officer.

<br><br><i>Forfeiture of Guns, Arms and Explosives</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act currently provides that any gun, arms or

explosive   which   is  deposited  with   the   Licensing

Authority, if not claimed by its owner within six  months

from  the date of the deposit, shall be forfeited to  the

Government.   Clause 10 of the Bill  amends  the  Act  by

replacing  the  Licensing Authority  with  the  Licensing

Officer  and  CISCO or any other auxiliary  police  force

which is authorised by the Licensing Officer.

<br><br><i>Possession and Use of Arms by Schools and Clubs</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 of the Bill amends the Act to empower the

Minister  for Home Affairs to make rules to regulate  the

possession  and use of arms, namely, air rifles  held  by

schools  and  shotguns  and pistols  held  by  clubs  for

sporting activities.  It also exempts any school or  club

from  the requirement of a licence, subject to prescribed

conditions.   Currently, without the power to  make  such

rules,  schools and clubs have to be subject to  all  the

requirements under the Act.  For example, if a school  or

club intends to acquire arms for sporting activities,  it

has  to  first  obtain a licence to  purchase  the  arms.

Having  purchased the arms, the school  or  club  has  to

apply  and  obtain a licence to possess the arms.   Also,

each  time the arms are transported out of the school  or

club   to  another  location  for  a  competition,  prior

approval has to be obtained from the Licensing Officer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 is therefore intended to allow rules to be

made to reduce the administrative work and the number  of

licences that a school or club needs to obtain to acquire

arms  for sporting purposes.  However, let me assure  the

House that the streamlining of administrative work and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>



exemption from having to obtain certain licences will not

undermine the safekeeping and proper custody of  arms  by

schools and clubs.

<br><br><i>Power to Search Vessels or Aircraft while in any Port or Airport</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, currently, the Act provides that the Port

Master  and  Licensing Authority may search  or  issue  a

search warrant to search any vessel or aircraft about  to

leave any port of Singapore, if it is suspected of having

on  board  illegal guns, arms or explosives.  It  is  the

Airport  Police  and  the  Police  Coast  Guard  who  are

activated to conduct the search.  Clause 17 of  the  Bill

therefore  amends the Act to extend the power  of  search

and  issuance of search warrants to the Commander of  the

Airport  Police  and the Commander of  the  Police  Coast

Guard.  Clause 17 of the Bill also amends the Act to make

it  clear  that  any vessel in the port, aircraft  in  or

about  to  leave any airport of Singapore may be searched

if  it  is  suspected  of having illegal  guns,  arms  or

explosives on board.

<br><br><i>Repeal of section 17</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 of the Bill repeals section 17 of the Act.

Section  17  provides that a permit must be  obtained  to

land  any guns or arms for transhipment by any vessel  or

aircraft arriving at any port of Singapore.  However,  in

practice,  the  cargo handler acting  on  behalf  of  the

vessel and aircraft would have already obtained an import

and  export  permit  which covers the  transportation  of

guns,  arms  and  explosives.  Section  17  is  therefore

redundant.

<br><br><i>Amendments to penalties</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, clauses 6, 12 to 16 and 22 of the Bill

amend  the  Act  by  increasing the  existing  fines  for

various  offences by between three and 10  times.   These

offences include unauthorised manufacture, possession  or

import  of guns, arms, explosives, poisonous and  noxious

substances.  The existing fines have not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>



been  amended  for over 30 years.  The  increase  in  the

fines  is  to  take into account the increase  in  income

levels  over  the  years and to maintain their  deterrent

effect.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, by passing this Bill and acceding

to  the  Convention on the marking of plastic  explosives

for   the  purpose  of  detection,  we  join  many  other

countries   in  taking  concrete  steps  to  reduce   the

availability   of   unmarked   plastic   explosives    by

prohibiting  the  manufacture and  movement  of  unmarked

plastic explosives and requiring the destruction  of  all

unmarked  explosives.  This will contribute  to  ensuring

greater  aviation  security  for  passengers,  crew   and

aircraft  and  make it more difficult for terrorists  who

plan  to  use explosives on aircraft and other  means  of

transportation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill introduces four main changes to the

existing  CPF Act, namely, to accommodate bank-originated

loans  for  HDB  flats; facilitate e-submission  for  CPF

submissions  and payments; shorten the interval  for  CPF

withdrawals  after age 55 and provide a cap on  voluntary

CPF contributions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Changes arising from Bank-Originated Loans for HDB Flats</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in July this year, the Government announced

that  the  Housing  and  Development  Board  (HDB)  would

transfer  HDB  market rate loans to the  banks  from  1st

January  2003.  This Bill addresses changes  that  impact

CPF savings arising from this move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, when HDB grants mortgage loans, it has

first  priority  or charge over sale proceeds  from  such

flats.   The  CPF Board has second charge if CPF  savings

have  been  used to make payment towards the purchase  of

the  flat.   This means that when the flat is  sold,  HDB

will   first  deduct  the  amount  owed  to  it,   before

transferring  any  balance  back  to  the  member's   CPF

account.   From 1st January 2003, the lending banks  will

have  first  charge  when they grant loans  to  HDB  flat

buyers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To secure the refund of monies due to CPF, the CPF

Board would have to lodge a charge with the Registrar  of

Titles  for  each HDB flat purchased with bank-originated

loans.   However,  this would lead  to  higher  cost  and

longer  processing time for the release of  members'  CPF

savings for the purchase of flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid these problems, clause 7 of the Bill

inserts  a new section 21B to create an automatic  charge

on  an  HDB  flat in favour of CPF Board  when  a  member

withdraws  CPF  savings to purchase or  upgrade  the  HDB

flat.  It also confers on the CPF Board the power of sale

to  recover the CPF savings used for the flat, as is  the

case for private properties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the automatic charge, there exists the

possibility that the need to refund CPF savings  used  by

the seller could be overlooked during the transactions of

HDB  flats,  especially when HDB is no longer  an  active

intermediary   in  flats  purchased  with   bank   loans.

However,  with due diligence by the parties'  lawyers  to

ensure that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>



title  of  the flat is passed on to the buyers free  from

all  encumbrances, including the return of  the  sellers'

CPF, there will be no need for CPF Board to exercise  the

power of sale which, in any event, will be used only as a

last resort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For HDB flats purchased with bank-originated loans,

the  priority ranking of the CPF charge is as  listed  in

the  circulated Table (Cols. 1479-1480), and I will leave

it  to Members to peruse this.  Essentially, the bank has

the first claim, and the CPF follows.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2002/20021031/20021031-HA-0751479.htm">Table 1 - Priority of claim</a><br>



<br><br><i>Implementation of Electronic Submission and Payment of CPF Contributions by Large Employers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to implementation of electronic

submission  and  payment  of CPF contributions  by  large

employers.    Employers   can   currently   submit    CPF

contributions and payments manually or electronically and

the  CPF  Board does not impose any processing fee.   All

public sector employers pay CPF through electronic means.

The   corresponding  figure  for  larger  private  sector

employers, ie, those with 100 or more employees, is  94%.

Despite the obvious savings through electronic submission

and  CPF  Board's promotional efforts, a  remnant  6%  of

larger  private employers continue to submit and pay  CPF

contributions manually.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage all employers to submit and pay CPF

contributions  electronically,  clause  10  of  the  Bill

enables  the  CPF  Board  to  prescribe  regulations   to

implement   the   payment,  collection  and   refund   of

contributions  through electronic means and  empower  the

Minister to prescribe such fees and charges that  may  be

levied for manual submissions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a start, the CPF Board will impose processing

fees  on those larger companies which continue to utilise

the   manual  mode  after  1st  April  2003.    This   is

justifiable as the Board has to incur

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>



greater cost to process manual submissions and payments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will monitor the progress of large

employers   going  into  e-modes  before   imposing   the

processing fee on smaller employers.  Even then, we  will

give smaller employers sufficient time and assistance  to

adjust  to  these  changes.   The  CPF  Board  will  also

continue  to  explore  and  develop  means  to  make   e-submission and payment of CPF more convenient and  easier

for all employers.

<br><br><i>Withdrawal of CPF after age 55</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, CPF members aged 55 years or older can

withdraw  their  CPF  savings at 3-year  intervals  after

setting aside the required Minimum Sum.  CPF members  who

have  not set aside the Minimum Sum can withdraw half  of

their  savings at 3-year intervals, with the  other  half

being used to top-up the Minimum Sum shortfall.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With greater operational efficiency, the Board is

able  to  shorten  the interval period  for  withdrawals.

Clause 5 of the Bill, therefore, amends section 15(3)  to

allow  withdrawals  at  1-year intervals  or  such  other

interval as the Minister may direct.

<br><br><i>Voluntary Contributions</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, preferential tax treatment is currently given

to   compulsory  CPF  contributions  from  employer   and

employees,  including  voluntary contributions  from  the

self-employed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is a need to encourage Singaporeans

to  save  for  retirement, CPF savings beyond  a  certain

limit  should  not be allowed to become  a  tax  shelter.

Voluntary  CPF  contributions beyond  the  tax  exemption

limit  currently enjoy a less explicit tax benefit, which

is  the  acronym TEE, ie, Taxable at contribution, Exempt

during accumulation and Exempt on withdrawal.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4, therefore, amends section 13B of the CPF

Act  to  limit  CPF  contributions made  by  a  Singapore

citizen   or  permanent  resident,  including   voluntary

contributions  paid by their employers, to the  mandatory

contribution amount, or the sum of $28,800 in  any  year,

whichever  is  the  higher.  The  amount  of  $28,800  is

derived  from the 40% CPF contribution rate of  a  $6,000

monthly salary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy change affirms the fundamental objective

of  CPF, which is to provide for basic retirement  needs.

Singaporeans  and permanent residents who  wish  to  save

more  for  retirement  may  instead  contribute  to   the

Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) which provides  tax

deferral benefits for voluntary contributions up  to  15%

of one's income, subject to a salary ceiling of $6,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill also amends section 13B to

disallow voluntary CPF contributions by any person who is

not  a citizen or permanent resident of Singapore.   Such

foreigners  already enjoy higher SRS  relief  of  35%  of

income,  as  compared to 15% for Singapore  citizens  and

permanent  residents.  With this 35% benefit in  deferred

tax  plus  50% exemption on tax at withdrawal offered  by

SRS,  foreigners already have a tax-advantage vehicle  to

save  for  retirement.  We understand that some employers

currently  contribute CPF voluntarily for  their  foreign

employees  working in Singapore.  From 1st January  2003,

these  employers are encouraged to adjust the  employees'

remuneration package accordingly.

<br><br><i>Other amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also introduces other amendments to

enhance  the  administration and operation   by  the  CPF

Board.  These include:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 to enable CPF Board to authorise any 2 of

its  officers  to sign documents under seal,  instead  of

restricting  it  to only the General Manager  and  Deputy

General Managers;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 to change the title of the General Manager

and  the  Deputy General Manager in the CPF Act to  chief

executive officer and the deputy chief executive officers

accordingly;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 to amend section 24 of the Act to clarify

that monies in any fixed deposit account maintained by  a

member with a bank under the CPF Investment Scheme or CPF

Minimum Sum are protected; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 repeals and re-enacts section 66 to clarify

that  the  section also applies to the Board's  insurance

funds,   and  removes  the  need  to  gazette  authorised

officers who may be required to give evidence in court so

long as an officer is duly authorised by the Board.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker Sir, the amendments

proposed  in  the  Bill will enable  the  return  of  CPF

savings upon sale of HDB flats which were purchased  with

bank-originated  loans; facilitate electronic  submission

and   payment   of   CPF  by  all  companies;   introduce

flexibility on the interval of CPF withdrawals after  the

age  of  55;  and  limit  the  amount  of  voluntary  CPF

contributions.   The  amendments are  in  line  with  the

overall objectives of the CPF system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key amendment in the Bill is the creation of an

automatic  charge on the HDB flats in favour of  the  CPF

Board when a CPF member withdraws CPF funds to finance or

refinance  the  purchase of the HDB flat.  These  changes

are  part of the broader recommendation on the CPF  which

the  ERC  recommended, and they have already been debated

in  Parliament.  I would thus not revisit  the  arguments

again.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to raise two key points

related   to  the  amendment.   First,  consumption   and

investments  in  housing.   A  key  thrust  of  the   ERC

recommendations  on CPF is the safeguarding  of  the  CPF

funds for retirement.  To do so, one of the strategies is

to  safeguard  funds  withdrawn for housing  purposes  by

limiting  CPF withdrawals.  However, this point seems  to

have been lost amongst Singaporeans.  With the lower  10%

cash downpayment, we see Singaporeans snapping up private

properties.  They do not seem deterred by the  fact  that

the banks now have the first charge on the mortgage loans

that they give.  I hope that beyond these amendments, the

CPF  Board  and  the Government can do  more  to  educate

Singaporeans on the impact of these changes on their  CPF

and  their retirement savings.  This will certainly  help

them  better  plan their finances, including  consumption

and investments in housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is on the CPF default rate and

electronic submission.  The CPF (Amendment) Bill seeks to

enable  the  CPF Board to implement electronic submission

and payment of CPF contributions.  With e-submission, the

CPF default rate by employers can be reduced further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on 6th September, the Business

Times reported that the CPF default rate had declined  in

the  second  quarter  of this year.   In  the  April-June

period,  0.61%  of the employers defaulted  on  payments,

compared with 0.8% in January-March.  Although the figure

is  low,  what  is worrying is that the  rate  had  risen

gradually  over the last four quarters,  and  up  to  the

second  quarter of this year.  I would like  to  ask  the

Minister of State what the CPF Board is doing to  further

reduce the default rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present CPF PAL-internet system enables

employers   to  submit  their  monthly  CPF  contribution

details  to  the Board via the Internet 24 hours  a  day,

seven  days a week.  All employers need to do is to  just

register with the Board and have a GIRO bank account.   I

would  like  to  ask  the Board what  is  the  employers'

response rate so far to the e-submission

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>



system and what more can be done to get more employers on

board, particularly the small and medium enterprises  who

generally  employ  less than 100  workers.   I  hope  the

Ministry would consider more measures to provide  greater

support and incentives to these smaller employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that by April next year, all employers

with  more  than  100 employees have to  go  for  the  e-submission  system.  However, I would like to  urge  that

more time should be given to the small businesses to make

adjustments.  In the interim, I hope the CPF Board  could

also  consider providing the e-submission service at  the

head office and the branches for employers with less than

100 employees, so that the small businesses, particularly

those who have difficulties and find it too costly to set

up  a system, will still be able to learn how to use  the

system, and eventually use e-submission, instead  of  the

traditional way of submitting CPF contributions.

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you  for  allowing  me to speak on this  CPF  (Amendment)

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I rise to express my concern on the unfair penalty

that  will  be  imposed on the HDB flat buyers  when  the

sellers  default on payment of the charge due to the  CPF

Board    after   the   amendment   comes   into    place.

Specifically,  I refer to the changes to the  Act,  which

empower the Board to sell the flat and recover its dues.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1366</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate my point with an example. Suppose

a  Mr  Ong has decided to buy a HDB flat from a  Mr  Tan.

They  agree on a price and Mr Ong duly paid up the amount

to Mr Tan either by cash, his CPF or a loan.  Thereafter,

one  would expect that Mr Ong would be able to move  into

his  dream  flat with peace of mind.  However, after  the

amendment  comes  into  force, things  might  not  be  so

straightforward anymore for Mr Ong.  Should Mr Tan decide

to  pocket the money and he does not repay the charge due

to the CPF Board, Mr Ong would be in deep trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? Because with the amended legislation, the

Board  would come after Mr Ong for the flat,  never  mind

that  Mr  Ong is not the person who defaults the payment.

After 60 days on expiry of the due date of the payment to

CPF  Board,  the Board would put up a notice of  sale  to

declare its intention to sell the flat.  Another 90  days

have  lapsed  and if Mr Tan still does not  pay  up,  the

Board  would  go  ahead  and sell the  flat  and  recover

whatever charges due to CPF Board.  As a result, Mr  Ong,

the  buyer, who has paid for the flat would lose his flat

while Mr Tan, the culprit, would get away.  An analogy is

like  when  you are going to a shop to buy  a  packet  of

rice,  but  because the shopowner did  not   pay  up  the

supplier, the supplier comes after you to take away  your

packet  of rice to recover the debt which is owed by  the

shop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is very unfair to the buyers, Mr Speaker, Sir.

I wonder if the Ministry, as the Chinese saying goes, has

become "hei bai bu fen" (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), which means

unable to differentiate the white from the black.  Or  if

the  Ministry  simply takes the easy way  out,  yes,  the

Board  can just take the flat back, sell it, recover  the

charges  due to itself and leave the buyers to  sort  out

the mess with the sellers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is another Chinese saying,

"yuan      you     tou,     zhai     you      zhu"      (

),  which  literally means there is a  culprit  to  every

wrongdoing and there is a debtor to every debt.  It means

that we must go after the real

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>

culprit  responsible for any wrongdoing and we  must  not

"yuan wang hao ren" (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), that

is, we must not wrong the innocent people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, while I support the

other  amendments in the Bill, I would like to  urge  the

Ministry  to rethink this particular amendment.   Instead

of empowering the Board to sell the HDB flat involved,  I

would like to suggest that the CPF Board be empowered  to

impose a severe penalty on the members who default on the

charges due to the Board.  For example, defaulters,  like

Mr  Tan  in  my illustration, could be fined a hefty  sum

several  times the amount due and, in some instances,  be

imprisoned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly hope that the Ministry would not reply

by  saying  that those buyers affected could take  action

against their lawyers for negligence or take out a  civil

suit  against the sellers.  Is that not a very convoluted

way of solving a simple problem?  In the first place,  it

is   already   wrong   to  ask   them   to   assume   the

responsibilities  of the seller's wrongdoing.   Now,  you

want  to  impose further burden on these innocent victims

who,  after losing their flats, have to incur extra legal

expenses and time, not to mention the mental anguish they

have to go through.  Since we know that this amendment is

unfair  and  unjust,  I  feel that  we  should  take  the

corrective action now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our law is to protect the law-abiding citizens and to hold wrongdoers responsible for

their   misdeeds.    This   particular   provision    has

contradicted  that spirit.  Therefore,  I  strongly  urge

that  this part of the amendment be reviewed and changed.

The  CPF Board must take action against the culprits  and

not  take  the  easy  option of penalising  the  innocent

victims while leaving them in the lurch.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank Mr Yeo and

Dr  Ong for their comments.  Let me reply specifically to

some of their points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has advised the public at large to

exercise prudence in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>

making  housing plans.  And we reiterate  this  call  for

home  buyers  to  acquire  homes within  their  financial

means.  He asked what CPF Board and Government can do  to

educate  Singaporeans  to  better  plan  their  finances,

including consumption and investment in housing.  I would

like  to  remind the House and the public  that  this  is

exactly  what the imposition of the valuation  limit,  in

terms  of  CPF withdrawal limit, seeks to  do.   It  will

start at 150% and slowly move over the next five years to

120%.  Similarly, the cash payments will increase from 0%

to 10%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo also talked about the CPF default rate and e-submissions, in particular, he mentioned that it was 0.6%

in  April-June up to 0.8% in January-March.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  I think these are quite highly commendable figures.

We   have   less   than   1%  of  employers   defaulting.

Statistically,  it is not different.  There  is  a  quirk

that in the month of February, there seems to be a slight

blip,  perhaps  related to the Chinese New  Year  season.

But,  yes,  we will do our utmost to reduce  the  default

rate  further.   Our  CPF  Board does  contact  employers

fairly  quick  after  they have gone  beyond  a  two-week

limit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked about small and medium enterprises and

how  we  can  help  them to enable  them  to  submit  CPF

submissions electronically.  Yes, the Ministry will  roll

out the plan.  Currently, about less than 10% do so.   We

will  extend  the same programmes that we  do  for  large

employers  to  smaller  employers, including  subsidising

some  of their transmission fees electronically.  We will

also create additional e-channels for e-submissions which

include  the  use of major kiosk service providers.   The

AXS employer returns, for example, currently utilises 150

kiosks  for goods island wide.  They can also have access

to sites in CDCs and CCCs as well as, he mentioned, GIRO.

And, yes, there are plans to also start e-lobbies, or  e-terminals  within the lobbies at CPF branches.   We  will

roll   out   special  training  plans  for  these   small

employers,  including  using the Government  IT  Literacy

Programme to co-fund part of the enabling process.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the point brought up by Dr Ong

where  he mentioned that this amendment is unfair against

the  seller.   I  would  like to  remind  him  that  this

provision already exists for private properties.   It  is

no  different from that of private properties.  The  only

difference is that now we create an automatic charge.  So

the  solution really is that you still need to enable the

CPF  Board  to acquire the properties with the  power  of

sale.  Because in certain acts of collusion between buyer

and  seller, you need the Act.  The solution  to  prevent

the  CPF Board exercising the power of sale is to  ensure

that there is due diligence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will make arrangements, in the event that HDB is

the  intermediary  and  where  HDB  is  appointed  as   a

solicitor  for  either buyer or seller  of  the  flat  to

ensure  that  the  CPF  funds  have  been  returned.   In

addition, banks and lawyers will be informed of  the  CPF

charge  and the power of sale that comes with it so  that

they  will do their diligence.  They will conduct  search

at  the CPF Board and the existence of the CPF charge  on

the HDB flat.  It will be in the interest of the banks to

ensure  that the CPF charge is this charge from the  sale

of  the flat so that there is no encumbrance on the flat.

The  buyer's lawyer should ensure that the title  to  the

flat   is   passed  to  their  client  free  from   prior

encumbrance  and the seller's lawyer should  also  ensure

that  their client returns the CPF as otherwise the  sale

could  be  jeopardised, should CPF invoke  its  power  of

sale.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the unlikely event that the above mechanisms fail

and  the  CPF  monies secured by the CPF charge  are  not

paid,  the  CPF  Board will still seek the assistance  of

HDB,  the mortgagees and the parties' lawyers to  recover

the CPF monies from the sellers.  With due diligence from

all  parties involved, this power will rarely be  invoked

and,  indeed,  only as a last resort, such  as  instances

when there is evidence of collusion between the buyers or

sellers,  will  CPF Board proceed to  sell  the  flat  to

recover  the  seller's CPF money that is secured  by  the

charge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July this year, Government announced that the

bank  origination  of  HDB market  rate  loans  would  be

implemented from 1st January next year, 2003.  One of the

objectives   of   this   Bill  is   to   facilitate   the

implementation of bank origination.  The Bill also  seeks

to  fine-tune  the Act to facilitate HDB's implementation

of its upgrading programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I explain the proposed amendments in

greater detail, allow me to first reiterate the rationale

for bank origination of market rate loans.

<br><br><i>Bank Origination of HDB Market Rate Loans</i>

<br><br><i>HDB Concessionary and Market Rate Loans</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB provides mortgage loans at a concessionary

interest  rate  to  help eligible  Singaporeans  buy  HDB

flats.   These subsidised flats are granted to first-time

subsidised flat buyers as well as second-time buyers  who

are upgrading from smaller flats.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB currently also provides loans at market rates.

Such market rate loans are for HDB buyers who have either

previously consumed HDB housing loan subsidies, or who do

not  qualify for HDB subsidies in the first place.  There

are  five categories of such buyers:  Singapore Permanent

Residents;   private   property   owners;   high   income

households, ie, those which earn $8,000 or more a  month;

those  who have already enjoyed two concessionary  loans;

and,  finally,  those who have enjoyed one  concessionary

loan for the purchase of a subsidised flat and are buying

a similar-sized flat, or a smaller flat.

<br><br><i>Bank Origination from 1st January 2003</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members are aware, my Ministry is reviewing the

functions  of  HDB  to see in what  way  HDB  can  better

fulfill its core responsibility, which is to provide good

quality   and  affordable  public  housing.   A   guiding

principle  of the review is that HDB should,  as  far  as

possible,   let  the  private  sector  take  over   those

functions which extend beyond this core responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One such activity is the provision of market rate

loans.   As these loans are not subsidised and are pegged

to  commercial  rates,  there is no  reason  for  HDB  to

continue  to  provide  them.  Our financial  institutions

have  the  resources and are well positioned  to  provide

competitive mortgage financing for the purchase of public

housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the Government decided that HDB will no

longer  provide  market rate loans with effect  from  1st

January 2003.  Flat buyers who are not eligible for HDB's

concessionary rate loans can take market rate loans  from

the many banks which are licensed to offer housing loans.

Existing  HDB  market rate mortgagors can transfer  their

remaining mortgages to the banks if they so wish.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have previously expressed concern that

the provision of market rate loans by banks, instead of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1372</b></font><br><br>

HDB,  is  in  effect  a withdrawal by Government  of  its

social safety net.  They see HDB as generally being  more

sympathetic towards flat owners in arrears, and will  not

repossess  flats  as a last resort.  On the  other  hand,

they perceive banks as being less forbearing, as they are

profit-driven.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reiterate that there is no change in the

Government's commitment to the provision of basic housing

in the form of subsidised HDB flats.  We are not touching

our basic housing safety net.  Our housing subsidies have

enabled  the vast majority of Singaporeans to  own  their

own  homes.  Concessionary loans are a key instrument  to

promote  home  ownership.   Hence,  the  Government  will

continue  to provide HDB loans at concessionary rates  to

eligible  buyers.  We will continue to maintain our  home

ownership  policy  by  providing  subsidised  loans   for

subsidised  flats  so  that  eligible  Singaporeans   can

continue to afford good quality public housing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, with bank origination of market rate loans,

the  Government is indeed pulling back the safety net  at

the  fringes.  But this will only apply to those  who  do

not  need extra help in the first place.  They are either

the  financially better off, or those who already  own  a

HDB flat.

<br><br><i>Flexibility with responsibility</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While flat-buyers will enjoy greater flexibility by

obtaining loans from banks, this greater flexibility also

comes  with greater responsibility.  Those who take loans

from   banks  should  exercise  financial  prudence,   do

financial  planning, and buy a flat within  their  means.

They  must  go  into the purchases with their  eyes  wide

open,  and expect to be subject to the mortgage financing

rules and foreclosure practices of the banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tandem with the move to bank origination and

greater  responsibility,  I  had,  in  July  this   year,

signalled  my Ministry's intention to treat  certain  HDB

flats   bought   with  bank  loans  more   like   private

properties.  I informed this House that MND was  actively

studying whether

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1373</b></font><br><br>

and  how  the  restrictions on resale and rental  of  HDB

flats  can  be  relaxed.  This is also in line  with  the

recommendations of various Economic Review Committee sub-committees,  such as the CPF Working Group and  the  Sub-Committee   on  Entrepreneurship,  that  the   Government

explore  various ways to help homeowners  monetise  their

housing assets and thus free up capital in the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to announce the results of our review.

<br><br><i>Current policy</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB flats are restricted by a minimum occupation

period  (MOP), which is the minimum period that a  lessee

needs  to own a flat before he can sell it.  The  MOP  is

currently  five  years  for a flat bought  at  subsidised

prices,  ie, either directly from HDB or a flat from  the

resale market but bought with a CPF Housing Grant, and it

is  21/2 years for a non-subsidised flat bought from  the

resale market without any CPF Housing Grant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subletting of the whole flat is also currently

disallowed,   except   in  special  circumstances.    For

example, the lessee may be overseas, or he may be elderly

and, subject to various criteria, he can sublet his whole

flat for income generation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These restrictions reinforce the principle of long-term owner occupation for subsidised public housing.

They  help to justify the subsidies enjoyed by  HDB  flat

lessees  and are fundamental features distinguishing  HDB

flats from private property.

<br><br><i>Policy refinements</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has considered the proposals from the

ERC  carefully.  It has decided that, together  with  the

move  to bank origination in January 2003, HDB will relax

the current restrictions on MOP and subletting for resale

flats  that are bought without the CPF Housing Grant  and

which are financed by bank loans.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st January 2003, HDB lessees who buy resale

flats  without any CPF Housing Grant and with bank  loans

will  only  need  to  occupy their flats  for  one  year,

instead  of the current 21/2 years, before they can  sell

it  in  the  open market.  Existing resale  flats  bought

without  any CPF Housing Grant will also qualify  if  the

lessee  re-finances his outstanding HDB market rate  loan

with  banks  or fully redeems his HDB market  rate  loan.

The  reduction in MOP will also apply to existing  resale

flats  that  are  bought without CPF  Housing  Grant  and

without any loan from HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subletting rules for these categories of flat buyers

will  also  be  relaxed.  HDB will allow them  to  sublet

their entire flat if they have occupied them for 10 years

or  more.   With these changes, HDB resale  flats  bought

without  any CPF Housing Grant and without any loan  from

HDB will be treated more like private properties.

<br><br><i>Subletting guidelines to prevent disamenities</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me stress that the Government is not

abandoning  the principle of long-term owner  occupation,

or  the social objectives of public housing.  That is why

we  have  not  completely relaxed the MOP and  subletting

rules.   To preserve the good environment of our  housing

estate  and  to  minimise nuisances that may  arise  from

subletting,  the  HDB will apply certain  guidelines  and

conditions  on  subletting that  are  already  in  place.

Lessees  are still expected to comply with the  covenants

in   the   lease   and  will  be  held  responsible   for

infringements  committed by their sub-tenants.   The  HDB

will  also work closely with the grassroots organisations

and  the  residents  to ensure that subletting  does  not

become  detrimental to the living environment of the  HDB

blocks.   The HDB will be releasing more details soon  on

the relaxation of the MOP and subletting rules.

<br><br><i>Amendments to the Act</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to the specific amendments to

the  Housing and Development Act - what they are and  why

they are being amended.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Amendments related to bank origination</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank loans for the purchase of HDB flats are secured

on the value of the flats.  Hence the bank has to be able

to foreclose the loan, recover vacant possession of a HDB

flat  and conduct a mortgagee sale, should the flat owner

default  in his mortgage payments.  Clause 6 of the  Bill

will  allow this, by enabling the bank to attach the flat

when  it is exercising its power of sale under the  terms

of  the  mortgage charge.  The bank, in place of  HDB  as

mortgagee, will have first charge on the market rate loan

should there be a foreclosure of the mortgage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government recognises that bank origination is a

significant  move for HDB flat buyers.  We are  therefore

keeping   certain  safeguards  in  place.   The   current

protection  clause  in the Housing  and  Development  Act

against third-party creditors will not be changed.   Flat

lessees  and  their families, including  those  who  take

their  mortgage  loans from banks, will  not  lose  their

flats  as  a  result of claims by third parties,  in  the

event that they become bankrupt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill also allows CPF Board to, as a

last  resort, exercise its power of sale to  recover  CPF

monies  used in the purchase of the flat when  solicitors

acting  for  the  various parties fail to  ensure  proper

refund  of  CPF monies when the flat is sold.  This  will

help  to  safeguard the return of CPF savings to the  CPF

member's account for his retirement use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, HDB's consent is required before a

mortgage  by  a  bank can be made  on  a  HDB  flat.   To

facilitate the process of obtaining HDB's consent and  to

set  out  the  terms  and conditions  for  granting  such

consent,  clause 9 of the Bill enables HDB to make  rules

for the creation of mortgage on HDB flats.

<br><br><i>Upgrading works in HDB precincts</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the subject of upgrading works

in HDB precincts.  There

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1376</b></font><br><br>

is  no  change  to our policies, but the amendments  will

ease the implementation of the upgrading programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Lift Upgrading Programme (LUP) that was

introduced  last year can be implemented as part  of  the

Main  Upgrading  Programme (MUP).   New  lifts  and  lift

shafts  will  be added, where it is technically  feasible

and  cost-effective to do so, to give residents  barrier-free access when their blocks are identified for the MUP.

A  75%  `yes' vote from the residents is required  before

MUP  or LUP can proceed.  Clause 11 of the Bill will make

it  clear that, although residents vote for both the  MUP

and  the LUP at the same time, the LUP will only proceed,

if both the MUP and LUP polls are successful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments related to upgrading works will

provide  a clearer definition of the various terms  used.

For  example, lift upgrading is today defined  under  the

category of `special upgrading works' in the Housing  and

Development  Act.     Clause 10  will  provide  HDB  with

greater  flexibility  should  we  decide  to  expand  the

present  scope of special upgrading works to other  types

of  HDB properties.  Clause 14 will give HDB the power of

entry, including forcible entry, into HDB flats to  carry

out  upgrading works within a flat or building  that  has

successfully voted for upgrading.  Such powers  will,  of

course, be used very sparingly if at all.

<br><br><i>Administrative measures</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill will also introduce some administrative

changes  to  improve the enforcement  of  public  housing

regulations and policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, clause 2 of the Bill provides for the

appropriate  authority  to approve  the  purchase,  sale,

lease  and  exchange of lands based on the  land  values.

This   is  because  the  Government  Instruction  Manuals

already provide for different approving authorities based

on the value of the lands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, clause 3 makes it clear that the rules on

renovation of HDB flats apply

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>

to both the flat owners and the renovation contractor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, clause 4 of the Bill disallows HDB from

delegating  the  power to make subsidiary legislation  to

any  person.  It also disallows HDB to delegate the power

to delegate to another party.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, clause 5 of the Bill spells out that all

flat  lessees, regardless of when they bought their flats

from  HDB, must seek HDB's prior consent before they  are

allowed to use their flats as a Technopreneur Home Office

or for other commercial purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 15 of the Bill increases the maximum

penalty for refusing to give information or giving  false

information  to  HDB  to  a  $2,000  fine  or  a  3-month

imprisonment  term or both.  This is  to  enable  HDB  to

effectively  enforce against illegal  parking  along  HDB

service  roads.  Similar penalties are imposed under  the

Parking  Places Act and the Urban Redevelopment Authority

Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the introduction of market pricing for HDB

flats,  it  is  only  fair that  HDB  should  reduce  its

restrictions on flat owners who do not enjoy much housing

subsidy.  The Bill will provide more flexibility for flat

owners who are presently required to pay HDB market rates

for mortgage loan to obtain loan from banks instead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This move will benefit those who are able to secure

attractive   mortgage  loans  due  to   their   financial

credentials.  But it may pose problems to those  who  are

in  financial  hardship.  These include Singaporeans  who

are  bankrupt or face financial hardship due to the  loss

of  their  sole  breadwinners or  prolonged  unemployment

during recessions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 10 years, many HDB flat owners have

upgraded to bigger flats.  Many dual income families  had

applied  for larger flats and obtained subsidised housing

loans  from  HDB.   As a result of the  recent  financial

crisis, some are presently facing difficulty paying their

mortgages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed Bill will have negative impact on two

groups of Singaporeans.  Those who wish to downgrade to a

smaller  flat  due to various reasons, such as  financial

hardship  or  retirement,  or  those  who  wish  to  move

laterally to another flat of the same size due to reasons

such as opting to stay near their family members.  I wish

to  urge  the Minister to consider providing HDB loan  to

these  two  groups of Singaporeans, in particular,  those

facing financial hardships.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the lifting of rental restrictions, the supply

of  rental  flats  will  increase,  thus  providing  more

options  and  cheaper accommodation  for  people  seeking

rental  flats.   But, to avoid any inconvenience  to  HDB

residents,  HDB  should apply a  cap  on  the  number  of

persons living in various sizes of rental flats.  This is

to avoid HDB flats being rented out as workers' dormitory

for foreign workers, thus affecting the residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we should also consider removing the

two-and-a-half-year  occupation period  for  flat  owners

taking  a  private bank loan.  This will further increase

the  supply of rental flats, thus providing more  options

for rental.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the change in policy to allow private bank

loans  for  certain  households of HDB  flats  may  cause

confusion  if  the terms and conditions are  not  clearly

disseminated  to  the  public.  Many  existing  HDB  flat

owners  who may fall into this category may not be  aware

of  the  financial implications of taking up a bank  loan

which has first charge on their flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we encourage financial prudence and self-management, many HDB flat owners may not understand the

financial risks involved in taking up a bank loan.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>

These  include fluctuating interest rates, penalties  for

late  payment,  termination or early  payment  of  entire

loans,  aggressive debt recovery procedures and  charges,

higher  legal  fees,  and many other  miscellaneous  bank

charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to protect the interest of HDB flat owners, HDB

must  launch  a  campaign to educate the  public  on  the

financial   implications  of  bank  loans,  and   provide

financial counselling to potential HDB flat owners  using

bank  loans.  This will help Singaporeans to make better-informed decisions when purchasing HDB flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to seek clarifications on certain

technical points in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 24(2) of the

Housing  and Development Board Act by deleting  the  word

"Minister" and substituting it with the words "prescribed

approving authority".  Section 24 provides the power  for

HDB  to  purchase, sell and lease or exchange land.   The

amendment   removes  the  need  to  seek  the  Minister's

approval   when   selling,   surrendering,   leasing   or

exchanging land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the rationale of removing this authority

from  the  Minister  or delegating this  authority?   The

selling,  surrendering, leasing or exchange of  land  has

drastic  impact  on land use and the real estate  market.

The supply of land has always been a concern for both the

Government  and the private sector in Singapore.   It  is

only prudent that such authority be given to the Minister

instead  of  delegating  it  to  a  prescribed  approving

authority.  I do not understand why the Board  must  seek

the  approval of the Minister when purchasing or  leasing

any land but do not need the Minister's approval when  it

sells, surrenders, leases or exchanges land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 11 of the Bill amends section 65C of the

Housing  and Development Board Act with regard to special

upgrading works.  I hope the Minister can clarify what is

classified as special

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>

upgrading  works and under what circumstances  must  flat

owners  vote for such works.  To date, only the provision

of lifts at every landing is defined as special upgrading

work,  which  requires voting and payment  by  residents.

Interim  upgrading works are usually 100% funded  by  the

Government and residents need not pay at all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the scope of special upgrading works is not

clearly  defined,  many items of  works  in  the  interim

upgrading  package  may be included as special  upgrading

works,  thus requiring payment by residents.   This  will

pose  undue  financial  burden on  residents,  especially

those in 3- and 4-room flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the amendment in clause 5 to allow

restricted  use  of HDB flats for commercial  use.   This

will facilitate the Technopreneur Home Office scheme.  To

further  encourage entrepreneurship,  I  would  urge  the

Minister  to  expand  the home office  scheme  for  micro

businesses,  such  as small agency or consultancy  firms.

This  will provide more opportunities for business start-ups which will eventually contribute to our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise  to  support  the Housing  and  Development

(Amendment) Bill and the various measures proposed by the

Minister, particularly the schemes to help home-owners to

monetise their housing assets and free up capital in  the

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise the following points so

as  to moderate the impact on house-owners who are facing

financial  hardships  because of  the  current  difficult

business and economic conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, house-owners who have enjoyed one concessionary

loan with a subsidised flat and are downgrading or moving

laterally  will  now  be required to take  market  loans.

Could  the Minister reconsider this especially for  those

households facing financial hardships?  Like many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>

others,  I am concerned that they would find difficulties

to secure a bank loan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the proposal to allow house-owners who have

bought "non-subsidised" flats without any subsidy as well

as  existing  lessees of such "non-subsidised"  flats  to

have  the  flexibility  to sublet  their  whole  flat  is

welcomed.   Sir,  I  would  like,  however,  to  ask  the

Minister  to  allow  house-owners  of  subsidised  flats,

especially those who have fully redeemed their HDB loans,

to  have  a similar flexibility.  Some may face financial

hardship, especially those who are retrenched and  cannot

find  employment.  They are not able to sell their  flats

and  downgrade in these difficult times.  We should allow

them  this flexibility to monetise their housing  assets.

Others  may  not want to sell their flats for sentimental

or  other  reasons.  They want to move to  smaller  flats

within  their  current means or stay with their  children

who  can  take  care of them.  I hope the Minister  would

consider  such cases having due regard to their hardships

which they may face in these difficult times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this note, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  all  know that HDB is one of the key  household

words in Singapore.  There would not be the scale of home-ownership  as  we  now  know and have  here  without  the

concept and philosophy behind the setting up of HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an achievement which Singaporeans are all

proud  of.  Successful as we are economically, the  value

of  home-ownership, as a base for instilling a  sense  of

belonging  and  as  stakeholders in  the  newly  emerging

nation like our Singapore is priceless.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons why HDB has been able to deliver

on  that  score is that it understood the  need  for  the

Board   to  remain  relevant,  nimble  and  flexible   in

fulfilling  its  role.   HDB knows goalposts  related  to

housing keep changing as Singapore and Singaporeans  move

up the ladder of economic and social well-being.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>

For, after all, housing in Singapore is more than just  a

question  of  brick and mortar.  It is  indeed  a  socio-political  phenomenon.   It is  about  living  and,  more

importantly, living under one multi-cultural roof.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging from the number of amendments made by HDB

since  its inception, we are reassured that HDB wants  to

remain  relevant, nimble and helpful.   Whether  for  the

better administration of the Act or to allow the Minister

to make rules with respect to the terms and conditions of

a sale, lease, mortgage or disposal of an HDB flat, or to

allow  an  approved mortgage or statutory  charge  or  to

enable  a  poll  to be conducted for lift  upgrading  and

other special upgrading works, as the purpose behind this

amendment Bill, to me, they all point to the intention of

the HDB wanting to be helpful, and I support that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that upgrading has been and is generally on

the  radar  screen for sometime now.  Similarly,  matters

pertaining  to  leases, mortgages and the role  of  local

banks  are also very much in focus now.  While I have  no

specific  comments to make on those proposed  amendments,

except to call for a faster rate of lift upgrading, allow

me,  Mr Speaker, Sir, to urge the HDB to also look at the

problem of those who want to downgrade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realise that the HDB has been very understanding

in facing the problems of those who need help in terms of

rescheduling   mortgages  or  in  settlement   of   other

financial  dues.   The recent economic downturn  and  its

subsequent  retrenchments  and rising  unemployment  have

made  many,  especially in the lower income brackets,  to

realistically review their aspirations and  dreams  about

the level and quality of home-ownership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many cases I met at the MPS, something I suspect

must be true at other MPSs too, are seriously facing this

problem  of not being able to meet their obligations  and

do  see downgrading as a way out.  For those who had  the

hopes  of  making a profit from selling their flats  have

had to think again.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1383</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many, I suspect, are caught in this trap. They want

to  downgrade  but  there are not many  three-room  flats

available  as  the  HDB has stopped  building  new  ones.

Neither  could they sell their present four or  five-room

flats  without making a loss.  Moreover, they would  also

need  to  put  up  cash upfront for their new  purchases,

something they would be hard put at.  I do not  know  how

serious  this problem is but I fear it might be faced  by

many Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the HDB, Sir, study this problem and see how

best it could help the many home-owners who would like to

or  need to downgrade, but not capable of doing so either

because of policy considerations or the market supply and

demand situation?  Could the HDB also review its existing

policies  that might make it difficult for those  needing

to  do  so?   This  should also  be  part  of  the  HDB's

endeavours to remain nimble and flexible in helping those

in need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  to  appeal to the Ministry of National Development,

in  view of the amendment Bill, to consider, in this time

of  slow  economic  recovery, when many Singaporeans  are

still facing difficulties in finding employment and  many

families are stretching on their savings, allowing for  a

second concessionary rate HDB loan for families who  move

laterally and downgrade their flats to a smaller flat due

to  forced circumstances, such as retrenchments, business

failures,  critical  illnesses,  death  of  breadwinners,

divorce separations, imprisonment and family support.  If

these affected families are not able to enjoy this second

concessionary loan rate from HDB, they will forever be in

the  financial web and stuck in this difficult  financial

position even if they downgrade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, these people downgrade to lessen their

financial difficulty. As stated earlier by Mr Mah Bow Tan

on bank origination of HDB bank rate loans in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1384</b></font><br><br>

Parliament on 23rd July, concessionary loans  are  a  key

instrument  to  promote  home-ownership.   In  such  dire

circumstances, if these families are not able to get  the

concessionary  rate  loans, they would  even  lose  their

ability to own a flat. Since we cannot tell banks not  to

foreclose  for hardship cases, we should encourage  these

families to take responsibility and be more dependent  on

themselves.  We  should  applaud their  decisive  choice.

This  is  in  line  with  Government's  encouragement  of

prudence and responsibility in housing purchase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, most of the people in this group may be

from  the  lower income.  This would also  cause  another

major  problem  as they may not qualify  for  the  banks'

strict  income criteria assessment.  So if  they  do  not

qualify, where can they turn to?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to appeal to the

Ministry  to  evaluate these special cases  individually.

The  HDB  would be able to set relevant criteria for  the

evaluation of the eligibility for this concessionary rate

loan to ensure that when these families move laterally or

downgrade, they are truly in financial difficulties  and,

in these circumstances, truly eligible for the subsidised

loan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possibility to prevent abuse of the flexibility

of  consideration  by  HDB for this second  concessionary

loan  is  to cap the quantum for the second concessionary

loan,  possibly  in relation to the previous  outstanding

loan  amount  of  the previous flat.   This  action  will

definitely   encourage  the  fundamental   objective   of

responsible    and    prudent   home-ownership    amongst

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area of concern is that although the

proposed   amendments  will  enhance  the  home-ownership

scheme   to   remain   relevant  and  injecting   greater

flexibility  into  the  public housing  market,  I  would

suggest  that MND and HDB do consider certain  guidelines

to   preserve  the  residential  nature  of  the  housing

estates,  especially  so  in a  high  density  and  close

proximity of a block of flats.  We should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1385</b></font><br><br>

not  turn the residential blocks into hostels, especially

for foreign workers and foreign students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MND and HDB must retain the final authority to

cancel  or  reject subletting permission,  especially  so

when   nuisance  and  complaints  are  being  made   from

neighbours.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, at present, about 86% of Singaporeans  live

in HDB flats.  Among them, 96% have purchased their flats

from  HDB.   Apparently, the Government's home  ownership

scheme has been well supported and is very successful.  I

think  Singapore is the only country in the  world  where

the  housing  needs of as much as 86% of the  people  are

satisfied  by  public housing, with almost  every  family

owning  its  own flat.  This is a win-win  situation  for

both the Government and the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as in any other schemes, any changes to the

housing  scheme  or  any  amendment  to  the  law  would,

directly or indirectly, affect some of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this amendment Bill, I would like to raise three

points.    First,   on   the  change   in   granting   of

concessionary  loan.   Under  the  current  rules,  every

qualified  buyer  is  entitled to  a  concessionary  loan

offered  by  the HDB.  However, under the  amended  rule,

when an existing owner of a HDB flat  wants to downgrade,

eg,  from  a 5-room or 4-room flat to a 3-room  flat,  or

from a 4-room flat to another 4-room flat, he will not be

entitled to this concessionary loan.  Of course, if  they

have  the means, there is no problem.  But for those  who

are  facing financial difficulties, particularly  in  the

past  few  years because of the economic recession,  many

people  are retrenched or unemployed, and are  unable  to

find  jobs  for  a long period of time,  they  will  have

problem  servicing their loan, and may have to resort  to

downgrading  in order to make ends meet.  Under  the  new

rule,  they  will not be able to enjoy this concessionary

loan from the HDB.  I think this is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>

something that we should carefully reconsider.  Residents

who  have  to downgrade from a bigger flat to  a  smaller

flat owing to financial hardship will face double trouble

if   they   are   deprived  of  the  entitlement   to   a

concessionary loan rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another group that warrants special consideration is

the  senior citizens.  In their younger days, they  could

have  purchased a big flat so that they could  live  with

their  children and grandchildren.  Now that the children

have  grown up,  bought their own flats, and set up their

own families, the old folks may find the flat too big for

just   the  old  couple  who  are  left  alone,  all   by

themselves.  They do not need to stay in such a big flat,

and the logical thing is to  downgrade to a smaller flat.

But now, they are not entitled to the concessionary loan.

In  the circumstances, can we not review the applications

on  a  case-by-case  basis?  If they  were  in  financial

difficulties, particularly those who were retrenched,  or

maybe  those  who were adjudicated bankrupt or  had  some

special financial difficulties, can we not consider their

cases  on  a  case-by-case  basis?   As  for  the  senior

citizens,  do  we have enough studio apartments  for  the

elderly?  I think this is one area where the HDB needs to

look into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, minimum occupancy period of resale flats.

Under the present rules, you have to stay in the flat for

more  than 21/2 years before you can put it up for resale

in  the  open  market.  With the present amendment,  this

minimum  occupancy period is shortened to one  year.  The

point  is, since they have bought the flat from the  open

market  with no subsidy from the Government,  why  should

there be such a restriction?  Can we not fully liberalise

this rule and do away with this restriction, so that when

they  apply  to the bank for a loan, they will  be  in  a

better position to bargain for better terms?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, subletting of flats. Those who bought the

resale  flats from the open market are allowed to  sublet

the  flat  after  staying there for a certain  period  of

time.  I  would like to ask the Minister how  many  units

would qualify for this scheme under

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>

the  present  arrangement. Of course, the permission  for

subletting  is  a  good  policy.   It  will  provide  the

prospective tenants with cheaper rental flats and, at the

same  time,  allow the owners to earn some extra  income.

However,  if there were too many of these units available

for subletting, it would give rise to some problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Minister mentioned that such

subletting would be subjected to strict rules.  We  would

like to know whether there would be enough provisions  in

the  rules to restrict the owners from subletting  to  an

excessive  number of foreign workers to the annoyance  of

their neighbours, or people who use the flats for illegal

activities.  This is something which we have to  be  very

careful  about. Each and every application for subletting

should be carefully scrutinised before it is approved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, thank you for

allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several of my hon. colleagues of the House have

spoken  at length on the Bill.  Let me add my support  of

the  Bill for giving the HDB the flexibility to  allow  a

wider  use  of HDB flats.  This is timely as  the  nation

emphasises    the    importance   of    creativity    and

innovativeness, the promotion of entrepreneurship and the

encouragement  of  starting  of  new  business.   But  in

allowing  the  wider use of HDB flats beyond  residential

purposes,  let  us be mindful of the needs of  neighbours

and other residents.  The Bill  -  ultimately, the Act  - provides  for  the  termination of  the  lease  for  non-authorised use.  But what about lessees who use the flats

for  the  intended  purposes but are indifferent  to  the

needs of residents and neighbours?  Their activities  may

cause  annoyance.   But  instead of  doing  something  to

reduce  the  annoyance, they hide  behind  the  authority

granted  to  them  to  use the flats.   I  hope  that  in

granting them the right to the flat,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>

the lessees are also made to undertake the responsibility

not  to  disturb  the neighbours.  If  they  unreasonably

choose   to  ignore  the  problems  they  cause  to   the

neighbours  and neighbourhood, the Board  must  have  the

right to withdraw the privileges granted to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I rise to oppose the

amendment.  This amendment requires HDB flat buyers,  who

have  used up their subsidised loan quota or who are  not

qualified  for  subsidies, to take market  rate  mortgage

loan from banks rather than the HDB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 of the Bill provides for banks to grant

mortgage,  and they would be able to take HDB flats  from

registered  lessees   and sell them  to  pay  outstanding

loans.   The  implication of this amendment is  that  HDB

flats  can now be seized and sold by bank mortgagees  for

default of mortgage loans.  Although the reason for  this

change,  as  explained,  is that lending  money  to  flat

buyers  at  market  rate is not HDB's core  business,  my

question  is  whether  this entire move  of  making  flat

owners   take   loans  from  the  banks  is   politically

motivated.   We all know how devastating  it  can  be  to

evict  families from the only roof they have  over  their

heads.  HDB, being a statutory board, is identified as  a

wing of the Government.  If it has to evict families  who

have  not  kept up with their payments, it will show  how

uncaring and uncompassionate the Government is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this current economic climate and uncertainty in

the  future  employment market, we can expect that  there

will   be   retrenchments,  unemployment  and   decreased

business opportunities.  More families will be unable  to

keep  up  with  their loan payments. By shifting  lending

from  the  HDB to the banks, the banks will be  the  ones

doing the eviction. In this way, the Government will  not

be  seen as the bad guy, when, in reality, the Government

is  distancing  itself from Singaporeans who  are  facing

tougher  times ahead.  This, in Mandarin, is called  chea

tau sha len.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1389</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to seek clarification on clause 2

of  the  Bill.   Instead of the Minister,  a  "prescribed

approving authority" will decide whether HDB land will be

sold,  exchanged, surrendered or leased.  The Explanatory

Statement  says  that  the approving  authority  will  be

prescribed  in the Rules.  I wonder who is this  powerful

authority  going  to  be;  will  it  be  more  than   one

authority; and what is the reason for the change.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I would like to thank various

Members for speaking in support of the Bill, and  I  will

respond to Mr Low Thia Khiang later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Dr Teo Ho Pin has asked whether we

can help those who either downgrade or move laterally and

who  are  in  financial difficulties because he  believes

that  in  this current situation, they may find  it  more

difficult to get a bank loan instead of a loan from  HDB.

Several  other  Members have also spoken along  the  same

lines  -  Mr  Othman Haron Eusofe, Mdm Cynthia  Phua,  Mr

Zainul Abidin and also Mr Ang Mong Seng.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first of all, explain - I think it was Mr

Ang Mong Seng who said that this is a new policy  -  that

this  is  not a new policy.  This is an existing  policy,

and  what  this amendment Bill seeks to do is to  require

such  lessees, instead of getting a market rate loan from

HDB,  to  now  get it from the bank.  This  is  just  for

clarification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But back to the reason why we have not allowed these

people  who want to either downgrade or to move laterally

from  taking a concessionary loan and instead to  take  a

market rate loan.  First of all, let me, as I said in  my

Second  Reading  speech,  repeat  once  again  that   the

Government  is committed to ensuring that public  housing

in  Singapore remains affordable to its citizens.  As the

public  housing authority, HDB's role is to  ensure  that

all  Singaporeans  will be able to afford  at  least  the

first  HDB  flat.  This is the reason why HDB  sells  new

flats at subsidised prices and also with subsidised loans

at concessionary interest rates, and HDB will continue to

do so.  If they do not wish to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1390</b></font><br><br>

buy  a  subsidised new flat, they can also buy  a  resale

flat and we give them a CPF housing grant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first loan, HDB will provide a subsidised

interest rate for first-timers.  In addition to that,  to

encourage  social mobility, to encourage people  to  move

up, to allow those who have outgrown their flats  -  they

may  have  bought  a 3-room flat many  years  ago;  their

families have grown up; they want to have more rooms  for

their  children  -  or they just simply want  to  have  a

bigger flat, HDB provides a second concessionary loan  to

those  who  have  already bought their  first  subsidised

flat.   So, from the perspective of the need for housing,

the need to have a roof over their heads, there is really

no strong reason for an HDB flat owner to move laterally;

in other words, move from one flat to another flat of the

same size, or for him to downgrade.  And those who decide

to do so should consider carefully when they do so.  They

should act prudently and they should decide whether  they

have sufficient funds.  Indeed they would have sufficient

funds in most cases arising from the sale of the existing

flat.   Invariably,  most of them who  sell  their  first

flat,  which is a subsidised flat, would be able to enjoy

quite a significant capital gain.  They can then use this

capital gain to finance the purchase of the second  flat,

which  is either of the same size or smaller.  But having

said  all  these, we do know that there  are  people  who

downgrade  because of financial difficulties,  and  these

are  the cases which, I think, Members in this House come

across during their meet-the-people sessions.  These  are

the  cases  which Members who have spoken  just  now  are

referring  to - people who have difficulties in servicing

their  mortgage either because of retrenchment, prolonged

illness, demise of their main breadwinner, and so on  and

so  forth.   Therefore, because of  this,  they  have  no

choice but to downgrade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we recognise that there are such cases which

downgrade due to financial difficulties and I would  like

to  assure  Members of the House that HDB  will  consider

such  cases sympathetically as and when they come to  the

attention of the HDB.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also mentioned the cases of those who either

move  laterally or downgrade in order to stay near  their

parents.  I believe he asked whether such cases can  also

be  allowed to enjoy the second concessionary loan.   Let

me inform him that there are actually quite a few schemes

in  place  to  encourage people to move nearer  to  their

families.  There are higher CPF housing grants for resale

flats,  for  those  who  wish to  move  nearer  to  their

families.   There  is a married children priority  scheme

for purchase of new flats in the mature estates.  And all

these schemes have been fairly successful.  The number of

families living nearby or in the same estate has actually

gone  up.   So, I do not think there is any special  need

for  another  scheme  to  promote  family  living.   But,

nevertheless,  we  will keep in mind his  suggestion  for

another day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also proposed some restrictions on rental

flats.   If  somebody wishes to sublet his  flat,  he  is

concerned  that,  without any restriction,  this  may  be

abused.   It can either be let to foreign workers  or  to

those  who are not so socially responsible and so on.   I

believe  several other Members have also  made  the  same

point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure them that this is a concern of the HDB

and,  in  fact,  this is the reason why even  today,  HDB

allows   subletting  of  the  whole  flat  under  special

circumstances.   There  is already  in  place  a  set  of

guidelines  to govern such subletting.  In  other  words,

you  cannot just freely sublet to any Tom, Dick or Harry.

You have to abide by such guidelines and these guidelines

and  conditions for subletting will also be applied  when

we  relax  the  subletting of HDB flats.   In  the  first

place,  they  will have to seek prior approval  from  HDB

before they sublet.  Lessees will be held responsible for

any  infringement that their sub-tenants commit.  And  if

there  are such infringements, then, obviously,  the  HDB

will  be  able to take action.  HDB, for this  particular

purpose,  will also conduct half-yearly flat  inspections

for approved subletting cases.  This is to make sure that

the situation

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>

that  Dr Teo talked about does not actually arise in  our

HDB estates, where you have got 20 foreign workers living

in one HDB flat, and so on.  So there will be guidelines.

There  will  be  regular inspections to  make  sure  that

infringements  do not take place.  As a final  safeguard,

what  HDB  will do is to have regular dialogues with  the

grassroots leaders, advisers and Members of Parliament to

get  feedback to see whether the scheme is working  well,

to see whether there are indeed disruptions to the social

environment,  disamenities, people who  are  anti-social,

and so on and so forth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do not think we should jump to conclusion that

people  who sublet HDB flats will automatically be  anti-social.  That is probably not being fair to those who may

wish  to  sublet  the flats.  Let me just  say  that  the

subletting  will actually allow quite a large  number  of

people  who  may not want to buy HDB flats  -  the  young

couples,  people  who are in financial difficulties,  who

may  not wish to commit - to also sublet such flats.  So,

I  do not think we should straightaway jump to conclusion

that  it  is only foreign workers who are subletting  the

flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also commented on the possibility of lessees

not  understanding clearly the financial implications  of

banks  taking  the  first charge, if they  refinance  the

loans.   I  think  this  is a legitimate  concern.   But,

having said that, I think we should also advise those who

wish  to  refinance their existing loans with banks,  all

those who are going to go to the banks for a loan in  the

first  place, to be aware and careful, to be  financially

prudent,  and  to  do  their sums before  they  jump  in.

Indeed, I dare say that the banks themselves, before they

lend,  would  also  have  to do their  homework,  do  due

diligence  work, and make sure that the people that  they

are  lending  to are creditworthy.  On both counts,  both

parties, the lender as well as the borrower, will have to

do  their  homework.  And, I believe, this  is  currently

being  done when you go to a bank to borrow for  purchase

of  a  private property.  They are not just going to lend

it  to  you  without asking any questions.  Similarly,  I

expect that the banks will exercise

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1393</b></font><br><br>

similar  prudence, credit assessments and judgement  when

they  lend to HDB flat owners.  HDB flat owners will also

have to do their sums.  So I would be loath to get HDB to

do  the financial counselling.  It is not HDB's job to do

financial  counselling for those who  are  going  to  the

banks.  If HDB were to do so, one could argue why are  we

having bank origination in the first place.  Because  the

whole  idea of bank origination is for HDB not to  be  in

the  business of providing market rate loans.  It is  not

their job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three minor points that Dr Teo raised.

One  is  on clause 2 of the Bill - I think this  is  also

what  Mr  Low Thia Khiang asked - why is it that  we  are

changing  the  Act.  Mr Low detects some monkey  business

somewhere, and this is the reason why he raised it.   But

I  would  like  to disabuse him.  There is no  conspiracy

here.   It  is quite a simple  matter.  What happened  is

that   the  Government  Instruction  Manual  has  changed

whereby  there are new authority limits.  In the  revised

Government  Instruction  Manual,  land  sales  below  $10

million  will  no longer need ministerial  approval.   It

goes to a Tenders Board.  So the approving authority,  in

this  case, for land sales below $10 million will be  the

Tenders  Board.   This Tenders Board  will  comprise  the

senior  officials  in the Ministry  of  Finance  and  the

relevant  Ministries, whichever Ministry  is  responsible

for that sale.  Land sales above $10 million will now  go

to   a   Ministerial  Committee,  and  this   Ministerial

Committee  will  consist of Ministers  from  the  Finance

Ministry,  the  National  Development  Ministry  and  the

relevant  Ministry where that sale is taking place.   So,

basically,  this is an administrative change in  the  Act

which   recognises   the  changes   in   the   Government

Instruction Manual.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 - what is "Special Upgrading Works"? This

is  what Dr Teo asked.  Special upgrading works currently

refer  to the Lift Upgrading Programme.  This is what  we

have at the moment.  When we carry out the Lift Upgrading

Programme,  we  do so under the Housing  and  Development

Act.   We  carry out a poll for Lift Upgrading  Programme

under the Housing and Development Act, and we call this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>

Special  Upgrading Works.  But, in future, we may  expand

the  scope  of Special Upgrading Works to include  things

like,  for example, a pneumatic refuse collection system,

if  we  do  decide  to implement that.  There  have  been

trials  going  on.   If we wanted to do  that,  we  could

include  that for the upgrading precinct but classify  it

as  Special  Upgrading Works.  I  just  use  this  as  an

example.   I  am not suggesting that we are going  to  do

this.  But if we do decide to, we will obviously have  to

have further discussion on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point that Dr Teo mentioned was on the

Technopreneur  Home Office Scheme.  He asked  whether  we

can  expand this to other small businesses.  Let me  just

say  that  at  the moment, we are already  allowing  some

businesses   to  be  conducted  within  the   HDB   flat,

businesses which do not pose any nuisance.  Examples that

come to mind include giving tuition, people who work from

home,  people  who  do  small scale  work,  say,  sewing,

tailoring,  that kind of business.  But we  are  actually

looking at broadening the scope of this to see whether we

can,    in    support   of   the   drive   to   encourage

entrepreneurship,  allow  some  other  businesses  to  be

allowed  in  HDB flats, provided that they do not  create

nuisance  to  their  neighbours and they  do  not  create

disamenities in the general surroundings.   But  this  is

under  discussion  with the various relevant  Ministries.

So  far,  we have not come to any conclusion  yet.   But,

yes, such discussions are ongoing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I have answered Dr Teo's points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Othman Haron Eusofe touched on two points. One

was  on  financial  hardship which,  I  believe,  I  have

answered.   He also asked about subletting, extending  to

those who are in subsidised flats.  The general principle

really  is, in this particular case, that for  those  who

are  not getting any subsidy from the Government, whether

in the price of the flats or in the loan, we are prepared

to  extend this concession to them.  However, in the case

of subsidised flats, I think there is a huge subsidy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1395</b></font><br><br>

element involved.  At this point in time, I do not  think

we should be extending such a concession to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encik Zainul talked about helping the downgraders.

I think I have also addressed that point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Cynthia Phua talked about second concession loan

for  downgraders.  I have also addressed that.  She  also

asked  about preserving the residential nature of housing

estates.  I believe I have also addressed that point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked why not just lift the MOP

(minimum  occupation period) completely.  Why  reduce  it

from  two-and-a-half years to one year?   The  reason  is

very  simple.   The MOP for HDB flats is to  ensure  that

public housing is meant for owner-occupation.  It is  not

for speculation.  It is not for investment.  So the owner-occupation principle is very important.  When you  buy  a

HDB  flat, you must live in it.  It is not for buying and

then renting out.  That is the reason why we want to keep

a  MOP  but  we  wanted to reduce it in order  to  create

greater  flexibility.  When we relax the  rules,  when  I

said  we want to treat HDB flats like private properties,

I   did   not  mean  totally,  completely  like   private

properties.  There is still a certain principle  involved

in public housing and that principle is owner occupation,

which we would like to preserve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we also want to keep the MOP of one year

because,  although it is a short period, it helps  us  to

signal  that HDB flats are not bought for speculation  or

for  investment.  And when the property market turns  up,

when  trading  of HDB flats comes back again,  which  was

quite  prevalent at one stage, we want to make sure  that

the minimum occupation period is in place to prevent such

speculation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang Mong Seng asked how many units are allowed to

be sublet and will it disrupt the rental market.  I think

that  is  the  thrust of his question.   Based  on  HDB's

statistics, for those who are either totally

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>

non-subsidised  or  those  who can  actually  re-finance,

there  is  something  like 15,000  HDB  flats  which  are

eligible  for  subletting with the 10-year rule.   Having

said  that,  I  think not all of them will be  subletting

their flats straightaway.  In the first place, they would

have to find another place to live.  And, secondly, I  do

not  think  that  HDB lessees would just want  to  sublet

their  flats without careful consideration.  So  although

the  maximum number is 15,000, I dare say that the  final

number that will actually be released out into the rental

market will be far less than that.  So I do not see  that

there will be a major impact on the rental market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to respond to Mr Low Thia

Khiang.  His point is that this whole move is politically

motivated that, as a result of this, Government will  now

wash  its hands off market rate loans, so that we do  not

have  to  evict tenants who foreclose.  Let me inform  Mr

Low  that  the  number of evictions  from  HDB  flats  of

tenants who do not pay up their loans, or who default  on

their loans, is extremely small.  So that has never  been

the  motivation for this move.  It is not as if there are

many  HDB  tenants who are defaulting on their loans  and

HDB  is  now  deciding to throw this problem  on  to  the

banks.   That  has  never been the  intention,  I  assure

Members  of this House.  HDB's role is to make sure  that

there  is  sufficient  housing for  our  people.   It  is

affordable, good quality housing and we want  our  people

to stay in the flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the motivation then, if it is not political?

It  is  very simple.  We are in the process of  reviewing

the  role of HDB.  We know what HDB should do.   We  want

HDB  to  concentrate on public housing.  We want  HDB  to

concentrate on building good public housing.  We want HDB

to concentrate on managing, on making sure that towns are

properly built, and so on.  HDB is not a bank.  It is not

a   financial  institution.   There  are  many  financial

institutions, over 100 at the last count, who are  better

placed  to  provide market rate loans.  These are  market

rate loans.  These are not concessionary rate loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for market rate loans which are provided at

market rates, let us leave it to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>

the  banks.  HDB should concentrate on doing what it does

best  - building good quality, affordable public housing.

That is the motivation for this move.  It has got nothing

to do with what Mr Low mentioned just now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 2, I think I have already explained to him

what the changes are about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe I have answered all the

questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I seek

clarification from the Minister?  Sir, I understand that,

currently, if the lessee of a HDB flat is evicted by  HDB

due  to financial difficulty, that is, unable to pay  the

loan,  normally on compassionate ground, HDB  will  offer

such  a  lessee a rental flat.  I would like to  ask  the

Minister,  with  the  change, when the  bank  evicts  the

lessee  of  a  HDB  flat,  will HDB  come  in  and  help?

Otherwise, where are they going to live?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, in the first place, when

somebody  buys a property to live in - and I  am  talking

again, and I remind the House, that this is not the first

basic  flat, we are talking about the second or even  the

third  flat  -  when he decides to purchase that  second,

third,  or whatever flat, he has to do so with  his  eyes

wide  open, knowing exactly what he is doing, whether  he

can  afford the purchase price, whether he can afford the

downpayment,  whether he can afford  the  repayment,  the

instalment  payment, and so on.  So I do not  expect  the

Government to stand guarantor to every person who buys  a

flat using bank loans and say that if you default, if you

cannot  afford to pay your instalments, do not worry,  we

will  give  you  a  rental flat.   There  is  no  blanket

guarantee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, as in all cases which come to HDB, when

MPs  put up appeals on behalf of their constituents, when

there  is  a genuine case of hardship, if the family  has

really  fallen on hard times, and we look at it, we  find

that  there is a case for special consideration, we  will

provide special

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1398</b></font><br><br>

consideration.  And that is the rule of  thumb.   But  to

expect  HDB  to  have a blanket ruling  and  say,  "Don't

worry, we are going to provide you with a rental flat  if

you  default on your loan", I do not think that is a wise

thing to do.  And it creates a moral hazard.  That is not

something that we would like to see.  What we want to  do

is  to  explain to our people, when you make a commitment

like  this  for  public housing, or for private  housing,

when  you  go to a bank for a loan, please make sure  you

know what you are doing and do your sums.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, the Minister

says the number of eviction of lessees due to default  of

payments  is very small.  Can he please tell us how  many

of  such evictions were there in 2001 and up to the  10th

month of this year?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I do not have the exact

numbers  with me.  But I can recall that there were  less

than 10.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. I

understand one of the reasons why there was not  much  of

default is because there were some Government schemes  in

place,  like  deferred  loan,  etc.   Will  the  Minister

expect,  in the event of an economic downturn like  this,

the  banks  would,  like  the  Government,  provide  such

services  to help people who are unable to service  their

loans  to  tide  over  the period?  And  what  would  the

Government advise the banks?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, as I said in my Second Reading

speech,  when somebody goes to the bank for  a  loan,  he

would  have  to abide by the bank's rules of foreclosure,

he  would  have  to abide by the bank's rules  on  credit

assessment.   So,  the short answer to him  is  that  all

borrowers would have to abide by the rules that are  laid

down  by  the lender.  And it is no different  for  HDB's

case,  it  is no different for the bank's case.   In  the

case of HDB, when they come to HDB to borrow, HDB has  to

do a credit assessment.  If they do not comply with those

conditions,  and  they default on their  loans,  HDB  can

evict.  But, as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1399</b></font><br><br>

Mr  Low rightly pointed out, HDB is more forbearing, more

forgiving.   HDB  has various schemes in  place  to  help

borrowers, such as stretching of repayments, and  so  on.

We do not expect the banks to do so.  Neither should we.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they go to the bank for a loan, they have got

to  do  their  sums.   And when  they  go  to  the  banks

currently,  they may find that the banks may actually  be

more flexible than HDB.  They may find that the banks may

offer them a lower interest rate than HDB.  They may find

that  the banks are willing to give them a longer  period

of  loan.   I  understand that some banks will  allow  30

years  or  more.  HDB has a maximum, which is  less  than

that.  All this will have to be factored by the borrower.

Do  you want to go to the bank to borrow or not?  Do  you

want  to buy that flat in the first place or not?   These

are  decisions which individuals would have to make.   We

are  not talking about facilitating the purchase  of  the

first  flat.   This is what I explained  right  from  the

outset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first timers who want to purchase their first

flat  go  to HDB, and it will provide them the subsidised

loan,  provide them with a subsidised flat and they  will

have  their  first flat.  But, now, they are looking  for

the  second,  or  third flat, or they  are  PRs,  private

property owners, or high income earners.  These  are  the

people who need to get a market rate loan.  These are the

ones  who have to go to the bank.  Is Mr Low saying  that

these people would also need to have a guarantee that the

Government  will help them if they default on their  bank

loans?  Surely not.  So we are really talking about those

people  who do not need a concessionary loan, who already

are  required to get a market rate loan from HDB.   These

are  the  ones who will have to go to the bank to  get  a

loan.   And these are the people who should be in a  good

position to judge whether they would like to get  a  loan

at  that price or not.  In other words, you have to  make

your  decision based on your own situation.  You have  to

do your sums before you get the loan.  We are not talking

about those who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>

are  buying  HDB  flats for the first  time.   For  those

people, nothing has changed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe:</b> I just want to make a

clarification.  In fact, I am asking for consideration to

be  given  to people who have bought subsidised flats  to

rent out the whole flat, and I am really referring to the

hardship  cases.   They have bought the subsidised  flats

and  they  have stayed there for many years.   Sometimes,

they  want to sell it, but the market conditions  do  not

allow  them to sell.  So why do you not consider allowing

them  to monetise the flat by renting it out for a  while

and  get an income?  In the meantime, they can stay  with

their children, or downgrade and rent a smaller flat.  So

I  am  just asking that the Minister consider the appeals

on a case-by-case basis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are already

certain  schemes in place for the cases  that  Mr  Othman

mentioned earlier.  In other words, if you are staying in

a subsidised flat and you have financial difficulties, we

already  have  various  schemes in  place,  ranging  from

deferment  of your instalment payments, reduced repayment

schemes,  and so on and so forth.  Quite a few  of  those

who  are  in financial difficulties and come to  HDB  for

financial assistance have been put on these schemes.   So

far,  I believe these have been well received.  So, I  do

not  think  there is a need for us to expand this  scheme

for subletting.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Minister clarify and explain how

the  individual  third-time  flat  buyer  can  factor  in

factors like economic recession, retrenchments and sudden

job loss in the planning process?  In his negotiations to

buy  a  property and take a loan from the bank, he cannot

factor  in  all  these factors of retrenchments  and  job

loss.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought this is

what  happens all the time.  This is what we all do.   We

make  our decisions based on what we believe is the right

thing to do.  Surely, the hon. Member does not expect the

Government to tell

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>

him  what he should do, whether he should buy a  flat  or

not,  what is going to happen to the economy.  All of  us

have   to   make  up  our  own  minds.   This   is   what

responsibility is all about, surely.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I wish to clarify. I am

talking  about  people who need to downgrade  because  of

financial problems, not talking about people with private

properties.   The  other question  is:  is  the  Minister

advising Singaporeans that they should not buy more  than

one  flat,  because they would have to take a bank  loan,

they  may  be  in trouble?  Is that what  he  is  talking

about?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I do not think I said anything of

that  sort.  Basically, what I am saying is that  if  you

buy  your second or third HDB flat, and you cannot get  a

market rate loan from HDB, you go to the bank.  And  when

you  go to the bank, the bank will ask you questions, you

will  have to answer those questions.  Then you  have  to

decide whether you should proceed or not.  Can you afford

it  or not?  And if the answer is yes, you can afford it,

go  ahead.  If the answer is no, you do not think you can

afford  it,  you  are worried about the future,  you  are

worried  about your job, you are not sure, just  keep  in

view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a bit strange, because here we are talking in

this House, and Members have said so, that we should give

Singaporeans  more responsibility, we  should  not  be  a

nanny  state, we should allow them to make up  their  own

minds.  A simple thing like this where you have to decide

whether  you  should buy a flat and how much  you  should

pay,  these  are  things which every  responsible  person

should  be  able  to  decide and make  up  his  mind  for

himself.   Do  you expect the Government  to  decide  for

them?

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. Does the

Minister  agree  that, in fact, by imposing  a  different

risk  between  HDB and bank loans at market  rates,  when

going to the bank, the person is likely to lose the whole

flat  as  well,  that  there  is  a  risk  factor?    The

Government  is  actually helping Singaporeans  to  decide

that they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>

better not buy a second or a third flat by taking a  loan

from the bank.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> The hon. Member talks about risks.

I  thought we were saying that we should let people  take

some  risks.  Allow them to take some risks but give them

the responsibility.  However, at the same time, give them

some  more  flexibility,  some  more  freedom.   This  is

exactly what we are doing.  Of course, there is risk.  In

every  decision,  there  is a  risk  involved.   In  this

particular case, there is a risk too.  But if you do  not

want to take the risk, then what happens?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam (Nominated Member)</b> rose.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Do you have a different line of

questioning?

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> No, it is clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Sir, for a third-time

applicant,  in terms of joint applications where  couples

are  concerned - a different type of risk - the  marriage

goes  bust, will there be any kind of consideration here,

please?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> I did not realise that marriage is

a risk!  But I am not an expert on that, so I better keep

quiet.  What was your question?

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> When a marriage dissolves

and, instead of a joint application, they now become  two

single  applicants, and they could have upgraded,  so  it

becomes  a  third-time application, but it  is  a  single

parent.  Could there be any concessions, please, or  does

it go back to the same premise of the bank loan?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Generally, as a rule, the answer is

that they would be considered as third-timers.  But,  the

HDB has so many rules and regulations, you always tend to

have  somebody who runs afoul of those rules in some  way

or other.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>

We  always  consider all cases very  carefully.   And  if

there is a good case made out, then special consideration

can be given, but not as a general rule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to make amendments to the Smoking

(Control  of  Advertisements and  Sale  of  Tobacco)  Act

(Chapter 309 of the 1994 Revised Edition).

<br><br><i>Background</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fact that smoking is addictive and that it

causes  lung  cancer,  heart  disease  and  other   fatal

diseases  in  smokers is not disputed, not  even  by  the

cigarette  manufacturers.  It is estimated  that  50%  of

long-term  smokers will die prematurely in  their  middle

age  without reaching the life expectancy of 76 years,  a

loss  of  about  22  years of life.   Yet,  new  smokers,

especially  the  youth, are attracted to  the  habit  and

become  addicted.   The World Health  Organisation  (WHO)

estimates  that  about half of those who experiment  with

smoking  during  their adolescence, will  become  regular

smokers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Mrs Lim Hwee Hua) in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.10 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Youth Tobacco Survey in 2000 showed

that in Singapore, 11% of the respondents aged 13-17  had

smoked on at least one day in the preceding month,  while

4%  of  these  youths  smoked at least  20  days  in  the

preceding month.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking rates in Singapore had dropped to a low of

14%  in  2001, from 18% in 1992, putting Singapore  among

the countries with the lowest smoking rates in the world.

Nonetheless,  the  National  Smoking  Control   Programme

continues to actively work towards a smoke-free lifestyle

among all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic tenet of the National Smoking Control

Programme is a multi-pronged approach to control smoking.

This  includes  public education, community  involvement,

legislation,  enforcement,  fiscal  measures,   and   the

provision  of smoking cessation services.   In  order  to

support  this  approach, the legislation  on  smoking  is

reviewed  and  updated regularly so as to  keep  up  with

changes  in  social trends as well as to adopt  the  best

practices from other countries.  The Smoking (Control  of

Advertisements  and  Sale  of Tobacco)  (Amendment)  Bill

therefore  comprises a total of seven amendments  to  the

Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me now highlight the major new

provisions that are being introduced in this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first change is to prohibit the sale of

cigarette  packs  containing  fewer  than  20  sticks  of

cigarettes.   The rationale for prohibiting the  sale  of

cigarette  packs  containing  fewer  than  20  sticks  of

cigarettes  is to discourage the youths from starting  to

smoke.   Studies  have  shown  that  most  smokers  start

smoking  during adolescence.  Many start by experimenting

with  one or a few sticks of cigarettes before they start

smoking regularly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cigarette packs containing less than 20 cigarettes

are more affordable to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>

young  smokers  as  they cost less.   For  instance,  the

average  cost of a pack of 10 cigarettes is $3.50,  about

half  the  price of a pack of 20 cigarettes, which  costs

about  $6.50.   The smaller packs can also  be  concealed

more easily from teachers and parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a WHO publication, cigarette packs

containing less than 20 sticks are, in fact, a  marketing

strategy  by the tobacco industry to specifically  target

young smokers, who are experimenting with cigarettes  and

have  less purchasing power.  Australia, Canada,  certain

states in the United States of America and Thailand  have

also  banned the sale of small packs with fewer  than  20

cigarettes to discourage experimentation by young people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second change is to increase the fine quantum of

underaged  smoking offences from $50  and  $100  for  the

first and subsequent offences, to a flat $300 ceiling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of the ongoing national smoking control

efforts, the trend of smoking among youths aged 18  years

and  below,  is  still  a  cause  for  concern.   From  a

legislative perspective, the current system of  penalties

for   underaged  smokers  does  not  pose  a   sufficient

deterrent effect and is also administratively cumbersome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 11(1) of the Act, an underaged youth

caught smoking, chewing, buying or possessing any tobacco

product  is liable on conviction to a fine not  exceeding

$50,   and   in  the  case  of  a  second  or  subsequent

conviction,  to a fine not exceeding $100.  The  existing

amount  of fines is not sufficient to deter the  majority

of  youth offenders who can generally afford the  amounts

imposed.   The revision of the current penalty towards  a

flat  $300 quantum would thus have a sufficient deterrent

effect on the underaged youth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third change is to include an enabling clause to

provide for the imposition of conditions when compounding

offences.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, underaged youths caught smoking are not

required to fulfill any conditions other than to  face  a

fine  of  $50  or  $100 upon conviction.   This  enabling

clause   will   allow  conditions  to  be  imposed   when

compounding   offences  under  the  Act.   For   example,

underaged   smoking  offenders  and  their   parents   or

guardians  could  be  conditionally  required  to  attend

smoking  cessation  counselling in order  to  have  their

offences  compounded.  Recognising that peer pressure  is

the  main  reason why many youths pick up  smoking,  this

measure  provides an excellent opportunity to communicate

to both the youths and their parents not only the dangers

of smoking, but also equip the youths with life skills to

enable them to quit and stay smoke-free.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our survey shows that almost half of our young

smokers  have either one or both parents who smoke.   The

compulsory  participation of parents in  the  counselling

process  will  also  enable the counsellors  to  motivate

these parents to quit smoking and serve as positive  role

models for their children.  This example illustrates  how

the enabling clause allows both enforcement and education

to  work hand in hand towards combating smoking among the

young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth change is to include the listing of other

constituents   in  addition  to  tar  and  nicotine,   in

cigarettes  imported or sold in Singapore.   The  current

Act  prescribes the maximum allowable limits for tar  and

nicotine   contained  in  the  emissions  of   cigarettes

imported and sold in Singapore.  However, in addition  to

tar  and  nicotine, cigarettes contain many other harmful

and  cancer-causing constituents.  One  such  example  is

carbon monoxide, normally found in car exhaust fumes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, Canada's legislation requires cigarette

packs  to  list  the  amount  of  tar,  nicotine,  carbon

monoxide,  benzene,  hydrogen  cyanide  and  formaldehyde

found in cigarette emissions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Act will be amended to require the listing and

its allowable limits of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>

constituents  other than tar and nicotine.  This  measure

serves to inform consumers about the poisonous and  toxic

substances that are found in tobacco products and  serves

as a deterrent to some people to smoke.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth change is to extend the current licensing

of   tobacco   retailers   to   include   importers   and

distributors  of  tobacco  products.   At  present,   the

licensing  of  tobacco  retailers provides  a  system  of

monitoring  and  regulation  of  the  sales  of   tobacco

products  at  the  retail  end.   However,  there  remain

certain  aspects of product compliance that  may  not  be

within the direct influence of the retailer.  Examples of

such  product  compliance include the  tar  and  nicotine

limits   of  cigarettes  and  mandatory  health   warning

labelling requirements of tobacco products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, greater accountability for ensuring such

compliance  with  the licensing authority's  requirements

should  be placed on the industry source rather than  the

small retail shops.  This would ensure, for example, that

the  Health  Warning Labelling regulations  are  properly

implemented at the distribution stage before the products

are  supplied to retailers.  In addition, this will  also

help  to tighten the distribution of tobacco products  to

only licensed retailers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be consistent with the approach that

regulation of tobacco should begin at the source  of  the

tobacco  supply chain, the current licensing  of  tobacco

retailers  will  be  extended to  include  importers  and

distributors  of tobacco products.  In this  manner,  the

source  of the tobacco trade can be better monitored  and

regulated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth change is to allow the serving of notice

to  attend Court, to be done by other means.  The current

Act  does not have specific provisions on the serving  of

summonses   and   notices.   In  the  absence   of   such

provisions, the Health Sciences Authority has to rely  on

Chapter  V of the Criminal Procedure Code on the  serving

of such notices.  This provision requires that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>

such  notices  be  delivered in person by  an  authorised

officer, a time consuming and resource intensive  method.

In  comparison, the Housing and Development Board has the

option  to issue notices via registered post, as provided

for in the Housing and Development Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar provision will be incorporated into the

Act  in order to allow the serving of notices to be  made

by  other  more  efficient means such as  the  method  of

registered post.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final change is to refine the powers of

investigation for authorised officers under the Act.   In

the  course of investigating offences under the Act,  the

investigating  officer authorised by the Health  Sciences

Authority  may  be  required to  obtain  statements  from

persons  involved in the investigation.  Similar  to  the

option available to the National Environment Agency, such

powers   of  investigation  are  provided  for   in   the

Environmental Public Health Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A similar provision will be made in the Act to

facilitate the investigations of offences under  the  Act

by the Health Sciences Authority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, the Ministry of Health believes

that a multi-pronged approach is needed to encourage non-smokers  to  stay smoke-free and smokers to give  up  the

smoking habit.  The amendments to the Act will complement

the  existing strategies, to ensure that the  legislative

measures remain relevant to the social climate and on par

with the best practices from other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I

speak   in   support   of   the   Smoking   (Control   of

Advertisements and Sale of Tobacco) (Amendment) Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the World Health Organisation, smoking

kills  three  and  a half million people worldwide  every

year and this works out to be about 10,000 deaths

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>

each  day.   Smoking can cause cancer, heart disease  and

stroke.   Seven Singaporeans die every day from  smoking-related  diseases  and about 15% of the population  still

smoke daily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cigarette smoking has been identified as the single

most  avoidable  cause of death.  It is common  knowledge

that  smoking  kills, but yet, the size of  the  hole  it

burns  in  the  pockets of smokers and non-smokers  alike

remains  huge.  In 1999, $871 million went  up  in  smoke

with  3.23 billion cigarettes consumed.  A smoker with  a

daily habit of 20 sticks will end up paying $68,000  over

30  years,  and  this  is not considering  the  potential

medical   costs   needed   for  smoking-induced   related

diseases.   In light of this, measures to further  reduce

the smoking habit are therefore most timely and welcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-smokers, children in particular, also suffer the

ill effects from cigarette smoke.  Therefore, smoking  in

public  areas that affects non-smokers should be  further

expanded to protect the non-smokers.  Madam, I would like

to  support  the  call to ban smoking  at  bus-stops,  as

commuters  have  no choice but to wait around  for  their

buses to arrive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many Western countries with Anti-smoking

Activists Groups; the one in America is especially active

in  their  fight of tobacco use especially amongst  their

youth  and  in  lobbying  tobacco  companies  to  support

community  and sports programmes for their youth.   There

is  no such Anti-smoking Activists Group now in Singapore

and  the  initiation of such a group should be encouraged

by  the  Ministry  of Health.  It is likely  that  larger

business  corporations, especially the tobacco companies,

do  not  contribute as much to our community  and  sports

programmes  because we do not have such  an  Anti-smoking

Activists  Group.  Madam, I believe that these  companies

should   be   the  biggest  donors  to  sports  promotion

programmes in aid of our youth and anti-cancer movements.

This  is  especially so when the young people  are  their

biggest and growing customer base and when cancer is  the

leading cause of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>

death  and the third leading cause of hospitalisation  in

Singapore.  An Anti-smoking Activists Group can  champion

this  and  ameliorate the rising incidence of  cancers  - lung cancer especially.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment to clause 11 of this Bill aims to ban the

sale of smaller packs containing fewer than 20 sticks  of

cigarettes to make the habit more expensive to pick up or

sustain.  This is targetting especially the young  people

who  presumably have less money to spend.   If  they  see

people  around them smoking and if cigarettes  are  cheap

and  readily  available to them, the  tendency  to  smoke

would  be higher.  A recent study in the British  Medical

Journal found that even one puff for those aged 12 to  13

could  turn  them into addicts because their  brains  are

still  at  the  developmental stage and the younger  they

start, the more likely the habits are going to stay  with

them.    However,   the   argument  against   bigger-pack

cigarettes  is  that the young smokers may encourage  and

persuade  others  to share and split  the  cost,  thereby

expanding  the number of smokers.  Bigger packs  also  do

not  help  those  who are trying to  quit  or  to  reduce

smoking in terms of cost and in terms of temptation  with

a pack of 20 compared to a pack of 10.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legislation must result in the desired outcomes and

getting  the  public better informed on  regulations  and

stricter  enforcement  of the rules  would  be  necessary

here.  Shopkeepers selling individual cigarettes claiming

ignorance and selling cigarettes to those below  18  must

be firmly penalised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to support the call for new measures to

scare  young  smokers off the habit with  gory  pictures.

Section   16   of   the  present  Smoking   (Control   of

Advertisements and Sale of Tobacco) Act provides for  the

implementation of labelling.  Will the Ministry of Health

draw  up  an  amendment  to the Labelling  Regulation  to

impose  requirement  on  the printing  of  gory  pictures

portraying health hazard?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>

Gory  pictures may work at first but it is likely, Madam,

that  people  become  immune to the same  pictures  after

sometime.  Hence,  to  be  more  effective,  these   gory

pictures should be changed regularly.  It will be good if

the  pictures  depict the different  diseases  caused  by

smoking:   consider, for example, pictures  of  blackened

lungs,  cancerous  lung growths, bloodied  brains,  brain

tumours, fat-choked arteries, dead heart muscles, rotting

teeth  and mouth diseases.  This way, not only do we  get

the  scaring effect, we also create more public awareness

on the side effects of smoking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 11% of teenagers from Secondary 1 through to

Secondary 4 light up at least once a month, according  to

a  survey done a couple of years ago.  It seems that peer

pressure is an important influencing factor. The Ministry

of  Health, in partnership with the schools, should  take

increased  measures  to address this.   The  anti-smoking

message  should  be innovative and interesting  lest  the

students  take  them for granted.  The  Health  Promotion

Board  can  step up efforts to empower our  young  people

with  life  skills to make sensible health and  lifestyle

choices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, many people do not fathom the dangers of

smoking  and,  therefore, there  should  be  more  public

education  on  the  various diseases caused  by  smoking.

Some  schools,  supported by the Health Promotion  Board,

have  started anti-smoking clinics.  I would like to  see

all  secondary schools having such clinics where students

train  to spread the smoke-free message through a special

peer-leader  training programme,  to  take  lead  in  the

school's   anti-smoking  efforts  and   to   offer   peer

counselling.   On  the  fact  that  female  smokers  have

increased  two  percentage points to eight  percent,  the

recent report by Canadian scientists that women who start

smoking  when they are teenagers are 70% more  likely  to

develop   breast  cancer  than  non-smokers   should   be

publicised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prevalence and increasing incidence of smoking

in teenagers is most

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>

disturbing.  Mdm Deputy Speaker, we must do more to  help

this  group.  Many people smoke because their environment

influences them.  They are much more likely to  smoke  if

there are smokers surrounding them, or if their favourite

film  stars smoke.  Most teen smokers think smoking makes

them  look  cool.   Therefore, steps  must  be  taken  to

project  a  "smoke-free" lifestyle as cool  and  socially

desirable.  Teenage idols and celebrities should be roped

in more to promote this message.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, may I ask the Ministry of Health to consider

subsidising nicotine-free pills like the new drug  called

Zyban,  nicotine patches and a variety of  other  devices

that  help smokers quit the smoking habit?  Such products

should be given free to school children to help them quit

smoking.   Britain  and some European countries  supplied

the  new  drug,  Zyban, since the  year  2000  and  their

Departments of Health said that the money was  well-spent

because the drug was particularly effective.  May I  urge

the Ministry of Health to study their experience promptly

in order to do likewise in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I rise

to  speak  both as a Member of Parliament and a concerned

mother  of  young  children  in  view  of  the  troubling

statistics among the youths on smoking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is commendable that Singapore has one of

the  lowest smoking rates in the world, with the national

smoking  rate dropping from 15% in 1998 to 14%  in  2001,

smoking among the young between the age groups of 18  and

24  years  has held steady at 16% between 1998 and  2001,

despite an aggressive campaign against smoking.  This  is

in  contrast  to  the declines in rates  for  those  aged

between 25 and 44 years (from 15% to 14%) and those  aged

between 45 and 64 years (from 15% to 12%).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results of a school-based youth tobacco survey

carried out in 2000 are even more disturbing.  The survey

found

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>

that  one in four students had tried smoking before,  and

one  in 10 had smoked at least one day in the past month,

even  though  they are prohibited by law from  buying  as

well  as  smoking cigarettes as they are under  18  years

old.   Although many of the 26% respondents who had tried

smoking may have done so out of curiosity, seasoned anti-smoking campaigners will confirm that, in many instances,

this is how the habit is initiated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, the then Minister for Health, Mr Yeo Cheow

Tong,  had noted that about half of the smokers had taken

up the habit before the age of 18 years old.  In fact,  a

grassroots volunteer of my constituency, who is a smoker,

told  me  that most of his smoking friends had picked  up

the habit when they were young.  He himself had picked up

the  habit when he was still in school.  He further noted

that  he had observed an increase in the number of  young

smokers  and  he himself was worried for  his  two  young

sons.   It is worthwhile to note that even he, who  is  a

smoker,  is now worried for his young sons whom he  fears

will take up the habit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2002, in response to a question posed by my

fellow  Parliamentarian, Mdm Halimah Yacob, the  Minister

of  State  for Health, Dr Balaji Sadasivan, had  reported

that a total of 131 retailers had been caught selling  or

providing  tobacco products to those  aged  18  years  or

under  since 1993.  This works out to an average of  some

14-15  cases per year over a nine-year period, which,  as

Mdm Halimah had noted, and I concur, is very small.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I would like to ask the Minister how

many  youths  aged below 18 years have  been  caught  for

smoking,  buying and/or possessing cigarettes  since  the

Smoking  (Control of Advertisements and Sale of  Tobacco)

Act  came  into force in 1993.  If the numbers have  been

increasing  over the years, what punishments  were  meted

out  to the offenders?  Additionally, what proportion  of

these offenders are repeat offenders?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I would further like to ask the Minister what

mechanisms have been put

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>

in place to allow for effective enforcement of the law to

prevent  the  sale of cigarettes to those aged  below  18

years  as well as the purchase, possession and/or use  of

cigarettes  by  this group.  I would  like  to  urge  for

greater vigilance in the enforcement of the law, as  this

would   surely  serve  as  one  of  the  more   effective

deterrents to our young against lighting up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neighbourhood police could work with the RCs and

the  schools  in order to be more effective  in  locating

retailers  who contravene the Act as well as in  flushing

out  underaged  smokers.  In some  of  my  block  visits,

residents  have informed me that they have seen  students

in  school  uniform  smoking  at  staircases  and  common

corridors on the top floors of  HDB blocks where there is

very little pedestrian traffic.  We have, of course,  fed

this  back  to  the  police and  the  schools  concerned.

Regular policing of such areas as well as stalls that may

be  selling  cigarettes to underaged smokers  would  help

alleviate the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I note that the Bill seeks to further hinder

the  young  from smoking by banning the sale of cigarette

packs  with  less  than  20 cigarettes,  as  well  as  by

increasing the fine payable by those aged below 18  years

who   are   caught  buying,  possessing  and/or   smoking

cigarettes  to  $300 for any offence, up from  $50  to  a

maximum of $100 in the existing Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback from some members of the public regarding

the  sale  of larger packs to make smoking more expensive

to  pick up and sustain, particularly amongst the  young,

is  that  this may not be effective, as the  young  could

simply share it with their friends or be enticed to smoke

even more, whilst others may simply be indifferent to the

higher price of a larger pack.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, the Health Promotion Board had noted

that   New  Zealand  had  experienced  some  success   in

deterring  young  smokers  when  it  adopted  a   similar

measure.  It is further noted that according

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>

to   a   World  Health  Organisation  study  on   smoking

behaviour,  first-time buyers usually try  smaller  packs

initially.  Although the effectiveness of this measure to

thwart  the  young from smoking may be minimal,  I  would

still  support  this move.  This is because  any  measure

that can further discourage the young from lighting up is

clearly  worth a try and would add weight to the host  of

measures   that  have  been  instituted,   including   an

aggressive anti-smoking education campaign.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also pleased to note that clause 8 of the Bill

provides  that  underaged  offenders  as  well  as  their

parents  or  guardians can be asked to attend counselling

sessions.  I feel that this, in combination with a higher

fine  which is now proposed, is more meaningful than just

a  fine.  This is because, since most youths are  not  in

the labour force, the fines would either be picked up  by

their  parents or they may be indifferent  if  they  come

from  wealthy  families  and  have  been  given  generous

allowance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to ask the Minister what

format  such counselling sessions would take and for  how

long  the sessions would be, as one would suspect that  a

one-off  counselling session of a few hours  may  not  be

effective  for  reformative  purposes.   Additionally,  I

would  like to suggest that some form of community  order

be instituted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young offender could be required to attend a

number  of  sessions after school, say,  on  a  Saturday,

where  he  could be counselled and taught the hazards  of

smoking,   constructive  use  of  leisure  time,   health

alternatives to de-stress and so on.  Such sessions could

help  to reform the offenders and, at the same time,  act

as  a  deterrent, since it would deprive them of some  of

their leisure time outside of school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, it has been reported that the strategy for

increasing  tobacco taxes has failed for the  first  time

this  year,  as a turf war between tobacco companies  had

brought prices down.  As affordability is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>

reported to be a major deterrent to smoking, I would like

to propose that tobacco taxes be further raised, so as to

negate the impact of any price cuts by tobacco companies.

Any  additional revenue generated from a further increase

in tobacco tax could be channelled  to cancer research or

any other programme related to the fight against smoking.

This  would  then  clearly dispel  any  notion  that  the

Government  is increasing taxes on tobacco  for  revenue.

In  fact,  I  would  like to mention that  my  grassroots

volunteer  who is a smoker said that having higher  taxes

and  hitting him harder in the pocket could spur  him  to

try harder to stop smoking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, whilst the national smoking rate has declined

since  the  Act was implemented in 1993, smoking  amongst

the  young remains a major concern.  Hence, we  must  not

spare  any  effort in the fight to deter the  young  from

taking  up  this habit  -  from making it less affordable

and less convenient to smoke, to persistent education and

vigilant enforcement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, with this, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Madam, like others in this

House, I am concerned that the percentage of smokers aged

between 18 and 24 has remained unchanged since 1998.   It

now   stands   at  16%  of  the  age  group   and,   more

disturbingly, the female smokers among them has increased

2  percentage points to 8%.  It is critical to discourage

the youngsters from smoking.  And, as the Minister noted,

studies  have  shown  that  someone  who  starts  smoking

earlier  and younger finds it harder to quit  later.   It

also  increases their risk of getting diseases like  lung

cancer earlier.  And for the women smokers, it would also

affect the health of their babies as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government hopes to discourage smoking among the

young by removing the smaller packets of cigarettes  from

the  market.   Only  20-stick packs  or  larger  will  be

available and these are more expensive.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise two points. First, many young

Singaporeans now get generous pocket money from  parents.

A  few  extra dollars will not make much of a difference,

unlike those in other countries where a study cited shows

that  it  worked in New Zealand.  An average pack  of  20

sticks  now sells for $6.50.  This is akin to  a  cup  of

Starbucks  coffee  and a slice of  cake.   It  is  easily

affordable  to most yuppy kids in Singapore.   I  suggest

that if the Government is serious about discouraging them

to  smoke by using this method, it should raise the price

of  cigarettes  even more.  It can do this by  increasing

the cigarette excise duties and increasing the number  of

smoking cessation programmes at the same time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it is widely recognised that peer pressure

is one reason why youngsters smoke.  In my view, much has

to  do  also with where they tend to hang out with  their

peers  these  days, to look cool and to look fashionable.

If  you walk into some of our pubs and clubs, chances are

that  they  are  smoke-filled and through the  haze,  you

would see young women dangling cigarettes in their hands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies in other countries have shown that girls

apparently  smoke  in order to attract  men,  while  boys

smoke  to appear mature.  The club scene in Singapore,  I

am told, is quite colourful and exciting.  And many clubs

and  pubs  are  trying to reel in the  young  girls  with

Ladies'   Nights,  and  by  having  a  lower  age   entry

requirement for women than for men.  The strategy is that

if  you get in the young girls, the men will follow.  But

these   are   environments  which  make  smoking   appear

fashionable and cool.  Clubs  have a peer pressure effect

on  impressionable girls to smoke in order to  belong  to

the  in-crowd  and to appear more attractive.   A  random

survey  of  adult pubs and clubs in Singapore shows  that

many allow women as young as 18-20 in, but often impose a

higher  age requirement for men, usually above  23.   For

instance, at Madam Wong's, you need to be only 20 if  you

are  a woman to get into the club, but you have to be  23

if   you  are  a  man.   At  Club  Eden,  the  entry  age

requirement for women is 21; for men,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>

it  is  24.   At Double O, the entry age requirement  for

women is 22; for men, it is 25.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned about this because these 20 to 21-year-old women are more impressionable, more susceptible

to  peer pressure and are less mature than the older  men

in  these  clubs.  Indeed, I hear that it is not uncommon

to  see  older  men lighting up the cigarettes  of  young

girls  in some clubs.  So I do not think bigger packs  of

cigarettes  will work.  As I see it, we  can  either  bar

these  girls  from environments which encourage  smoking,

such   as  these  pubs  or  clubs,  or  clean  up   these

environments that presently promote the image that it  is

cool to smoke.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not go so far as to call for a ban on smoking

in  bars, pubs and discos, at least not for now.   But  I

would  call  for a higher age entry requirement  for  the

women, to be at least on par with the present requirement

for  the men.  However, this is left pretty much  to  the

discretion  of  the clubs and pubs right  now.   Can  the

Government  do  something  about  this?   The  Government

should also, at the same time, rope in the pubs and clubs

in its No Smoking Campaign.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I understand that the Government is taking

a  multi-pronged  approach to discourage youngsters  from

smoking   -   from  legislation to public  education  and

applying peer pressure to emphasising that staying smoke-free  is  cool, using stars as models.  While  I  support

this,  I  would  like to caution against  a  heavy-handed

approach, as it would probably backfire.  Many youngsters

smoke  because of peer group pressure or to cock a  snook

at  authority.  They are biologically programmed to  take

risk.  The more the Government tells them not to smoke or

that  they  would  die earlier if they do  and  die  from

horrible  diseases,  the more they find  it  exciting  to

smoke.   The danger with a heavy-handed approach is  that

smoking  will  become  a  symbol of  youthful  rebellion.

Hence, I would argue that if it is an uphill task getting

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1420</b></font><br><br>

message  across to the young, then let us put more  focus

about  tackling the environments which influence them  to

smoke.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan:</b> Madam, thank you for allowing me

to join in the debate.  I rise to support this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking is an expensive and harmful habit. Like the

rest of the speakers, I am particularly perturbed to  see

young  people taking on this habit.  So I think it  is  a

good idea to sell cigarettes in packets of 20, instead of

the  present  small  packets of  10  cigarettes.   I  now

realise that you can buy drinks in Starbucks with a piece

of  cake  for that amount.  So, it is not too  difficult,

but  if  by this move we make it more difficult for  even

some of our young to smoke, then it would have served its

purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also glad to see that the Bill has closed the

loopholes  of retailers breaking up packets  and  selling

cigarettes  in  sticks.  The stiff  penalties  legislated

make  it  not worthwhile for retailers to do  so,  and  I

support the stiff penalties proposed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a friend who was a heavy smoker. When he was

asked  if  he knew that he was putting his life at  risk,

the  reply  was  that, statistically, his life  would  be

shortened  by  just  a few minutes,  and  what  was  that

compared to a lifespan of over, as the Minister said,  76

years.  If a person can will the last few minutes to  the

very  end of his life, then there is no problem.  To  cut

the  story  short, he contracted cancer in his early  40s

and  had one of his lungs removed.  He is now a wiser man

and  has stopped smoking.  But at what a price!  And even

at that, he is one of the luckier ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I strongly support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, first, I

would  like  to thank all four MPs who rose to  speak  in

support  of  the  Bill.  This is a rare occasion  for  me

where I am told I am not going far enough, and I need  to

be pushed forward.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1421</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said in my Second Reading speech, the anti-smoking programme is a multi-faceted programme. We must

pursue  different  strategies and from different  angles.

What  we  are  discussing today is really the legislative

changes  to  make it possible for us to keep the  smoking

rates   in  Singapore  under  control.   For  the   items

specifically  under  discussion today,  the  issue  about

smaller packs, I accept the different views.  Whether  it

is  effective or not, I think it is worth trying.  And  I

thank those who support it on that basis too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo suggested setting up an anti-smoking

activist group.  I think that is an excellent suggestion.

We will pass it on to HPB and to the Committee overseeing

this  and  see  how they can prompt or encourage  such  a

group to be set up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also need more enforcement, a point made by all

three  speakers.  We need greater vigilance,  enforcement

of  the rules, particularly against retailers who sell to

underaged  smokers, and also on the offenders themselves.

While in the Bill we have asked for increase in fines and

also  introduce  counselling, the  changes  will  not  be

effective  if  these are not enforced.  So I  assure  the

House  that with these additional powers and the existing

powers,  we  are  taking and intending to  take  stronger

enforcement of these rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the suggestion of labelling, whether to provide

more   graphic  or  pictorial  warnings,  this  is  under

consideration.   It  is proven to be quite  effective  in

other  countries.   We  intend to also  review  this  and

introduce this in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo also suggested that we subsidise

nicotine-free  pills  in our Smoking  Cessation  Clinics.

This  is something that I will refer to the Committee  to

look at.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Amy Khor and Ms Irene Ng both advocated very

strongly that the tobacco tax be further increased.   Let

me assure the House that it is the Government's policy to

continuously increase the tobacco tax to keep up at least

with the purchasing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>

power of Singaporeans.  But, as Dr Amy Khor has observed,

this  year,  while we raise the tobacco tax by  20%,  the

cigarette  manufacturers lowered  the  cigarette  prices,

thereby negating the impact of the tobacco tax.  But this

is  a  war  that we will continue to fight.   It  is  not

fought over one year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng raised several suggestions on how to

influence  the  environment  that  youths  patronise,  to

discourage   them  from  smoking.   I  was   particularly

intrigued  by  her  comment that  young  girls  smoke  to

attract  man, and boys smoke to look mature.  I remember,

some  years ago, watching an advertisement which shows  a

lady smoking and the caption saying: "Do you want to kiss

an  ashtray?"   So, I am not sure whether a lady  smoking

really attracts man.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I think we agree with all the speakers that

we  have a big battle ahead.  It may be cynical, but  the

cigarette  manufacturers  are  really  targeting  at  the

young.  They know that smoking is addictive and they know

that   the   strategy  is  to  get  people  hooked   onto

cigarettes.  I think this is a very cynical strategy but,

unfortunately, it is the truth, and we have to combat  it

at  every level.  As you can see from the amendments that

we  put  into  the  Bill, our effort is  really  strongly

targeted at the young people to try and persuade them not

to get started on the first puff.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank Members for their support and their many

suggestions.   We will take these up with  the  Committee

looking  into  this.   And I can assure  you  that  these

suggestions will be followed up.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, could the Minister

also  address my question on the ban of smoking  at  bus-stops?   Could  he also enlighten us on the  anti-smoking

efforts  in schools, whether more can be done,  and  what

else can be done?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> As part of our strategy, we have

taken  anti-smoking in schools quite seriously.  We  have

conducted talks.  We have brought role

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>

models,  people in the media, people in the entertainment

industry,  who  have agreed to help us in this  campaign.

So  they go to the schools and they serve as role models,

and they try to persuade young Singaporeans not to smoke.

So  that  is  part of the strategy.  We try to  strike  a

sensible balance, as Ms Irene Ng mentioned, when  dealing

with  the young.  I think you have seen our reply in  one

of  the  newspapers.  Dealing with the young, we  do  not

really  want to put them off.  So you have got to  strike

this  balance.  I believe the Committee looking into this

has attempted to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the various suggestions about banning additional

places,  this is something that we work closely with  the

Ministry  of  the Environment, whether it is  banning  of

smoking  in pubs or in other places, bus stops and  other

areas.   This is something that we continuously  take  up

with the Ministry of the Environment.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I

would  like  to follow up on the query on the counselling

sessions  mentioned  in  clause 8.   Could  the  Minister

kindly  elaborate  on  what would  be  involved  in  that

process?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I am afraid I do not have the

details.   It is also something that Dr Amy Khor  raised.

This is something that the HPB and the various committees

will do on their own.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> Just a quick follow-up. Is it possible that in the suggestions on

counselling,  in  order  for  it  not  to   be   counter-productive,  due consideration is taken into getting  the

underlying  causes for teenagers to be easily  influenced

by  peers  and to have some form of self-discipline  that

there   would  be  self-awareness,  sensitivity  training

provided for them to understand how to be assertive,  how

to resist peer temptation and also the kind of inner self-discipline?  Because it appears that parents will also be

involved.  Similarly on the problems with drug abuse,  if

we do not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>

tackle  those  underlying  causes,  then  some  of  these

measures  could  be  just symptomatic treatment  and  not

really  that  effective  and, in  fact,  become  counter-productive.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I thank the Member for his

advice.    We  will  definitely  have  properly   trained

counsellors  to do this, and I am sure they will  do  the

right thing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Lim Hng Kiang].

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>MEDIA DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>5.57 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim (Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mr David T. E. Lim):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, I

beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br><i>Introduction</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the debate on my Ministry's budget in May

this  year,  I  announced that MITA would  establish  the

Media  Development Authority of Singapore or MDA to  give

focus to the development of the media industry.  The  MDA

will  be  formed  by  merging the Singapore  Broadcasting

Authority  (SBA),  the Films and Publications  Department

(FPD)  and  the Singapore Film Commission  (SFC)  into  a

single statutory body.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MDA Bill provides the legislative framework for

the establishment of this new statutory board.  Before  I

go  into the Bill proper, let me first elaborate  on  the

rationale for forming the MDA.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Need to Form the MDA</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to form the MDA is driven largely by the

convergence  of different media, and the emergence  of  a

cluster  of  high  potential growth and high  value-added

activities in the media industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, technology has blurred the lines between

different  types of media.  Movies, for example,  can  be

watched at cinemas, on television, and over the Internet.

We   get   our  news  from  the  newspapers,  radio   and

television,  and  also over SMS, MMS  and  the  Internet.

More    changes    are   coming.    Wireless    broadband

technologies, for example, promise to bring about greater

convenience,  more  powerful communications  capabilities

and wider reach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of new media channels has also spurred

the development of new content.  Contents are now created

with not just one channel in mind, but with the intent of

being  used  and  shared across many different  channels.

Likewise,  industry support capabilities, like production

houses,  are  structured  to support  multiple  forms  of

media.   And  new content development capabilities,  like

the   use   of  animation  and  films,  are  also   being

established.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its report, the Economic Review Committee (ERC)

Sub-Committee  on Service Industries projected  that  the

creative  cluster, of which media is a significant  part,

could  contribute 6% to Singapore's GDP in 10  years,  up

from  between  2.8% and 3.2% in 2000.  Specifically,  the

media industry is targeted to double from 1.6% of GDP  to

3.5%  over the same period.  It is therefore an important

industry for Singapore, and one that has the potential to

create many good jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These developments have two main implications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, a single authority is needed to respond to

the  needs of the cluster of media industries.  A  single

authority would be able to develop strategies and  devise

schemes to facilitate the development

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>

of  new  innovative  contents across all  media,  and  to

respond  quickly to the rapidly changing  technology  and

business environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, a single authority will be in a better

position  to  develop  and  administer  a  practical  and

appropriate censorship regime that takes into account the

different  nature,  impact and  viewership  of  different

media.  It would be able to regulate media companies with

more  flexibility,  greater consistency  and  operational

effectiveness.

<br><br><i>Roles of the MDA</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MDA will therefore have two primary functions - as a content regulator, and to develop the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On content regulation, MITA's view is that media

continues  to play an important and significant  role  in

nation  building.  One of the MDA's key  objectives  will

therefore  be  to  protect Singapore's  core  values  and

safeguard the interest of consumers.  To do this, it will

take  over the licensing and regulatory functions of  SBA

and FPD, and administer the relevant Acts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On industry development, the MDA will play a number

of  roles.   Firstly, the MDA will promote the growth  of

the  media  industry, working closely with  the  Economic

Development  Board  (EDB) and other agencies  to  attract

investments  to  Singapore.   It  would  use  its  domain

knowledge  to work with the industry and other Government

agencies   to   build  up  the  creative  and   technical

capabilities we need.  It will drive the Media 21 vision,

which  aims  to  develop Singapore into a vibrant  global

media  city,  specialising in the creation,  development,

distribution and trading of media content and copyrights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the MDA will play an important role in

maintaining   fair  and  efficient  market  conduct   and

effective competition in the media industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Media competition was introduced in June 2000 to

give viewers and readers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>

more media choices and higher quality content.  This  has

resulted   in   innovative  offerings  from   the   media

companies.  However, given the relatively small  size  of

the Singapore market, competition is likely to be limited

to  just a few players.  Competition today is between two

leading  media companies, each dominant in  one  area  of

traditional media - television or newspapers.   There  is

therefore  a need to ensure that the competition  between

these  players  is  not dysfunctional,  and  that  public

interests and social goals are not compromised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MDA will therefore be empowered to implement a

competition  code for the media industry.   Such  a  code

would  lay  out the ground rules for fair market  conduct

within the sector, provide a more transparent competition

framework,  and  prevent the abuse of  market  powers  by

dominant  media  companies, to  ensure  that  quality  is

maintained.   Competition codes are already in  place  in

countries,  such  as  Britain and  Australia,  to  ensure

healthy competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBA circulated a draft media competition code to the

industry  in April this year.  The comments and  feedback

from  the industry are currently being reviewed, and  the

code  will  be released by the first half of  next  year,

after the MDA is formed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me move on to the MDA Bill.

<br><br><i>The MDA Bill</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MDA Bill provides for the establishment and

constitution of the new statutory board and outlines  its

main  functions,  duties and powers.   I  would  like  to

highlight some of the key aspects of this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 11 and 12 of Part III set out the functions,

duties and powers of the Authority.  The primary function

of  the  MDA  is  to  exercise licensing  and  regulatory

functions  in  respect  of media services  in  Singapore,

including the establishment of guidelines and standards

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>

for media content, and any equipment or facility used  to

provide  these  services.   In  addition,  the  MDA  will

encourage, promote and facilitate the development of  the

media industries in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of its functions, the MDA will also

administer the following media-related legislation:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The Newspaper and Printing Presses Act;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The Undesirable Publications Act;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) The Films Act;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) The Broadcasting Act, which is the renamed

Singapore Broadcasting Authority Act; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) The arts entertainment licensing aspect of the

Public Entertainments and Meetings Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislative approach taken is to not make any

substantive   changes  to  these  Acts  that   MDA   will

administer.  This is because the various Acts have served

our  national objectives well.  The focus of  this  Bill,

therefore, is the merger of the various units to form the

MDA.   After  the MDA is formed, MITA will  review  these

Acts, and propose further amendments as necessary to deal

with convergence and other issues that may arise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Part IV of the MDA Bill addresses an

immediate issue that needs to be dealt with, which is the

competition framework for the media industry.  Clauses 16

to  27  are provisions to allow the MDA to maintain  fair

and efficient market conduct and effective competition in

the  media  industry, and also to prevent the  misuse  of

monopoly or market power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions in the MDA Bill are essential to

provide  legislative powers for the  statutory  board  to

intervene   in  competition-related  matters,   and   are

necessary  to  safeguard against the potential  abuse  of

market powers by dominant media companies.  The MDA  will

be empowered to intervene in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>

competition-related matters that have an  impact  on  the

industry,  including  mergers  and  consolidations   that

involve   media   companies,   agreements   that    could

unreasonably  restrict competition  and  restrictions  on

access  to  essential  resources.   The  provisions  also

include  a  maximum financial penalty of  $1  million  to

deter  anti-competitive behaviour,  which  is  consistent

with that prescribed in the Telecommunications Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also includes provisions relating to staff,

financial  matters,  and transfer of assets,  liabilities

and  employees, which are similar to the  Acts  of  other

statutory boards.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mdm Deputy Speaker, the formation of

the  MDA  will benefit the industry and the public.   The

MDA will provide a focus for the development of our media

industry.   As  a single authority, it will  enhance  the

efficiency and effectiveness of our regulatory regimes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of the MDA is timely, as it would be

well positioned to respond to the recommendations of  the

Economic  Review  Committee as  well  as  the  Censorship

Review  Committee  on  matters pertaining  to  the  media

industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MITA is confident that the MDA, with its focus on

the  media  industry, will be instrumental in  developing

Singapore into a vibrant global media city and contribute

to the development of a creative economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker,

I rise in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me declare my interest. I am the Vice-Chairman of the NTUC Media Cooperative and Board Member

of  the  Infocomm Development Authority.  And as a result

of  my  21  years  as  a journalist, I  have  many  media

friends.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I have deep admiration for them who must meet

deadlines every day and, following the liberalisation  of

the  media since June 2000, every minute is deadline  for

many of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Media Development Authority of Singapore Bill

sets  out  the functions and powers of MDA.   While  MITA

foresees  that  the formation of the MDA will  contribute

positively  to Singapore's media sector and  benefit  the

public, I wish to highlight three concerns of its  impact

on the media scene.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, the first concern is on the standards of

performance  mentioned in clause  17  of  the  Bill.   My

questions are:  who sets the standards?  At which  level?

Are  they  the standards set by the media industry?   Are

they  the  standards set by MITA in the interest  of  the

readers  and viewers?  Will there be different  kinds  of

standards  for  different media?  And how widely  has  it

been consulted?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I ask this question because I have observed

our   media  scene  and  understand  the  aspiration  and

frustration, the satisfaction and disappointment  of  the

journalists, readers, listeners and viewers in  the  past

decades.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 70s and 80s, we were discussing and debating

what kind of media model was more suitable for Singapore.

We  talked about the American style of journalism, the UK

model  and  the Japanese model.  In the end, we developed

our  own  brand of journalism, the Singapore  Model.   In

short,  the media is part of the virtuous cycle  of  good

government  and good society.  That is the  role  PM  Goh

advocated  at the Straits Times' 150th Anniversary,  five

years  ago.  Yes, Straits Times is now 157 years old  and

Lianhe  Zaobao  will be celebrating its 80th  Anniversary

next  year.   The  media is part of the  virtuous  cycle.

They  have  their long histories, performance  standards,

values   and  cultures.   Thus,  the  kind  of  standards

mentioned  in  the Bill must bear in mind  the  unwritten

standards  set  in  these media organisations  which  are

already scrutinised by the readers and viewers every day,

every hour.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, my second concern is the code of practice

mentioned in the same clause.  The MDA Bill provides  for

the  Authority  to issue a Competition Code  to  regulate

competition  so  that  competition  continues   to   stay

relevant  and  constructive.   I  understand  that  MDA's

objective  is to maintain fair and effective competition,

as mentioned by the Acting Minister just now, and provide

for  safeguards against dominant media companies  abusing

their market powers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, our principal interest is to ensure that

competition  does  not lead to a decline  in  quality  or

depth.   With  competition, there  must  continue  to  be

public  service  and  a  value  system  that  serves  the

national interest and community.  Thus, I would urge  the

Minister to introduce a code that regulates with a  light

touch rather than enforce close policing in such a way as

to   end   up   stifling  competition,   creativity   and

innovation.  After all, the media here does not resort to

sensationalism,   or   untruths,   just    to    generate

circulation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, my third concern is the power of MDA. It is

so  powerful that it seems that it is more of a regulator

rather  than a champion and promoter of the industry,  as

the  word "development" in its name may imply.  MDA  will

oversee   the   licensing  and  content   management   of

broadcasts,  films, publications and arts  entertainment.

MDA  will  also be tasked to administer the  Broadcasting

Act,   the  Newspaper  and  Printing  Presses  Act,   the

Undesirable  Publications Act, the  Films  Act,  and  the

Public  Entertainments  and  Meetings  Act.   It  is   so

powerful that it is tantamount to be a mini-MITA.  I  can

foresee that the Chairman and board members will have  an

extremely challenging role in shaping the development  of

the  media scene in Singapore, especially in the  age  of

new economy and the convergence of media.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as Prime Minister Goh said at the Straits

Times' 150th Anniversary Celebrations:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can be proud because you have reported without

being corrupt, adversarial or sycophantic."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this remains the spirit of our media industry

with the birth of the MDA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, many people

in  the arts circle and the media industry hope that  the

Government would not maintain the very strict  stance  on

censorship and hope that the Government would  lean  more

towards a less strict regulatory model in relation to the

media  and the arts.  But it would appear from this  Bill

that it is not going to be so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typical of the authoritarian and paternalistic style

of the PAP, it wants to continue with a strict censorship

regime.  In these modern times, with the proliferation of

the  computer and fast widespread communication with  the

Internet,  I do not think that strict censorship  can  be

effective.   In  fact,  it is holding  Singapore  society

back.   Singapore  wants to be a modern,  urban  society.

The  Government wants to make it a Renaissance City.  The

Government  wants  the  city to be dynamic,  vibrant  and

creative.   But  while promoting these enlightened  aims,

the  Government  still wants to maintain the  nanny-state

status  of  Singapore.  How can the arts  and  the  media

progress, grow and compete with those of other countries,

if  the  Government continues to treat its citizens  like

children?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that while we all agree that pornography,

unhealthy  and  destructive  pronouncements  in  politics

touching on issues of race, language or religion have  to

be  curbed, and we also believe that our children have to

be protected from harmful smut and pornography, this does

not   mean   that  there  should  be  a  blanket   strict

censorship.  It is time the Government started to  review

its  policy of strict censorship.  The Government  should

consider,  in  the  alternative, a  model  of  regulatory

devices,  noting  the  conservative sensitive  nature  of

certain  groups  of our population.  For  an  enlightened

regulatory  model to be accepted by the majority  of  the

people, it is best that the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>

Government should not take into its own hands the duty of

drawing  up the regulations but, rather, get all sections

and representatives of various interest groups to draw up

the  regulations.  In this way, once the regulations  are

made  and enforced, it cannot be said that they were  the

sole work of the Government, but rather they are made  by

the  general  consensus of the people and shall  be  more

acceptable  by the public.  Whatever it is, I would  like

to  urge the Government to stop treating Singapore  as  a

nanny  state,  but  to  open  up  the  society  and  give

Singaporeans a chance to mature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should now like to comment on some of the

provisions  of the Bill.  I note that the enforcement  of

the  Public Entertainments and Meetings Act (PEMA), after

the  MDA  Bill  is passed, shall no longer be  under  the

purview  of  the Ministry of Home Affairs.  I  hope  that

MITA  shall be more flexible than the MHA in interpreting

the  provisions of the Public Entertainments and Meetings

Act,  and allow me, as an Opposition MP, to make speeches

at my Party dinners held in my own constituency.  Can the

Minister in charge of PEMA give me an assurance that,  as

an  Opposition  MP, I shall not be gagged in  future  but

shall  be allowed to make speeches at functions organised

by my Party in my constituency?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to refer to clause 5 concerning the

membership  of  the Authority.  Clause 5 cites  that  the

Authority  shall comprise "a Chairman and not  less  than

five  but  not more than 16 other members,  all  of  whom

shall be appointed by the Minister".  In other words, the

Minister  is  given  a  completely free  hand  to  choose

whoever he wants to be in the Authority.  I would imagine

that  it  would be more rational if the Bill specifically

states  that  the  Minister must choose  members  of  the

Authority from certain professions or occupations.   That

would  make  the Authority more representative  and  more

balanced.   I  think the Minister should include  in  the

membership  of  the  Authority representatives  from  the

local    arts   circles,   the   universities,   parents'

associations and the different groups.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the functions and duties of the Authority

mentioned  in  clause 11 of the Bill, I  would  urge  the

Government to use a light hand rather than a heavy  hand.

The Government should have, as its aim, to eventually  do

away   with  censorship  and  make  Singapore   a   truly

Renaissance City, when Singapore shall bloom  as  a  city

renowned for its art and culture.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mdm Deputy

Speaker,  thank you for allowing me to speak on  the  MDA

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I can fully appreciate the rationale of the

Media  Development  Authority  of  Singapore  Bill,   and

believe  that it is timely.  In this era of  mergers  and

acquisitions, the formation of MDA as a single  authority

to coordinate the regulation and development of the media

industry  across the different media platforms,  such  as

printing  media, cyberspace and the airwaves, is sensible

and logical.  I believe that the aim is to streamline the

roles  of  the  different  agencies  and  to  give   more

flexibility and greater consistency to the Authority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As explained by the Minister, the MDA will also be

taking over the roles of such organisations as the  Films

and  Publications Department, the Singapore  Broadcasting

Authority  and  the  Singapore Film Commission.   All  of

these  will  come  under  the  purview  of  MDA.   As  an

integrated statutory board, it will oversee the licensing

and  content management of broadcast, films, publications

and arts entertainment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be that as it may, Madam, it is noted that the Bill

has  not attempted to make any substantive changes to the

relevant  Acts which MDA is tasked to administer.   I  am

questioning the wisdom of this move.  The past  10  years

have seen the world changed drastically, due to the rapid

scientific     and    technological    advancement     in

communications   and   the  media   industry.    Internet

technology,  handphones, PDAs and other mobile  solutions

are  just some of the things that are now part and parcel

of   our  lives.   Moving  forward,  we  will  see   more

developments and breakthroughs in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>

communications  field  and,  as  we  speak,  Madam,  more

people,  even  those from the Third World countries,  are

starting to use or are considering the usage of satellite

communications and satellite television.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few months ago, I had the opportunity to be part

of  the team to welcome some parliamentarians from  Iran.

In  our discussions with them, they also highlighted  the

challenges that they are facing to balance their  efforts

to   embrace  new  technologies  like  the  Internet  and

satellite communications for all its benefits against the

risks of exposure to undesirable contents that they  want

to  protect their people from.  They had wanted  to  hear

from  us  and  hoped  to learn from our  experiences.   I

thought it was quite flattering that they even considered

us  as  a  country to learn from.  The point  that  I  am

highlighting is that even a country like Iran, which  has

a  reputation, rightly or wrongly, as being conservative,

is  also toying with the idea of satellite communications

and satellite television.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering, Madam, what is our present status

now.   Have  we made any progress in this area?   Are  we

preparing  ourselves  for  these  changes?   Is  the  new

Authority, MDA, equipped and ready to come out  with  new

initiatives and strategies?  I personally was  pleasantly

surprised  when Prime Minister Goh, in his  National  Day

Rally  speech,  mentioned about bar-top  dancing.   I  am

happy not because of the bar-top dancing but by the  fact

that the Prime Minister is aware of the situation on  the

ground  -  the  diverse views, the different  lifestyles,

requests and demands of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I believe we have arrived at the

juncture of our country's development and growth where we

are  expected to deliver something different.  Do  things

differently  and do not always stick to the  old  formula

that  has  served  us well.  Let us strive  to  make  our

people  more  resilient and strong.  I  believe  that  we

cannot afford to continuously shield

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>

and  protect them from undesirable contents.   Should  we

not  start  to let them learn to fend for themselves  and

learn    to    develop   life   skills    and    personal

responsibilities towards their families  and  themselves?

Similarly,  we  should  continue  to  emphasise  on   the

education  and soft aspects of our development that  will

make our society and country even stronger in the face of

more  daunting  challenges far more  difficult  than  the

undesirable contents that we are shielding them from.  To

top  it  all,  it is becoming more difficult  and  almost

impossible  to  effectively perform this protector  role,

due  to  rapid technological advancements as well as  the

fact that Singaporeans travel extensively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I am glad that MITA sees the formation of MDA

as  a  body that will contribute positively to the  local

media industry.  The area that I hope that would be given

some attention and assistance would be the film industry.

Back  in  the 1950s and 1960s, the local film  and  movie

industry  was  thriving,  and we  produced  many  classic

movies  and we were considered as one of the main sources

of  quality  productions.  But, now, gone are  the  glory

days of Jalan Ampas, Cathay Film Production and Shaw Film

Production.  But the recent development of the local film

industry  with  the  emergence of talented  Singaporeans,

such  as  Jack Neo, Eric Khoo and the likes,  are  making

waves  with  their films like "Money No Enough",  "I  Not

Stupid", "12 Storeys", and "Mee Pok Man".  And it is very

encouraging.  It is my hope, Madam, that MDA will take  a

more  active role to promote this industry.  We  can  see

that  we  do  have  talents in our  midst.   Furthermore,

Singapore  and the region are not short of  resources  to

come up with respectable quality products and maybe,  one

day,  we will see a Singaporean winner at the Cannes Film

Festival and even at other competitions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, I believe that the new Authority

and  its relevant agencies must begin to take inputs from

the  industry players as their experience in the industry

is  worth  more  than any advice from  academic  experts.

Similarly, MDA should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1437</b></font><br><br>

not be seen as always giving bureaucratic directions but,

rather,  it must be a partner of the stakeholders  -  the

industry  players, artistes, actors, directors  and  many

more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, we have made lots of progress and strides to

promote  the  local  media, entertainment  and  the  arts

scene.  I have to commend MITA in their efforts.  Looking

forward,  it  may be worthwhile for MITA to  continuously

review  and upgrade its policies and programmes to remain

relevant.   I have to admit that it is not an easy  task.

But  it  will  certainly  make the  overall  effort  more

meaningful  and  it will help strengthen the  local  film

industry in particular and the entertainment industry  in

general.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong:</b> Madam, this Bill marks a

significant change for the media industry.  The Bill will

create a super multimedia regulator authorised to,  among

other  things,  develop  codes of  practice  relating  to

content  or  technical standards for media  services,  or

relating to standards of fair market conduct in any media

industry, and also to monitor compliance with such codes.

More  significantly,  the  Bill  also  provides  for  the

Authority  to  issue  a  Competition  Code  to   regulate

competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I want to point out that this Bill comes

about  two years after limited competition was introduced

in the media sector.  Since then, the two media giants in

Singapore  - Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) and MediaCorp

-  have  forayed into each other's turf.  In the  earlier

phase,  the media industry saw a flurry of rapid changes.

MediaCorp  started  publishing a daily  newspaper  called

Today in June 2000, while MediaWorks, SPH's new broadcast

arm,  was  licensed to run two free-to-air TV channels  - Channel I and Channel U.  SPH also started publishing the

tabloids   Streats   and  Project  Eyeball,   the   first

integrated  print  and  cyberspace  news  publication  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, executives of Today at MediaCorp,

its major owner, have painted

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1438</b></font><br><br>

a  painful  start for Today over distribution  and  other

matters  that  were once monopolised by  SPH,  while  the

executives at SPH MediaWorks also reported obstacles in a

field once dominated by MediaCorp.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The competition situation has now more or less

stabilised.  Since the economic downturn  however,  there

have  been  even  more changes in terms of consolidation.

Consolidation  has  been  a  key  feature  of  the  media

landscape.   For  example,  SPH  has  suspended   Project

Eyeball  and  MediaCorp has shut down  its  City  TV  and

consolidated its sports and Chinese programmes with  some

of  its  other  TV channels.  The media  landscape  is  a

challenging one right now for the media players.  Against

this backdrop, I would like to highlight two concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it is not clear if the MDA's role is to

promote  a  level  playing field for  competition  or  to

manage the competition in such a way as to make sure that

MediaCorp  and SPH do not knock each other  out.   It  is

quite  different.   Reading  the  comments  of  Singapore

leaders in the past, it would seem to be the latter.  For

instance,  DPM  Lee Hsien Loong has once  said  that  the

Government wanted to promote constructive competition and

it  would be a managed process so that one does not knock

out  the  other.  But does it mean that to be  fair,  you

have  to be unfair?  In the sense that, does it mean that

if  Today proves to be so successful, the Government  has

to  step  in  to  make sure that it does not  become  the

dominant  print media?  Does it mean that if SPH  becomes

so  successful with its two TV channels, that there  will

be  some  constraints to make sure that it will not  take

over and become the dominant broadcasting media?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also expressed another concern

that with competition, the media may go for scandals  and

sensations,  instead of serious news and compete  on  the

way down, which is happening in many other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister: will managing the

competition also mean

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1439</b></font><br><br>

controlling  the kind of news that the media can  report?

And, if so, how will this be decided, given that the  MDA

has  made  clear  that one of its roles  is  to  issue  a

Competition Code to regulate competition?  Will there  be

a transparent public interest test?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, if the code is to manage the competition, as

I  suspect it is, it is important that the media industry

be consulted widely in drawing up the code and that there

will  be transparency in both how it is drawn up as  well

as how it will be enforced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I want to ask the Minister how this

Competition Code sits with the coming generic Competition

Act  which is said to be ready in 2-3 years' time  which,

incidentally, strikes me as being rather slow.  One would

have  thought  that it would be the other way  round,  to

introduce   an   over-arching   framework,   an   omnibus

Competition Act, which will underpin competition  in  all

industries and enable more focused and detailed industry-specific measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this is the approach that Australia

is   taking.   It  also  has  a  super  media   regulator

responsible for the converging media and telecoms market,

but  it does not have a separate set of media competition

rules.   Australia has a generic competition law enforced

by  the  Australian Competition and Consumer  Commission,

which  applies to all industries.  In the United Kingdom,

they  are  also  moving  towards a  single  regulator  of

converging   multi-media  industries,   the   Office   of

Communications.   It  will  have strong  anti-competitive

powers as in the Competition law that they have.  In  the

United  Kingdom, they already have an omnibus Competition

law to provide an over-arching framework.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the Government seems to be favouring a

sectoral-based  competition code and  has  come  up  much

faster  with  this than with the bigger  Competition  Act

which we are all waiting for.  For instance, the IDA  has

already come up with the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1440</b></font><br><br>

Competition  Code  for the telecoms  and  this  has  been

effective since 2000.  This poses the question of whether

we  have  a coherent framework.  Should a media  company,

for  instance, file a complaint to the MDA or  should  it

file  with the Competition Commission, once it is formed,

to enforce the Competition Act?  Who is to decide whether

a   dispute  is  more  appropriately  tackled  under  the

Competition  Act,  which is coming, or  under  the  MDA's

Competition Code?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not arguing that we do not need sectoral

regulation now.  At this stage in our development, we are

working to achieve a transition from a monopoly situation

to  a  competitive marketplace.  This and the  particular

features   of  the  media  and  the  telecoms  are   what

distinguish  sectoral  regulators  from  the  Competition

Commission.  In the absence of a Competition  Act,  there

is  a need for a competition code for specific industries

such  as  the  media.  Sectoral rules  provide  a  quick,

effective   way  of  solving  disputes  and  to   promote

competition  and  to  protect  consumers.   However,   as

competition  develops and regulatory  intervention  fades

into  the background, we should do away with the Code  to

allow  greater  use  of  the  Competition  Act.   It   is

important  that we operate both the sectoral  Competition

Codes,  the competition code for the media and the coming

generic  and  omnibus Competition Act within  a  coherent

framework.  The MDA's aim should be to be able to lighten

sectoral   regulation  as  competition  increases,   thus

increasingly  rely  more and more on the  coming  generic

competition law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose that the Competition Code should include

provisions for regular reviews as well as prohibition  on

using  sectoral  powers  if there  is  already  effective

competition.   The Government should allow regulation  of

the media to move towards self-regulation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, there is a need for sectoral regulation

but  my hope is that the more successful we are in  using

it,  the more competition will grow and so the less  need

to rely on it.  The challenge for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1441</b></font><br><br>

MDA  is  to  develop an overall approach and  a  coherent

framework  in enabling greater competition in  a  rapidly

changing environment while preserving social and cultural

benefits associated with the existing policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, thank

you very much for allowing me to speak on this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam here is a very good friend of mine. But I

am amazed actually at the way he describes our media.   I

know  we  are  all getting on in age, Mr Chiam  included.

Maybe  we  will soon be like grandfathers.  But I  cannot

understand  how  he describes our media  or  Government's

handling  of  the media is like a "nanny".   Having  been

with  the  media business for more than 20 years  as  the

editor of the Straits Times Group, I find that, in  fact,

the  media  has  been  maturing, and maturing  very  well

indeed.   I remember the early days when I was editor,  I

did  feel  that  the media here was rather parochial  and

sensational  and I did not want to have any  part  of  it

earlier on.  But after having spent sometime, 3-5  years,

I  then  realise how important the role of the media  was

and felt that in fact, it was important that we could  be

part  of  that development of the media.  If you look  at

the media today, you will find that they are undergoing a

maturing process, with the kind of different opinions and

debates that are going on.  I think it is helping  us  to

move towards a maturing Singapore society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see this move, Mdm Deputy Speaker, as an effort on

the  part of the Government to allow an authority and  at

arms-length to do the kind of work which the Ministry  of

Information, Communications and the Arts has been  doing.

To  me, that is progress.  When Mr Chiam and Mr Seng  Han

Thong talked about a "light touch", I wonder what do they

mean  by  "light  touch" as against a  "heavy  touch",  I

suppose.  But I think here, perhaps what is needed  is  a

judicious  touch because "light touch" can  also  be  too

light and then we can also create problems for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1442</b></font><br><br>

ourselves.   But  neither do I call for a  "heavy  touch"

like  in  the early years.  Nevertheless, like my friend,

Mr  Seng Han Thong, we all realise how difficult  is  the

job  done  by  the media people, day in day out,  chasing

deadlines  and having to make decisions every  moment  of

the  day of their working day.  Our hearts are with  them

and we hope they will continue to do the good work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final point I would like to make, Mdm Deputy

Speaker,   is  the  test  of  this  Bill  or  the   Media

Development  Authority on the question of the  choice  of

members which the Government or MITA will appoint to this

Authority.   I think the whole credibility of this  Media

Development Authority will depend on the kind  of  people

that we elect to the Authority.  I would like to ask  the

Minister  to elaborate on what is the criterion  for  the

selection  of members of this Authority.  I do hope  that

the  Minister  or  the  relevant  authorities  that  will

appoint  the members will choose people who are critical-minded,   open-minded  Singaporeans,  that   will   allow

Singapore  to  move further ahead towards a mature  media

and a mature society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, first of all, may

I  thank  all  the  speakers who have spoken,  especially

those who have spoken in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, first of all, reiterate what I said in my

speech,  that is, the main function of this  Bill  is  to

bring  together different agencies and Government  bodies

that  currently administer different parts of  the  media

industry  into one statutory body.  The purpose of  doing

this  is  really  to  give focus to the  media  industry.

Nothing  else has really changed.  I think to look  ahead

and  perhaps to speculate that this means that  it  is  a

tightening  of  censorship, for  example,  is  just  pure

speculation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, on this issue of censorship and control,

this  is an issue that cannot be avoided.  No country  is

devoid  of controls or censorship rules over their media.

If you take a country, perhaps a country as

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1443</b></font><br><br>

liberal as the United States, you will find that they too

have controls over the media.  No foreign entity can  buy

more  than  20%  of  a broadcast company  in  the  United

States.   And in the United Kingdom, where the regime  is

more liberal, even the transfer of ownership in the large

newspaper  companies  will require the  approval  of  the

Minister.   Every country will have to approach  this  in

its  own way, sensitive to its own context and to address

its own concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, indeed when my staff attended a

conference  recently in Europe which had to do  with  one

aspect of the media, ie, about film classification,  they

came back and told me that the Europeans were not able to

agree  on  a  single  film  classification  standard  for

Europe.   That  is  because  each  country  had  its  own

concerns   about  what  was  important,   in   terms   of

classification,  standards and cultural norms  that  were

appropriate  for that particular country.  So  censorship

is  an issue that all countries have got to grapple with.

And for Singapore, we have got to find our own standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate Mr Zainul Abidin's intervention on this

point that Mr Chiam raised that we should not keep saying

that this is a "nanny" state and the Government tells the

media  what to do.  Mdm Deputy Speaker, I did not ask  Mr

Chiam  what  he was going to say this afternoon  when  he

indicated he wanted to speak on the Bill.  Neither  do  I

want  to  know.   I  was quite happy  for  him  to  raise

whatever points he would raise.  Likewise, I do  not  ask

the  editors of our newspapers on what they are going  to

write in the headlines tomorrow.  Neither do they ask  my

permission.  Neither do I want them to do so.   I  really

do  not follow why we continue to prosecute such an image

of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, if I may address, in turn, the

different  concerns  that have been raised  by  different

speakers.   Mr Seng Han Thong raised a number  of  issues

about  the  standards of performance and asked what  this

meant.  He

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1444</b></font><br><br>

referred  to clause 17 on codes of practice.  This  is  a

clause  under  the competition section of the  Bill.   It

deals  with  standards  of  performance  with  regard  to

competition.   For  example,  if  this  was  a  broadcast

company,  you  would expect that you need  to  have  some

standards  of  performance.  You might need to  regulate,

for  example,  air  time, the number of broadcast  hours.

You might need to ensure that there is no interference of

signals  between one broadcaster and another broadcaster.

There  are  certain technical standards that need  to  be

achieved.   You need to ensure that service  is  provided

and  the system does not break down every other day.   So

there  are these technical standards.    As I said, there

are  also  other social standards.  But as  Mr  Seng  has

pointed out, our approach to the different media has been

different in the past and will continue to be  so  as  we

move  forward.  For the print media, for example, I think

our editors have done a very good job.  They have managed

to  build up the reputation of our newspapers.  They  are

seen  to be credible.  They are seen to be serious.  They

are seen to be a voice that deserves to be heard.  And  I

think  they understand their role in nation building  and

have  taken  this  role seriously.  I  think  that  is  a

relationship that has worked well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the broadcast area, we have programming codes,

and that, again, is because we have some peculiarities in

broadcast,  eg,  dialect policy.  From time  to  time,  a

broadcaster may break that rule and needs to be  reminded

about  that  particular policy, and that policy  reflects

the  nature of our society and our other policies  -  our

language policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address Mr Seng's concern, let me say that these

standards  of performance are, firstly, technical.   And,

secondly,  the  other  standards  that  may  need  to  be

introduced, I would leave it to the MDA to consider  what

other standards they need to introduce in order to ensure

that competition is on an even playing field.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seng made the point that the Bill seems to

suggest that the MDA will become more of a regulator than

a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1445</b></font><br><br>

developer.  Just because there are more clauses  to  deal

with  competition does not mean that the  Board  likewise

will be so.  I do not think we should judge a book by its

cover.   There  are  many  clauses  here  to  deal   with

competition.   Because, as I said, this is  an  immediate

need,  and this is not something that is covered  in  the

other Acts that the MDA will also administer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure Mr Seng and the other Members who have

spoken  that  the MDA indeed is formed to  focus  on  the

development  of the media industry, and they are  working

very hard now to draw up plans on how to do this.  One of

the  issues raised by Mr Zainudin, for example,  was  the

film  sector of the media industry, and I thank  him  for

his  support for the film sector.  This is indeed an area

that we would like to see develop.  As the Prime Minister

said  in  his National Day Rally  -  I think he meant  it

for  Jack Neo  -  "Two No Enough", and he encouraged Jack

to produce more movies that we can all enjoy and that can

travel.  And, indeed, Jack Neo's last hit  "I Not Stupid"

has done very well, not just in Singapore but it has also

travelled,  to some extent, in the region,  and  I  think

that augurs well.  In fact, I received an e-mail recently

of  a Singapore club in the US which is gathering all the

Singapore students and anybody else who is interested  to

watch  "I Not Stupid".  So, that is yet another way  that

it  serves the function to hold together Singaporeans who

are  spread far and wide, away from Singapore.   Yes,  we

will do what we can to develop the film industry.  But we

have got to recognise that it is not an easy industry  to

develop.  We are a small marketplace and films that  have

local  cache  that can resonate with Singaporeans  easily

may not travel very far.  So, the challenge for directors

and  movie  makers is really to find a formula that  will

appeal  both to Singaporeans but will also travel  beyond

Singapore.   Because  whether you  show  the  film  to  3

million  people, 30 million people or 300 million people,

it is still the same set of costs of making the film.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can address some of the specific issues that Mr

Chiam  raised  on the Public Entertainments and  Meetings

Act (PEMA),

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1446</b></font><br><br>

I  should just let Mr Chiam know that the Act will not be

administered in toto by MITA.  MITA will only  administer

the  art entertainment aspects of PEMA.  So, if Mr  Chiam

decides to sing and dance, we can consider giving  him  a

licence.   But if he is going to make a speech,  he  will

still need to go back to the Minister in charge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On clause 5, Mr Chiam made a reference to the

members  of the Board and suggested certain criteria  for

picking  these  members of the Board, as  did  Mr  Zainul

Abidin.    I   would   take   their   suggestions    into

consideration.    Certainly, we want to pick  people  who

are  able to contribute towards the goals of the MDA and,

certainly, their suggestions that they should  be  people

who are critical, who are open minded, who can understand

and  see  the vision of making Singapore into  a  vibrant

global  city  for  media  and  for  the  arts  these  are

certainly  the kinds of criteria we would  apply  and  we

want to try to get a broadbase of people, so that we will

get different ideas to drive the Board forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have addressed Mr Chiam's suggestion that

we  should do away entirely with censorship.   I  do  not

think it is practical and I do not think you can point to

any country in the world that has succeeded in doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zainudin also touched on the matter of satellite

communications,  and  suggested  that   even   Iran   was

considering  doing  this.   I  think  there  is   a   big

difference   between   Iran  and  Singapore,   and   that

difference  is size.  Satellite technology  is  something

that  is important and useful to large countries, because

it  means  that you do not have to really lay  a  lot  of

cables.  Laying cables in large countries is probably not

cost  effective.  For Singapore, we have  cabled  up  the

whole  country  and,  for all practical  purposes,  every

residence in Singapore is able to receive cable  signals.

So,  there  is really not the same reason for us  to  use

this technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Irene Ng asked a rather philosophical question - the difference between promoting and managing

competition.  I think if you created a specific

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1447</b></font><br><br>

scenario whether we would hold back a company if  it  was

too  successful, if  Today became the dominant  newspaper

company, would we be concerned?  If MediaWorks became the

dominant  broadcasting company, would  we  be  concerned?

The  answer  is  no.  I think we leave  the  industry  to

compete.   What we want to be sure of is really that  the

incumbent  operator does not put impediments unfairly  in

the   way  of  a  competitor  trying  to  get  into   the

marketplace and trying to compete, and that is  what  the

competition code is for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms Ng also talked about the omnibus Competition Act

that  is  being considered and why we have chosen  to  do

sectoral  competition codes at this  point  in  time.   I

think  the  answer is that we cannot wait, once  we  have

introduced competition into the media industry.  Although

over  the  last two years the more aggressive competitive

behaviour  has  quietened down  a  little  bit,  I  still

receive  complaints  every now  and  then  by  one  party

against  another  party  on  anti-competitive  behaviour.

Really,  the  only  way to deal with  this  properly  and

effectively is to have a competition code and that is why

we are introducing one now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether it will be consistent with the omnibus

Act  in  future,  certainly  we  will  have  to  make  it

compatible,  and  it will be reviewed at the  appropriate

time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Deputy Speaker, I think I have addressed the

issues  that  have  been raised by  Members.   Again,  in

conclusion, let me thank them for their support.  Let  me

say that the purpose of bringing these different agencies

together  is  to create focus in the media industry.   We

see  this  as  a  potential area of  growth  as  we  move

forward.   The  media, together with  applied  arts  like

design, is an important industry, not just in itself  but

because  of  its  spillover effects to the  rest  of  the

economy.  I think one of the key elements of our economic

strategy  to  move  forward is really  to  tap  into  the

creative and innovative capability of our people  and  of

our resources here in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1448</b></font><br><br>

Singapore, and the Media Development Authority is  tasked

to do that.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> Mdm, I would like to

get  clarification  on the functions and  duties  of  the

proposed MDA.  I can well understand that it is taking  a

balance between development and regulations.  It is true,

and I agree with Ms Irene Ng, that it is creating a super

statutory  regulator.  But I do not  think  the  concerns

that  we  have  about censorship are as ominous  as  some

Members  have put it.  Because I am on one of the appeals

committee  of  MITA and I can safely say that  we  hardly

have any appeals.  This is an indication that we have not

put   too   heavy   a  touch  on  censorship   that   the

organisations would like to come forward and make appeals

for  us  to consider.   I may be wrong here but something

seems to be missing amongst the functions and duties, ie,

as   a   very   important  regulator   or   developmental

organisation  on knowledge, what kind of functions  would

MDA  see  for  itself  to  actively  promote  Singapore's

ability  to  be  discerning about what we see,  hear  and

read,  so  as  to  minimise the need for so-called  heavy

types  of censorship here.  I would like to implore  MDA,

even though it is  ---

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Mdm Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Deputy Speaker:</b> Dr Ngiam, can you just round up

your clarification?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ngiam Tee Liang:</b> I am coming to my

question now.  Would MDA see for itself that it also  has

a responsibility to make Singaporeans safe for ideas, ie,

you  give  them informed choices, rather than make  ideas

safe for Singaporeans, ie, through the censorship route?

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Dr Ngiam raises a very fundamental

question about the development of our society.   I  think

he  wants  a  society to be more reflective, to  be  more

mature,  to  be  thinking, to understand that  there  are

trade-offs whatever the issue is.  He has developed these

perspectives because he sits on some of our  boards,  and

he  is  put  in  a position where he has to  decide  very

difficult  issues.  On the one hand, somebody might  come

and say, "Why don't you allow this movie to be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1449</b></font><br><br>

screened, because as mature adults, surely we can make up

our  own minds about the contents of this movie?"  On the

other  hand,  we have others coming to the appeals  board

saying,  "No,  you should not allow this to be  screened.

It lowers our moral character.  This will do great damage

to  our society."  And so, indeed, Singaporeans will have

to  be  more discerning.  But I think this is beyond  the

ability  of one agency or one authority to do.   I  think

this  is  a  task  for all of us in this  House,  in  all

Ministries, in the way we debate, in the way we  discuss,

in  the way we formulate policies, to be more reflective,

to  consider  the pros and cons and to come  to  our  own

conclusions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this afternoon, Members heard suggestions

about  the  Government  making  decisions  on  behalf  of

citizens.  Well, we want to try and shift some  of  these

decision-making risks that citizens have got to  consider

and   to  evaluate  and  to  come  to  a  conclusion  for

themselves.   This is the process.  It is  not  something

that will happen overnight but, certainly, we can all  do

our part.

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam:</b> Madam, I applaud what the

Minister said earlier about not inhibiting the censorship

but making it a little bit more transparent.  As part  of

that process, while you bring in the right people to form

this body, may I also suggest that sometimes that kind of

overriding  principles must come down to the officers  on

the ground, including MITA officers as well as editors of

papers,  etc.  Because, sometimes the OB markers are  not

very   clear   and  everyone  tends  to   over-read   the

Government.    Perhaps   this   can   be    taken    into

consideration.

<br><br><!-- Mr David Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Lim:</b> Mdm Deputy Speaker, again, my answer

is  very  similar  to what I gave to Dr  Ngiam.   We  are

conducting  a  censorship review.  This  is  not  germane

really to the Bill that is before the House, but if I may

just  briefly address that.  We decided that we  will  go

ahead  with this Censorship Review Committee, and I think

I  want  to  give them time to consider inputs  from  the

public.  We have received

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1450</b></font><br><br>

many  useful suggestions.  Arts groups have put  together

their  thoughts  and written them down.   They  have  put

serious  proposals to the Committee.  The Committee  will

consider all of these.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are moving forward in this area. But, as I have

said in this House before, it is not whether we are going

to become more liberal or more strict.  I think the issue

really is whether we can keep pace with developments.  We

cannot  choose the world we live in.  And if we  want  to

grow and to progress, we have got to be connected to  the

rest  of the world.  But that also does not mean we  have

got  to  be  like everybody else.  No two  countries  are

alike.  No two societies are alike.  Therefore, we should

find our own formula.  We should have our own voice.   We

should  have our own distinctive identity.  And we should

not  be too eager to copy the standards that other people

have  set for themselves, because no society is  free  of

the consequences of these choices.

Whatever choices we make, there will be positive outcomes

and there will be problems that we will have to manage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it is a process and, I think, on censorship, let

us wait to see what the Review Committee has to say.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr David T. E. Lim].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

<div align="center"><b>NUMBER OF JOBLESS SINGAPOREANS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Gan Kim Yong</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

if  he could give an update on the number of Singaporeans

who  remain jobless and whether he expects the  situation

to improve by early next year.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An estimated 84,300 residents (comprising

Singaporeans  and  Singapore  Permanent  Residents)  were

unemployed in September 2002.  (This figure is seasonally

adjusted). Although the labour market had shown signs  of

recovery, job creation is still not sufficient to  absorb

this   year's   new  entrants  to  the   labour   market.

Consequently,    the    seasonally    adjusted    overall

unemployment  rate  rose to a 15-year  high  of  4.8%  in

September  2002 from 4.1% in June and 4.5% in March  this

year.   Among the resident labour force, the unemployment

rate was 4.9% in September 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unemployment is expected to remain high until the

end  of this year.  It is expected to be between 5.0% and

5.5%.    If   economic   recovery  is   sustained,   then

unemployment would fall in 2003.  But it is too  soon  to

predict next year's unemployment rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent developments in the external environment

would affect Singapore's economic recovery and employment

growth.  Nevertheless, there are still job  vacancies.  I

would  therefore urge unemployed Singaporeans to  have  a

positive  attitude, to be flexible and  more  willing  to

take up these jobs. It will not be easy to change, or  to

go  into  new  areas, but those who keep on trying,  will

eventually succeed.

<div align="center"><b>HOSPITALISATION FEE ASSISTANCE SCHEME</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for Health,

since  the introduction from 1st1/2November 2001  of  the

one-year hospitalisation fee assistance scheme as part of

the  second  off-Budget package to help lower income  and

retrenched  Singaporeans (a) how many retrenched  workers

and their families have benefited from the scheme so far;

(b)  how much has it cost the Government; and (c) in view

of  the  continued economic downturn, does  his  Ministry

plan to extend the scheme.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two types of rebates that the Government

has been giving to Singaporeans under the Hospitalisation

Fee Assistance Scheme (HFAS) since 1st November 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Singaporeans who are class B2/C inpatients or

subsidised  day  surgery patients in  the  public  sector

hospitals and institutions would automatically receive  a

10% fee rebate on their hospitalisation bills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, retrenched Singaporeans and their non-working spouse and dependent children would be eligible

for  an  additional 40% fee assistance.   Thus,  together

with  the 10% rebate, families of retrenched Singaporeans

would  effectively  receive  a  50%  reduction  in  their

hospital bills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past 11 months since the implementation of

the HFAS (from 1st November 2001 to 30th September 2002),

some 265,712 Singaporean families have benefited from the

scheme.   Of these, 139 were retrenched Singaporeans  and

their  families  who  received a 50% reduction  in  their

hospital bills.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1453</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Altogether, the Government has paid out close to $20

million  worth  of  rebates  to  Singaporeans  and  their

families to help defray their medical expenses.  Of this,

$142,000  was given to retrenched Singaporeans and  their

families.   The bulk of the rebates ($19.8  million)  was

given  to  Singaporeans who used the  heavily  subsidised

class B2/C inpatient services or who underwent subsidised

day surgery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The HFAS was introduced for 1 year under the

Government's 2nd off-budget measures to help Singaporeans

tide  through  the  economic  downturn.   The  HFAS  will

terminate on 31st October 2002 as planned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans who face financial difficulties in

paying  their  medical  bills, including  those  who  are

retrenched,  will continue to receive funding  assistance

from  Medifund.   They can ask to see the Medical  Social

Workers  who will assist them accordingly. No Singaporean

would  be denied essential medical care because of  their

inability to pay.

what  advisory has been or will be given to  individuals,

businesses  and  private  security  agencies  to  prevent

attacks  of  similar nature from occurring in  Singapore;

and  (b)  given that many Singaporeans are making holiday

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  (a)  what lessons can Singapore  draw  from  the

recent  terrorists'  bombing  in  Bali  with  regard   to

alerting  Singaporeans' receptiveness to  information  on

terrorists'  activities;  and  (b)  what  more  can   the

Government  do to ensure that Singaporeans shall  at  all

times  be  prepared for any eventuality and  not  presume

that all is well because the Government is taking care of

everything.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

Home   Affairs  what  travel  directives  and  additional

security  measures are being introduced  to  protect  our

installations,   assets  and  people  working   overseas,

especially those on the Indonesian islands of  Batam  and

Bintan.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since September 11 last year, we have already taken

various  security  measures to deal with  the  threat  of

terrorism facing Singapore.  These security measures  are

still sufficiently robust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have previously informed this House, Police,

and  in  some  instances  SAF and  Gurkha  officers,  are

deployed  at  key establishments such as Changi  Airport,

Tuas   and   Woodlands  Checkpoints,  certain  Government

buildings  as  well  as our oil and water  installations.

Regular patrols are conducted and physical measures  such

as CCTVs and security lightings have been put in place to

improve   security.   The  Home  Team  and  Mindef   have

conducted  numerous joint exercises and analysed  various

scenarios   to  ensure  that  our  contingency   response

capabilities  and resources are ready to  deal  with  any

situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Security measures at our borders have also been

intensified  to  prevent  entry of  undesirable  persons.

Stringent immigration and security checks are carried out

at  all  sea,  air  and  land checkpoints.   Police  have

recently deployed Explosive Detection Dogs (EDD)  at  the

various   checkpoints  to  aid  in   the   detection   of

explosives.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1455</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Role of the community</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Bali incident, Police have enhanced their

presence  and  increased their patrols to commercial  and

entertainment establishments. However, the police  cannot

be  at every street corner. The community must also  play

its  part  by  being vigilant and be on the  lookout  for

suspicious events and characters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the critical information that gave ISD the

lead  in  the investigation and eventual arrests  of  the

Jemaah  Islamiyah network in Singapore came from a member

of the public.  While there are no known imminent threats

posed  by  the  Jemaah Islamiyah, the general  threat  of

terrorism  has not abated. However, we should  not  allow

this  to  affect  our  lives.  We should  not  sink  into

despondency, nor panic and cower in fear.   We  must  not

allow  ourselves  to  be intimidated  by  terrorism.   We

should  respond to these threats in a calm  and  rational

manner.   We  should maintain normalcy and go  about  our

business  as  usual;   just be more vigilant  and  alert.

What  we  do  not  want is for people to play  pranks  by

making false calls and hoaxes to divert the attention and

waste  the  precious resources of the security  agencies.

We will deal firmly with such pranksters.

<br><br><i>Roles of businesses and private security agencies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the Bali bomb blast, Police, together with

ISD  had  again  briefed the business community  and  the

private  security  industry  on  the  necessary  security

measures to adopt.  We have also taken steps to raise the

professionalism  and competencies of the  security  guard

industry.   These  include  the  revision  of  the  basic

training  requirements for licensed security  guards.  We

want   to  ensure  that  security  guards  are  not  only

knowledgeable  in security processes, but that  they  are

also  able  to perform their assigned duties competently.

All  security  guards  will be  trained  to  handle  bomb

threats,   deal  with  suspicious-looking   objects   and

persons, and respond to shootings and other emergencies.

<br><br><i>Advisory for overseas travel</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were concerns about whether advisories will be

issued   to  Singaporeans  traveling  overseas,  security

measures  for  business assets and  Singaporeans  working

overseas.  MFA will not be issuing a travel  advisory  at

this stage.  However, given the current circumstances, we

would  urge anyone who needs to travel in the  region  to

keep themselves updated on developments in the region and

to  register  with the nearest Singapore  Embassy  there.

Singaporeans  can  also  call  the  Ministry  of  Foreign

Affairs  Consular hotline (65 - 332 0000)  for  emergency

consular assistance if required.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our overseas missions and other Government agencies

have  also  taken  appropriate measures  to  enhance  the

security  of their premises, residences, staff and  their

families.  Our overseas missions are in constant  contact

with our citizens working, studying or living in the host

countries  through  students  bodies,  Singapore   clubs,

warden  system and other channels to provide any consular

assistance if required.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore companies in Batam and Bintan, especially

those  in  the Batamindo Industrial Park and  the  Bintan

Industrial Estate, have been briefed on the situation and

the   various   security  measures  introduced   by   the

industrial  park  operators. Many of our  Singapore-based

companies  are found in these two industrial  parks.  For

those outside the park, plans are underway to brief  them

as  well. There are also arrangements in place to  assist

the  companies  and  our citizens who are  working  there

during emergency.

<div align="center"><b>ASSISTANCE GIVEN TO INDONESIA AFTER BALI INCIDENT</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Ms Braema Mathiaparanam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Ms Braema Mathiaparanam</b> asked the Prime

Minister whether any assistance was offered, eg,  medical

aid,  refrigeration facilities or airlifts, to the people

in  Indonesia during the recent Bali disaster and, if  no

such gestures were made, what were the reasons.

<br><br><!-- Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Raymond Lim Siang Keat (for the Prime Minister):</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Government did offer assistance

to  the Indonesian Government following the tragic events

in Bali.  Our Ambassador in Jakarta did approach both the

Indonesian  Co-ordinating  Minister  for  Social  Welfare

Yusuf Kalla and Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda to  make

these   offers.    The   Indonesian   leaders   expressed

appreciation for our offer but replied that the situation

was under control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add that, working closely with our Embassy in

Jakarta, the Singapore Association in Indonesia (SAI) and

the  Singapore Women's Group (SWG) raised Rp 163  million

(S$32,000)  at its annual Charity Ball for the  hospitals

in  Bali  that  have worked tirelessly on the  ground  to

treat  the  victims.   The guest  at  the  ball  was  Her

Excellency Ibu Herawati, wife of Foreign Minister  Hassan

Wirajuda,  and she helped raise a significant portion  of

the  proceeds  for the Bali victims by her own  impromptu

song performance. Furthermore, Singaporeans spontaneously

found  ways  to extend help to those in need.  Gleneagles

Hospital sent a five-member medical team to Bali to offer

medical  assistance  and supplies. The  team  treated  30

Indonesian  patients, including 20 burn  victims,  during

their  stay in Bali.  This team was replaced  by  a  six-member  medical  relief team from  Singapore  Red  Cross.

Other  Singaporeans also chipped in to raise  funds.   As

you  would  have read in the Straits Times, a  Bali-based

Singaporean  couple  Shaharin  Abas  Koh  and  Joyce  Tan

collected  over S$3,000 for the Bali victims  by  sending

out  e-mail  messages  and SMS messages  to  friends  and

relatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The efforts of these Singaporeans were recognised

last  week  by the Jakarta Post, an Indonesian newspaper.

In  an  editorial  on 23rd October 2002  entitled  "Thank

You", the paper extended, and I quote, "deepest gratitude

for  what  Singaporeans have done for Indonesians,  on  a

voluntary basis".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this latest tragedy in Bali - for the victims of

all  nationalities  - has shown, it  is  not  always  the

Government  that has to initiate voluntary  aid  missions

abroad.  Singaporeans will spontaneously give  generously

of  their time, expertise and money when there are others

in  need. Their voluntary efforts have helped to  further

strengthen the good people-to-people ties between the two

countries.

<div align="center"><b>C AND B2 CLASSES IN PRIVATE HOSPITALS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister

for  Health  if  his  Ministry will  accept  the  private

hospitals' offer to treat subsidised C class and B2 class

patients.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Health acts as the purchaser of

medical   services   for   lower   and   middle    income

Singaporeans.   Public sector hospitals and  institutions

are   set  up  to  provide  good  and  affordable   basic

healthcare  to  them.   The Ministry  has  put  in  place

various  safeguards to ensure that Singaporeans  continue

to  enjoy  good healthcare and to moderate cost increase.

Amongst these are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Setting up two healthcare clusters as not-for-profit entities and imposing revenue caps on them. Each

cluster   has  a  tertiary  hospital,  regional   general

hospitals  and  polyclinics  to  ensure  integrated   and

seamless  care  for patients at the lowest  cost  setting

appropriate to needs;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1459</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Specifying the number of Class B2+, Class B2 and

C  beds  to be provided by our public hospitals to ensure

that  the  needs of lower and middle income  Singaporeans

are met;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Setting clinical and service standards to ensure

quality in the medical services delivered;  and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Coordinating the introduction of high-cost and

high-technology medicine and equipment to avoid  wasteful

duplication and manage increases in healthcare cost.

All  these  safeguards are to make sure that  our  public

sector hospitals and national centres keep cost down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, subsidised patients choose the public

hospital and ward class they want to be treated  in,  and

the  appropriate Government subsidy is given based on the

choice  of ward class.  The Ministry will not be able  to

extend  this  arrangement for private  sector  hospitals.

There  is  no mechanism to determine who is eligible  for

treatment  at  private hospitals, and  we  would  end  up

subsidising  those who can and should pay for  their  own

healthcare  expenses. There is also no compelling  reason

for the Ministry to run a dual system where we now select

subsidised  patients  for certain treatments  in  private

hospitals, as suggested by the Parkway group.  The public

hospitals  are providing acceptable standard of  care  to

subsidised  patients. The Ministry has allowed subsidised

patients   to  be  treated  by  private  sector   general

practitioners  and  dentists  under  the   Primary   Care

Partnership Scheme, but those eligible have to undergo  a

means test.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry would be happy to contract the service

from  the  private sector if it can offer lower costs  at

the  same  or  better  service quality  with  the  proper

framework  in  place.  We are putting  in  place  such  a

framework  for  the  step-down care  sector,  with  means

testing,  accredited private sector facilities,  properly

audited  norm  costs, revenue caps, and  so  on.  If  the

private  sector  is  keen to help keep  healthcare  costs

down,  they  are  welcome to provide  step-down  services

within this framework for a start.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE LAND AUTHORITY</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Mdm Cynthia Phua</b> asked the Minister for

Law  why  does Singapore Land Authority need  to  appoint

other  Government  agencies, such as Urban  Redevelopment

Authority,  Housing  and  Development  Board   and   Land

Transport  Authority,  to sell  state  land  when  it  is

capable of undertaking such a sale itself.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although SLA was formed as a statutory board in June

2001,  we  have  decided to continue with the  prevailing

practice of appointing other agencies to sell State land.

There  are good reasons for this practice.  For  example,

URA  which has expertise in urban redevelopment has  been

appointed   to   sell  land  linked   to   planning   and

redevelopment  objectives since  the  1960s.   Similarly,

since 1989, HDB has been appointed the agent to sell land

within  public housing estates.  STB has been  our  agent

for tourism-related projects since 1988.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this practice has worked well for many years, we

do  not  intend to discontinue it.  Nonetheless, as  with

all  Government policies, we will review  it  and,  where

necessary,  make changes and improvements.  For  example,

LTA  was  appointed recently for a site  integrated  with

transport  infrastructure and SLA has also been appointed

as land sales agent for another site.

<div align="center"><b>REVIEW OF MEDISAVE-CUM-SUBSIDISED OUTPATIENT SCHEME</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  and  Minister for Finance whether his  Ministry

will  review  the  Civil  Service Medisave-cum-Subsidised

Outpatient Scheme for dependants of female civil servants

to ensure equal treatment with their male counterparts.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Service reviews its medical benefits

regularly.   Under the Medisave-cum-Subsidised Outpatient

(MSO)  Scheme,  introduced in 1994, we have  aligned  the

treatment  in  medical benefits between male  and  female

officers.   They receive the same additional  1%  monthly

contribution to their Medisave account which they can use

for other family members, including dependants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only slight difference is in outpatient

benefits.   Women  officers are  not  eligible  to  claim

outpatient  subsidy  for  their  husbands  or   dependent

children.    However,  this  difference  was  effectively

removed  in 2001 when the Government decided to  transfer

any  unused  balance in the annual cap  of  $350  to  the

officer's Medisave account at the end of each year.   The

officer can then use this amount in Medisave according to

Medisave guidelines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic philosophy of the civil service is that

its medical benefit schemes should reflect the values and

practices  of  our  Asian society,  where  typically  the

husband is responsible for taking care of the family.  We

should be careful to avoid inadvertently sending a signal

that  husbands  no  longer have this  responsibility,  by

changing  long-established practices  before  the  social

reality  has  adjusted.  However, as I mentioned  at  the

last  Committee of Supply, this is not set  in  concrete,

and  the  civil service will continue to review  the  MSO

scheme periodically as our society evolves.

<div align="center"><b>INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION CONVENTION 100</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</b> asked the Minister

for  Manpower in view of Singapore's ratification of  the

International Labour Organisation Convention 100 on Equal

Pay  for  Equal Work, whether the Singapore Civil Service

is in compliance with this convention.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore ratified ILO Convention 100 in June this

year.   This  Convention seeks to promote and ensure  the

application  of  the principle of equal remuneration  for

men and women for work of equal value.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wages in Singapore are based on meritocracy and

determined by market forces of demand and supply.  In the

case of the Civil Service, the principle of equal pay has

been adopted since 1962.  Male and female officers of the

same rank are placed on the same salary scale.  We are in

compliance with the convention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the public sector is aware of the

difference  in  medical  benefits  for  male  and  female

officers engaged prior to 1994.  For this group of  civil

servants,  medical  benefits were extended  only  to  the

dependants of male officers, but not to the dependants of

female  officers.   This  policy was  formulated  on  the

principle that in an Asian society like Singapore, it  is

the  husband's responsibility to look after the  family's

need.    However,  if  a  female  employee  becomes   the

breadwinner,  as in a widow or divorcee,  her  dependants

would be eligible for medical benefits.  In 1994, serving

civil  servants  were given the option of  accepting  the

subsidised outpatient cum Medisave Scheme whereby male or

female

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1463</b></font><br><br>

civil  servants received the same outpatient subsidy  and

additional 1% Medisave contribution.  The latter could be

used  by  both  male  and female  officers  to  meet  the

hospitalisation expenses of their dependants.  Since then

all  civil  servants  were recruited  on  similar  terms.

Officers  on the older medical benefits schemes  can  opt

over  to  the MSO scheme at any time.  The Civil  Service

will periodically review its medical benefits scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having ratified Convention 100, my Ministry will

take  steps to implement the necessary measures to comply

with  the  requirements of this convention.  The Ministry

will,  in  consultation  with the National  Trades  Union

Congress, Singapore Business Federation and the Singapore

National Employers' Federation, initiate the adoption  of

a  Tripartite  Resolution to re-affirm the commitment  of

the   3  social  partners  to  promote  and  observe  the

principle of equal remuneration. This will pave  the  way

for  this  principle to be incorporated in the collective

agreements signed between employers and unions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Trade

and  Industry  what  is his Ministry's  response  to  the

observation  of  the  Economic  Review  Committee's  sub-committee  on manufacturing that electricity in Singapore

has become too expensive.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to frame this issue correctly. First,

electricity price in Singapore is unlikely to be  cheaper

in  absolute  terms  than  in the neighbouring  countries

because  of certain structural characteristics  that  are

unique  to a city state like ours. It is no different  as

to  why  property prices here are more expensive than  in

Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Jakarta. Second, the issue then

is   whether   within   these   structural   constraints,

electricity prices are as competitive as they could be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the structural factors? Our electricity

price  comprises  two components.  One  is  the  cost  of

generating electricity, and the other is the cost of  the

infrastructure to deliver the electricity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our generation cost is high because we depend on oil

and   gas  for  our  energy  source,  unlike  many  other

countries which have recourse to cheaper electricity such

as hydro-electricity. Both oil and gas are expensive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our infrastructure cost is also high. Because of

our small size, we bury our entire electricity network so

that land can be freed up for other use. Depending on the

voltage  level, buried transmission cables cost three  to

25   times   more   than  overhead  cables.   To   ensure

reliability,  back-up capacity has to be installed  since

faults  take longer to locate and fix with buried cables.

This  makes  a  buried  system much more  expensive  than

comparable overhead systems used in most other  countries

and   cities.  This  cost  translates  into  higher  grid

charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These then are the constraints. What are we doing

within    these   constraints   to   ensure   competitive

electricity prices? On the matter of grid charges, EMA is

reviewing  the  current grid charging framework  to  find

ways  to  benchmark our grid charges to those imposed  in

comparable countries and cities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also started to further liberalise our

electricity market to make it more competitive. This will

help  put  downward pressure on prices. Competition  will

force  market  players  to  be more  cost  conscious  and

squeeze   out  inefficiencies.  It  will  also  encourage

players to seek new and cheaper technology to gain market

share. With the pending liberalisation, we have seen  the

entry of seven new licensees in electricity retailing and

three new generation licensees.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1465</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see the impact of competition on electricity

prices  from  the  first phase of retail  contestability.

About  220  customers,  comprising the  large  industrial

companies   are  already  contestable.   They   can   buy

electricity  from these retailers.  About  179  (or  80%)

have switched to buying electricity from these retailers.

Of  those  who  have switched, about  86%  were  able  to

negotiate  lower  prices for their  electricity.   Retail

contestability   in  the  electricity  market   will   be

gradually  opened  to other consumers.   5,000  consumers

will become contestable three months after the new market

starts.   Another 5,000 will become contestable 6  months

thereafter.  This will open about 70-75% of total  demand

to  retail  competition. The EMA  is  currently  studying

extending  retail  contestability to  domestic  consumers

starting end 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition has also driven the existing generation

companies to seek better efficiencies to gain competitive

edge over their rivals. Some had replaced their oil fired

plants  with  gas fired plants. Such plants enjoy  better

efficiencies and therefore lower costs. This has  enabled

the Energy Market Authority to lower the price cap on 1st

January  2002,  which resulted in a 6% reduction  in  the

average electricity price.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Singapore's electricity costs are not low.

Many  factors  resulting in this are beyond our  control.

However  we can expect competition to drive the  industry

to  achieve  better  efficiencies which  will  ultimately

benefit consumers. The challenge for us is to continue to

provide   consumers  with  good  quality   and   reliable

electricity supply, and the higher costs this necessarily

entails; while keeping electricity prices affordable  and

competitive.   In   this  regard,   we   appreciate   the

suggestions of the ERC sub-committee on manufacturing and

my  Ministry is carefully studying them to see what  more

can  be done. This is so as we are in full agreement with

the   sub-committee   that  keeping  electricity   prices

competitive  is an important element for the industry  to

prosper and thrive.

<div align="center"><b>RESPITE FOR ELECTRICITY AND WATER CONSUMERS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Trade

and  Industry,  at  this  time of economic  difficulties,

whether  he  will advise Power Supply Ltd and the  Public

Utilities Board not to cut electricity and water supplies

to  consumers who are in arrears of utility bills but  to

give them more time to pay up.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern raised by the Member for Potong Pasir is

shared  by all of us in this House. My Ministry has  been

in  discussion with Power Supply. Power Supply deals with

customers  in arrears by giving them what is  effectively

an  extension  of  time to pay rather than  pre-emptorily

cutting  off their utility supplies.  It issues reminders

and also visits these households to work out the best way

to resolve the outstanding bills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a consumer informs Power Supply that he has

difficulty paying his bills, Power Supply will advise him

to  make alternative payment arrangements, usually in the

form  of  instalments. For such consumers, they must  pay

off at least their current bill. The backpayments may  be

repaid  via  an  instalment plan. This arrangement  helps

control  the size of the arrears from spiralling  out  of

control.  Currently, about 73,000 households  are  paying

their arrears in instalments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a commercial company, Power Supply should recover

arrears from its defaulting customers. However, they  are

aware  that  they  should  do this  in  a  sensitive  way

especially from households who have genuine difficulties.

For  these  households, if the need arises, Power  Supply

will refer them to the Community Development Councils  to

access the Government's financial assistance schemes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1467</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CDCs administer a Rent and Utilities Assistance

Scheme (RUAS) that offers assistance to households in HDB

rental flats who are in need and have difficulties paying

their rent and maintenance charges.  They also administer

an   Interim  (Short-term)  Financial  Assistance  Scheme

(IFAS)  to  help families in 2 to 4-room HDB  flats  with

temporary   grants  to  meet  their  subsistence   needs,

including maintenance charges.  In the first half of this

year,  a  total of about $340,000 has been  disbursed  to

more than 600 applicants of the RUAS scheme. In addition,

the  Government  has  also extended  the  Utilities  Save

scheme  for  another year, as part of the 2nd  off-budget

measures to help households to offset their utility bills

through  a  monthly  grant for  10  months.   The  scheme

started in July this year, and will last till April 2003.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For households that are facing financial

difficulties,  they should contact Power Supply  to  work

out  a viable repayment plan, so that their bills do  not

get out of control. For genuine hardship cases, there are

Government financial assistance schemes in place to  tide

families over temporary difficulties. However, households

must also do their part to cut consumption and to lighten

their  own  bills.  Power Supply's statistics  show  that

about  92%  of  households with accounts in arrears  have

electricity and water consumption bills that exceeded the

national average for their housing types. Such households

will  find  their bills more manageable  if  they  reduce

usage.  As  part of its education efforts,  Power  Supply

advises  these  households how to better  conserve  their

electricity and water usage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disconnection of utilities supply is a last resort

action  taken  by Power Supply.  This can be  avoided  if

households  contact Power Supply and jointly work  out  a

viable repayment arrangement.

<div align="center"><b>ELECTRONIC VOTING IN THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTIONS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Prime

Minister  whether  the  Government  will  consider  using

electronic voting at the next election of the President.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April last year, this House passed legislation to

provide  for the implementation of electronic  voting  in

Singapore  for  both the presidential  and  parliamentary

elections.   The Elections Department then  proceeded  to

develop an electronic voting system.  Members will recall

seeing  a  demonstration  of  the  prototype  last  year.

However,  the  electronic  voting  system  could  not  be

completed  in  time  for the General  Elections  held  in

November 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the pace of rapid technology changes,

Elections Department is currently looking into developing

another electronic voting system.  If the system  can  be

completed  and  certified for use in  time,  it  will  be

implemented   for  voters  in  two  SMCs  at   the   next

Presidential Election which is due to be held between 1st

June and 31st August 2005.

<div align="center"><b>ECO-RECYCLING PARK</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29. <b>Ms Olivia Lum Ooi Lin</b> asked the Minister for

the  Environment (a) if he will provide an update on  the

proposed  pilot  Eco-Recycling  Park  in  Tuas;  and  (b)

whether   his   Ministry  plans  for  more  schemes   and

programmes  to encourage recycling companies  to  set  up

their  facilities and invest in advanced  technology  and

capital equipment there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Swee Say:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Output of solid waste has increased in tandem with

economic and population growth in the last three decades.

Today, about 7,700 tonnes of waste are disposed of at our

incineration  plants  and Semakau landfill  daily.   This

represents a six-fold increase compared to 30 years  ago.

This trend is not sustainable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to minimise waste and recycle more. Last

year, our recycling rate was 44%.  We aim to increase  it

to  60%  by  2012.   To  achieve  this  target,  one  key

initiative is the setting up of the Eco-Recycling Park in

Tuas through the joint effort of ENV, NEA, EDB and JTC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides helping to increase recycling in Singapore,

the  growth of the recycling industry can also serve  the

growing  markets in Singapore as well as in  the  region.

The  Park  seeks to attract high-value added  activities,

and  transform  the image of the recycling industry  into

one  that deploys advanced technology and provides a more

conducive working environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We adopt a cluster approach in the development of

the  Park  so that companies can enjoy greater  synergies

and  operational efficiency.  JTC offers them  a  30-year

lease  at reasonable rental. ENV encourages them to  make

use  of the "Innovation for Environmental Sustainability"

(IES)  Fund  and try out new approaches in  environmental

management.  They  can  also take  advantage  of  various

incentive schemes managed by EDB, IE Singapore and SPRING

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Park was launched in March 2002 and has received

encouraging response. By the end of this year,  companies

operating  in  the Park will be able to offer  facilities

for   the   recovery  of  recyclables  from   industrial,

commercial and domestic sectors, including paper,  glass,

plastic,  wood  and  metal. The remaining  non-recyclable

materials are then disposed of at Tuas Incineration Plant

located in the Park.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in the early stage of developing the Park.

There  is still a long way to go.  NEA, JTC and  EDB  are

currently   promoting  several  companies   to   set   up

facilities  to  recycle plastic, glass,  cardboard,  food

waste,  waste cooking oil and so on, in the Park.  Guided

by  the Singapore Green Plan 2012, the development of the

Eco-Recycling  Park  will  not  only  help  enhance   our

environmental  sustainability,  but  also  transform  the

waste  recycling  industry in Singapore into  a  regional

leader.

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN DOMESTIC WORKER LEVY</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Jennifer Lee</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

(a)  what  was  the Government levy for foreign  domestic

workers  at the time of its introduction and how  has  it

increased  over the years to its present  rate;  and  (b)

what  was the number of foreign domestic workers  at  the

time  of  introduction  of the levy  and  what  were  the

numbers since then, specifically in the years before  and

after each change in the levy.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign domestic worker (FDW) levy was first

introduced in April 1982.  At that time, the levy was set

at  30%  of the worker's monthly wages, in line with  the

levy  rates for other sectors*.  To moderate FDW  demand,

the  FDW  levy  rate has been adjusted upwards  over  the

years  to the present $345 per month. The changes in  FDW

levy  rates from 1982 to 1999 are given in Annex I below.

Owing to the uncertain economic climate, a moratorium was

placed on increases to the levy rate in January 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were around 14,000 FDWs when the FDW levy was

first introduced in 1982.  Since then, the number of FDWs

has  grown steadily to more than 140,000 today, which  is

ten times the figure in 1982.

<hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>

*  The monthly levy rates for these sectors then were set

at   30%   of  the  worker's  monthly  wages   or   $150,

whichever is greater.

<div align="center"><b>BREAKDOWN AT BUKIT PANJANG LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

Transport (a) why is the Bukit Panjang Light Rail Transit

constantly breaking down despite repeated assurances from

the  Ministry that service standards are up; and (b) what

kind  of  safety  measures  are  in  place  for  such   a

driverless transport system, when train wheels can become

dislodged in the operation process.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1475</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bukit Panjang LRT system has had many teething

problems in its initial years.  But in recent months,  it

has  largely stabilised.  Until the recent breakdown,  it

has  performed to the high service standard of 99.7% that

we  demand.   (Meeting  this  standard  means  a  maximum

service disruption of less than four minutes over  a  20-hour  daily operation.)  The average service availability

from  June  to September was 99.74%.  This compares  well

with other similar systems in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent breakdown occurred on 21st October at

around  6.40  am,  when  one guide wheel  was  dislodged,

causing a power trip.  (A guide wheel helps to steer  the

vehicle  towards the desired direction, unlike  a  normal

wheel  which  helps to propel the vehicle forward.)   The

spindle that held the guide wheel grated against the rail

and  damaged  900 metres of it.  SLRT had to replace  the

damaged sections.  The repair was time-consuming  due  to

the  extent  of the damage.  Each connection  had  to  be

dismantled and re-installed carefully.  Extensive  checks

and  trial  runs  had to be conducted  to  ascertain  the

safety   of  the  entire  LRT  system  before  commencing

service.  Partial service resumed on 24th October at 6.30

pm and full service resumed on 26th October at 12 noon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incident caused a lot of inconvenience to

commuters but it did not pose any safety implication  for

them.   In  any case, having a driver on board would  not

have  prevented the occurrence of the incident.  (BP  LRT

is  not  an  unmanned  system, just that  technology  has

allowed it to be controlled remotely by the crew  in  the

Operations Control Centre.  The crew constantly  monitors

the  system  and carries out swift recovery actions  when

faults are detected.)

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Land Transport Authority has directed SMRT, the

parent  company of the SLRT, to investigate the incident.

One of its terms of reference is to look into measures to

prevent   similar   incidents  from  re-occurring.    The

investigation   team   is  expected   to   complete   its

investigation within four weeks.

<div align="center"><b>MASS RAPID TRANSIT FARE CARD</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong</b> asked the Minister for

Transport (a) if his Ministry has thought of using  other

more  convenient fare systems when replacing the  single-trip  Mass Rapid Transit fare card with the standard fare

card where a deposit is required and refunded at the  end

of  each trip, which has highly inconvenienced commuters;

and   (b)  what  happens  to  the  deposits  that  remain

unclaimed after a while.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two main types of transit fare cards:

magnetic  cards and ez-link contactless smartcards.   LTA

has   opted   for  the  ez-link  system  as   contactless

smartcards, unlike the existing magnetic cards, have  the

capacity  to  accommodate  the  fare  information  of  an

expanding  Rapid Transit System.  Hence, they  can  allow

commuters  to continue enjoying through-ticketing  for  a

seamless journey even as they transfer from line to line.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North-East Line and all future lines will operate

solely  on the ez-link system.  They will not be able  to

accept magnetic cards, hence the need to replace magnetic

cards,  including  the single-trip magnetic  fare  cards.

The  latter will be replaced by the new Standard  Tickets

(STs) that ride on the ez-link system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, 7% or about 75,000 train passengers use

single-trip  magnetic  cards.  While  it  is  technically

feasible  to retain a separate ticketing system for  such

single-trip  use,  it means a higher cost  of  operation,

which will have to be borne by the rest of the commuters.

This does not seem fair.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1477</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A contactless smartcard is more expensive to produce

but  it  can  be re-used.  The new Standard Ticket  costs

about $5 to make.  To encourage commuters to return  them

for  re-use, a $1 refundable deposit is imposed  on  each

card.   While this has imposed some inconvenience, it  is

not  that cumbersome once commuters become familiar  with

the refund procedure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, our advice is for commuters to use the

stored-value  ez-link cards instead  of  the  single-trip

Standard  Tickets.  They can then enjoy lower  fares  and

transfer  rebates,  and avoid the  need  to  reclaim  the

deposit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we have also asked the operators to

consider  allowing the Standard Tickets to  be  used  for

multiple trips on the rapid transit system (RTS) so as to

reduce  the inconvenience to the small group of commuters

who want to continue using the Standard Tickets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for each ST card that is not returned, SMRT loses

about  $4.  The deposits which are not claimed will  help

to cover these losses.
