<div align="center"><b>DETENTION OF SINGAPORE FISHING BOATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AND CREW IN ANDAMAN ISLANDS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Ho See Beng -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs

whether  he is aware that three Singapore  fishing

boats  and  their crew are being detained  by  the

Indian Government in the Andaman Islands and  what

steps are being taken by the Ministry concerned to

secure  the release of the detained crew  and  the

boats.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ho See Beng.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There being no response -



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan):</b> Question No. 1.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the three

vessels  referred to by the hon.  Member  are  SMF

496, SMF 538 and SMF 500. Of them, the last - that

is,  SMF  500  - was detained once before  by  the

Indian authorities at Port Blair in February  1965

and both the crew and the vessel were subsequently

released  in April 1965. Almost in all cases,  the

fishermen concerned had complained of bad  weather

and  engine  trouble  for  the  difficulties.  The

Foreign  Minister had discussions with the Primary

Production Department to find out the facts of the

case. We had discussions also with the Indian High

Commission  here on the same subject. I  will  now

mention  briefly the case of each of  these  three

fishing boats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SMF 538 was apprehended by the Indian naval

authorities  for intrusion into their  territorial

waters  off the Nicobar Islands. We were  informed

of  this  by  the Indian High Commission  on  15th

June, 1966. On 27th July, 1966, a request was made

to  the Indian High Commission to obtain the early

release  of  the  vessel  and  her  crew.  On  8th

October, 1966, this Ministry was informed  by  the

Indian  High Commission that the crew of SMF  538,

who had since been sentenced to two months'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



imprisonment, would be released on 30th October,  1966,

but   the   vessel  was  confiscated  by   the   Indian

authorities. This is in accordance with the Andaman and

Nicobar Islands Fisheries Regulations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 16th September, 1966, a letter was received from

the  Singapore Marine Product Workers' Union  that  two

more Singapore fishing boats, SMF 496 and SMF 500, with

a  total crew of 16 persons, had been detained  by  the

Indian   authorities  at  Andaman  Islands.   On   18th

November,  1966, the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs  made

representations   to   the   Indian   High   Commission

requesting the High Commission to use its good  offices

to  obtain the early release of the crew and the boats.

A reply is awaited from the Indian authorities.

<div align="center"><b>AMENDMENT TO LABOUR ORDINANCE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues</b> asked the Minister for

Labour   if  he  will  consider  introducing   amending

legislation  to bring within the ambit  of  the  Labour

Ordinance workers who are at present excluded from  the

provisions of the Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Acting Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Minister for Labour (Mr E. W. Barker):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the Government is fully aware  that,

in  the light of changed economic, political and social

conditions in the Republic, a comprehensive  review  of

the  three  employment Ordinances, namely,  the  Labour

Ordinance, the Shop Assistants Employment Ordinance and

the  Clerks Employment Ordinance, with a view to  their

amendment,  is essential. Therefore, the Government  is

actively  considering a number of amendments  to  these

Ordinances.  These  have  been  discussed  by  a   sub-committee  on labour matters. One of them is to  extend

the  scope of the Labour Ordinance as well as the other

two  Ordinances  to bring in workers who  do  not  come

within their ambit at present.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>BAR WAITRESSES UNDER 21</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Labour if

he will consider introducing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



legislation to prohibit girls under  the  age

of 21 from working as bar waitresses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Under the existing law, waitresses under

the  age of 17 years are prohibited from being employed

in  bars.  This  age  ceiling  for  employment  to  bar

waitresses is considered to be adequate in the interest

of  such  workers.  Unless there are  very  strong  and

compelling reasons for the proposal made by the  Member

for  Bras  Basah, the Government does  not  propose  to

raise the age restriction to under 21 years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there

is  a provision in the Labour Ordinance which prohibits

female  factory workers from working after  10  p.m.  I

wonder  whether  the Acting Minister  for  Labour  will

consider applying the same provision to bar waitresses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the present prohibition

of  employment of waitresses under 17 years of  age  is

contained  in the Liquors Licensing Regulations,  1962,

which were made under the Customs Ordinance, 1960. Rule

43 (1) of the Liquors Licensing Regulations reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'No licensee shall employ or permit to be employed in

his licensed premises any waitress -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) who has not reached the age of 17 years, or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) who he knows or has reason to believe is a

prostitute or of bad character.'



<br><br>The  relevant  regulations dealing with  bars  make  no

restriction  as  to the time within  which  such  girls

should work. But if the Member for Bras Basah feels  so

strongly  about the matter, I will certainly look  into

it  and  perhaps  extend the relevant  section  of  the

Labour Ordinance to bar girls.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think all of us

are  aware that when the P.A.P. first came to power  in

1959,  the  former  Minister for Labour  introduced  an

Ordinance relating to bars. At that time, the lights in

the bars were not allowed to be dimmed. But nowadays if

any one of us here goes to bars,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



he  will  find  that they are made to appear  like  the

Black  Hole  of Calcutta. Will the Acting Minister  for

Labour  also consider the enforcement of the  Ordinance

to make proprietors brighten the lights in their bars?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ho, unless you can relate the light

in bars to the age of waitresses, I think your question

goes beyond the bounds of a supplementary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, the Acting Minister for

Labour  has  said  that he will  be  looking  into  the

question of bar waitresses under the age of 21,  but  I

am  afraid he may not be able to do anything. So  I  am

appealing to him, if he cannot restrict girls under the

age of 21 from working in bars, to prohibit the dimming

of lights in bars.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, this is a difficult

question. Some people would prefer to have their drinks

in  rather  dark and cool surroundings.  On  the  other

hand,  the  hon. Member's concern is the protection  of

these young girls. But I wonder what can happen even in

a  dimly-lighted bar? I am only the Acting Minister for

Labour,  and when the Minister returns from  Manila,  I

will submit to him the Member's request.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>UNEMPLOYMENT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Labour (a)

what   is   the  total  number  of  unemployed  persons

registered  with  the  Labour  Department  as  at  30th

November, 1966; (b) since 1st January how many  persons

were  successful  in  gaining  employment  through  the

assistance  of  the Employment Exchange of  the  Labour

Department;  and  (c) what measures  he  will  take  to

reduce   the  number  of  unemployed  persons  in   the

Republic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the total number of

persons  registered  with the Employment  Exchange  for

employment  assistance as at 30th November,  1966,  was

69,556.  The number of persons who have been placed  in

employment  by  the Employment Exchange since  the  1st

January, 1966, to the 30th



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



November,  1966, was 2,318. It must be emphasised  that

the  Employment Exchange is not the only labour  market

in Singapore, as workers are also recruited directly by

employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is fully conscious of the need to find

jobs  for  its  unemployed citizens. It has,  in  fact,

already  taken  a  number of measures to  create  jobs.

Under the industrialisation programme, 10,500 new  jobs

have  already been created in the industrial sector  up

to the end of last year. We expect that 10,000 to about

12,000  new jobs will be created every year  from  1967

onwards  with  the  progress of industrialisation.  The

Regulation  of Employment Act was passed  to  safeguard

employment opportunities of Singapore citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Labour is now considering the

introduction  of  a training scheme in  the  hotel  and

catering  industry  for training  persons  as  waiters,

waitresses  and  chamber-maids, as  there  will  be  an

increased  demand for these categories of employees  as

hotel  expansion to cater for the tourist  industry  is

expected in the near future. The scheme is expected  to

come into operation early next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have a scheme to expand the dockyard in the

Port  Authority  and  we  are at  the  moment  inviting

foreign participation in our dockyard, the main  object

being to get foreign know-how on dockyard expansion  so

that  our dockyard can repair ships much more than  can

be  done  at  present. If the dockyard is expanded,  we

expect  that a few more thousand jobs will  be  created

for those unemployed in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just now the

Acting  Minister for Labour has mentioned only  two  or

three  measures that the Government will be  taking  to

provide  more  job  opportunities  for  our  unemployed

citizens.  I would like to find out whether  there  are

other  measures  to  be taken, so that  the  number  of

unemployed could be reduced to a greater extent  rather

than   introduce  only  some  aspects  of  it,  thereby

knocking  off,  say, 30,000, 50,000 or  60,000  of  the

total unemployed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the main measures by

which we hope to reduce unemployment are those which  I

have mentioned. I can think of no other measures at the

moment.  But the hon. Member should be well aware  that

in  Singapore  we  have  three  big  problems.  One  is

Education,   the   other   Housing,   and   the   third

Unemployment. I think we can say without boasting  that

we have conquered the first two problems, Education and

Housing. We are now tackling the third problem  and  we

hope that in a few years we might be able to reduce the

number of our unemployed.

<div align="center"><b>BAR WAITRESSES</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Singapore citizens and non-citizens from West Malaysia)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Labour if

he  has  information  of  how many  bar  waitresses  in

Singapore are Singapore Citizens, and how many are non-Singapore Citizens from West Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, from figures available

in   the  Ministry  of  Labour,  there  were  964   bar

waitresses employed as on the 31st March, 1966. 338  of

these  are  non-Singapore citizens from West  Malaysia.

This  is  the number that has applied for work  permits

under the Regulation of Employment Act.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware that the

proprietors   of   these  bars  have   not   paid   the

contributions to the Central Provident Fund of some  of

the waitresses who work in their bars?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there must be cases

where  contributions to the Central Provident  Fund  by

bar  waitresses are not paid. But unless the Member can

give  me specific cases to follow up, I am afraid I  am

at a loss to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I myself do not

like  to  make contact with bar waitresses to find  out

whether or not their employers pay C.P.F. for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



waitresses. But if the Acting Minister for Labour would

take  the trouble to send somebody to all the  bars  in

Singapore  and make inquiries, I am sure  he  can  find

out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> We will send you!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will certainly direct

the  General Manager of the Central Provident  Fund  to

send his team of investigators right round our bars  in

Singapore  in  order  to satisfy the  Member  for  Bras

Basah,  in  whose  constituency  I  believe  there  are

several bars!

Malaysian  identity  cards and residing  in  Singapore,

will  be  issued  with new Singapore  Citizen  identity

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore citizens by

a  circular to all Government Members of Parliament  on

the 1st July, 1964, requesting them that if any project

approved  by the Committee was not carried  out  within

three  months,  they  must  bring  the  matter  to   my

attention. And the hon. Member for Sembawang has  never

brought  this  particular road to my attention,  and  I

<div align="center"><b>USE OF LOCALLY-MANUFACTURED MATERIALS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Stipulation in tenders)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues</b> asked the Minister for Law

and National Development if he will consider issuing  a

directive   that   the   use  of   locally-manufactured

materials,  such  as shutterboards,  etc.,  where  such

materials    meet   the   requisite    standards    and

specifications, be stipulated when tenders are let  out

for Government, Housing and Development Board and other

public   projects,  as  a  measure  to  promote   local

industries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, in May 1965 the Government,

with  a view to encouraging local industries, issued  a

directive  to  all  departments  and  statutory  boards

requiring  them  to use locally-manufactured  goods  as

listed  in the Economic Development Circular No.  2  of

1965  dated  7th May, 1965. Among the items covered  in

this list were plywood and veneer, corrugated cardboard

and  corrugated  fibre  board,  and  a  host  of  other

products already being manufactured in Singapore.  This

directive also required that in every contract a clause

should  be included requiring the contractor,  wherever

possible, to give preference to the use of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



locally-manufactured materials in  lieu  of  equivalent

imported materials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy of encouragement of local industries was

further   confirmed   and  strengthened   by   Economic

Development Circular No. 8 of 1965 dated 4th  December,

1965,  which  prescribed that preferential purchase  of

locally-made products should be carried out even though

the  cost  of such products was 5 per cent higher  than

the imported equivalents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the issue of these two circulars, Government

departments and statutory boards, including the Housing

required   standards   and  specifications   of   their

projects.   No   further   directive   is,   therefore,

considered necessary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  is the Minister aware that in 1965 there  was  an

import of 19,149,896 square feet of plain plywood  into

Singapore, costing $2,908,072? And in January to  March

1966  this year there was an import of 3,574,411 square

feet of plain plywood into Singapore, costing $576,700?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member's

supplementary question should be directed at the  Trade

Division  of  the Ministry of Finance under  which  the

Economic  Development Board comes. However, I am  aware

of  the  import figures of plywood quoted by  the  hon.

Member  for  Telok Blangah. I understand these  figures

are  accurate, but I would like to point out  that,  in

addition to imports, Singapore also exports plywood. In

1963 10 million square feet of plywood was exported  at

a  cost of about $1.7 million, and from January to June

this year about 15 million square feet of plain plywood

was exported, costing about $2.2 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to protect local plywood industries, a quota

system was introduced in April 1966 under which only 50

per  cent of the total 1963 imports were allowed to  be

imported.   Imports   from  Malaysia   were,   however,

exempted. On the 29th October this year, this quota was

further restricted to only 5 per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



cent of the 1963 figures. Malaysia was again exempted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that we are reluctant to impose a

ban or quota on plywood coming from Malaysia, as we  do

not  want  to  do  anything  to  hinder  trade  between

Malaysia   and   Singapore.  Plywood   is,   in   fact,

practically a Common Market item.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Tang See Chim</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National Development what plans he has for the  overall

development of the Choa Chu Kang Constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a substantial part of

Choa  Chu  Kang  Constituency has been  set  aside  for

farming and resettlement. The villages in this area are

also earmarked for expansion to provide such facilities

as  schools, community centres and clinics to serve the

rural people. The sites presently occupied by the Royal

Air  Force and the cemetery will remain for some  time,

but a large portion of the swamp land lying between the

proposed Woodlands New Town and Sungei Kranji is  being

reclaimed and developed for sawmills.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> When will the area

proposed  to  be developed for sawmills  be  ready  for

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Again, Mr Speaker, this is a question

for  the  Economic Development Board, as  it  is  their

project. But I am given to understand that the Economic

Development  Board has already reclaimed,  as  a  first

phase  of the development, some 40 to 50 acres of  land

which   are   now  ready  for  allocation   to   timber

industries.  But,  unfortunately,  water  and  electric

power  is  as  yet not available, because their  supply

will  entail  the  laying down of  big  mains.  It  is,

however, expected that these mains will be laid in  the

Kranji  area in about the middle of next year.  In  the

meantime,  the Economic Development Board  is  planning

phase II of the reclamation, and the size, duration and

completion of this phase will depend, of

course,  on  the availability of earth from the  nearby

<div align="center"><b>RESETTLEMENT POLICY IN CHOA CHU KANG</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Fragmentation of farm lands)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Tang See Chim</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National  Development  whether he  is  aware  that  the

resettlement  policy  of  the Housing  and  Development

Board as practised in the Choa Chu Kang Constituency is

leading  to  the fragmentation of the farm lands  there

and is preventing farms from achieving an economic size

whereby  they  can take advantage of modern  scientific

methods of farming and reduce costs of production;  and

what  action  he  proposes  to  take  to  correct   the

situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am fully aware of the

policy  involving the resettlement of farmers not  only

in  Choa  Chu Kang but also in the whole of  Singapore.

The  present  practice  of  restricting  two  acres  of

farmland  to each bona fide farmer who is resettled  is

the  best  the Government can do to distribute  limited

farm  land  equally  amongst the dispossessed  farmers.

Under present conditions in Singapore, the question  of

economic  size of farms does not arise, as the majority

of  our farmers practise mixed farming. Very few farms,

in  fact,  occupy more than five acres of land.  Modern

scientific methods of farming by way of the proper  use

of  fertilizers,  the selection of good  strains,  crop

rotation  and  pest control are the most  sensible  and

economically  feasible  in the  context  of  our  local

farming  conditions. To this end the Primary Production

Department has been helping farmers to achieve improved

yields  through  the  application  of  such  scientific

methods. The effect of fragmentation is, therefore, not

necessarily  detrimental to the farming  community  and

may  have  to be accepted in a situation of acute  land

shortage.

who  were served with notices of removal by Government,

are  not  satisfied with alternative  accommodation  of

allocating alternative farm land to them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, under the resettlement

policy of the Housing and Development Board, only  bona

fide farmers who are to be resettled by Government  are

eligible  for alternative farm land up to a maximum  of

two  acres in the resettlement areas. I understand that

the cases referred to by the hon. Member for Ulu Pandan

were  not genuine farmers and as such were only offered

alternative accommodation in flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  may  I  ask the Minister in charge  how  many

families  are affected in this area, and how many  have

been allocated land, and why?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, of the total number of

families  to  be cleared, it has been established  that

four are genuine farmers, and 25 do not depend entirely

on  farming  for  their livelihood as they  have  other

sources  of  income, like driving taxis or  working  as

labourers.  Under  the resettlement  policy,  these  25

families  are  not considered as genuine farming  cases

and   do  not  qualify  for  land  allocation  in   the

resettlement  areas. However, as I  have  stated,  they

have  been offered alternative accommodation in Housing

and Development Board flats. The four families who rely

solely on farming for their livelihood have been  given

alternative farm land in the various resettlement areas

according to their choice.

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the statement that

there  are many serious accidents at the bend of  Meyer

Road opposite the former Sea View Hotel is not strictly

correct.  In  the past two years, there were  about  10

minor  accidents there, none of which resulted  in  any

serious  injury.  In order to widen or straighten  this

bend  at Meyer Road, expensive acquisition of land will

have  to  be undertaken. Since this road only serves  a

residential  area with a not very heavy traffic,  there

is, therefore, no justification to pursue such a course

of  action. However, to reduce the rate of accidents at

this  spot,  steps are being taken to  impose  a  speed

limit  of  20 miles per hour and it is felt  that  this

measure, together with the existing double white  line,

should produce the desired effects.

<div align="center"><b>ZEBRA CROSSINGS AT ANSON AND TANJONG PAGAR ROADS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister of State

(Prime  Minister's Department) if he will consider  the

establishment of zebra crossings (i) at Anson  Road  in

front  of  the Gan Eng Seng School and (ii) at  Tanjong

Pagar Road between Wallich Street and Tapah Street.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  Anson  Road  is 58 feet wide and  the  volume  of

traffic  is  fairly constant and heavy. However,  there

are  sufficient breaks in the flow of traffic to  allow

pedestrians to cross the road safely, provided care and

caution is taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observation by the Traffic Police has disclosed that

the  number of pedestrians crossing Anson Road in front

of  Gan Eng Seng School is negligible. The majority  of

persons  crossing Anson Road in front of Gan  Eng  Seng

School  are  the  students  of  this  school.  A  zebra

crossing  is  not  recommended at this  place.  If  the

intention of requesting the zebra crossing is  for  the

students,  then  a  school crossing patrolman  is  more

justified  than a zebra crossing. Observation  will  be

kept at this place when the school re-opens in January,

and if it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



found necessary to have a school crossing patrolman at

this place, recommendations will a be submitted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer the second part of the question. Tanjong

Pagar  Road is 41 feet wide and there are several  side

roads.  This  road  caters  for  two-way  traffic,  and

parking  is  permitted on both sides of  the  road.  In

addition,  hawkers have pitched their  stalls  on  both

sides  of  Tanjong  Pagar Road from Wallich  Street  to

Gopeng Street. This leaves only sufficient room for one-lane traffic in either direction. Vehicles will have to

crawl  along this portion of Tanjong Pagar Road.  There

are  sufficient breaks in the flow of traffic to  allow

pedestrians  to  cross safely. There is  no  particular

spot   along   Tanjong  Pagar  Road  where  pedestrians

concentrate to cross the road. Therefore,  if  a  zebra

crossing is provided along Tanjong Pagar Road, it  will

not  be  of  much practical use, since the  pedestrians

will  not take the trouble to walk all the way  to  the

crossing to cross the road, as they can cross  the  the

road  safely from wherever they approach Tanjong  Pagar

Road.  In  view  of  this,  a  zebra  crossing  is  not

recommended.

these  mobile  centres reach the Member's constituency.

There  are  approximately  10,000  consumers  in   this

centre.  It is difficult to find suitable office  space

and also it is uneconomical to open up centres in every

five  or  six  days  after  the  receipt  of  bills  by

fairly  satisfactorily in meeting all  requirements.  I

are  usually  stationed at most sites in the  shade  of

which provide some shelter to the public queueing up to

pay  their bills. So although rain is an inconvenience,

Expenditure for 1966 contained in Paper Cmd. 28 of

1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one head of expenditure in the

respect thereof have been received.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1110 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1110 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this House is asked to approve a sum of $122,000

for  emergency  repairs to the City Hall  building  and

urgent  extensive  repairs to buildings  of  ex-Federal

departments which were left in a state of neglect  when

Singapore was part of Malaysia. When we were a part  of

Malaysia, we paid 40 per cent of our national income to

the  then  Malaysian Central Government. Sir,  until  I

received   the   Third   Supplementary   Estimates   of

Expenditure for 1966, as contained in Paper Cmd. 28  of

1966,  I  was under the impression that the  ex-Federal

departments were well maintained by the then  Malaysian

Government.  They  had been paid 40  per  cent  of  our

national income for the purposes of maintaining all the

departments under their care. Sir, you may  agree  with

me   that   repairs  to  the  buildings  of  ex-Federal

departments  could  have  been  done  by  the   Central

Government  during the Malaysian period.  Some  of  the

expenditure involved should have been taken  from  this

40  per cent, instead of which this House is now  asked

to  approve an additional sum for repairs. In  view  of

this,  could the Minister concerned make an  effort  to

claim  back the cost of the repairs so that this  money

could  be  spent on other projects which could  benefit

our people?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> In my view, the less said about our

differences  with  Malaysia and what should  have  been

done  or should not have been done, the better. Of this

sum  of  $121,419, about $20,616 was spent on the  City

Hall,  $30,835  on  the Criminal and District  Courts,

$19,404  on Changi Prison, $46,702 on the General  Post

Office, and $3,862 on the Telecommunications Station at

Kim  Chuan  Road,  making a total of  $121,419.  I  can

assure  the  Member for Changi that this sum  is  being

paid  by  the  Central  Government.  As  a  result   of

Malaysia,  they owe us some money and we owe them  some

money.  At  the moment, negotiations are  about  to  be

completed on who owes whom and how much, and  this  sum

of  $121,000,  or  nearly $122,000,  falls  within  the

figure  of about $3 million which we are claiming  from

the Malaysian Government and which they have agreed  to

pay under an item of this nature.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sim, in view of that, do you wish

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1110 be reduced

by $10 in respect of subhead 2002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, everybody knows that the Istana during

the colonial days was used as a place for the reception

of a few privileged persons and representatives. During

the  Lim  Yew Hock regime, it was used as the residence

of  a certain Minister or Ministers. But at the present

moment, in the context of independent Singapore, it  is

a place of significance. It is symbolic of our Republic

and  is a very important place. Its status is such that

it  is used to welcome our national guests. It is  also

used  as a place for the representatives of the  people

to  congregate on ceremonial occasions. Therefore,  its

status is quite different from what it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



was  in  the past. From the building in the istana,  we

can  see  that  it could be used in the  past  for  the

purposes  I have mentioned. But it is not suitable  for

present-day  purposes, because it smells  too  much  of

aristocracy. It was designed for the use  of  very  few

people only. But now it is used to welcome our national

guests  and  as a meeting place for the representatives

of  the people on festive or ceremonial occasions.  The

capacity of the hall is very small. Only a small number

of  persons  may  be  housed  therein.  Because  of  my

personal  experience  after  having  attended   several

functions  there, I have the feeling that whenever  the

Government wishes to welcome representatives  from  the

people,  such functions are always held in the  grounds

of  the  Istana, and on rainy days or very windy  days,

the people have to take shelter running with chairs and

cups  and  saucers into the building  itself.  If  this

sight is to be presented to our foreign guests, it will

be  a  very  disappointing one indeed.  This  may  give

people  the  impression that we are  so  poor  that  we

cannot  even  afford  a  proper  place  to  hold   such

functions. From this supplementary estimate, I can  see

that  since  we have spent so much money on decorations

and  repairs,  why  not we spend  some  more  money  in

altering  the Istana itself, to enlarge it so  that  it

can  hold bigger functions and make it more appropriate

for  our purposes, instead of letting it be used  by  a

few  people only, the aristocracy? This is my  view  on

this  item and I hope that the Minister concerned  will

give me a satisfactory reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I came here today

prepared  to argue that the sum of $182,000,  which  we

spent  on repairs and extensions to the Istana  and  on

the  renovation of the old Attorney-General's bungalow,

was well spent. I thought that the Member for Delta was

criticising  the spending of such money.  But  I  agree

with  all  that she has said and, if we can spend  more

money  on the Istana, I will be the first to spend  it.

It  is true that if there is rain on certain days  when

we  have  functions in the grounds, then it  is  rather

congested in the small hall. The only alternative is to

pull down the whole building and put up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



something  even  more  substantial  instead.  From  the

repairs  alone,  Sir, you will see  that  the  building

itself is an extensive building. But whether or not  we

can  afford  to pull it down and put up a new  one,  or

whether   we   can   afford  to  make  very   extensive

alterations to improve it is a question which only  the

Minister for Finance can answer, as he is the  one  who

hands out the money.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Madam Chan, in view of what the

Minister  has  said, do you wish to  proceed  with  the

amendment or withdraw it?



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, if the Minister says that the Finance Minister has

not   got  enough  money  to  renovate  or  repair  the

building,  of  course,  I  will  have  to  withdraw  my

amendment. But I hope that he will consider my request.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I treat the amendment as withdrawn

and  perhaps on another occasion you may deal with  the

Minister for Finance on this topic again?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill introduced by the Minister for Education to

amend   the  original  Ordinance  is  necessary.  Anti-national elements have opposed it in their speeches for

their  own ulterior motives. Today it is necessary  for

us  to understand and appreciate the analysis given  by

the  Minister for Education when moving this Bill,  and

we  can appreciate the necessity for it to be passed by

this  House. My personal opinion is that the amendments

are  not  only necessary but that there should be  more

amendments  to the original Ordinance to make  it  more

water-tight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Nanyang University has been bedevilled

by  various  problems  and difficulties,  such  as  the

engagement of the Chancellor. The problem started  from

the   time  when  a  foreigner  was  recruited  to   be

Chancellor  of the University. Up to now, the  post  of

Chancellor  is  still  vacant.  The  new  Ordinance  on

Nanyang  University  has not been  formulated  and  the

University is still within the purview of the  original

Ordinance. The post of Vice-Chancellor



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



was   not  provided  for  in  the  original  Ordinance.

Therefore,  the present amendment Bill is necessary  to

put right the position. One odd thing is that today  we

forget about the Chancellor whereas we provide for  the

Vice-Chancellor.  In the past, people  knew  about  the

Chancellor but forgot about the Vice-Chancellor. It  is

not  possible to go without a Chancellor,  but  in  the

Ordinance there is no provision for a Chancellor. Since

there  is  no  such  provision in the  Ordinance,  then

nobody  would  dare suggest or say who  should  be  the

Chancellor.  That is something which should  be  looked

into.  If the Minister for Education thinks that it  is

necessary to provide for the post of Chancellor as well

in  the  Ordinance, then I will welcome it  very  much.

This  is  one defect in the present Ordinance  which  I

hope the Minister will look into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the donations to Nanyang

University.  I  have some queries  to  air  also.  When

Nanyang  University was first set up, members  of'  the

public  in all walks of life promised various  sums  as

donations  to the Nanyang University Fund. But  so  far

not  all  the  donations promised have been  collected.

Without further information, it is not possible for the

public  to know who have or who have not paid the  sums

that  they  have  promised to give to Nantah.  This  is

something to which the Government should pay attention.

I  would  like  to know what measures the  authorities

concerned  will take with regard to the  collection  of

such promised donations in order to augment the Nanyang

University  Fund for the maintenance of the running  of

the University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that whenever we talk about Nantah,

it  is inevitable that we also think about the question

of  the recognition of Nanyang University degrees.  The

Government has promised on many occasions that it would

aid  Nanyang  University and it has  allotted  quite  a

great  deal  of money to it. Members of the public  are

still  looking  forward  to  the  day  when  those  who

promised  donations  to Nanyang  University  will  come

forward to fulfil their promises. Many people are  also

awaiting the day when the Government will come



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



out openly and say that Nanyang University degrees will

be  recognised  by  the Government.  According  to  the

present  rate  of  progress of Nanyang University,  the

Government can draw up its plan for the recognition  of

Nanyang  University degrees and members of  the  public

are waiting for this question to be answered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

with  Singapore becoming an independent  Republic,  the

introduction of the Nanyang University (Amendment) Bill

is  necessary.  There are anti-national  elements  with

ulterior motives who make use of this amendment Bill as

a  pretext  to  accuse  the Government  of  wanting  to

destroy  Chinese  education and of  trying  to  further

control  Nanyang University. All these accusations  are

groundless. In fact, the people of Singapore know  what

kind of people they are who say such things. It is very

obvious  from the statement of the Minister of  Defence

that  all these accusations are made by only a minority

who  are  anti-national elements  and  who  have  close

relationship with the anti-national Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the people of Singapore know very

well that the Government is implementing the policy  of

equal  treatment to all the four streams of  education.

It is allotting large sums of money for the development

and promotion of the four streams of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also allotted large sums of money to aid

Nanyang  University, such as the building of a Library.

All  this  goes  to show that the Government  does  not

discriminate  against  Nanyang  University.  In   other

words,  this  shows  that  the Government  is  actually

promoting  Chinese  education by actual  deeds.  It  is

proof  that the Government is looking after the highest

Chinese educational institution --- Nanyang University.

This  is  the  correct attitude taken by a  responsible

Government. This attitude and action on the part of the

Government of Singapore should be supported and praised

by all conscientious people. Therefore, the accusations

by the anti-national elements with ulterior motives are

puerile and sheer nonsense.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the present problem facing Nanyang

University is how to raise its academic standard. After

the passage of the Nanyang University (Amendment) Bill,

which is now before the House, I hope that the Ministry

of  Education will adopt quicker measures to  implement

the  various recommendations of the Nanyang  University

Reform Committee, such as the revision of salaries  and

better  working  conditions of the  teaching  staff  in

order  to enable the teachers, professors and lecturers

to  devote more time and energy to raising the academic

standards  of  the students so that they will  be  well

educated  and be able to contribute to nation-building.

There  is a great difference between the salary  scales

of  the teachers of Nanyang University and those of the

University of Singapore. There is a saying that we want

the  horse to run well, but we also want it not to  eat

any  grass.  How  is it possible? I hope  the  Minister

concerned  will  look into the working  conditions  and

salaries  of the teaching staff whilst he is  promoting

Chinese education.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise   in   full  support  of  the  Nanyang  University

(Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanyang University was first conceived in 1953 and it

started  classes  in  1956. Its  inception  took  place

during  the colonial days under circumstances in  which

many  obstructions were placed by the colonial masters.

Despite  this, people from all walks of life in  Malaya

and    Singapore   donated   generously   towards   the

establishment of Nanyang University. Its main objective

was  to  pave the way for further studies for graduates

of  secondary schools. The second objective, of course,

was to provide a source of teaching staff for secondary

schools.  The third objective was intended to link  the

oriental  and occidental cultures and also  to  develop

Malayan culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since the establishment of Nanyang University,

the  organisation of this University was run by  multi-millionaires  and very rich businessmen. Although  they

were enthusiastic in this pursuit,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



which  is  praiseworthy,  they  lacked  experience   in

running  an  academic  institution.  They  managed  the

University as though they were doing business in a  big

enterprise. Because of this, and owing to various other

factors  which presented a lot of problems  to  Nanyang

University, there was a lack of Chinese scholars coming

forward during the initial stages to give the necessary

assistance and guidance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly and undeniably, Mr Speaker, over the

past  10  years  of  its existence, Nantah  has  indeed

trained  and  fostered great talent in various  fields,

such  as commerce, education, industry, etc. But in  so

far  as  the  organisation  and  structure  of  Nanyang

University,  the economic problem, and the question  of

academic  staff are concerned, Nanyang University  lags

far  behind  any other university. The main  reason  is

that  the  University Council is improperly  organised.

The  second  reason is that there has  been  no  expert

scholar  to  fill  the role of Vice-Chancellor  of  the

University  ever since its inception. Mr Speaker,  you

will  agree  with  me that these two factors  are  very

essential to a university.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the reorganisation of Nanyang University, the

main  powers of the Nanyang University Council  lay  in

the  hands of Mr Tan Lark Sye. He was the Chairman  of

the  University Council. Mr Tan, of course, is a  very

successful  businessman, but I am afraid he knows  next

to nothing about the organisation and administration of

a university and university education. Because of this,

he  had  to rely on some useless, good-for-nothing  and

incompetent  followers of his to run the University  in

so far as administration was concerned. For example, in

the   administrative  structure  of   the   University,

although there existed an Executive Committee which was

the supreme administrative organ of the University, the

University  authorities appointed a Secretary  who  was

directly responsible to Mr Tan Lark Sye. The powers of

the   Secretary  included  the  control  of   financial

affairs, the academic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



staff,   their   recruitment   and   dismissals,    the

administration  and  policy making of  the  University.

Because  of  such wide controls, he became in  practice

the un-crowned emperor of the University. His followers

held key positions in Nanyang University, and they  had

no  regard for the sacred mission of the University  as

such.  Because  of  this, the organisation  of  Nanyang

University  was such that people who were  capable  and

scholarly were reluctant to continue serving under  the

unlearned,  useless and good-for-nothing leadership  of

the  incompetent  followers. And even  those  who  were

quite  prepared to stay on only stayed on for  a  while

because  they  could  not tolerate  these  unreasonable

circumstances.  And those who had come to  serve  would

not  think  of  staying on for long.  Of  course,  this

affected  the  treatment and the pay structure  of  the

academic  staff,  which accounted for the  University's

failure  to  get  internationally reputed  scholars  to

serve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as I have already said, the powers of

the Secretary conflicted with the administration of the

Executive  Committee, and this conflict  brought  about

the  Prescott  Commission Report which  took  away  the

tenure  of office and the powers of the Secretary,  and

the  Chairman of the Executive Committee had to resign.

This,  of course, was very, very comforting to  Nanyang

University and it gave a ray of light, a hopeful  light

indeed,  to  Nanyang University. So at that  time  when

people  from all walks of life were very confident  and

hopeful  about Nanyang University, it failed  again  in

the selection of proper personnel in the administrative

and   executive  fields.  And  so  Nanyang   University

underwent another chaotic state of affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the loose organisation of Nanyang

University  and its incompetent administration  can  be

likened  to  a  crumbling feudalistic  structure  which

provides  good opportunities to pro-Communist elements.

Under  those  circumstances, pro-Communist cadres  took

over Nanyang University; they were well trained people.

Because the Nanyang University Students' Union had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



all along been controlled by the pro-Communist students

who  knew  that the University could be manipulated  at

their  will, these pro-Communist students had  complete

disregard for discipline in the University campus. They

took Nanyang University as a hotbed for the training of

Communist   cadres.  Through  the  Nanyang   University

Students' Union they propagated Communist ideology  and

ideas.  They  even  made use of  the  property  of  the

University  for  illegal activities. In the  University

itself these pro-Communist students had no respect  for

law   and  discipline.  They  beat  up  students   with

different   ideologies,  and  because  of   this,   the

situation was very, very unsatisfactory. They even went

so  far as to coerce the authorities to fine or dismiss

those students who dared to oppose them. These students

wasted  their  time  doing  other  things  instead   of

studying. They failed in their examinations as a matter

of  course,  and  because of that they  threatened  the

lecturers  and teachers, asking them to  pass  them  in

their examinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since 1961 these pro-Communist students

blatantly   linked   themselves  with   the   Communist

organisations outside the campus and formed a  united

front for activities against the nation. They even held

political meetings in the campus of the University  and

carted a lot of workers and other students to break  up

the   peaceful  atmosphere  of  study  in  the  Nanyang

University  campus.  They  brought  politics  into  the

Nanyang  campus.  As a result, Nanyang  University  was

drawn  into  the  political vortex. Nanyang  University

suffered in its reputation. It was unable to live up to

the  hopes  of  people from all walks of life  who  had

confidence  in  its  future.  As  a  result   of   such

shattering  of their confidence, the future of  Nanyang

University   and   the  students  was  also   adversely

affected,  and  members  of  the  public  had  a  wrong

impression of the University. So the innocent  students

suffered.  This  is  a very sad situation  indeed,  Mr

Speaker.  Because of a small group of extreme  elements

who  were pro-Communist and who had no love for Nanyang

University, Nanyang University was used for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



the  evil  political purposes of certain people.  Those

who  really  love Nanyang University are  the  studious

students  and  generous donors from  various  walks  of

life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is the duty of a responsible elected

Government  of  the people to guide the  University  in

healthy  and  good  development.  The  Government   has

therefore   taken  the  initiative  to   help   Nanyang

University  reorganise  in  this  direction.  This   is

necessary.  It  also  helps in the realisation  of  the

hopes  of  those  who have contributed  financially  to

Nanyang  University so that it may not  fall  into  the

hands  and continue to be in the hands of the Communist

cadres.  The  Singapore Government has shouldered  this

great  responsibility. It has already  taken  steps  to

reorganise  Nanyang University. It has got rid  of  the

undesirable  elements. It has given Nanyang  University

the   necessary   financial  support.   It   has   made

adjustments  in the pay and treatment of  the  teaching

staff   and   increase   the  facilities   of   Nanyang

University,  such  as  the  new  library  and   science

equipment.   Within  a  short  period   the   Singapore

Government   has   given  $6.7   million   to   Nanyang

University.  This, of course, is a praise-worthy  move.

It shows that the Government is paying attention to the

development  of  the University. I hope  that  it  will

continue  to do this, and I also hope that people  from

various walks of life will, in the same spirit as  they

have  helped  Nanyang University,  continue  to  donate

generously from now on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the aim of the Nanyang University

(Amendment)  Bill is to strengthen the organisation  of

the  University  Council to implement more  effectively

the  development of the University. The  membership  of

the  Nanyang  University Council includes  people  from

various  strata of society, such as representatives  of

the  Government,  the  University,  and  the  Graduates

Organisation, and well-wishers, some of whom come  from

Malaysia.  An  organisation on this  basis  is  a  very

reasonable   and  enlightened  one,  as   the   Nanyang

University Graduates Fellowship had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>



made it clear in a statement on the 26th of October  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Because of the past and the future necessity of the

Nanyang  University  to  foster more  effectively  high

talents  for the nation, it is necessary to set  up  as

early  as  possible an effective central administrative

organisation   so  that  all  such   matters   as   the

administration, curricula and academic  standards  will

be well taken care of, including the matter relating to

the salaries of the teaching staff. Such changes in the

organisation  of the Council and in certain  names  are

also  in  keeping with this spirit without any harm  to

the University organisation.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to quote one more extract to conclude my

speech, Mr Speaker. From the same Fellowship, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As one of the highest educational institutions of

our  country, the Nanyang University will shoulder  the

responsibilities for the further education and  studies

of Chinese secondary graduates.'



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, as one who has been educated in Chinese, I  am

very  concerned  with the highest of  Chinese  academic

institutions,  namely, Nantah. When Singapore  achieved

independence, members of the public had high  hopes  of

Nanyang  University. Everybody thought that it was  the

highest  expression in higher education. It is  one  of

the  supports of our society. It is everyone's duty  to

give  encouragement  and support to Nanyang  University

because this institution is a very important factor  in

our  society.  They all hope that the  University  will

provide  opportunities and facilities for  students  so

that  in  future  they can put what they  have  already

learnt in the University at the service of society.  In

view  of  this,  the previous University  Council  have

requested  the Minister for Education and  the  Nanyang

University authorities to make a careful study  of  the

Nanyang   University  organisation  and   the   Nanyang

University   Ordinance.  They   have   formulated   and

recommended amendments to the original Ordinance  which

are  now  before the House. We all remember that  under

the    Nanyang   University   Ordinance,   1959,    its

organisation  and composition are not in  keeping  with

the present requirements and time. The section on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



the  composition of this Council very clearly  provides

that  20  University members should be elected  by  the

Council  and at least one of them should be a  resident

of  Singapore,  and  at  least one  each  should  be  a

resident in the various States of Malaya.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Tang See Chim in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>4.02 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this it can be seen that it is necessary to

amend  this  provision in regard to the composition  of

the  Council.  Otherwise  a few anti-national  elements

would  be  able to manipulate the organisation  and  to

infiltrate  into  this Council because  foreigners  can

come  into  it  and manipulate it to  carry  out  their

nefarious subversive activities. On the other hand,  we

should  also  encourage those who really  love  Nanyang

University and Chinese education to be in this Council.

I  therefore  support  the  present  amendment  to  the

composition  of the Council which inter  alia  provides

for  six members to be appointed by the Government,  of

whom  three  may be members resident outside Singapore.

But  I feel that in the composition of the Council they

have  neglected representatives from the working class.

In   other  words,  there  is  no  provision  for  such

representatives on-the Council. The Nanyang  University

Fund  is  made up of donations from people  in  various

walks  of life, including taxi-drivers, trishaw  riders

and  workers. They have shown great enthusiasm in their

support of Chinese education and Nantah. Therefore,  in

the  new  Council in the amendment Bill,  I  feel  that

clause   7  (1)  (e)  should  be  amended  to   include

representatives  from  the  working  class,   say   the

N.T.U.C. With such an amendment, I feel the composition

of  the  Council  will be perfect, more effective,  and

more  representative  and, as a  result,  will  have  a

greater  contribution to make to the future of  Nanyang

University.  The  few undisciplined students  who  hold

their   teachers   in  contempt,  who  have   destroyed

University property and have carried out nefarious acts

of vandalism, will be wiped out, so that those students

who  are really sincere in their further studies in the

course of the next four



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



years  may be enabled to pursue their studies in  peace

and in a better environment.



<br><br>4.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   I   rise  to  support  the  Nanyang   University

(Amendment)  Bill. As what the Parliamentary  Secretary

to the Minister for National Development has said, ever

since   its  inception  Nanyang  University  has   been

bedeviled by defective organisation, bad administration

and ignorance of the University Council. The top policy-making  body,  the  Nanyang  University  Council,  knew

nothing about University education. Therefore,  it  was

possible  for the Communists and pro-Communist students

to  make Nanyang University a breeding-ground for their

cadres and to exploit Nanyang University for their anti-national activities and evil purposes and to bring down

the  name  of the University. In order to make  Nanyang

University a real institution of higher learning -  and

this  is the hope of all who love Nanyang University  -

they  will agree that it is necessary to wipe  out  the

influence  of these pro-Communist elements as  soon  as

possible.   Only  thus  is  it  possible  for   Nanyang

University  to  provide peaceful surroundings  for  the

students to pursue their knowledge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me quote a speech made by the

Minister  for Education on the 20th December last  year

in this House. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Universities represent the apex of the educational

system  in  a  country.  They  have  an  essential  and

influential  role  in  society,  and  the  quality  and

character  of  the  universities  are  bound  to   have

important   impacts  on  the  social,   economic,   and

political life of a country. The role and character  of

universities have varied from place to place  and  from

time   to   time.   Universities   are   simultaneously

conservative    and    progressive    institutions    -

conservative in the sense that they preserve  the  best

in  the  culture of a society, and progressive  in  the

sense  that  they introduce new ideas, new discoveries,

and  new  inventions,  usually for  the  betterment  of

society.    As   institutions   of   higher   learning,

universities throughout the world share certain  common

functions,  but they differ also because they  have  to

cater  for  the  different needs of the  societies  for

which they purport to serve. It is obvious that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



universities  in  homogeneous societies  with  a  well-developed sense of national identity have one important

difference in role to play from universities  in  newly

independent  countries  faced  with  the  problems   of

building  national  identity  out  of  a  heterogeneous

population.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech I have just quoted refers to higher

institutions  of  learning  in  general,  but   Nanyang

University,  ever since its inception,  and  especially

since  the publication of the Wang Gung-Wu Report,  has

again  and again emphasised that the Nanyang University

students  should  be at least bilingual,  if  not  tri-lingual, and be able to fulfil the special needs of the

society they will have to serve. Mr Speaker, Sir,  all

the  past  facts have shown that the Nanyang University

students  have  distinguished  themselves  in  service.

Although  they  have  come from a different  stream  of

education,  their loyalty, their patriotism  and  their

work are no less excellent than those of the others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, ever since the founding of the

University, people from all walks of life in Malaya and

Singapore   have   contributed   generously   to    the

University, especially people from the middle and lower

strata.  But  what  is deplorable  is  that  this  non-Government  University, ever since its  inception,  has

passed  into  the  hands of those evil-doers  who  have

ulterior  designs and these elements,  because  of  the

support  given  by certain rich business tycoons,  were

able  to  carry out their evil deeds in the  University

and  land  it in a mess. The control of the  University

passed  into  the  hands of certain multi-millionaires.

These  people knew nothing about university  education.

They  thought that money is everything. But  they  have

forgotten the old maxim: "To die of hunger is  a  small

matter,  but  to  succumb to  evil  forces  is  a  real

disgrace."  Many  people  with academic  qualifications

were  hesitant in coming to the University.  Those  who

did  come  very  soon left. What is absurd  is  that  a

general meeting - they have a membership of 1,500  -had

not been convened even once.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the reason why I have quoted so many

examples  is  that I wish to show that because  of  the

incompetence of the people in charge of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



the  University, it was possible for the pro-Communists

to  infiltrate  into the University. By their  actions,

they brought down the name of the University and landed

it  into difficulties. Teachers, administrators and the

leadership  were surrounded by pro-Communist  elements.

They  made  use  of  the  University  campus  as  their

training  ground  to  carry out their  evil  deeds  and

nefarious  designs. These people profess  to  love  the

University,  but,  in  actual  fact,  they  have   been

indulging  in acts of vandalism by damaging  University

property  and  burning down University buildings,  thus

making  it necessary for the University authorities  to

spend  a  large sum of money on repairing the building.

Is  this the behaviour of one who loves the University?

This  only  worsens  the  financial  position  of   the

University.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, ever since its inception in 1953,

many  people  have made generous contributions  to  the

University,  ranging  from  hundreds  of  thousands  to

millions of dollars. But the actual amount collected is

only $12 million. If this sum is compared to the amount

contributed by the Government, it is very insignificant

indeed. The Government has contributed $6.7 million  in

a  short  period.  The  people  donated  money  to  the

University  because they love it and pay a high  regard

to  the  sacred task of education. It was  because  the

Council  members  did not set a good example  that  the

collection  of  money  was  made  very  difficult.  For

example,  Mr Tan Lark Sye, who promised to  donate  $5

million,  actually  paid  up  only  $2.5  million.  The

Hokkien  Huay Kuan promised to donate $600,000 for  the

erection  of  an  auditorium,  but  the  actual  amount

collected was only $200,000. The Nanyang Siang Pau  Co.

Ltd, promised  to donate $1 million,  but  the  actual

amount  collected was only $94,000. Another reason  was

that the University was in a topsy-turvy condition  and

control  of it had passed into the hands of  the  anti-national  elements, and the future  of  Nantah  was  in

danger. Therefore, these people did not pay up the full

amount.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanyang University is a non-government institution.

Apart  from  the  grant by the Government,  it  has  to

receive support from the public. Ever since the  wiping

out   of   the  pro-Communist  anti-national  elements,

Nanyang  University has been put on a  proper  footing,

especially in view of this amending Bill. Therefore,  I

appeal  to  those who love education and the University

to  keep  their  word  and pay up all  that  they  have

promised  to  donate. This will be  beneficial  to  the

development  of  the  University  and  to  society   in

general. To all people from all walks of life,  I  make

this  appeal - that they should continue their  support

for  Nanyang University. Although the University is now

receiving  aid from Government, it does not  mean  that

the  people  should stop giving aid to it.  With  ample

finance it can be managed in a better way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the pro-Communist elements thought

that  as the University was founded by people from  all

parts of Malaysia, people outside Singapore should have

more  say and control in the running of the University.

This   is   absurd.  Because  of  different   political

situations,  the citizens in Singapore  should  have  a

bigger   say  and  control  in  the  running   of   the

University. This is only proper and is in keeping  with

our  national interest. But, at the same time, we  will

allow  Malaysian  citizens to play  their  part  within

certain limits. This is provided in the amendment which

allows   for  three  Council  members  from   Malaysian

territory.  We  also welcome people  outside  Singapore

giving   aid  and  constructive  suggestions   to   the

University  and their continued support. The  Singapore

Government and people are now subsidising about  $1,300

for  every outside student per year. In spite of  that,

the  Government  still welcomes genuine  students  from

abroad  to  study here. At the same time,  I  hope  the

Malaysian   Government   will  discard   their   narrow

racialist   ideology.   They  should   absorb   Nanyang

graduates into their Government departments just as the

Singapore  Government is doing. If they  can  do  this,

then  we can say that the Malaysian Government  is  not

discriminating  against  Chinese  education.  I   fully

support this amendment Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Sir,

I  think it is hardly necessary for me to argue further

the  case for the amendment Bill. The support given  to

it  by  Members  of this House, particularly  from  the

former   graduates  of  Nanyang  University,  is   most

welcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government realise that the present amendments to

the  Nanyang University Ordinance are inadequate. There

are,  in  fact,  many other sections of  the  Ordinance

requiring   suitable   amendments   to   make   Nanyang

University  and its Council function more  efficiently.

However,  the present amendments are what the  existing

Council  is  prepared  to accept to  avoid  unnecessary

suspicion from certain sections of the public who might

still  be  fearful that the character of the University

might  be altered. However, the Government shall always

keep  in touch with the future Council to ensure  that,

should  further amendments be necessary, these will  be

brought  up  for  consideration in this  House  at  the

appropriate time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Merah has made certain

references  to the composition of the Council  and  the

difficulty in calling for a general meeting of  members

to  elect from amongst themselves three members to  the

Council. These difficulties have been envisaged, but  I

am  sure the Council will be able to sort them  out  by

introducing  new regulations, if necessary,  to  govern

the conduct and procedure of such general meetings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Merah has also mentioned that we

have  been  too concerned with the status of the  Vice-Chancellor  in  this  present  amendment  Bill  to  the

neglect of the Chancellor. However, section 12  (1)  of

the  existing  Ordinance has already provided  for  the

Chairman  of  the  Council  to  be  the  head  of   the

University, and as such the provision for the  post  of

Chancellor is unnecessary at this stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also raised the question of

contributions  from  members of  the  public  who  have

pledged various sums at various times in the course  of

the history of the University. If he will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



table a question on this subject in this House, I shall

attempt to get the relevant information for him.  Right

at this moment I have no such information at hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am as anxious as the Member that the question of

recognition  of  Nanyang University degrees  should  be

resolved as soon as possible. In fact, last year I  did

mention  that the Government would consider recognising

Nanyang University degrees in about three years'  time.

I  think  the  more important question is  whether  the

University  will be given the opportunity to reorganise

without  being interrupted by pro-Communist  agitation,

and  whether  the  quality of the  staff  can  also  be

improved.  In my view, if Nanyang University  could  be

reorganised  without  any  interruption  and  both  the

quality of the staff and the students could be improved

- and I think it could, which would lead to the raising

of  the  academic  standard  -  then  the  question  of

recognition  could  come  in a  matter  of  two  years,

perhaps three.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has brought up the question

of  salaries  for  the  staff  of  Nanyang  University.

Perhaps he is not aware that since 1966 we have  raised

the  salaries of the staff of Nanyang University to the

same  level  as  that obtaining in  the  University  of

Singapore.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>4.28 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since then the University of Singapore has

had another revision to their salaries to bring them in

line  with  the  salary  scales now  obtaining  in  the

University  of Malaya. Therefore, the present  salaries

of  the  Nanyang University staff are not as attractive

as those of the University of Singapore. However, these

disparities  can be put right as soon as  the  time  is

appropriate. What Nanyang University lacks, of  course,

is a gratuity scheme for its staff, and on this subject

I  think Government is always prepared to consider  any

suitable suggestions from Nanyang University.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has mentioned that there is

no provision for representation from the workers on the

University  Council. Although no specific provision  is

made   for   a   representative  from   the   N.T.U.C.,

nevertheless, the amendment to section 19 (1) (e)  does

not  preclude  nomination of a  representative  of  the

N.T.U.C. if  he  is noted for his interest  in  higher

education for workers. As I have mentioned earlier, the

present amendments are not comprehensive enough for the

efficient  working of the University, but I can  assure

Members  of  this House that, as soon as  the  time  is

opportune and further amendments are necessary, I shall

bring up the subject again in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

<br><br>4.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law of distribution on intestacy applicable in

Singapore  at  present  for  non-Muslims  follows   the

provisions  of  the  English law as  contained  in  the

Statute  of  Distributions - a 17th century statute  in

England  which has, in fact, been repealed  there.  The

rules relating to the distribution of the estate  of  a

deceased  person  on  intestacy as  contained  in  that

statute  are  outmoded, especially  in  regard  to  the

shares of the respective spouses. Under these rules, if

a  woman dies intestate leaving a husband, the whole of

her  estate  goes to him. But if a man  dies  intestate

leaving a widow and issue, the widow is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



entitled to one-third of the estate. And if he leaves a

widow and no issue, she is entitled to one-half of  the

estate. The Bill seeks to amend the existing law so  as

to give equal rights to the spouses. When a person dies

intestate,  his  property will be  distributed  in  the

manner set out in clause 7 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the intestate dies leaving a surviving spouse but

no  issue or parent, the spouse will be entitled to the

whole of the estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the rights of a surviving spouse and

issue,  the spouse will be entitled to one-half of  the

estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the rights of a surviving spouse, the

estate  of  an  intestate  who  leaves  issue  will  be

distributed  in  equal  portions  to  and  amongst  the

children  of  such  person  dying  intestate  and  such

persons as legally represent such children, in case any

of the said children be dead and buried.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no descendants, the parent or parents of

the  intestate will take the estate, in equal  portions

if  there are two parents, subject to the rights of the

surviving spouse, if any.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are neither surviving spouse, descendants,

nor  parents, the brothers and sisters and children  of

deceased  brothers  or sisters of  the  intestate  will

share the estate in equal portions and the children  of

any deceased brother or sister shall take according  to

their  stocks  the  share which he or  she  would  have

taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no surviving spouse, descendants,

parents, brothers and sisters but grandparents  of  the

intestate, the grandparents will take the whole of  the

estate in equal portions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no surviving spouse, descendants,

parents,  brothers  and sisters or  their  children  or

grandparents but uncles and aunts of the intestate, the

uncles  and aunts will take the whole of the estate  in

equal portions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In default of such distribution, the Government will

be entitled to the whole of the estate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a person so dying intestate is permitted by his

personal law a plurality of wives and leaves more  than

one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



wife,  such  wives  will share among them  equally  the

share  which the wife of the intestate would have  been

entitled  to  had  such intestate left  only  one  wife

surviving him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of distribution under the Bill, it is

provided  that  there  shall be no distinction  between

those related to the deceased person through his father

and  those related through his mother nor between those

who  are related to him by full blood and those who are

related by half-blood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A "child" is defined as a legitimate child and

includes any child adopted or registered as such  under

any written law for the time being in force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill has been referred to the

Singapore  Bar Committee who have indicated  that  they

support  its  provisions. It is proposed to  refer  the

Bill  to  a Select Committee so that full consideration

can be given to its provisions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill makes certain consequential amendments

arising  out  of  the repeal of the Trustees  Ordinance

(Chapter 34) and the opportunity has also been taken



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



to  make  a  number of amendments considered  desirable

from  the  accounting point of view. It is proposed  to

delete the provisions requiring the Minister to arrange

from  time  to time the fees chargeable by  the  Public

Trustee so as to produce an annual amount sufficient to

discharge  the salaries and expenses of the  office  of

the  Public  Trustee.  The Public  Trustee  administers

mostly small estates. The fees chargeable by the Public

Trustee   are  already  much  higher  than   the   fees

chargeable  in  England and New Zealand by  the  Public

Trustees  there.  As  it is unlikely  that  the  Public

Trustee  fees  will  be increased, it  is  proposed  to

delete  the provisions contained in subsection  (4)  of

section 18 of the Public Trustee Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Trustee Ordinance contains no provisions

relating  to  the disposal of unclaimed  funds  in  the

hands  of  the  Public  Trustee.  The  Bill  seeks   to

introduce  provisions whereby unclaimed funds remaining

in the hands of the Public Trustee at the conclusion of

the  administration of the estate  of  a  person  dying

testate or intestate shall be credited to the Unclaimed

Estates Account to be kept there for seven years, after

which  such  funds, if they remain unclaimed,  will  be

paid into the Consolidated Fund.

<br><br>

<div align="center"><b>RESETTLEMENT OF FARMERS OCCUPYING STATE LANDS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore

Livestock  Farmers' Association wrote  to  me  on  25th

November,  1966,  requesting me to  bring  before  this

House the grievances of their members in respect of the

resettlement  of livestock farmers who  were  occupying

State  land  required  for  development  purposes.  The

request  of the Association has been made too late  for

me  to raise the matter during Question Time, and  that

is the reason for my present adjournment speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Association has also attached to its letter to me

a copy of the letter dated 2nd November, 1966, which it

has  previously  sent to the Director  of  the  Primary

Production Department and to the Minister for  Law  and

National  Development. Whatever may be the  reason  for

the  Association  to request my service  to  place  its

grievances before this House only shortly after it  has

made  representation  to  the Department  and  Ministry

responsible for the resettlement of the farmers,  I  am

in  no position to comment. But the three points raised

by the Association in its letter relate to an important

and  interesting  aspect of any public  administration,

that  is, the particular application or execution of  a

general  policy of the Government by the department  or

statutory body charged with the administration of  such

policy. For this reason alone, if not for any other,  I

consider  it  most  appropriate that  these  grievances

should be aired before this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point raised by the Association in the

letter  mentioned earlier is that many of  its  farmers

have been adversely affected by the Government's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



industrial and housing projects. But before any  Member

of  the House jumps to any hasty conclusion, let me add

that the Association is not grumbling about the farmers

literally  standing in the way of progress. It  appears

that  these farmers did not own the land on which  they

have  been working. Such land was invariably State land

which  they  have been allowed to farm under  Temporary

Occupation Licences. Under the terms of these Temporary

Occupation Licences, or T.O.L.s, as they are  popularly

known,  for which nominal fees are payable, the farmers

have to vacate possession of the land on demand by  the

Government.  Because of the rapid pace of  Government's

industrial  and housing development, those farmers  who

have  been unfortunate enough to occupy State  land  in

certain  areas  which  are marked out  for  development

purposes, have to vacate possession of their respective

pieces  of  land  on  which they may  have  worked  for

several  years and start all over again on fresh  plots

of  land.  In  this  respect, I must  congratulate  the

Government  on  its  human  gesture  in  providing   an

alternative site to the farmers so requested to  vacate

possession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snag is that on the previous sites most of these

farmers have been occupying areas of several acres. But

on  resettlement they are only allocated areas  of  not

more than two acres. Some farmers may even be allocated

pocket-sized plots of land. It may seem strange to  the

Members  of this House that, instead of being  grateful

for  being  allocated any land at all, the farmers  are

now  carping about the plots of land allocated to them.

But  it  must be appreciated by this House  that  these

farmers  are  mostly  breeders  of  poultry  and  pigs,

particularly of the foreign or cross-bred variety. Such

poultry  and  pigs are less hardy than  the pure  local

strain. Therefore, for the successful rearing  of  the

foreign  or  cross-bred variety of poultry,  a  certain

minimum  standard of hygienic practices and precautions

must  be  adopted.  The  size  of  the  plots  of  land

allocated  to farmers on resettlement is  a  matter  of

paramount   importance   to  the   farmers,   because,

generally  speaking, the bigger the size the easier  it

is to observe the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



standards  of  hygiene in respect of  the  poultry  and

pigs.  The  result  is  that, because  of  the  rigidly

enforced maximum of two acres of land to be allotted to

each   resettled  farmer,  who  might  have  previously

occupied five or six acres, the farmers on resettlement

have  no  choice but to cram their flocks of fowls  and

herds of pigs into the limited space allocated to them.

It  does  not require much imagination to realise  that

cramming  these animals or livestock into a  much  more

confined  space  than advisable would have  an  adverse

effect on the health of the animals. This in turn would

affect  the volume of production of eggs and  meat  for

the market, whether domestic or foreign.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This effect of a rigid application of the policy

restricting each resettled farmer to a maximum  of  two

acres,  I think, should give rise to grave and  serious

concern  not  only to the Government but  also  to  all

persons who have the interest of Singapore at heart. We

at present are engaged in an all-out effort to increase

the level of productivity. The local rearing of poultry

and  pigs should play a significant and important  role

in  this  effort to increase productivity  and  output.

Instead  of taking a flexible attitude to consider  the

farmers'  plight,  our Government policy  is  so  rigid

where it does not warrant rigidity. For example, in the

Ministry  of  Finance,  they are  so  very  liberal  in

issuing bar licences - but here they are so rigid.  The

bigger  the  volume of our local production of  poultry

and  pigs  and  associated  products,  the  lesser  the

dependence  of  Singapore on other countries  for  such

commodities. One obvious effect of such minimisation in

our  import of poultry and pigs would mean a saving  in

our foreign exchange reserves, a saving which is not to

be  sneezed  at  in the present context of  Singapore's

political and economic circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the Association has requested me to bring to the

attention  of the Members of this House is whether  the

Government  can reconsider this policy of allocating  a

maximum   of   only  two  acres  per  farmer   on   the

resettlement of such farmers. I am given to  understand

that this policy of the Government is well



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



founded  on  the fact that land is a scarcity  item  in

Singapore  and that there is a limit to the  amount  of

State  land  which  the Government can  set  aside  for

farming   purposes.   On  the  surface,   the   present

Government policy appears to be reasonable and  logical

in  the circumstances. I wish to assure you Members  of

this House that I have no doubt in that respect. But  I

am inclined to wonder whether this present policy which

has  been rigidly applied or enforced by the department

or statutory body concerned with the allocation of land

to  resettled farmers can be rendered more flexible  in

its  application. This would become more evident in the

course  of  the next point which I intend to  bring  to

your attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point of the Association's grievances is

that,  because some farmers on resettlement  find  that

the  land  allocated to them is insufficient for  their

needs, they are forced to obtain an extra plot of  land

from  other  farmers who do not require all  the  whole

pieces of land allocated to them. The complaint of  the

Association is that those farmers who managed to obtain

additional plots of land in this manner have  found  to

their astonishment that, after the transfer of land has

been arranged and completed, they have to pay T.O.L. or

Temporary  Occupation Licence fees for such  additional

plots  of land many times higher than the usual  T.O.L.

fees   charged  for  those  plots  of  land  originally

allocated to them. In normal circumstances, the  T.O.L.

fee  per acre of agricultural State land is either  $15

or  $30  per  year, depending on the situation  of  the

land. But when the farmers acquire additional plots  of

land  from  other farmers, the T.O.L. fee for  land  so

acquired  ranges between $72 and $160 per acre  in  the

case  of  land where the normal T.O.L. fee is  $15  per

acre  per year and can be as high as $204 per acre  for

land  which is normally $30 per acre. While the  amount

of  increase  may  not  appear very  great  to  us,  it

represents a huge sum to the farmers. The difference of

$100 in the T.O.L. fees payable by the farmers per acre

may  mean a difference between loss and profit  to  the

farmers  who  already  have  other  heavy  expenses  to

shoulder.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already mentioned to you, I am aware of

this Government policy of restricting the allocation of

land  to resettled farmers up to a maximum of two acres

per  farmer  because of the sheer physical scarcity  of

land in Singapore. I also understand that it is also  a

necessary  corollary of such policy for the  Government

to  adopt  deterrent measures against farmers occupying

plots  of  land  bigger  than  two  acres  by  charging

exorbitant premiums or high T.O.L. fees to farmers  who

want  to acquire additional plots of land. But the fact

remains  that  farmers  who  find  the  plots  of  land

allocated to them insufficient for their needs are able

to  acquire additional land from other farmers who  are

allocated  plots  of  land in excess  of  their  actual

requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand to be corrected, Sir, if I say that the

present  policy of allocating land to resettled farmers

is on the basis of the mere fact of occupation of State

land required for development purposes. The departments

or  authorities concerned with the resettlement of such

farmers  do not seem to have considered the possibility

that  a  policy  framed on such  a  basis  may  not  be

equitable  and,  worse  still, may  lead  to  a  highly

undesirable  situation as that where resettled  farmers

are  allocated plots of land when they had no intention

at  all  of carrying on their former farming occupation

or on so extensive a scale as previously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this way, in the face of the much often repeated

affirmation that it is the policy not to allocate  more

than  two acres of land to resettle farmers because  of

the   physical  scarcity  of  land  in  Singapore   for

agricultural  purposes  or otherwise,  a  farmer  could

still be allocated land on resettlement when he has  no

wish  to  carry  on  farming. It  is  because  of  this

administrative  inflexibility in the application  of  a

sensible  and logical policy of the Government  that  a

ridiculous situation has developed whereby farmers, who

are  genuinely interested in farming and who found that

the plots of land allocated to them on resettlement are

insufficient  for their needs, must acquire  additional

plots of land from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



other persons who have been allocated plots of land  in

excess of their requirements or who have no longer  any

intention of carrying on farming after resettlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By making it prohibitive for the genuine and hard-working farmers to acquire additional plots of land,

the  departments  or  authorities responsible  for  the

administration of such Government policy are, in  fact,

obstructing Government policy. If land is as scarce  in

Singapore   as   it  is  maintained  by  the   relevant

department  or statutory body, how is it possible  that

persons  who  are no longer interested in  farming  are

allocated plots of valuable agricultural land on  their

resettlement? To me the remedy seems to lie in devising

a  proper system for the allocation of land to  persons

who  are interested in carrying on farming, and not  in

the  rigid and inflexible adherence to a policy of  not

allocating more than two acres of land to any resettled

farmers,  irrespective  of  the  bona  fides  of  their

intention or requirement after resettlement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point which the Association has requested me

to  raise  is  a  general grievance  of  all  livestock

farmers   whether  resettled  or  otherwise.  But   the

grievance  has been rendered acute in relation  to  the

resettlement   of   farmers  because   of   the   rigid

application  of  the  policy of  restricting  resettled

farmers to a maximum of two acres each.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that previously farmers were required to

pay only $3 to $5 as planning fees for each unit of pig

sty and chicken shed built according to plans submitted

to  and approved by the relevant Government department.

Now  it  seems that this rate of fee for each unit  has

been  increased to $12. The members of the  Association

are  understandably  upset by  this  increase  in  fee.

Because  of  the  limitation  of  land  space  or   the

irregularity of the contour and layout of the allocated

land,  or  land  acquired  otherwise  as  a  result  of

resettlement  and rigid application of policy  and  for

hygienic  reasons, the farmers have to build many  more

units of pig sties and chicken sheds than necessary  if

they  have not been so rigidly restricted in land  area

on resettlement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand it, this fee is required for

administrative purposes and not as a source of  revenue

for the Government. The imposition of such planning fee

is   to  ensure  that  proper  planning  permission  is

obtained by farmers before they construct any  pig  sty

or  chicken  shed.  It is difficult to  understand  why

there is a necessity to increase this planning fee. The

increase  represents an increase of more than  100  per

cent  on the old rate which, as I say, may not be  much

to you and me but it means a lot to the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As farmers are playing a vital role in Singapore's

struggle for survival, I think it is only reasonable to

expect  that the Government policy is framed or applied

in such a way that livestock farmers are encouraged and

induced  to increase their productivity and output  and

not  in such a way as to demoralise them or force  them

out  of production completely. In the end, it is we the

people  of  Singapore who have to pay the price  for  a

policy  rigidly  or  unimaginatively  applied  by   the

department or statutory authority responsible  for  the

administration of such policy.



<br><br>5.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

ours is a country which practises democratic socialism.

Therefore,  the Government is very concerned  with  the

welfare  of  the  farmers. It has set  up  the  Primary

Production  Department in order  to  help  the  farmers

carry out their farming activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Bras Basah has aired the

grievances  of  those farmers who have been  resettled,

that  they  have been given only two acres of  land  on

resettlement.  This  will cause  some  difficulties  to

them.  I realise that our Government is faced with  the

problem  of land scarcity. However, I am of the opinion

that  although the available land for farming  is  very

limited, I still think we should give better protection

and  consideration  to  those  farmers  who  have  been

affected  by  our  development  programmes,   as   they

constitute  a  very great proportion of our  population

and have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



contributed a lot to the economic welfare of our State.

They have contributed about $100 million worth of goods

to  our  economy. They have produced enough vegetables,

eggs  and  other farming products for export  to  other

countries,  thus earning a lot of foreign exchange  for

our  country.  Therefore, I believe that  the  Minister

concerned  will agree with me when I say  that  if  the

Government  allots  a  bigger  piece  of  land  to  the

affected  farmers  so  as to facilitate  their  farming

activities in order to increase their productivity, the

farmers will bring greater prosperity to our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as to how to solve the problem of

land scarcity, I am of the opinion that the departments

concerned  should have an overall and  better  plan  in

allocating  land and developing land in the surrounding

islands  for  farming purposes, as  enunciated  by  our

Prime  Minister. The land in these surrounding  islands

can  be  used  for rearing fishes, ducks  and  for  the

cultivation  of vegetables. I appreciate that  we  will

have to invest a lot of money to develop these islands,

but in the long-term interest this is worth doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is the exorbitant T.O.L. fees the

farmers  have  to pay for their land and  the  planning

fees.   In   order  to  alleviate  their  burden,   the

department concerned should give consideration to their

request.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further point is about those who are not bona fide

farmers. These people have some land near their  houses

and they carry out poultry and other farming activities

as  a  side-line in order to supplement  their  income.

They are also affected by the resettlement schemes, but

the  Government should give only accommodation but  not

any  land to them. Therefore, I would like the Minister

concerned  to  carry out his policy in a  more  flexible

way.  These  not bona fide farmers should  be  given  a

small piece of land in order that they can continue  to

earn   their  customary  income  from  their  side-line

activities so as not to suffer any hardship  when  they

are resettled elsewhere.

<br><br>5.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of

resettlement  not  only affects our farming  population

but  also  affects  our economy as a whole.  Government

appears, however, not to have given sufficient  thought

to  its  farming  policy. It appears to be  preoccupied

with    industrialisation.   Whilst   industrialisation

rightly  demands  our  urgent  attention,  our  farming

policy   should   not   be  neglected.   Unfortunately,

neglected  it appears to be. It is, I should  say,  the

Cinderella  in our Government policy. In acquiring  the

Jurong  site  for industrial development, for  example,

farmers  from that area were resettled in the Choa  Chu

Kang Constituency.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> They

will vote for you!



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> They were each allocated a plot of

land  of  not more than two acres irrespective  of  how

much  land they had been cultivating before,  and  also

without   considering   their   particular   type    of

cultivation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make way for the resettlement of farmers from

Jurong, land in the Choa Chu Kang area was acquired and

farmers  who  were  farming on  a  large  scale  before

suddenly   found  that  they  had  to   squeeze   their

operations  into a much smaller plot of  land.  As  the

Member  for  Bras Basah has just said,  most  of  these

lands were held on T.O.L.s. All the Government did  was

to  revoke the T.O.L.s, take back the land and re-allot

to  these resettled farmers a plot of not more than two

acres.  Let  me give the House an example to illustrate

my   point.  In  my  constituency,  there  was  an  old

established poultry farming family rearing chickens  on

a  very  large scale on ten acres of land.  The  annual

turnover  was  in  the region of $1 million,  and  they

employed  a  score or so of farmhands. Because  of  the

Government's resettlement policy, the land was acquired

by the Government - in this case the T.O.L. was revoked

-  and  this family was re-allotted a two-acre plot  of

land. How can the Government expect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



this particular farming operation that was carried  out

on  a  ten-acre plot of land before to be squeezed  now

into a two-acre plot?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Flatted farming.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Flatted farming, is it?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is being done in England.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Yes, that could be so, but,

unfortunately, in this particular case, the result  was

that some farmhands had to be dismissed, adding to  the

unemployment  problem,  and the  operation  had  to  be

scaled  down,  leading  to a decline  in  the  national

output.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that every farmer must be given as

much  land as he can farm, but there must be a  certain

degree  of  flexibility  in the administration  of  the

present  Government policy of resettlement. As  we  all

know,  farming  at the present stage of development  in

Singapore  is labour intensive. It is one of  the  ways

which could be explored to create job opportunities.  I

submit,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that  properly  developed

farming   can   give   tremendous   opportunities   for

employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present policy of the Government, however, of

allotting  a plot of two acres to farmers, irrespective

of   their   special  circumstances,  is  against   the

development  of  the farming industry as  a  whole.  It

would create a lot of subsistence farmers, but it would

not  help in the development of farming in the  context

of the national economy as a whole.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, unfortunately, has not many acres of farm

land  and  we  must  make the  best  use  of  the  land

available to us for farming. Unfortunately, the present

Government's  farming policy appears to  be  piecemeal,

and  I urge the Minister concerned to spare a few  more

moments of thought on this particular subject. It  will

do  our farmers and our economy as a whole a great deal

of  good  if  he  can  think of a  more  coherent,  and

consistent policy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>5.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

several Members of this House have spoken about the

farming population and their problems. As a Member from

a rural constituency, I think it is also my duty to air

my views on the same problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I was recently elected, I have, within a

period  of  slightly more than one  month,  visited  my

constituency  now and then in order to  understand  the

problems  affecting the livelihood of the  farmers  and

villagers. During these visits, I have discovered  that

the  topics  dealt  with by the  Members  are  actually

realistic  problems facing the farming population.  The

Member for Choa Chu Kang has already mentioned that our

Government   is   paying   too   much   attention    to

industrialisation and neglecting the problems affecting

the livelihood of farmers in Singapore. As a result  of

such  neglect,  the  farmers in  the  rural  areas  are

finding  it difficult to earn a livelihood without  the

necessary care and attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has also pointed out that

the  farmers in Singapore play an important role in the

economy of our nation, because they produce about  $100

million  worth  of farm produce per year.  In  view  of

these facts, I would urge the Minister concerned to pay

more  attention  and  care to  the  livelihood  of  the

farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of allocation of arable land to

farmers  affected  by resettlement, I fully  appreciate

that  our  land area is very limited - it is about  225

square miles. But we can think of some other places  to

provide our farmers with more arable land. According to

the  present  resettlement policy with  regard  to  the

allocation  of  farm land, a maximum of  two  acres  is

allowed  to each farming household. Members  one  after

another  have already pointed out that the  maximum  of

two acres is, in fact, not sufficient for the necessary

farming  activities. Although in relation to the  total

area of our island this allocation is quite reasonable,

consideration must be given to deserving cases of bona

fide farmers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



so  that no land is given to undeserving cases, thereby

giving  rise  to  the situation, as  mentioned  by  the

Member for Bras Basah, where people who are not totally

dependent  on  farming for their livelihood  have  been

allotted  land, whereas those dependent on farming  for

their  livelihood  have  been allotted  land  which  is

insufficient for them, so that they have  to  get  some

land  from those who do not need so much land. In  this

situation, the people who get land from others have  to

pay higher T.O.L. fees and this, of course, adds to the

burden of the farmers. In my own constituency, there is

a  similar  example.  I  have a  farmer  who  has  been

resettled  at  Choa Chu Kang and his T.O.L. fees  have

been  increased from $7 to $408 per year.  This  is  an

increase  of many times the original amount, which  is,

of  course,  a great burden on the farmer concerned.  I

hope  the  Minister will give serious consideration  to

the problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes without saying that we must develop and we

cannot   remain  in  a  backward  state.  This   is   a

proposition  which everybody must accept. I  think  the

farmers  affected by resettlement appreciate  it.  They

agree with the Government's development policy. If they

get  reasonable compensation or allocation of land  and

if  Government officers in implementing the policy  are

reasonable  and fair, then they will not have  much  to

complain  about.  But  sometimes, in  implementing  the

policy of the Government, some Government officials are

too  rigid and inflexible. As a result, they are unable

to  handle  a  situation without some  imagination  and

flexibility.  Some farmers in the process  of  removing

have  to attend to their farming activities at the same

time,  and  they do not have the time to  change  their

addresses at the police station because they are busily

engaged.  As a result of resettlement, it is  sometimes

discovered that the addresses in the identity cards  of

some farmers are different from those at which they are

living. Because of this, they are not allotted land  in

the  resettlement area. In some other cases, the houses

of  the farmers are without house numbers. They use the

addresses of some provision



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



shops in a market place and, because of this, they

do  not get farm land. In some other circumstances, the

names  of  farmers appearing in identity cards  do  not

completely  tally  with their names appearing  in  some

other Government documents. In cases where the transfer

of   the   T.O.L. has  not  been  effected  from   the

grandfather  or the father to the farmer himself,  then

this person again will not be considered for allocation

of farm land in the resettlement area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these people are, in fact, dependent upon farming

activities for their livelihood and they are not  given

the  necessary land. In certain circumstances, some  of

these  farmers have to live in Housing Board flats  and

they  have  to  change  their way  of  life  completely

because   they  have  no  land  to  carry   out   their

agricultural   activities,  and  they   are   cut   off

completely  from  a  side  income.  So  they  find   it

difficult to make ends meet from their small income and

they  are faced with certain problems of earning  their

livelihood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one other aspect regarding

compensation.  In  my  constituency  there   are   some

villagers who have planted rubber trees on their  land.

The  Resettlement  Department assured  them  originally

that  they  would  get compensation  for  their  rubber

trees. This, in fact, was the position in 1963, so that

owners  or  farmers who had planted  rubber  trees  got

compensation. This gave people the impression that,  in

future, compensation would be given in other cases.  So

they  allowed  the Government to cut  down  the  rubber

trees.   But  later  on  they  were  notified  by   the

Government,  to  their  astonishment,  that  Government

would not compensate them for cutting down their rubber

trees. They were taken by surprise. It was like a  bolt

from the blue. They had engaged contractors to cut down

the   rubber   trees  in  the  hope  of  getting   some

compensation,  and  now they have no  compensation.  So

they   lose  the  trees  and  they  have  to  pay   the

contractors.  These  are  genuine  difficulties   which

deserve the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



sympathetic consideration of Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bras Basah has just now mentioned,

among  other things, the planning fees relating to  pig

sties   and  chicken  runs.  I  myself  have   received

complaints  on  this matter from my villagers,  because

their income is already low enough. If they have to pay

licence fees from $3 or $5 to $12 a year, that will  be

a  burden to them, particularly as the chicken feed has

increased  in price and their farm produce,  such  as

eggs and chickens, has gone down in price. So they have

decreasing   prices for  their  farm  produce,   higher

licence  fees,  and more expensive chicken  feed.  They

deserve the sympathy of the Government, and I hope that

the Government or the Minister in charge will give them

due consideration.



<br><br>6.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I had not intended to  enter  into  the

debate on the subject until my interest was aroused  by

certain  statements made by the Member for  Bras  Basah

and the Member for Choa Chu Kang, among others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the ordinary citizens of Singapore do not

realise   that  livestock  farming  is  a  considerable

economic  pursuit on this island, and  that,  far  from

importing  poultry, eggs and pork, this City  State  of

ours  is  a very substantial exporter of food  -  pigs,

eggs  and poultry - to surrounding countries. We  have reached  this  rather  unusual and surprising  position

because  of  certain  advantages  which  we  enjoy   in

livestock  farming. Firstly, in the post-war  years  it

was   possible   to   control   diseases   and   pests,

particularly  among poultry, by injections,  especially

anti-ranikhet injections. This enables large flocks  of

birds  to  be  raised  with small risk  of  substantial

losses  when  the whole flock dies during an  epidemic,

which  used  to  happen regularly before  the  war.  In

addition    to    this,   Singapore    has    excellent

communications  and  could,  therefore,  buy   feeding

stuffs like maize, fishmeal,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



and  cod  liver  oil from the cheapest markets  in  the

world.  Cheap supplies combined with excellent  banking

and  credit facilities have enabled our farmers to  get

feeding stuffs on very favourable terms to enable  them

to  raise large flocks of poultry either for the  table

or  as  laying birds, as well as to raise large numbers

of pigs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the economic point of view, there is one rather

ridiculous  feature  about the  livestock  industry  in

Singapore.  This  is the absurdly low prices  at  which

farmers are able to rent or lease their land. A  farmer

can  get,  say,  5  or  10 acres  of  Crown  land  from

Government on T.O.L. (Temporary Occupation Licence) for

a  fairly nominal payment of something like $5 or $2  a

year  sometimes.  Of course, this is not  the  economic

rent.  It does not reflect the real value of land which

the  Government could get, say, from renting  the  land

for other purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the cheapness of land which has somewhat

distorted  the  picture  and  has  not  impressed  upon

farmers  that land is very scarce. Supposing they  have

to pay something like $200 a month for an acre of land,

which  may be the market price for land, then  I  think

they  will  be more careful about the use of  land  and

will  be  able to raise very large flocks of  birds  or

large numbers of pigs in small areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here we are. We are faced with a situation where

land  is limited by nature and, at the same time, there

is a substantial demand for the use of land for raising

poultry and pigs because it is a paying occupation. The

Member  for Bras Basah says that the solution would  be

to  give  more  than  two acres  per  farmer  and  asks

Government not to limit the grant of resettlement  land

to  two acres. It is all very well to say, "Let  us  be

generous." But at whose expense? After all, the acreage

on  the island is limited and if you give more than two

acres,  then  only a certain number of people  will  be

able to get it and large numbers will have to be turned

away  without  any land. So the idea of  giving  people

larger grants of land may



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



be  all  right in individual cases, but I  think  as  a

policy it is self-defeating.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I want to put forward for the consideration of

the  Minister one solution which was experimented  with

in  the United Kingdom. I am not a farmer by profession

or  a gentleman farmer; so I do not know at all whether

it will work here, but maybe his staff can work out the

economics  and  the technical side of this  idea.  Some

years  ago  in  the  United  Kingdom  an  extraordinary

development took place in agriculture, and that is  the

development  of what are called "concrete farms".  Some

farmers  of  pigs - I think they were mainly  concerned

with  pigs -decided that you could raise pigs in flats!

After  all, the rearing of a pig or for that  matter  a

chicken,  is really a process whereby you put into  its

mouth  corn  or  what have you, and  then  you  convert

vegetable carbohydrates into animal protein.  And  that

is what chickens and pigs are meant for! And you can do

this  in  a building. In fact, even in Singapore,  when

they  rear poultry by modern methods, they do  not  let

the poultry run about the farm; they put them in cages,

and  pigs are kept in pig sties. [Interruption] No, no.

No  health  hazards, because then you can  arrange  for

automatic sprinklers and so on. You can put detergents,

or  whatever  they are, at the right time  and  in  the

right place.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> You can then do farming in Housing

Board flats!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No. I am not saying it could be

done  in  flats.  It could be done in  specially  built

structures. And since pigs and poultry are lighter than

human beings, you can build a light and presumably less

costly structure.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Government must then give a

special loan to the farmers.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, I am coming to that. When a

group  of  enterprising farmers tried this in  Britain,

there  was,  of course, a tremendous uproar  among  the

respectable farmers who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



reared  pigs  on  land.  They  said,  "This  is  unfair

competition."   Presumably  then  it   must   be   more

economical and more competitive to raise pigs  in  this

unnatural way in concrete buildings than to raise  them

in  the  natural way, i.e, on farm land.  I  think  the

Minister might get his officials to have a look at this

idea.  And  if  it  is  possible to  build  very  cheap

structures,  much cheaper than, say, structures  needed

for  housing human beings, then this may be one way  of

encouraging   the   growth  of  the  animal   husbandry

industry.  It  may mean, of course, Government  forking

out  money. But, as against that, if it is possible  to

save  on land, then the saving in the cost of acquiring

or buying land, the price of which will go up from year

to  year,  can go into a fund which could be  used  for

lending  money to farmers to enable them to build  this

kind of structure.



<br><br>6.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): If we note

the debate that we have just heard, Mr Speaker, Sir -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Just before you proceed, Mr

Govindaswamy, could I ask Members who are  now  turning

on   their   speakers  to  turn  them  off   when   Mr

Govindaswamy finishes his speech?



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): When I speak on this

motion,  I  would like to refer to some  of  the  notes

which  I  have made. Government has a bounden  duty  to

work  for  the welfare of the rural folk. Only  if  the

rural  people have a fair livelihood will city dwellers

have  an  equally good livelihood. We put  up  so  many

buildings in the city area. We construct and widen  our

roads.  Nevertheless, we must remember  from  where  we

derive the foodstuffs for the city dwellers. Ours is  a

very  small country. We do not produce enough food  for

our own consumption, but have to import it from abroad.

We have to use our land not only for the benefit of the

rural dwellers, not only for better farming conditions,

not only for poultry and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



dairy farming and pig rearing, but we have also to make

the  best  use of it. If such improvement projects  are

undertaken,  then the produce will be of great  benefit

to  all the people of this country. We will be able  to

produce enough to export.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Defence has brought forward some facts. He says that poultry production has increased a great deal and that pig rearing has also increased, so we are able to export farm produce. From the Digest of Statistics of 1960, he will note how the cost of living has been rising. Since this is the case, and since only

two acres of land are being allotted to the farmers  by

Government, what can they do with two acres?  Can  they

farm  on it? Can they build anything to live on? If  we

cannot provide such facilities for the farmers, then in

what manner are we practising democratic socialism?  It

is  only when we raise the living standard of the lower

income groups that we can have a secure future for  our

succeeding generations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Defence has also suggested that farming could be carried out in flatted buildings. Let us consider the tremendous amount of capital needed for such buildings. If the same capital could be provided for the farmers, it is easy to imagine the tremendous expansion in production which could be achieved. While

we  are  carrying out many improvement projects in  the

city,  we  should keep in mind the needs of  the  rural

dwellers  as well. This Government has a duty  to  look

after  the  welfare  of  the  poorer  sections  of  our

community. It is these poorer sections who live in  the

villages.  Therefore, if the Government is not  showing

sufficient interest in their problem, I feel it will be

an  inadvisable  course.  The  rural  folks  are  in  a

position to help us. Their productivity means  a  great

deal for the city dwellers. In this connection, if  the

Government  is  indifferent, the people  in  the  rural

areas may one day be compelled to leave their place and

come to the city to look for jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister for Labour has said, 69,500 people

are  now unemployed and this figure may easily rise up.

To prevent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



such a situation the Government has to devise ways  and

means  to  tackle the problem right now. It should,  as

far   as   possible,  assist  the  farmers   to   their

satisfaction. This is my submission to the  Government.

May I repeat again that we should not be indifferent in

this matter?



<br><br>6.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  today I am sitting in the Opposition's  place

and  so I shall stand up and say what is right and what

is wrong without any favour, fear or ill-will.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Bras Basah has made an

adjournment  speech  on  the resettlement  of  farmers.

Formerly I was an official in the Resettlement  Section

of  the  Government  and  I know  more  than  he  does.

Resettlement is within the jurisdiction of the Minister

for National Development. There are merits and demerits

in  the work done by the Primary Production Department.

What are the merits? The merits are that the Government

is  looking after the housing needs of the people.  The

Housing  and Development Board has undertaken a massive

housing  programme.  But in other  respects  there  are

defects.  What  are  the defects and  demerits  of  the

Ministry  concerned? Although I am  in  the  Opposition

seat, I will say what is right and what is wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of resettlement of farmers, there was no

compensation  paid in the beginning. In some  cases  no

alternative accommodation was allotted. In  some  cases

farmers  received  $500 or $1,000 as  compensation  for

resettlement,    but    they   had    no    alternative

accommodation. This is a defect. Later on the situation

was improved. The farmers got alternative accommodation

plus  compensation. Still later on they got  two  acres

for  farming. This is, of course, right. But  now  they

say they do not have enough farming land. If you do not

give  them the land, how could you expect them to live?

This  is  the defect or the demerit, as I have  already

said. Again the Chairman, Mr Tan Kia Gan, what type ofperson



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>



was  he  when  he  was  in  the  Ministry  of  National

Development? He sold the flats in the Tiong Bahru  area

without proper valuation by the Valuation Officer. This

again was a defect. How can you -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Member is bordering on the

irrelevant. I must ask him to come back to  the  debate

on the adjournment. Could he please confine his remarks

to the resettlement of farmers occupying State land?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Yes, I will come

back,  Mr  Speaker. The most important  thing  is  the

administrative   work.  The  officer   in   charge   of

administration should not do things as he pleases.  The

failure  in  certain respects is not the fault  of  the

Minister  or  the Parliamentary Secretary.  It  is  the

fault  of  the administrative head, because he  took  a

dictatorial course of action. He was stubborn  in  some

cases.  He took action without consulting the  Minister

in  charge. He went his own way. Sometimes, of  course,

the  Minister was to be blamed because he did not  seem

to  know  many  things. Yes, it is true. Regarding  the

sale  of the Tiong Bahru flats, no valuation was  made.

The Minister did not know. Did he know? No.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker</b> rose -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member is

being   completely   irrelevant.  We   are   discussing

resettlement and not the Tiong Bahru flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee, could you please confine your

remarks to resettlement?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I just

mention this in passing, because we are now going  into

the merits and demerits of the Ministry. It is not just

a  flatter  of the livelihood of the farmers but  other

matters, such as maladministration, which must be taken

into account.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you want me to come back to the proper

issue, so I shall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>



come  back now. I feel that the means of livelihood  of

the  farmers  is  of paramount importance  and  special

attention  must  be paid to it. As  in  the  past,  the

Government  has acquired a lot of land for reallocation

to farmers. This should be done here.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

wish  to  join  in the debate because  I  have  certain

suggestions  to make. The first is that the  Government

should  reconsider  its  policy  towards  the  farmers.

Secondly,  the  Minister or the  department  concerned,

that  is,  the  Resettlement Section,  must  set  up  a

committee   comprising,  in  particular,   Members   of

Parliament  for the rural areas and constituencies  and

officers  of  the department concerned. This  committee

will  be in charge of resettlement as a whole. Thirdly,

a  policy must be formulated to assist the farmers on a

comprehensive basis so that they will not suffer  great

hardships and will be given an opportunity to carry  on

their farming activities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the resettlement

of  farmers does not affect my constituency, but  since

it  is  in  the rural area, I would like to  take  this

opportunity  to  say  a  few words.  Firstly,  I  fully

support the views expressed by the mover of the motion

and  several  of  my colleagues on the resettlement  of

farmers  occupying State land. Sir, the Government  has

been  stressing  a great deal on the need  to  increase

productivity,  but productivity in this  context  means

increasing  industrial produce  only.  However,  in  my

view,  the Government has not made a realistic approach

towards encouraging our farmers to increase the  output

of  agricultural produce. From what I gather in  regard

to  the resettlement of farmers, the Government has, in

fact,  allotted  them farm land which is  much  smaller

than the farm land on which they had previously farmed.

For example, when a farming area is to be taken over by

the Government for public development, the resettlement

of  farmers will inevitably take place, but instead  of

allocating them farm land of a similar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>



size,  the Government, through the department concerned

or  the  statutory board, has allocated to  them  small

plots of land, thereby reducing their scope to increase

their farming activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure this House will agree with me on this

point. When an area is required for public development,

and  resettlement of farmers takes place,  the  farmers

will  have to be moved out to new areas. They will have

to  start all over again before they can carry on  with

their  normal  activities and to  reap  their  harvest.

Therefore,  with  the reduction in the  size  of  their

farming  lands,  they  will  inevitably  reduce   their

farming  activities,  thereby resulting  in  a  reduced

amount  of agricultural produce. Sir, I am sure  it  is

not  the Government's intention to inhibit the progress

of  farming  activities  in  our  Republic.  Therefore,

instead of decreasing the size of resettled land to  be

allocated, which is not more than two acres,  I  appeal

to  the  Minister  concerned to take a  more  realistic

policy  on the resettlement of the farmers. I  am  sure

this  House  will  bear with me if I  stress  that  the

farmers in the Republic play an important role  in  our

country's struggle for survival. They toil all  day  to

produce  as  much agricultural produce as  possible  to

help  feed  many  of  our people.  They  produce  large

quantities of eggs, poultry, pigs and a good variety of

vegetables.  By so doing, they contribute in  no  small

measure  towards providing these essential  commodities

for a good part of our population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, realising the importance of the role

played by the farmers, I would like to appeal again  to

the  Minister for Law and National Development to  look

closely   into  this  question  of  resettling  farmers

occupying State land with a view to increasing the size

of land to be allocated, instead of reducing such plots

to  not  more than two acres, so that the farmers  will

continue  to  help feed a good many of us not  only  in

this House but in our Republic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, several

Members   of   this  House  have  spoken   about   the

resettlement  of farmers. I sincerely  hope  that  the

department concerned, including



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister in charge, and the officials will in  due

course  treat  this problem with some humility  and  in

proper  perspective. I would like  to  suggest  that  a

committee  be set up to review our farming  policy  and

its  terms of reference must include the administration

of  the  Resettlement Department.  And  if  the  review

reveals   that  there  are  certain  defects   in   the

department  concerned,  then  the  department  requires

"resettlement" itself!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two other points to add. In the Resettlement

Section,  problems have arisen in various  fields.  For

quite  some  time  in  the  past,  the  rules  of   the

Resettlement  Section were such that those  people  who

were  ignorant  of  the  rules were  always  told  that

everything was done according to law. But, in  fact,  a

lot of things were not done according to law. They were

done  according  to the rules. They were  not  actually

laws which had been passed and debated in Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I wish to bring to the attention of

Members  concerns the "masterpiece" of the Resettlement

Section.  Some farmers are quite prepared to  make  way

for   the  development  of  their  farm  land  by   the

Government and to resettle in another place. But  if  a

villager  affected is a sole occupier, then he  is  not

entitled  to  alternative accommodation  in  a  Housing

Board  flat. Even if he has a child - a daughter  or  a

son  who  applies jointly with him for a Housing  Board

flat, his application will be turned down on the ground

that his child -- daughter or son - is not affected  by

the  resettlement scheme, having been living in another

place. This is ridiculous. This is a blunder - a  legal

blunder  if we may call it - because the sole  occupier

affected is allowed to apply jointly with another  sole

occupier  affected  by the same scheme  for  a  Housing

Board  flat. If a bachelor and a spinster are similarly

affected,  how  can they be expected to  make  a  joint

application for a Housing Board flat? This is a  defect

which  must be removed. This is a common sense  matter.

When a sole occupier is affected, he being lonely is in

misery already. And if he is to be discriminated in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>



favour  of  those with families, those  who  enjoy  the

bliss  of  family life, then he should receive  special

consideration to compensate him. This is a policy which

the  Government  should consider. The present  rule  is

against  the  common sense concept of  humanitarianism.

Although sole occupiers are not many in number, I  hope

we  are able to handle their problems with some ease so

that  they will be housed in a proper place. This is  a

matter worthy of our consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter is that in the Resettlement Section

some  work  is done with no bearing on resettlement  at

all.  This  is  the  matter of eviction.  There  is  no

resettlement.  There is eviction without  resettlement.

If  you want to resettle, that means after eviction you

must rehouse the evicted people somewhere else. But  in

many cases the so-called resettlement is mere eviction.

The  people are driven out and that is the end  of  it.

That  is  what  they call resettlement, which  I  would

rather  call eviction. The officers concerned must  not

forget  that  the department is set up for resettlement

and  not  for eviction alone. So they must  know  their

duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say we regret that in certain places some

temples are in existence. Because they are affected  by

the  resettlement scheme, they have to be removed.  But

the administrative policy does not give resettlement to

the  people  living  in these temples.  They  are  just

evicted  and are given no alternative land,  either  to

build  another temple, or accommodation to live in  and

to  carry out their religious activities. As a  result,

these people have no place for religious congregations.

This  is  against the freedom of religion advocated  in

our  Republic. It is inconsistent with the  concept  of

freedom  of religion. So certain arrangements  must  be

made  in  regard to temples and other places of worship

affected  by the resettlement scheme. This  is  a  very

sensitive  matter  and  must  be  given  some   careful

thought. In the case of a mosque or church affected  by

a  resettlement  scheme, alternative  accommodation  or

land  is given for the reconstruction of the mosque  or

the church. But in the case of temples of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>



another  religion, no provision is made in some  cases.

This  will give rise to discontent and misunderstanding

amongst the members of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would like the Minister in charge and the

officers  concerned to pay special  attention  to  this

aspect  of  the problem, because we have received  many

complaints  from  the farmers and villagers  about  the

officers of the Resettlement Section. Perhaps  not  all

of  them are bad in their attitude in dealing with  the

public,  but some of them are lacking in the spirit  of

public service. When they carry out their duties, there

is  no  sincerity  on their faces. Instead,  they  look

fierce   when  they  implement  the  policies  of   the

Government. When you go to the Resettlement Section, it

looks  as  though you are going to hell  with  all  the

devilish-looking officers around. Sir, some farmers who

need to go to the Resettlement Section invariably go to

their   Members   of  Parliament  for   a   letter   of

recommendation,  as though it is an effective  talisman

against  these devilish-looking officers! Some  farmers

and  villagers complain that the letters given to  them

have been torn to pieces by the officers concerned.  So

I hope the Minister concerned will look into the matter

and  take  stringent  action  against  these  officers,

because  in our newly-independent Republic, if we  want

the people to support us in national reconstruction, we

must  not  allow  a small group of public  servants  to

create  a  sense  of  hatred among the  public  against

Government. This is my sincere hope.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have heard

practically  all the Members of this House  speak  with

one  voice,  except the Minister of Defence,  and  they

make   general  allegations  against  the  Resettlement

Department of the Housing and Development Board. I,  of

course,  have no answers to the general allegations.  I

remember,  in  particular, the Member for  Bukit  Merah

shouting   about   the  devils  in   the   Resettlement

Department. I would suggest that he give me  the  names

of these devils and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>



what  the  allegations  are,  because  anyone  who   is

resettled  is  dissatisfied. You give  him  a  thousand

dollars;  he wants two thousand dollars. You  give  him

one acre; he wants five acres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the hon. Members themselves have

admitted,  land is a scarce commodity in Singapore.  In

fact,  land  is  very scarce. We have only  225  square

miles  of  land in Singapore. We are trying to  reclaim

more land. We have a reclamation scheme in Kallang.  We

are  reclaiming  land in Kranji, along the  East  Coast

Road and in the Port Authority. But all the reclamation

we  do  in  Singapore cannot double  the  size  of  the

island,  and  a great part of the land in Singapore  is

swampy land. A large part, too, forms part of the  land

adjacent to our reservoirs and we cannot allow  farmers

in.  This is the catchment area and it is a wide  area.

If  yon allow them in with their pigs and chickens, the

water will be polluted.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> You are driving a motor road in.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> To drive in a motor road is a different

thing. You have a road along MacRitchie Reservoir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put it in short, Mr Speaker, Sir, we have not got

sufficient  land.  Everybody in Singapore  expects  the

Government to give all the time; they themselves  never

give.  In  Singapore,  we  have  large  acres  of  land

occupied  by,  say,  one  person.  A  few  years   ago,

investigations revealed that, a woman in Singapore  had

a  Temporary Occupation Licence from the Government and

she  was  occupying 300 acres of State  land.  She  was

supposed to be in occupation, but all she was doing was

making money out of that. All 300 acres were sublet  to

others  who  were paying her fees or rent.  Of  course,

these   300   acres  were  taken  away.  Her  Temporary

Occupation Licence was revoked and licences were  given

to  the  actual occupants. This is our policy. We  give

land to people who want land and who occupy it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> What about the Singapore Island Club

where they play golf?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> But this is just one example. If you have

any  noises to make about the Golf Club, do not address

them to me. I am not a golfer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back to our subject. If we have in Singapore

land  as much as the Malaysians have in Johore  or  the

Australians in Australia or the New Zealanders  in  New

Zealand, I would he happy to comply with their  wishes.

Instead of giving them two acres, I would give them two

square miles. But we have not got the land. That is why

our  buildings  go  up  and up.  We  are  not  building

sideways;  we are going up. As the Minister of  Defence

has  pointed  out,  it would not be realistic  to  give

farmers  more  than two acres of land. I  realise  that

production  will  not be as great as if  a  farmer  had

three  acres or twenty acres. That is logical.  But  as

the  Member for Choa Chu Kang puts it, it is a question

of  priority - land for industry, land for farms.  Do  we

sacrifice everything for the farmers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another wrong impression Members have is that all

farmers  are poor. They say, "Why do you not  help  the

rural  folk? You are doing nothing for the rural  folk.

They  are  all poor." But the Member for Choa Chu  Kang

has  quoted one case in his constituency where  someone

was  occupying  ten acres of Government  land  and  the

turnover  was $1 million a year. This person said  that

we  took away this land and gave him two acres. I  say,

what is wrong with that? The land never belonged to him;

the  land  belonged to us. It was not to cut  down  his

production.  If  he had so much money,  he  could  have

bought  10, 20 or 30 acres. But as I have put  it  just

now,  they all want to take; they never give. What  has

the  Government to give? The Government  has  land.  So

everybody  gets  T.O.L.s.  Once  the  T.O.L. is  given

- whether  it is for 10, 15 or 20 acres -they behave  as

if  the  land  is  theirs. Now this is where  they  are

wrong.  The land is State land and it is let  out  very

cheaply  -$15  per annum for one acre,  which  is  well

below the economic rent. It is practically a gift  -  a

gift  on  a  year's licence. But the land  is  not  the

farmers'.  The land is State land. Subject  to  certain

conditions, that licence is given



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>



and one of the conditions is no transfer, no subletting

without the consent of the Commissioner of Lands, which

makes  me  come  to  the second  point  raised  by  the

Livestock Association in their letter to the Member for

Bras Basah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We give Mr X two acres of land. He claims to be a

genuine  farmer. We go into his bona fides and  we  are

satisfied that he is a farmer. We give him two acres of

land.  What  does he do? He transfers  his  two  acres,

either  through non-interest in farming or because  his

farming did not succeed, to a successful farmer. So the

Land Office hears about this and says to him, "You have

no  business to transfer without telling us. One of the

conditions  is that you should not transfer."  So  they

impose  a  premium which is in the region of  $150  per

acre. They also increase the rent. The previous licence

-  or rent if you like to call it was a subsidised fee.

We  were  not making any money out of it.  But  when  a

transfer  like that takes place, we charge an  economic

rent or a licence fee. The reason is this -- - that the

land  is  our  land.  Because  of  the  transfer,   the

transferor  gets a few thousand dollars. Do  not  think

that  out  of  the goodness of his heart he transferred

his  licence  fee.  He  got a  big  fat  fee  for  that

transfer.  Normally in order to avoid stamp duty,  they

declare  the  transfer fee at $4,000 in  order  not  to

avoid  but to reduce the amount of stamp fee attracted.

So  this  is  Government land let out on a  T.O.L. and

someone  practically sells it. They sell our  land.  We

should  be  making the profit, but they are making  the

profit. If we do not either revoke the T.O.L. or impose

these  new transfer fees and increases in annual  fees,

they  will  be  buying  and  selling  State  land  like

nobody's  business. This is the mistake.  The  land  is

ours;  it  is  not  theirs. We let it  out  on  certain

conditions  provided they keep to the conditions.  They

will always have the land, but the trouble is that they

do not keep to the conditions. That is the second point

raised by the Member for Bras Basah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point raised by the Livestock Association.

We  come  now to the building permits which  have  been

raised to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>



$12  per  annum. There is a history behind  this,  and,

shortly,  it is this. A new set of building regulations

came into effect from the 1st of August, 1966, the  aim

being  to  replace two sets of former building  by-laws

which  consisted of City Council by-laws applicable  to

the city area and those of the Rural Board bylaws which

were applicable to areas outside the city. In doing so,

this   simplified  administrative  procedure   overcame

discrepancies  experienced in the past because  of  the

two  sets  of building by-laws. The fee for a temporary

permit for any temporary building in the city area  was

$12  per annum. This fee was not increased but was made

applicable  to  the whole of Singapore island,  and  it

affected the Rural Board so that a temporary permit fee

of $3 to $5 per annum in the past was increased to $12.

The  Minister for Finance had a hand in this. His scale

of  fees in the rural areas had not been revised  since

1953 and he felt that it was fair and reasonable that a

fee of $12 per annum charged for a temporary permit  in

the  city  area should be made applicable in the  rural

area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to come back again to the subject of "We are

doing  nothing for the farmers;" "you must have  a  new

policy in farming;" "the Minister does not know what is

happening  in his Resettlement Department,  people  are

grumbling."  Let  me  tell  you  this.  In   1965,   we

introduced  legislation to register all  farmers.  This

incidentally was done by way of the Animals  and  Birds

(Amendment)  Ordinance. The object of this  legislation

was  to  register the farmers. The idea of  registering

them  was to find out how many farmers we had and  what

type of farmers we had. The intention was to try to see

the  size of the problem and, if possible, to make sure

that  the,  services provided by the Primary Production

Department should benefit those people who needed these

expansion   services   most.  The  Primary   Production

Department  was  of  the  view  that  registration  was

essential.  For some reason or other, this registration

of  farmers met with considerable opposition  from  the

farming population, perhaps more through ignorance  but

perhaps they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>



had their valid reasons. To cover administrative costs,

we  intended  to  charge them $5 registration  fee  per

farmer.  They  did  not  like  it.  Another  reason  is

probably  this. They do not pay income tax. The  moment

they register, the Minister for Finance chases them. So

we  give away money when we do not know who the farmers

are.  But  that $5 is incidental. We are  not  charging

them annually. It was just this once. They did not like

the  idea. They did not like us to know more about them

than what they told us. If they have their problems, we

are  prepared  to help them. But how can you  help  any

body  of  people unless you know who these people  are,

how  many  there are, and what their problems are?  One

method is registration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Why not take a census?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> And in registration you can distinguish

between the genuine farmer and the bogus farmer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Members has pointed out that we give land

to one farmer and the next month he transfers it; so we

are  at fault. He says, "Sometimes you do not give land

to  a genuine farmer," and so we are at fault. When you

give,  it is wrong. When you do not give, it is  wrong.

When  you  query  him about his identity  card,  it  is

wrong. The address is in Changi, but he is supposed  to

be farming in Choa Chu Kang. So we look at his identity

card and ask, "What is this?" Oh, he does not like  it;

he  is a genuine farmer. Or his name is different,  and

we  query. And when we query, he does not like it.  But

the  idea  of querying is merely to find ample evidence

or  proof that they are genuine farmers. There must  be

bogus  farmers; there are crooks. I am not saying  that

the whole lot are crooks, but we must catch the crooks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> This could be due to a change of

address.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> It could be; very rightly so. But we

query  not  to down them. We query to down the  crooks.

But there must be grouses on this point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I could now refer to the Member for Sembawang

who is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>



here.  I  think he has made a very valuable  suggestion

that  we  start farming on the outer islands.  We  have

about 40 islands round Singapore, and I can assure  him

that  an  intensive survey has been made by a committee

who has done a lot of field work on the islands, and it

has made certain recommendations. Land is scarce and we

need  more land and we propose to use these islands.  I

cannot  give  details at the moment as  the  report  is

still  quite secret, but I can assure him that  we  are

going to make use of these islands.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> For farming or for pleasure?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> For all purposes. But it is difficult to

get  the farmers to leave the main island for the small

islands. That is the point, they will not move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Bukit Merah has made one point which,

I  think,  I must reply to, and that is this.  He  says

that when a church or a mosque is demolished, there  is

always  another  piece of land for  another  church  or

another  mosque.  When  it is a  temple,  he  says,  we

demolish the temple and never supply the land.  Let  me

reassure him that we have a multi-religious policy  and

we  do not discriminate between churches, mosques,  and

temples.  It  is not easy to find alternative  land  in

Housing  Board estates where a temple wants to be,  and

each particular problem or temple must be dealt with on

the  facts of the case. I think the Member will realise

that  religion is a very sensitive problem, and  people

are  very  touchy. I would be the last  person  in  the

world  to break into a temple and pull the walls  down.

All  these  matters have to be handled with the  utmost

tact,  and  we  do  our best not to be  forced  into  a

position  to  demolish. In fact, we never demolish.  We

behave,  I should say, with a lot of sincerity  and  we

finally  after  a long time get them to move,  but  not

after they have extracted from us many a concession!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another Member has referred to the question of rubber

trees.  He  says  that the Government promised  to  pay

compensation for cutting down rubber trees,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>



and  then this poor farmer engaged a contractor to  cut

down  the rubber trees. And when the rubber trees  were

cut  down, no compensation was paid. We have, in  fact,

paid compensation for rubber trees in some cases and we

have  refused  to  pay in others. I do  not  know  what

particular  case he has in mind, but where a  Temporary

Occupation Licence has a condition that you are to farm

on  the  land  and not to plant rubber trees,  you  are

supposed  to  farm  on the land. If  you  plant  rubber

trees, and we find that out later, then we cut down the

trees,  because you have already broken the  conditions

of  the Temporary Occupation Licence. You are lucky  we

did   not  revoke  the  licence.  Do  not  expect   the

Government to pay you for planting rubber trees,  which

is  in direct breach of one of the express terms of the

Temporary  Occupation Licence. But if  we  give  you  a

T.O.L. to plant rubber trees, we will pay you when  we

cut  down  the  rubber trees, but  not  otherwise.  The

Member  for  Changi  should  know  that  some  of   the

Temporary Occupation Licences were granted long  before

the P.A.P. came to power, even before the last war.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I close, Mr Speaker, I should tell Members of

the  House about the present resettlement policy of the

Government,  and  it  is  this.  Farmers  - Category  A.

Genuine  farmers are provided with alternative land  in

developed resettlement areas plus cash compensation for

their  houses,  improvements and cultivation.  If  they

elect to find their own accommodation, they are paid  a

rehabilitation grant of $1,000 per acre  of  cultivated

land.  Transport allowance ranging from $50 for a  sub-tenant to $100 for a hut owner is paid, irrespective of

whether  they are resettled in a resettlement  area  or

elect to find their own accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Category B - non-farmers. Non-farmers are given

suitable  alternative accommodation  in  Housing  Board

flats,  if  they  want  such  flats,  plus  payment  of

disturbance and transport allowance ranging  from  $300

for  a  sub-tenant to $350 for a hut owner or occupier.

The hut owner will be reimbursed for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>



house  occupied by his immediate family and  for  other

improvements  in  accordance  with  the   schedule   of

approved  rates.  These benefits are also  extended  to

families who elect to find their own accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shopkeepers - Category C - affected by clearance are

given  priority in the allocation of alternative  shops

in  various  Housing and Development Board  estates  at

concessional rentals without having to go  through  the

normal tender system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps before I close, it would not be out of order

for me to give you -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> A bouquet!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Not a bouquet, but to give you the

figures  of  the amount of money paid by the Government

from  1961  to 1966. In 1961 we paid about $275,000  as

compensation;  1962  $924,000;  1963  $1,698,000;  1964

$3,365,000;  1965  $5,451,000; and  for  the  first  10

months of this year, we have already paid more than  $4

million in compensation. So we have spent quite  a  bit

of money in respect of resettlement. We have not forced

any  person  out  of his house without proper  care  or

reasonable compensation. It is accepted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>



that to get a family to move out from a place where the

members  have  lived for many years  is  not  a  simple

operation.  The Government has, therefore,  made  it  a

policy  not  to  upset  such  families  unless  it   is

absolutely  necessary, as in the  case  of  land  being

required  for a public purpose, for road widening,  for

reclamation, for a school, for a clinic, or for  public

housing.  Even  then  it  must be  explained,  for  the

benefit  of those who pretend to be so indignant,  that

an  infinite amount of patience, tolerance and sympathy

has  always  been  exercised to  make  resettlement  as

painless  as possible. We would be happier if it  would

not  be  necessary to upset or uproot any family,  but,

hon.   Gentlemen,  the  alternative  is  to   have   no

development, no roads, no new schools, no clinics,  and

no housing. Surely this is not what you critics want.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.



<br><br><div align="right">Adjourned accordingly at</div>
