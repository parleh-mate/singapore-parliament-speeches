<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Legislative Assembly of the State of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

yesterday when the House adjourned, I was referring

to an important factor which could be and should be

one  of  those which would form the basis  for  the

creation  of  a  climate of  confidence  which  the

Government  proposes to build up. I was  referring,

Sir,  to the Han Raya Haji message of the Hon. the

Prime Minister. He said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So long as we remember that all religions preach

goodwill  and love for one's fellow-men, then  with

tolerance we can live happily together in peace and

prosperity."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for this country in particular, we need to

remember  and not only to remember, but to practise

it. The Hon. the Prime Minister once stated that he

feared that the greatest danger for this country is

from  communal hatred. We cannot expect  to  dispel

this  fear unless we replace it with something more

constructive.  I am glad that he had  stated  these

three  qualities as being necessary - that we  should

have  goodwill, love and tolerance. I for one, Sir,

may  disagree  with  my friends on  the  Government

benches,  but  it  does not  mean  that  because  I

disagree with them therefore I should entertain any

feelings of ill-will towards them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose to touch next on economic

expansion and refer to the statement which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has been their declared policy, clearly

enunciated  during the election campaign,  to  give

private  enterprise,  both of  local  and  overseas

origin,  all the encouragement and assistance  they

need...".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



Sir,   this  was  very  encouraging  and   if   the

Government will implement this policy, it will help

to build up a climate of confidence. But, Sir, as a

Member of the Opposition, I have to point out  that

there  are  certain  statements  made  and  certain

indications  which make people wonder  whether  the

pendulum is not swinging from the Colonial laissez-faire policy to one of excessive state control  and

interference.  Statements  have  been   made   that

Government   proposes  to  control  all   community

centres, all boys' clubs and very likely all  trade

unions.  The two do not seem to agree.  If  we  are

going to encourage private enterprise in one field,

the  same principle applies; it means that we  have

to  encourage private enterprise also in the  field

of  social welfare projects. Sir, I put it  to  the

Government that they should reconsider this and  if

they  really  want to encourage private enterprise,

then  they should modify their policy so that where

private  enterprise has been abused and the  people

have suffered, then I for one would agree that  the

State must interfere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the problem of unemployment has been touched

upon  very briefly in a short paragraph.  We  would

have liked, Sir, for the Ministers representing the

Government  to  elucidate their  policy.  Then  the

Opposition  could really help to  point  out  where

there  are points to be reconsidered. But since  we

do  not know what is beyond the speech, Sir, we can

only  conjecture.  The problem of  unemployment  is

very closely connected with the problem of national

development. It is stated here:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of the gravest and most pressing problems

facing   the  Government  of  Singapore  today   is

housing."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we wholeheartedly agree. Housing can have a

great  effect on the unemployment problem. We  know

that  the population increase in Singapore is  such

that,  to  cope with just the annual  increase,  we

should build at least 10,000 housing units a  year.

The  Singapore Improvement Trust has been  able  to

build  up  to  a maximum rate of only  about  4,000

houses  a  year.  With maybe increased  energy  and

greater  expenditure of money the number  could  be

increased. But with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



the  backlog of the years since 1945 or 1941,  with

arrears  of housing to be made good, we  know  that

private  enterprise must be encouraged to step  in.

Here,  Sir,  we  find  that  there  are  two   very

discouraging features. If an estate developer wants

to  build 200 houses, he is now called upon to make

a  deposit for water and light even before  he  has

started  building operations for the whole  of  the

200 houses. Worked out at $1,500 per unit or $1,000

per unit, it comes to $200,000. This means that the

developer  must  first deposit  $200,000  with  the

Government   or   the  City  Council.   Sir,   this

discourages the developer naturally. Why should  he

put  in  $200,000  even before he starts  building,

when  he feels that the climate is still uncertain?

I have a constructive suggestion to make, Sir. That

is,  if the deposit is reduced and payment made  in

stages  for  20 or 50 houses at a time,  that  will

encourage   estate  developers  to   invest   their

capital.  Then  again, Sir, this is  on  behalf  of

those many workers who want to own small houses  of

their  own.  They  are  scared  because  there  are

reports that the assessment will be raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain countries, Sir, to stimulate housing,

the   Government  exempted  owners  of  houses   or

builders  of  houses from paying assessment  for  a

period   of   time.  Sir,  I  put   forward   these

suggestions  in  order  that the  housing  industry

might  be  encouraged to develop further  and  that

unemployment  would be helped. At the moment,  with

the  housing industry more or less at a  standstill

except  for those who can afford it, the result  is

that many masons, carpenters, lorry drivers and  so

down the line, are unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come now to a subject in which I am

naturally   and  specially  interested.   That   is

education.  I  have been informed,  Sir,  that  the

Education  Minister was a teacher  before  he  went

into  the  field of insurance. I take it that  with

that  background  he  can see a  problem  from  its

different  angles. I am glad, Sir, that the  policy

is  to  accept the recommendations of the All-Party

Committee  Report on Chinese Education released  in

1955.  In  that Report, Sir, it was stated  that  a

great  deal of the educational development in  this

country had been due to private



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



enterprise or public spirited merchants and  others

who had formed committees of management and started

their   own   schools  in  villages   without   any

encouragement from the then Colonial Government. In

the  same  way,  in  regard to  English  education,

various  missions had established  schools  whereas

the  Government was interested in only just  a  few

schools,  leaving the main task to private  bodies.

Sir, we are glad that after the war, the Government

decided  that it should play a more important  part

and  invest  more  money on the  education  of  its

future  citizens. This development has been all  to

the  good. Now that the Government has been  taking

more  and  more interest, it is natural, I suppose,

that  when people pay more money, they want to have

more  control, because they pay the piper.  At  the

same   time,  Sir,  for  the  sake  of  encouraging

competition  and initiative, we feel  that  private

enterprise must be encouraged and that these Boards

of  Management  which are controlling  the  Chinese

schools  should  continue with the  least  possible

interference and Boards of Governors be formed  for

Government as well as aided schools which do not as

yet have Boards of Governors whereby there will  be

maintained the liaison between school and  home  to

which  the  All-Party Committee Report  on  Chinese

Education has referred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two questions at the moment which

are   in   the   minds  of  parents  as   well   as

educationists.  I  remember, Sir,  six  years  ago,

because  of  the  problem of limited accommodation,

the then Director of Education said that there must

be  introduced  in  Singapore the  same  system  of

Secondary Entrance Examination as in England.  That

is known as the Eleven-plus Examination. But he did

not  recommend  the  full  implementation  of  what

exists  in  England. He recommended the examination

to exclude certain students and not to classify all

the students. He said to me that only a quarter  at

the  most  of  the students in the primary  schools

should  go  into  the secondary  schools.  Sir,  in

England, they have the Eleven-plus Examination as a

classifying examination. Those who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



fit  for  the grammar type of education go  into  a

grammar  school; others into technical schools  and

others  again into modern schools. But here at  the

age  of  Eleven-plus, Twelve-plus or Thirteen-plus,

thousands  were dismissed and were told  that  they

could  not  get  into  the  secondary  schools.  We

educationists believe, Sir, that at the Primary  VI

level,  the  boys  and  girls  coming  out  of  the

schools - whether English, Chinese,  Malay  or  Tamil

vernacular  schools - are only  half-baked  products,

and   half-baked   products  can   become   serious

liabilities in the life of the country. One of  the

reasons why we have so many juvenile delinquents is

that these boys and girls come out from the schools

without sufficient education to be employed, and so

they  employ  themselves in their own  way  to  the

detriment   of   the  interests  of  the   country.

Therefore,  some of us suggested to the  Government

that   if   they  wanted  to  have  an  elimination

examination, it should be at the Form III level, or

at  the seventh year level, when they would have at

least enough education to make use of whatever they

had learned to good purpose and be employable. Sir,

we were told that it could not be done. The schools

were given an ultimatum. Either we toed the line or

the  grant would be withdrawn. So, Sir, we  had  to

toe the line. Sad to say, thousands of children had

to leave school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that was a policy which was short-sighted.

The previous Minister for Education realised it too

late  and tried to reverse the policy. But  it  was

too  late,  Sir. We tell the truth and we  believe,

Sir, that the Minister for Education today will not

take it amiss just because I am on this side of the

House and because in politics sometimes we take the

attitude that if that is said by somebody from  the

other  side, it must be bad. We hope that  it  will

not  come to that. Whatever is good that comes from

the  other side, we admit it as good. If  there  is

something  we  have  to  criticise,  we   have   to

criticise because we are the Opposition.  So,  Sir,

we  suggest, if the Minister for Education has  not

made up his mind yet, that the examination which is

now  known  as  the  Government  Secondary  Schools

Entrance Examination should be turned into a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



classifying  examination  or,  if  it  must  be  an

elimination  examination, then it should  be  at  a

level  so that our students come out at the age  of

14 or Fourteen-plus when it will not be against the

Trade Union Ordinance to employ them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also the problem of the six-day

week.   Even  before  this  was  introduced,   many

teachers had been doing a six-day duty freely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> More work for less pay!



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Some of them who teach in

Sunday schools have had to do a seven-day week. But

let  us  also look at it from the point of view  of

the  students.  When we say that a student  does  a

five-day week, we must not think only of the school

hours.  A  Form V pupil seems to have to  do  only,

say,  five  hours  a day, but he must  do  homework

which entails labour for three or four hours at the

minimum.  Some of them do five hours'  work  a  day

after  school  hours and, if we  take  it  in  that

light,  a Form V pupil has to put in five hours  in

the school and four hours at home - nine hours a day.

With  a  five-day week, it works up to 45  hours  a

week - it  already exceeds, I believe, the limit  set

down by the Trade Union Ordinance. So if we make it

a six-day week-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Cruelty!



<br><br><!--Mr Thio Chan Bee-->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr  Thio  Chan  Bee</b> - well, the  children  should form a trade union of their own! They could turn to

their  parents  and say, "Look, parents,  you  come

home on Saturday after a 5½ day week. What is the

meaning  of  making  us do a six-day  week?"  So  I

suggest that, except for special circumstances, the

six-day week in interpretation should be a 5½ day

week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I come now to the last topic. I wish to

touch on Home Affairs. It is stated in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's Speech:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The future of Singapore lies ultimately in re-uniting with the Federation of Malaya as a state in

an  independent  country. It  is  the  Government's

intention  during its term of office to create  and

bring  about conditions favourable to an early  re-unification with the Federation."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we on this side of the House wholeheartedly

support  that objective, but we realise that  there

are  fears, one of which is the fear of the Malays.

Sir,  we share with them the anxiety and we believe

that  this  anxiety  can  only  be  removed  if  we

implement - (I am glad, Sir, that the Hon. the  Prime

Minister  is here) - the basis which he mentioned  in

his  Hari Raya Haji message that with goodwill, love

and  tolerance, we can bring about  a  new  Malayan

nation.  We  can bring about conditions  that  will

help  to  link us up with the Federation.  Sir,  my

hope is that this may come about in my lifetime and

your  lifetime and that there will emerge a Malayan

nation  when, although multi-lingual, multi-racial,

multi-national or multi many other things, we shall

be  united in one loyalty to this country. We  have

already  an  example in the world in  the  case  of

Switzerland, and we hope that the national  pattern

there  can be repeated here. Then we shall  see  in

this   part  of  the  world  Singapore  and  Malaya

becoming one as the Switzerland of Asia.



<br><br>2.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

listened  attentively to the  speech  of  the  Hon.

Deputy  Prime  Minister when he  moved  the  motion

which  is now being debated. He struck a very sober

note  and  showed his keen awareness of  the  heavy

responsibilities that lie in the task ahead. I  was

ready   to   applaud  and  pay   tribute   to   his

statesmanlike  speech.  I  was  even  prepared   to

overlook  the exaggerated claim which he  has  made

for his Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the end of his speech, Sir, however,

something  crept in which struck a discordant  note

and  this has spoilt the good effect of the earlier

part of his speech, and has forced upon me, Sir, to

change somewhat the tone of my speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You change too easily. That

is the trouble.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> On taking office, Sir, the Hon.

the Prime Minister issued a call to the nation that

in  the  task ahead each and everyone of us  has  a

part  to  play  and that each and  everyone  of  us

should work together in this nation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>



building. I was indeed stirred by this call  and  I

then  called  on  the Hon. the Prime  Minister  and

offered  the  Government our co-operation  in  this

nation building. I was stirred because Singapore is

ours,  ours to cherish and to nurture. And  in  the

Prime  Minister's call lies the essence of  sinking

our differences for the common good.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore cannot understand why, in the light

of  that call, the Leader of the House should  have

felt it necessary to end his fine speech by casting

aspersions   on   the  previous  government.   Such

dissipation of his energy, Sir, cannot be  said  to

be  contributing to the task ahead. I cannot  allow

these allegations to pass unchallenged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our period of office, we did all we could

within  the  limitations of the Rendel Constitution

for  the  welfare of the people of  Singapore.  And

even  the Deputy Prime Minister did touch on  these

limitations under the Rendel Constitution. We  have

improved living conditions; we have provided better

social  amenities; we have raised the  standard  of

living.  We have, and not the P.A.P. as barefacedly

claimed by the Hon. the Deputy Prime Minister,  led

the   people   towards   this  new   self-governing

Constitution.  We  have introduced multi-lingualism

into  this Assembly about which the Hon. the Deputy

Prime  Minister has crowed so much. We have  opened

the  gates  of Singapore to more than  300,000  new

citizens.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Thinking they would vote for

you!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> We have -

place  would bring about greater responsibility  in

the   Hon. the  Prime  Minister.  Sir,  with   the

interruptions,  what is the use  of  continuing  in

this  strain? Records will show what we have  done.

Let  the  P.A.P. Government chalk up the record  of

their   achievements   during   their   period   of

stewardship. Time will tell and I sincerely hope, I

repeat, I sincerely hope that they will be able  to

do better under a self-governing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>



and,  of course, a better Constitution. To  me  the

welfare  of  the people of Singapore is  paramount;

political leaders and political parties are just in

the scheme of things.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> They are not like the Labour

Front!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order-



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It is all right. I am used to

it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think this debate is one of

quite  a  serious nature, and perhaps hon.  Members

ought to remember the Standing Order which does say

that when a Member is speaking, there should not be

any unseemly interruptions. Perhaps hon. Members on

the  Government  side  will allow  Members  of  the

Opposition to be heard in silence.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, when the

standstill  Budget was debated in this  House  last

year,  the  leader of the P.A.P. did not  criticise

the budget as was his wont to do in previous years.

In  fact, he was, to say the least, quietly  taking

it from the man known as the Member for Changi, who

has  now retired from this Chamber. Sir, there  was

no indication from him that the P.A.P. was thinking

about  pay  cuts. Indeed when the P.A.P. Mayor  was

introducing the City Council Budget, there  was  no

mention  made  of any pay cuts, and if  I  remember

rightly, there was mention of a surplus. Where then

is  the  justification for pay cuts of City Council

employees? And to add to the injustice,  these  pay

cuts   were  hurriedly  and  arbitrarily   imposed,

flagrantly  ignoring  the  accepted  principle   of

negotiation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming now, Sir, to the pay cuts of Government

employees. The P.A.P., as I said earlier,  did  not

give  any indication during the Budget debate  last

year that it would be desirable in the interests of

economy   to   introduce  cuts  in   the   variable

allowance.  Nor did they at any time  during  their

election campaign give such an indication. As  soon

as they got into the saddle, their economic expert,

through  some  expert  computation,  declared  that

there  was  a  threatened deficit of  $14  million.

Surely,  Sir, the economic expert, who has  been  a

civil servant for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>



many  years, knows full well that for the past  few

years  there has been a surplus at the end of  each

year despite the budgetted deficit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not challenging the wisdom of the Government

to  introduce  economies in the administration.  In

fact,  I  support  it.  Nor am  I  challenging  the

Government's right to introduce pay cuts, but I  do

want  to  protest against the manner in which  they

have  gone about their business. To say the  least,

Sir, it is most undemocratic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the Member for Cairnhill took off

his glasses and polished it.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Excuse me, Sir, for polishing

my  glasses. I want to have a better view  of  hon.

Members on the other side of the House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That action and that phrase

may well be said to be intimidating, although I  am

sure  there  are  robust people on  the  Government

Benches.  But  I  must remind the hon.  Member  for

Cairnhill that he is addressing the Chair,  and  if

he has polished his glasses to look at the Speaker,

then, of course, he is completely in order.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my view of

your  honourable self has not been clouded, but  my

view  of  the  Members on the other side  has  been

clouded  by  the change in colour of  some  of  its

Members.  Ah!  now I have got them  in  the  proper

perspective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Minister for Labour and Law, the

Hon. the Minister for Finance, who is not here  at

the  moment  and his seat is therefore  unoccupied,

and  the  Hon. the Deputy Speaker, who is I believe

still  the  Secretary-General of the  Trades  Union

Congress,  and  of  course,  the  Hon. the   Prime

Minister - these  men,  Sir,  these  honourable  men

first  won  their  way  into  the  political  field

through championing the Government servants.  These

champions,  I  am sorry, I mean these ex-champions,

brought  into  being the Council of  Joint  Action.

They  fought hard and they fought bitterly  against

the  then  Government and won their  way  into  the

hearts  of trade unionists in Singapore. They  even

won  their way into my heart! Those were indeed the

days, Sir! The Council of Joint Action was a Council



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>



of Joint Action, and woe to the Government  if

it  had  dared  to take the line that the  glorious

P.A.P.  Government is now taking. Those were indeed

the  days. Today, Sir, we see a complete change,  a

complete  change. The Government servants formed  a

Council  of Joint Action to protect their interests

against dictatorial employers, and what did one  of

the  fathers,  not  here  at  the  moment,  of  the

original  Council of Joint Action say?  The  P.A.P.

Government does not recognise the Council of  Joint

Action. Do I hear applause? No. No applause.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That would be out of order, of

course.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Therefore, the verdict is

indeed a shameful verdict.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To introduce pay cuts arbitrarily without even

giving   one   month's  notice   to   monthly-rated

employees  is.  I maintain, contrary  to  law.  The

Government, as employers, cannot change-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On a point of information,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon. Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am still speaking, Sir. The

Hon. the Prime Minister will have a right to speak

in  due  course, and I do not think  the  Hon. the

Prime Minister would want to be further informed as

he is already so well informed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, Sir, as employers, cannot change

the  terms of contract of its employees without due

notice.  They  cannot  change  a  monthly  contract

without giving one month's due notice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Is that what you got your

LL.D. for?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Will the Hon. the Minister for

Labour  and  Law look into this matter? I  remember

when I was the Minister for Labour and Welfare,  it

had  been brought to my attention, many a time,  by

P.A.P. trade  union  leaders that  such  and  such

employers were most undemocratic, most dictatorial,

because  they  had  not  given  the  employees  due

notice.  Times  have  changed.  Times  indeed  have

changed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Staff side claimed that there had been

no  negotiations on these pay cuts. The  Government

refuted  this. From Press reports and from personal

experience of trade union negotiations, I  maintain

that  there had been no negotiations in the  proper

sense.  Only two meetings were held, and  these  on

successive days. Surely, Sir, in a matter  of  this

grave nature, the representatives of the Staff side

would have had to consult their trade unions before

they  could  speak  with  authority.  And  the  law

requires  that there should be proper notice  being

given for such meetings of trade unions to be held.

The  Minister for Finance claims that any delay  in

reaching agreement would be to the disadvantage  of

the  Government.  Surely, with  his  experience  of

trade union negotiations, what was required at  the

initial meetings was to agree on an operative  date

and this, I understand, the Staff side was prepared

to  do.  After the operative date had  been  agreed

upon,  any  delay through negotiations in  reaching

agreement on the quantum would have had no material

effect.  Oh, no! This is not to be. The  Government

means  business.  The Staff side  has  to  take  it

because  their  champions,  or  rather  their   ex-champions,  say  so!  The  Government   cannot   be

pressured  into retreating. These are their  words,

Sir,  their  own words, "The Government  cannot  be

pressured  into retreating". But who is  exercising

pressure on whom in this case? I ask this House - who

is exercising pressure on whom?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous Government, Sir, the much-maligned

Lim  Yew Hock Government, had an agreement with the

Staff  side that in cases where no agreement  could

be  reached through negotiations, the matter  could

go to arbitration at the request of either side.  I

am surprised that the Staff side did not try to get

out  of  this  pressure by demanding - oh,  no,  they

should  not  demand - by requesting that  the  matter

should  go to arbitration. The Government, Sir,  in

the  words  of the Minister for Finance, cannot  be

pressured,  and  so  even if  the  Staff  side  had

requested arbitration, the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>



might  have said that it had scrapped the agreement

reached  between  the Staff side and  the  previous

Government.  Perhaps  I  am  doing  the  P.A.P. an

injustice.  Perhaps they will agree  to  refer  the

matter  to  arbitration, and  I  would  like  their

answer to this. I cannot help but keep on recalling

to   my   mind  the  words  of  the  Minister   for

Finance - that  the  Government cannot  be  pressured

into retreating. Judging from his speech during the

debate on the City Council (Suspension and Transfer

of  Functions) Bill two days ago, the Minister  for

Finance  is  doubtless  less  concerned  with   the

observance   of   the  democratic  institution   of

arbitration  tribunals. He is more  concerned  with

the  substance, and the substance in this  case  is

the  Government's decision to introduce  pay  cuts.

The Government could not care less about the method

of  achieving  this substance. To them  the  method

adopted  by  them is democratic, and  if  the  poor

Opposition  have the temerity to say  that  such  a

method is undemocratic and dictatorial, they  would

stand  up and remind us, maybe with grins spreading

all over their faces: "We have 43 members, and what

about  you - just  8."  That  is  the  substance   of

democracy. So, Sir, I do not think they would worry

about  arbitration at all. So obviously the  answer

to   my  suggestion  of  referring  the  matter  to

arbitration is going to be no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How then are they going to reconcile this stand

if  they  were  to  say "No" with their  policy  on

industrial  relations? I quote  from  the  Hansard,

Volume 11 No. 1, column 9:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the channel for the solution of industrial

disputes  is  direct negotiations between  employer

and  Union, then conciliation through the  Ministry

of  Labour and Law, and only finally the  Court  of

Labour."



<br><br>Sir,  this  Court of Labour is to  have  powers  to

enforce its awards. On the one hand, they say  what

they mean - column 9, and, on the other hand, in  the

treatment of their own employees, they do not  mean

what   they   say.  They  are  indeed   an   honest

Government! God help us.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There is, of course, a direct

implication  that  the Government  is  a  dishonest

Government.  Therefore  that  expression  must   be

withdrawn.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I will, therefore, not

call on God at all. I withdraw.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Am I right in saying that I heard

the  hon.  Member  saying that "the  Government  is

indeed  an  honest Government"? There is  a  direct

implication,  of  course, that  the  Government  is

dishonest,  and  therefore  it  is  parliamentarily

wrong.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am sorry, Sir, that I cannot

even  say  that  they  are  an  honest  Government,

because of the form in which I used it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> An apology is not enough. I want a

withdrawal of that statement which implies that the

Government is dishonest, and the hon. Member  knows

that  an  implication  of  that  nature  is  highly

unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I beg to withdraw, Sir, and

tender due apologies. Thank you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the previous Government had taken this

arbitrary and dictatorial stand, not only would the

Council  of  Joint  Action  be  reformed  by  their

trusted champions (now ex-champions) but they would

be  most  vociferous in their clamour for  justice.

Not only would this happen, Sir, but outside P.A.P.

unions   would   be  organising  protest   meetings

pledging  their full support to their  brothers  in

distress  to fight to the bitter end. How dare  the

Lim  Yew Hock Government strike a death blow at the

accepted practice of trade unions negotiations, and

so  on and so forth. But what do we see today?  The

very  life of the trade union movement is at stake.

It  is  not the question of pay cuts at all. It  is

the negation of the right of trade unions to proper

negotiations. What do we see today?  All  quiet  on

the  trade  union  front!  Even  the  Trades  Union

Congress, whose Secretary-General is the  Hon, the

Deputy Speaker, is deadly silent. The P.A.P. trade

union leaders, the much-proclaimed champions of the

workers  of Singapore, have conveniently  forgotten

their  training and their upbringing.  There  is  a

deathly silence. The P.A.P. Government must  indeed

be  a  wonderful  government for the  workers.  The

Government, do you not know, is going  to  build  a

Trade Union House. Yes, the Government is going to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>



build  a Trade Union House, and P.A.P. trade  union

leaders   will  no  doubt  have  first   claim   to

occupation  of  this  House  to  live   in   as....

marionettes!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope and pray that this arbitrary and

dictatorial action of the Government does  not  put

ideas into the heads of private employers. They too

are  finding  their  profits  dwindling  and  their

employees  are  fearful that  a  similar  fate  may

overtake them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I get off this subject I want to

reiterate  that  I am not opposing  the  wisdom  of

Government  to impose pay cuts. I am  not  opposing

that  at  all.  What  I  oppose,  and  oppose  most

vehemently,   is  the  unilateral   and   arbitrary

imposition of such cuts and the deadly blow to  the

right of trade unions to proper negotiations, which

right they have enjoyed so far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government claims that "by and large,

the  immediate prospects for economic expansion are

good."  They  are so good, Sir, that local  capital

has  run  away  and is still running  away  to  the

Federation. Foreign capital is thinking twice about

coming to Singapore. There is a better climate  and

there  are  bigger  consumer  potentialities   just

across  the  causeway, and so  foreign  capital  is

going there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The [P.A.P.] Government has in the few brief

weeks  of  office received numerous enquiries  from

foreign  and  local firms who want to  set  up  new

factories  in  Singapore." So they  say.  But  have

they?  The  Minister for Finance has chosen  to  be

silent  so  far and we have not been  told  of  the

facts and figures. I venture, Sir, to say that  the

P.A.P. Government has inherited most if not all  of

these enquiries from the previous Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government further claims that "the Party in

power enjoys the reputation of honouring its public

pronouncements."    What    about    the     famous

pronouncement of the Party Chairman who stated that

the  P.A.P. City Councillors would remain in office

to  serve,  as  he said, the proletariat,  and  the

P.A.P. honoured  this  public  pronouncement   by

allowing their City Councillors to resign the  City

Council, and, to give cover to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>



this  failure to honour their public pronouncement,

the City Council is now scrapped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I remember rightly, Sir, during their election

campaign,  the P.A.P. leaders issued  a  threat  to

private  capital  to  the extent  that  if  private

capital  co-operated with a P.A.P. Government  they

would  exist for twenty years or more, but if  they

did  not  co-operate with a P.A.P. Government  they

could not exist beyond five years, or words to that

effect.  If  my  memory is wrong,  I  am  sure  the

Government will tell me that it is wrong. If it  is

not  wrong, Sir, what do they mean by that? Do they

mean  what they said, or do they now say that  they

do not mean what they said when they said what they

meant? What a reputation!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was indeed tickled when I heard this passage

in  the Speech. I quote (Hansard, Volume 11, No. 1,

column 8):-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the same time we must remember that a chronic

state  of  industrial unrest means the wrecking  of

our  economy,  and if our economy is  damaged  then

workers, employers and the country as a whole  will

suffer."



<br><br>Sir,  during  the past four years  when  I  was  in

office, industrial unrest was the order of the  day

among  P.A.P. trade unions. I  am  glad  that  the

P.A.P. has  learnt the error of their ways  and  I

would  like to take this opportunity to pay tribute

to them for this change of heart for the better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now about trade unions. The Government has

said  that  it  will  cancel  splinter  and  yellow

unions. The Minister for Labour and Law has  chosen

to be silent so far and I therefore do not have the

benefit  of  his  definition. The hon.  Member  for

Thomson  in  his  speech yesterday  said  something

about   the  undesirability  of  having   so   many

registered unions whose membership is small, it may

be  that he was speaking for the Government and was

trying to help out the Minister for Labour and Law.

But  he too had given no clear definition. Perhaps,

what  he was trying to imply was that there  should

not  have  been  so many unions registered  by  the

previous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>



government.  When  I was Minister  for  Labour  and

Welfare, Sir, I had thought of this, and if  I  had

carried  out  what I thought the P.A.P. would  not

have had so many of their unions registered.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is a technical point which

has  occurred to me. I think I am correct in saying

that  there is a Bill which will be debated in this

House on the question of splinter or yellow unions.

Can  I  have confirmation of this from the Minister

for Labour and Law?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I so confirm.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case, I must draw the

attention of the hon. Member to Standing Order  35.

If  the hon. Member has the Standing Order, perhaps

he would like to read it. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It shall be out of order to anticipate an order

of  the  day by discussion on a motion or amendment

dealing with the subject matter of a Bill or  other

order  of  the day on a day prior to that appointed

for the consideration of that order."



<br><br>So there is in this particular case an order of the

day,  namely,  the Second Reading of  the  relevant

Bill,  and  perhaps the hon. Member would  like  to

reserve his comments on that particular point until

we come to discuss the relevant Bill.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> With respect, Sir, I did not

touch  on the principle of the Bill at all.  I  was

just  saying  that  there was no  definition.  This

arises  as a result of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

address.  I  was trying to reply to what  the  hon.

Member  for Thomson said yesterday, when he  brought

out all those relevancies as to the number of trade

unions, and the strength of trade unions. All these

discussions are not in regard to yellow or splinter

unions  at all. It is the question of the  previous

Government having registered so many trade  unions,

whose membership is more. I feel that I should have

the right to reply.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Of course, I am not trying to

stop  the hon. Member from mentioning these matters

in  passing.  What  I am trying to  stop  the  hon.

Member  from  doing is to discuss this subject,  in

other  words,  enter into a debate on the  subject;

because a debate can properly be held when we  come

to the Second Reading of the relevant Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Thank you, Sir, I was just

saying  that  in  reply  to  the,  shall  we   say,

implication   that  the  previous  Government   had

registered so many trade unions whose membership is

small. I would like to say that I did think at that

time  of not registering all the unions which  made

applications to the Registrar. But because  I  felt

that the Government must give trade unions a proper

run,  there  should  be no restrictions  placed  on

their   registration   nor  on   their   legitimate

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming back to the speech of the Member for

Thomson.  It is obvious to me, Sir, that  the  hon.

Member  for Thomson had not searched his conscience

when  he accused the previous Government of  having

done  nothing for the workers of Singapore  and  of

being  anti-trade  unions.  Sir,  perhaps  he   has

forgotten how the S.T.C. strike was solved and  how

the  Malayan Airways strike was solved and how  the

Harbour Board strike was solved. I mentioned  these

strikes  only because their leaders are now Members

of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Member for Thomson's speech yesterday,

Sir,  there  was  a hint of warning  to  me  to  be

careful  about my trade union activities.  This  is

typical,  Sir,  of the P.A.P. trade union  leaders.

This  is what they call the substance of democracy.

The   hon.   Member  also  accused   the   previous

Government of having done nothing to ameliorate the

working conditions of workers in Singapore.  Is  he

trying  to  say  that  the Labour  Code,  the  Shop

Assistants   Ordinance,   the   Clerical    Workers

Ordinance,  the  Factories  Ordinance  are   P.A.P.

legislation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our time, Sir, as records will show, we

improved  the standard of living of the workers  of

Singapore, whereas the P.A.P. Government called  on

the workers of Singapore to accept a lower standard

of living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the P.A.P.'s idea of solving industrial

disputes  is  exactly what we did in  the  previous

Government.  The only difference is that  while  we

had provided arbitration tribunals, we did not make

these   compulsory.  We  did  not  have  compulsory

arbitration.  I  admit, because  the  trade  unions

during  our  time did not support it; because  they

believed, and I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>



agreed  with them, that a militant trade union  can

achieve more by direct action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a trade unionist, Sir, I must register my

vigorous protest against the Government's intention

of  having  a Trades Union Congress with  executive

powers. This is a move in the wrong direction and a

misconception of the purpose and role of  a  T.U.C.

This  sounds like turning the T.U.C. into a machine

to  be used for political ends - and the sop, a Trade

Union House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the P.A.P. Government is

continuing  to  implement  the  plans   which   the

previous  government introduced for the  relief  of

the  unemployed,  but I must say that  it  is  most

cruel on its part so suddenly to withdraw the issue

of  the ration of two katis of rice and one kati of

sugar.  We did not go round, Sir, like the  P.A.P.,

telling the people that we are a government for the

poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You are wrong!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> We just looked after the poor

and gave the poor their due. We have improved their

living  standard. And when introducing this  scheme

we  gave to unemployed, $3 a day, two katis of rice

and  a  kati of sugar for a day's work. The  P.A.P.

Government, immediately on taking office, took away

the  two  katis of rice and the one kati of  sugar.

Maybe  they have a different meaning in  their  own

dictionary. We fleeced the poor! We gave them  what

we  felt  was  fair for them to live  on.  And  the

P.A.P. Government has taken it away. And they claim

that they are the Government for the poor!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unemployment has grown since the P.A.P. came

into power and it is still growing. And to the hon.

Ministers   on  the  other  side  of   the   House,

unemployment  is a joke to them.  To  us  it  is  a

serious matter.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> You

are unemployed!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, not only has unemployment

grown,  but  there is now greater under-employment.

The  hawkers are earning less, the taxi-drivers are

earning  less,  the farmers are earning  less,  and

there  are  many  other types of  workers  who  are

earning less-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Like the Opposition Members!

[Laughter].



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, it is indeed a matter for

regret that the Government should feel this  is  an

occasion  to  laugh, when the Opposition  tries  to

point out to the Government the serious nature  of

the  problem  that  faces  them  today.  All  these

people,  Sir,  are  earning less  and  the  vicious

circle  goes round and round. All these  have  been

brought  about  by  a  feeling  of  uncertainty,  a

feeling  of insecurity and a foreboding of  greater

hardship to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an almost complete cessation of

building  and the reason has already been  advanced

by  the  Member  for  Tanglin.  This  cessation  of

building  has brought about hardship to the  allied

industries - brickmaking,    sawmilling,    furniture

making,  and  so  on. Sir, in  spite  of  what  the

Government may feel, we in the Opposition will keep

a  watchful  eye on how the Government  is  solving

this  growing  unemployment problem.  We  will  co-operate to the full in any measure that is good. We

feel  strongly,  Sir, that the  withdrawal  of  the

issue  of  rations is not in the interests  of  the

poor  and  we would urge upon the Government - and  I

would  plead with the Government - that the issue  of

these rations be restored.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now refer to Hansard Vol. 11, No. 1, col.

11. I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rural people will also be encouraged to build

kampong  roads and assist in carrying  out  kampong

drainage  schemes. The building  materials  in  all

instances will be provided by Government."



<br><br>Sir,  while this kind of encouragement  is  a  very

good  thing during normal times, we feel  that  the

building of kampong roads and the carrying  out  of

kampong  drainage  schemes  should  be  among   the

projects for the Government to provide relief work.

We hope the Government will do this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, again in col. 10 of Hansard under the heading

"National Development" I see these words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...re-organise the various subordinate organs

under  the  Ministry  to eliminate  duplication  of

functions and wasteful expenditure.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would remind the Government of what their

Party leaders said during



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>



the election campaign. They said that this proposed

reorganisation  would not be to  the  detriment  of

City  Council employees, that is to say, they would

not  lose  their  jobs. I am  surprised  that  they

should have said this when they knew full well that

they  could not honour it. For how could  they?  Or

maybe  they have a different meaning to  the  words

"to eliminate duplication of functions and wasteful

expenditure"? This is another instance, Sir, of how

the  P.A.P. are going to enjoy the  reputation  of

honouring their public pronouncements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the debate on the City Council

(Suspension  and  Transfer of  Functions)  Bill,  I

reminded  the  Government that during the  election

campaign,  the  P.A.P. had stated  that  it  would

create  an  autonomous Board to  take  over  public

utilities.  I received no reply during that  debate

and I hope I will receive a reply now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, yesterday, the Member for Changi was waxing

eloquent on his charge that the previous government

had  let down Chinese education. This goes to  show

how   little  he  knows  of  the  subject.  He  had

conveniently  overlooked that it was  the  previous

government  which  appointed  the  1955   All-Party

Committee  on  Chinese  Education  and   that   the

education  policy had been brought into  line  with

the  recommendations  of that Committee.  Even  the

P.A.P.  Government now clearly says that it accepts

the  Report of this Committee. Furthermore, it  was

due to the previous government that Chinese schools

had  been  given their due place in  the  education

system   as   a   result   of  which   considerable

improvements  have taken place in Chinese  schools.

And  the  hon. Member seems to have forgotten  that

because of the strong and successful stand  of  the

previous government on multilingualism, it had been

made  possible  for him and his fellow  members  to

contest  the general elections and get  elected  to

this  Assembly  and,  for the first  time,  as  the

Deputy Prime Minister has said, Mandarin, Malay and

Tamil are heard in this Chamber.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, speaking generally on the

Speech, I do not see much difference in the  P.A.P.

policy  at all, apart from certain aspects such  as

making Malay the national language, the creation of

a  Ministry of Culture, and so on. Most of what  is

in  the  Speech  is  a  continuation  of  what  the

previous government has been doing. Of course, I do

admit  it - and admit it here - that the difference  is

in  the approach to the problems. The P.A.P. claims

that  it  has  a more dynamic and a more  realistic

approach  and  it  claims that it can  deliver  the

goods.  I  would  like to end my  speech,  Sir,  by

wishing  them  the  very  best  of  luck  in  their

endeavours in the task ahead.



<br><br>3.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, this Government, returned  with

the   overwhelming  support  of  the   people   and

responsible  to them, considers that its  paramount

duty  is  to  provide its citizens  with  the  best

education that it can afford to give.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education is the largest single head of

expenditure,  costing $63½ million  or  nearly  a

quarter of the Budget, and we should get full value

for  this money. Capital development costs  another

$8.2 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past colonial educational system must be

changed so that our citizens will have a purpose in

life; be proud of being citizens of a new State, be

loyal  to it and be so trained in our schools  that

they  can be quickly employed and help build up  an

industrialised society. They must be taught to  use

their   hands  with  their  brains.  "White-collar"

mentality   belongs  to  the  colonial  past.   New

education begins.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's education policy is based on

three  main principles. Firstly, the acceptance  of

the  1955 All Party Report on Chinese Education  of

the  last Assembly provides for equal treatment  in

respect  of the four streams of education: English,

Chinese, Malay and Tamil in the order in which  the

number of pupils are to be found in our schools. In

view of the previous emphasis on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>



English   education   by  past  Governments,   this

Government will, in order to bring about parity  of

treatment,  pay much greater attention to  Chinese,

Malay  and  Tamil schools in the years ahead  until

such time as the appropriate balance is reached. It

is necessary to add, Mr Speaker, Sir, that it does

not  mean  that English education will be curtailed

or  suppressed. It is simply a change in  emphasis;

to restore justice and thus bring about the desired

equality   of  status  of  education   with   Asian

languages as the media of instruction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the acceptance of Malay as the national

language  by  this  Government  implies  that   the

Ministry  of Education will have to translate  this

into  a  living  reality.  This  brings  about  yet

another  change  in  emphasis  in  the  educational

system as known in the past. According to the  All-Party  Committee  Report, it  aimed  at  bi-lingual

education   for  primary  schools  and   bi-lingual

education for secondary schools. To non-Malays,  it

will  now mean that the Malay language will  assume

its importance next to their own mother tongue.  It

will  become the second and not the third  language

for  non-Malays: but as there are  only  400  Malay

teachers  or  4 per cent of teachers looking  after

16,000 pupils in 69 Malay schools and a few classes

in   English  schools,  the  first  task  of   this

Government  is  to produce a sufficient  number  of

teachers  in order to be able to teach Malay  as  a

regular  subject in schools. With this in  view,  a

special  two-year course in Malay  was  inaugurated

three  weeks ago at the Teachers. Training  College

and  whilst it was originally intended to start off

with a first enrolment of 1,080 teachers, owing  to

the  great  enthusiasm and response from  qualified

teachers, the first batch of qualified teachers now

studying  Malay, Mr Speaker, is l,560 - made  up  of

1,088  teachers  from  English  schools,  440  from

Chinese  schools, 26 from teachers teaching English

in  Malay  schools, and 6 from Tamil schools..  The

second  enrolment  of  1,000  will  take  place  in

January 1960, and a further 1,000 in July 1960. The

standard  aimed  at is the Government  Standard  II

Examination and teachers should begin to take  this

examination in December



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>



1960,  after  which  they will  receive  a  special

professional course of training to teach  Malay  in

schools,  so that by the middle of 1961, the  first

batch of teachers will graduate and we shall be  in

the  happy position of being able to provide a  few

teachers  in  every Singapore school, whatever  its

media  of instruction, to teach Malay as a  regular

subject. However, until we have sufficient teachers

able  to  teach  Malay  as  a  regular  subject  in

schools, it shall remain an optional subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most gratifying experiences to date,

Mr Speaker, has been the immediate and spontaneous

response  to the study of Malay from all  quarters.

Requests for syllabuses have been received  by  the

Ministry   from  the  University  of  Malaya,   the

Singapore  Council  of Adult Education,  commercial

firms and individuals. It has been decided to  give

the  fullest publicity to the syllabus in the Press

and  the  Ministry will be pleased  to  assist  all

interested  parties in their efforts to make  Malay

the national language grow and flourish; and it  is

the  intention of the Ministry to make it  possible

for  those  now  doing private study  to  take  the

Government examination if they so desire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there will be a revision in the

curriculum  in schools in order that emphasis  will

be  on  practical  subjects  like  mathematics  and

science  and in the study of the various  languages

of  Singapore. It is not intended to scrap subjects

like  history or geography, if only to give a  good

general and rounding-off in education. However,  it

is  only  natural that in the awards for  bursaries

and scholarships there will be a bias towards those

who   will   take  subjects  which  are  considered

desirable by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I would like to answer the Member for

Tanglin  in his approach towards the six-day  week.

It  has  been  felt  by  many  parents  that  their

children have been rushed in their school work  and

had  to  make  up with long hours of  home-work  at

home.  With this partly in mind and the  fact  that

the  curriculum  in schools does  not  give  enough

emphasis to the study of languages, this Government

has decided on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>



the  six-day week so that the pupils may spend more

time in schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Automatic promotion in primary schools, which has

been  going on for the past eight years, is  to  be

stopped  owing  to deterioration in the  standards,

both  of  the  pupils' work and  the  work  of  the

teachers.  Another  reason for  stopping  automatic

promotion  in  primary  schools  is  to  allay  the

unnecessary  fear,  amounting to hysteria,  arising

out  of  the weeding out of thousands of  children,

mentioned  by  the  Member for Tanglin,  after  the

common  entrance examination for secondary  schools

in   the  English  medium.  With  the  disposal  of

automatic promotion in primary schools, this common

entrance   examination   will   be   just   another

examination along the line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the proposed Education Advisory Council is

appointed,  in which the four streams of  education

will be adequately represented, renewed work on the

revision  of  syllabuses and the Malayanisation  of

text-books will be started in earnest,  and  it  is

the  aim  of  the Education Ministry  to  see  that

Malayanised text-books will be in use  by  1961.  I

have lots of complaints from parents regarding  the

cost  of  education in our schools - frequent changes

of  text-books, yearly and so forth. That is why it

has  been  necessary for me to state that for  1960

there  shall be no change in text-books,  and  that

they  can  continue to use text-books for 1959,  if

that is possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In anticipation of the remarks by the Member for

Tanglin regarding secondary education and its great

demand,   the  Government  has  decided  that   all

secondary  schools should also be on a  two-session

basis from 1960. Since it is Government's policy to

provide  more  vocational and technical  education,

consideration  will be given for the conversion  of

some of these secondary schools for vocational  and

technical secondary education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I shall deal with the Member for

Cairnhill who, it is to be remembered, was the last

Minister for Education in the last Government,  and

now warms a chair on the opposite



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>



side of this House. In 1956 there was a fanfare  of

trumpets  when  two  so-called secondary  technical

schools  were  built, namely,  Tanjong  Katong  and

Queenstown  secondary  technical  schools.  To  my

horror,  I  have  discovered that  these  so-called

technical  secondary  schools  are  just   ordinary

grammar  schools. As from today, these two  schools

will  be  known as Tanjong Katong Secondary  School

and  Queenstown  Secondary  School,  not  secondary

technical  schools. This action of  mine,  I  hope,

will  not  be  called  into  question  by  my   two

colleagues, the Minister for Home Affairs  and  the

Minister for Culture, who are the guardians of  our

morals.  By  this  act,  I  am  tearing  away   the

proverbial  fig-leaf  from the  last  Minister  for

Education,  as  I wish to show him  up,  naked  and

ashamed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was my unfortunate distinction to have been

called  to order by you, Mr Speaker, on  the  very

first  day of this Assembly; and yesterday  I  also

had  the doubtful pleasure of being called to order

again.  I shall try very hard, Mr Speaker, not  to

be  called to order a third time, and not to let it

go  down on record that a certain Minister had been

called  to order every day of an Assembly  sitting.

So  I  shall, in the true parliamentary  democratic

style, state that this term "technical" attached to

the  two schools was a terminological inexactitude.

Parliamentary democracy is so long-winded, and I am

a  man  of little words. I have joined the People's

Action Party because of the action it produces, not

verbal  diarrhoea, which we have come  across  from

certain politicians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conscious of the needs to educate as many of the

citizens  as possible and to make good the  neglect

of  the past, this Government has decided to launch

out  on  a  mass  literacy and education  campaign.

Although  it  would  appear that  every  child  who

requires  an education is being catered  for,  with

321,000   pupils  in  our  primary  and   secondary

schools, this is far from the truth. There are many

who are unable to be in our schools because of over-age,  poverty,  or  ignorance.  Already  more  than

50,000  pupils  have  registered  for  entry   into

Primary 1 for 1960.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a large section of our adult

population,  some of whom work during the  day  and

others who are unemployed unfortunately, who attend

night  classes  to better themselves  with  further

education.   The   Singapore  Council   for   Adult

Education alone has an enrolment of 14,000.  It  is

the   intention  of  the  Education   Ministry   to

reorganise  and to expand this work, so that  those

desiring  education will be given proper syllabuses

and receive instruction from qualified instructors.

Night  sessions can be properly staffed instead  of

being   manned   by   part-time  instructors   with

indifferent syllabuses or text-books.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present most school buildings at night are

dark  and empty. It is the aim of this Ministry  to

have  as  many of its school buildings as  possible

aglow  and  active, so that they will  become  true

beacons  of  light  to those  who  desire  to  seek

knowledge and to leave the darkness of illiteracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it will be asked how the Ministry expects to

carry out this ambitious programme of a two-session

basis for elementary and secondary schools, and  at

the  same  time  attempt  to  bring  about  a  mass

literacy and education campaign for the first  time

in  the  history of this country. Will it entail  a

further  increase to the already weighty  Education

budget?  The Ministry happily does not  think  that

such a step is necessary, because our recent survey

revealed that maximum use has not been made of  the

available   school  buildings   and   staff,   both

administrative and teaching. At present, in English

primary school buildings alone, by working on a two-session   basis,  there  will  be  at   least   850

classrooms  available for pupils  next  year.  Each

classroom  normally  holds 40 pupils.  At  present,

most  schools  have a separate principal  for  each

session.  There is a case of one principal  looking

after   a   17-classroom  school  with   11   empty

classes - i.e. only six classes in session. There  is

no  reason  why one principal cannot look  after  a

school  with two sessions, with a slight adjustment

to working hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear that we can do more to meet the needs

of   education,   if  we  organise  all   available

facilities both in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>



buildings,  equipment and manpower.  Therefore,  as

from  1960  every teacher in Government  and  Aided

schools  will be required to put in, as a  part  of

ordinary duty and not for payment as overtime work,

a maximum of an extra one-half session. The teacher

who  normally teaches in a morning session  may  be

posted   to  do  an  extra  half-session   in   the

afternoon,  or an extra half-session at night,  and

vice-versa. Night session classes will begin from 7

to 10 p.m. Having been a school-master, as the hon.

Member for Tanglin stated earlier this afternoon, I

can assure Members of the House that the extra half-session   required  of  teachers  will  not   cause

teachers  to do more hours than office workers,  of

course,  after  taking  into  account  their   free

periods during school hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many reasons for deciding on this bold

move,  only possible from a P.A.P. Government,  and

it  is  hoped that the 10,000 teachers  in  service

will  respond to this call with proper  spirit  and

enthusiasm, and thus fulfil their important role as

nation builders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Education bill at 25 per cent of the

Budget  is  already high, and it  is  inconceivable

that  the  public would agree to an  increase  when

other  urgent demands for social services, such  as

easing of unemployment and housing will have to  be

met as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as also remarked by the hon. Member for

Tanglin,  those who are conscientious teachers  are

already  doing such extra hours voluntarily  unsung

and  unknown, for example, going back to school for

sports duties, library work, extra curricula  work,

and  laboratory work. Of course, I do  not  include

work  in  Sunday schools. This new ruling therefore

recognizes  such  good  work and  distributes  work

evenly amongst the staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the extra half-session does not

necessarily mean teaching duties alone. It includes

extra  curricula work mentioned just now.  It  will

also  include committee work on educational  bodies

approved  of by the Ministry, because the  Ministry

expects much more of such committee



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>



work in its implementation of the new programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, as a result of this extra half-session

work,  a  large pool of teachers will be  available

for posting elsewhere, not outside of Singapore, of

course.  It  will  then  be  possible  for  greater

intermingling of teachers in the various streams of

education,   and   immediately   bring   about   an

improvement  in the standard of language  teaching;

for   example,   Chinese   school   teachers   will

immediately  improve the standard  of  teaching  of

Chinese  in  English schools and vice  versa.  This

will  also  be a big step forward in breaking  down

the  walls  of  segregation between  the  different

streams of education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, at present, physical education is not

given  a proper place in the curriculum because  of

shortage  of teachers looking after this aspect  of

work. Games are also not as well organised owing to

lack of teachers taking an active interest in extra

curricula  activities. It is important to emphasise

that  education  is  not just  book  learning.  All

aspects  of  development of the growing human  body

and mind come within the scope of education, and it

is the aim of the Ministry of Education to raise  a

happy,  strong  and  healthy population  under  its

educational programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to higher education, it should be

mentioned   that   the  report  of   the   Prescott

Commission on Nanyang University will be  published

shortly.  It  should also be remembered  that  this

Commission was initiated by the Nanyang University,

and  that the members of this Commission were  also

proposed  by  them  and approved  of  by  the  past

Government. When the Prescott Report is  published,

this  Government will take active steps to  discuss

the  future of Nanyang University and its graduates

with  responsible Chinese educational  bodies.  The

Government  will  also encourage  the  closest  co-operation  between  Nanyang  University   and   the

University  of Malaya, as it is in the interest  of

Singapore  that  the  two  institutions  of  higher

learning should work in close harmony.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 185</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, let us recollect that

before  the  P.A.P. took office in the  Government,

its educational policy was appropriately called the

spring   source  of  the  nation.  This  Government

recognizes that the children of Singapore  are  the

spring  source of our nation. If we take good  care

of  it, the spring will develop into a stream which

will nourish an oasis; if we neglect it, the spring

will be lost in the sands of the desert.



<br><br>4.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, speaking on

the  motion  moved  by  the Deputy  Prime  Minister

yesterday,  most of the Members on  the  Government

side  stressed  its  aims for  the  improvement  of

Singapore,  but did not stress definite  plans  for

this  improvement. In his speech, the Deputy  Prime

Minister reminded us of his Party's victory in  the

elections and that it has formed the Government, as

though it is only the P.A.P. which is truly working

hard  in  the interests of the people of Singapore.

They forget that their success today is through the

efforts  of all political Parties in Singapore  and

particularly  of the Members of the past  Assembly,

which have resulted in the Constitution under which

we now have self-government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to mention these matters because of the

attitude  of  the Government in this Assembly  that

Opposition Members are trying to hinder the efforts

which  it  is making for the good of the people  of

Singapore. We have reiterated several times in  the

debate  that  the duties of the Opposition  are  to

make   constructive  criticism  and  to  give   co-operation  to  the Government in carrying  out  any

programme   which  is  good  for  the   people   of

Singapore.  I  think  it  is  undemocratic  if  the

attitude  is that the Opposition cannot  voice  its

opinions  or  criticise  the  Government.  Such  an

attitude  shows how far the Government is from  the

desire  to  consolidate  the  various  peoples   of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be remembered, Mr Speaker, that we

have often said that the P.A.P. has been successful

in forming the Government by the votes of only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 186</b></font><br><br>



54  per  cent of the people, and that there are  46

per  cent  of the electorate who still do not  have

faith in the P.A.P. Government and do not support its

policy.  If  the P.A.P. Government  works  for  the

benefit of the people irrespective of whether  they

like   the  P.A.P. or  not,  the  Government   can

consolidate  and  unite  the  people  of  Singapore

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say that the way the Government

is  carrying out its work, without careful thought,

such as cutting the pay of Government employees, is

not good. This is a step which has given rise to  a

feeling of unrest among the employees because  they

feel as though the Government is now taking revenge

on  those  who are mainly from the English-educated

class. I am of this opinion because I often read in

the  newspapers that the P.A.P. leaders have stated

that  the main body of the educated people did  not

vote for the P.A.P. - meaning, most of the Government

employees.  So not long after the P.A.P. held  the

reins of Government, it took action to cut the  pay

of  Government  employees. This appears  to  be  in

implementation  of  what has  been  stated  in  the

papers.  This  will surely create the feeling  that

whatever  is  said by the P.A.P. it will  put  into

practice.  So,  Mr Speaker, I hope that  the  step

carried  out to cut the pay of Government employees

is not one of revenge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that I have to speak on this matter, Mr

Speaker, Sir, because the step which has been taken

is,  first of all, taken in a hurry. Secondly,  the

Government  has stated, as mentioned in the  speech

of  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara, that the cuts  in

pay have been imposed on those who are most able to

afford  them. What surprises me is that the opinion

of  the  Government  seems to  be  that  Government

employees  belong to that class of people  who  are

most  able  to  bear pay-cuts. I  believe  that  in

Singapore, Government officials are not all  living

a  very  easy life because they have duties towards

their   families   and  their  earnings   are,   as

acknowledged  by  the Government, just  sufficient,

and  commensurate  with their  responsibilities  in

Government service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 187</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the points which concern the efforts of

Government  and which attract my attention  is  the

method  of  bringing  the people  together  as  one

nation.  But  I  believe these  efforts  will  take

considerable  time  and  energy.  The   effort   to

consolidate  the  views of these  people  who  have

different   languages,   different   cultures   and

different religions is one which, as I have  stated

earlier, will take a long time and a lot of  energy

to  carry  out. Therefore, if it is true  that  the

Government wishes to carry out what it has  stated,

steps  should be taken from now to consolidate  and

bring  together  these people who  are  of  various

races in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the steps which probably the

Government  has not seen fit to take is the  effort

to  raise  the standard of living of the Malays  in

Singapore so that they could live on the same level

as   that   which  has  been  achieved   by   other

communities. I say this, Sir, not because I wish to

raise  the question of communalism. This, I  myself

know,  is dangerous. But what I would like  to  say

is:  Can we bring together all these races if there

are   communities   which  are  still   living   in

conditions   far   below   those   of   the   other

communities? I do not wish to say here,  nor  do  I

wish  to demand the right, but what I wish to  draw

the  attention of this Assembly to is that we today

are  progressing under the constitution of a  self-governing State of Singapore. How did we  go  about

to  shape this constitution? At the time when  this

constitution was formulated, we almost met with,  I

do  not  say, a deadlock, but I could say, a course

that could be very difficult to follow. We are glad

today  that we have reached a successful conclusion

in  framing this constitution. In this constitution

there  is one chapter - in fact in its preamble - where

it   is  mentioned  that  the  Government  will  be

responsible for safe-guarding the special  position

of   the  Malays,  for  supporting,  fostering  and

promoting their interests in all fields. But I see,

in  the efforts of the Government to carry out  all

the requirements as contained in this constitution,

no mention at all about this. So, Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 188</b></font><br><br>



Speaker, Sir, this is a matter which makes us  feel

very  concerned, especially on the part of my Party

which  has  fought  very hard to  bring  about  the

inclusion  of all this, in the constitution.  I  do

not  know  whether  the present Government  is  now

going ahead with another constitution. But if  this

is  a  matter  which has been done unintentionally,

then I urge that this matter be put right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, I would like to say something

about the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am sorry for that interruption.

There was some difficulty with the interpretation.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, in the

debate on the transfer of power to the Ministry  of

National Development, I have drawn the attention of

the Government to-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I wonder if the Leader of the

House  would agree that we adjourn for half-an-hour

for tea?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I so agree, Sir.

<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.15 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, continuing with my  speech,  the

Member for Anson stated that I work in order to get

a  name.  I would like to emphasise that I  have  a

mandate   from  the  inhabitants  of  the  Southern

Islands  to convey to this House matters concerning

improvement  of  their living  conditions.  When  I

mentioned  that  the  efforts of  the  Ministry  of

National  Development in relation to  the  Southern

Islands  are  carried out without any communication

to  me,  this does not mean that I am objecting  to

the  efforts  made  by  the  Ministry  of  National

Development.  What I hope is that I will  be  in  a

position to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 189</b></font><br><br>



participate and help the Government in solving  the

problems  of the people in the Southern Islands.  I

know that we are here not to improve any particular

ward  but we are here specifically for the interest

of the people of Singapore as a whole. From what  I

can gather, the Southern Islands is a ward which is

very backward compared to other areas at present in

Singapore. I fear that a casual survey conducted by

the  Minister  for  National Development  will  not

bring about an improvement in the living conditions

of the people there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two things which I find important

there: firstly, the education of the people in  the

Southern  Islands  is lagging far  behind  compared

with the education of the people in other wards  in

Singapore; secondly, many facilities on the islands

are  inadequate. The Government, as I have read  in

the  newspapers, make a hue and cry about this  and

that - for   instance,  to  help  the  fishermen   by

providing  them with fishing equipment or  gear.  I

feel  that such assistance alone will not have  its

desired  effect  on the future generations  of  the

inhabitants  there. The reason why I  say  this  is

that  despite the Government's efforts  to  provide

equipment or fishing gear for the fishermen  there,

many capitalists or financiers have stepped in  and

undertaken   to  provide  the  required  equipment.

Because  they are unable to overcome oppression  by

the capitalists, although they are in possession of

adequate  equipment  which  can  result   in   good

catches,  their income is still far from  adequate.

It  is  imperative  for the Government  to  provide

several co-operative societies which can look after

and control their income and their earnings. As  it

is  at  present,  although there  are  co-operative

societies,   these   societies   have   not    been

functioning. They are lacking in guidance,  in  the

true  sense  of  the  word,  from  the  authorities

concerned. Therefore, I state that it is imperative

for  the  Government to improve  such  a  state  of

affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point which I have discovered in

the speech by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. There  is

an absence on the part of the Government to mention

steps or efforts to deter Communist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 190</b></font><br><br>



subversion  among  the  people  of  Singapore.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, with the Government side saying  that

the Government is a non-Communist Government but is

not  taking steps to prevent Communist infiltration

among  the  people.  I fear that  this  absence  to

mention steps to deter Communist subversion will be

a  serious threat in the future. We have  seen  how

States  which  failed  to  take  steps  to  prevent

Communist  infiltration have resulted in chaos  and

trouble  in  those  States.  Consequently,  several

lives   were   lost  as  a  result   of   Communist

activities.   Therefore,   before   such    matters

eventuate,  it  is necessary for the Government  to

stress  the  steps to be taken in order to  prevent

Communist infiltration in the island of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In concluding my speech, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like to remind that, in our efforts to bring

about  unity among the people of Singapore, serious

attention must be paid to bringing about parity  in

the  livelihood  of  the people of  Singapore  with

particular  reference to the Malays  who,  I  would

unhesitatingly say, are far lagging behind  in  all

walks of life.



<br><br>5.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Inche Yaacob bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, at the outset, I thank

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara who delivered his speech

on  policies which embody the substance  which  has

become  the basis for this Government to  formulate

its   Five-Year  Plan  in  order  to  establish   a

prosperous society. What is more pleasing  is  that

the  Malay language, which was previously mentioned

by  the  ex-Minister for Education of Singapore  as

being  a language fit only for those who wished  to

become  peons, or policemen, etc., is  today  being

written  down  in the history of Singapore  because

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara of Singapore delivered

his  speech  in  Malay, which is  accepted  as  the

national  language by the present  Government,  and

this  cannot  be  denied by anyone.  In  fact,  the

previous  Government did not have  the  courage  to

fight for the Malay language and to claim it as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 191</b></font><br><br>



the  sole  national language of this  country.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I again emphasise, on this  question

of  a national language, if we view especially  the

Government's education policy which has been  drawn

up  and which can be implemented, it clearly  shows

that  the objectives of the present Government will

not  remain  in theory only but will  be  put  into

practice,  and  it  will be shown  that  the  Malay

language  is being fought for and being implemented

as the sole national language on this island and on

the  same  footing  as it is in the  Federation  of

Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are going to analyse the points one by one

contained in the speech made by the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara, I think that will take a long time, because

analysing  the plan takes as much time  as  putting

into   practice   the  Five-Year   plan   of   this

Government.  But  I  wish to clarify  here  certain

matters  in  the  Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech,

which  have caused dissatisfaction on the  part  of

the  Opposition  Members. Firstly, the  Member  for

Mountbatten  expressed her fears over the  measures

taken  by  the Government in cutting allowances.  I

feel  this measure of cutting allowances is a  very

bold  step taken by the Government in the interests

of  our  State, which is faced with the problem  of

finance.  This courageous step should  be  accepted

with   calmness  and  goodwill  by  all  concerned,

because,  in actual fact, the allowances that  have

been  cut  contribute towards the finances  of  the

State  which  is facing financial difficulty.  This

contribution prevents the loss of the  islands  off

Singapore, as we have seen in the past the sale  of

Christmas  Island, but the Government  led  by  the

P.A.P. will not go begging for money in  order  to

fill its coffers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Geylang Serai expressed his fears

because  the  Deputy Prime Minister who  moved  the

motion  did not mention any matters except that  of

the  policy  of  the P.A.P. This cannot  be  denied

because before we gained self-government the speech

by  the Governor was made by himself, but this time

the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 192</b></font><br><br>



was prepared by the Cabinet of the governing Party,

and  therefore  coincides with the  policy  of  the

Party that is governing the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussing the abolition of the City Council in

the  previous session, the Member said  we  do  not

give opportunities for the people to administer the

State,  which will result in the emergence of  many

leaders;  but we should remember that  this  matter

has already been finalised. There is no need for me

to  raise this matter again in this Assembly, as it

is  a  waste  of  time. If there  exist  many  more

bodies, they will only delay the functions  of  the

Government. The main question that aroused the fear

of  the  Member  for Geylang Serai is  nationalism.

What kind of nationalism shall we form? And what is

the basis? Is it Malay? That, briefly, is the cause

of the fear expressed by the Opposition Member, the

Member for Geylang Serai. I feel it is not an  easy

matter  to  unite the races of so many  diversified

religions  and colour, but it is equally impossible

for a father or a mother to produce children of the

same  size,  the same black hair. Therefore,  in  a

State with a multi-racial population, the basis for

the  consolidation of the people is the feeling  of

undivided allegiance to that State, and it is  this

policy  that has become the basis for the  struggle

of  the  P.A.P. in its fight to establish a Malayan

nation on this island. Concerning the fears of  the

said  Member when he mentioned a society  which  he

referred  to  as  Malayan,  but  non-Communist,  it

should not be stated that Malaya is separated  from

Singapore.  What should be stated is  a  socialist,

non-Communist Malaya. It is clear that the  P.A.P.,

which  holds  the  reins  of  government  now,   is

fighting  for  the  merger  of  Singapore  and  the

Federation  of  Malaya. Therefore,  if  we  do  not

mention a Malayan society, it follows that we allow

the  British  colonialists to split  Singapore  and

Malaya.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 193</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Member of the Government said yesterday, the

Member  for Tanglin expressed his fears and  doubts

about the relationship of the new State that it  is

without a captain. I think only people who have not

been on board a ship do not know who is the captain

and who are the crew. Also, because of shortage  of

funds,  the  Member  accused  this  Government   of

slaughtering their own staff first and robbing  the

property of others in order to help someone else. I

say that if we take money from the right pocket and

put  it  into the left pocket, it is not  stealing.

And  if  a ship wishes to make a safe journey,  the

holds of the ship should be well balanced. If it is

heavy  on  one side, it will be difficult  for  the

captain to navigate. For that reason and in fact it

is  true,  there are many people living on  a  high

level  and there are also many people living  on  a

low  level.  I was born in an attap hut  and  I  am

still  living in an attap hut, without  electricity

and without pipe water; and I know the difficulties

of  the  people. Therefore, the reduction of income

of  the  higher  class in order  to  build  up  the

coffers  of the lower income group is not  robbing,

but  merely to put right the imbalance. If  we  are

carrying  two  tins of water, and  if  one  tin  is

empty, do not fill the empty tin with stones.  That

is stupid. But divide the water equally in each tin

so  that there will be a proper balance. Also, with

regard to the cutting of allowances, the Member for

Tanglin  said that there are many parents who  have

complained, and asked their children to  economise.

This  shows that they can still economise. The poor

people cannot economise any longer. If we draw  the

sarong up, we cannot conceal the lower part, and if

we  conceal the lower part, the upper part will  be

seen. Therefore, to put the whole thing right, this

matter should be carefully considered. I think that

is better than to expose the whole body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in his speech, the Member for Tanglin mentioned that thousands of students had

been  dismissed from school. I think it is not  for

me  to  reply, because this incident did  not  take

place  during  the time of the present  Government,

but it took place



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 194</b></font><br><br>



when the past Government was in power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, because I have visited the Southern

Islands,  it  is proper that I give a clarification

concerning the remarks made by the Member  for  the

Southern  Islands, who has expressed his doubts  as

to the work carried out by the Ministry of National

Development.  The  Member for the Southern  Islands

said  that  the projects of the present Government,

mentioned  by  the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  in  his

speech, are according to their conception, not  for

the  people. I am completely surprised because they

know  that  this Government is a P.A.P. Government.

Every  government must follow its outlined  policy.

It  is  impossible for the P.A.P. Government, which

holds  the  reins of government now, to follow  the

policy of the Labour Front, or for that matter that

of  any other Party. They must remember that  every

programme  launched  by the Government,  especially

the  P.A.P. Government, was approved by the  people

on 30th May last.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning his allegation that, in the view of

the   Government,  the  Opposition  is   merely   a

hindrance,  it  is  not  true  to  say   that   the

Opposition   is  here  to  hinder.  If   we   allow

Opposition   Members  to  speak   for   four   days

consecutively, then time is lost. There is no doubt

about  that.  But  we  give an opportunity  to  the

Opposition  Members  to think further - whether  they

think  along the lines of the policy of the  P.A.P.

This  is not robbing, which has been misunderstood.

But  in  the  interests of the people of Singapore,

they  can give constructive criticisms. But if they

criticise for the sake of the outside group and not

for  the  people of Singapore, we will  defend  our

policy.   This   does  not   mean   that   we   are

undemocratic.  On this matter the  Member  for  the

Southern  Islands  and also other  Members  of  the

Opposition  have  stated that  the  P.A.P. victory

represented  only 54 per cent of the  electorate - 54

per  cent  only  of the electorate  voted  for  the

P.A.P. in the elections. They say that this  means

that  there is still a balance of 46 per  cent  who

did not vote. They forget that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 195</b></font><br><br>



46  per  cent is divided amongst various  political

Parties  represented  by  the  Opposition.  On  the

average, more than half of these Parties voted  for

the present Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the steps to cut the allowance of

Government employees, which they alleged was  taken

in revenge because they did not vote for P.A.P.,  I

think  there  are some Members who are taking  this

opportunity to inflame the feelings of those people

who  are dissatisfied, and who oppose the programme

of   the  Government.  But  if  we  consider   this

carefully,  the  cut  in the  allowances  does  not

damage the economy of their domestic life at  home.

I  myself  have lived on $80 a month with seven  or

eight  dependants,  and,  including  myself,   nine

people. It is not a headache to me. If these people

suffer  a reduction of $250 - some only $20 - I do  not

think  it will be a burden to them. It is necessary

that the people who can afford it should contribute

if  they  really  love the State  which  is  facing

financial difficulty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are people who mention

that  the  consolidation of the  various  races  of

Singapore into one people will take a long time. We

admit that. Therefore we do not admit that when the

P.A.P.  Government  is in power,  we  can  tomorrow

evolve  one nation in Singapore. So we must mention

a  Malayan  nation, and this is being practised  in

the  Federation of Malaya. Here I would like to say

that  in  the headline news appearing on the  front

page  of  today's paper, the Utusan  Melayu,  dated

Friday,  17th  July,  the Tunku  said  not  to  use

communal sentiments. This means that the leaders in

the  Federation of Malaya are fully  aware  of  the

dangers  which will arise in a State  comprising  a

plural society. The P.A.P. Government is constantly

aware of this and vehemently opposes any element or

group  which tries to inflame communal feelings  in

the  State of Singapore. This, I think, is in  line

with  the  attitude  of  the Federation  Government

which is led by Dato Abdul Razak.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 196</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, on this issue there are people who put forward the question whether we can bring about

this  unity, this one nation, if there is a section

of  the people who are very much backward? I  would

like  to  emphasise  that in a  socialist  society,

there is no class distinction. Therefore, if we say

that we are going to fight for the poor people, the

livelihood of the poor will be brought up to a  par

with the middle class. If the livelihood is low  we

will  raise  it up to the same level of the  middle

class, so that the livelihood of all the people  of

Singapore will be on a par. If there is a community

which  is lagging behind, then we say that  we  are

going to raise the standard of living of the people

who  are  oppressed.  We will  try  to  uplift  the

livelihood of these people to the same level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for the Southern

Islands  has  said that the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara

did not mention in his speech the special rights of

the  Malays. On this matter, permit me to speak  in

the  debate,  as  I see there is a  debate  on  the

amendment   moved   by  the  Member   for   Kampong

Kembangan.  I  would  like to emphasise  that  this

Government is based on the present constitution  in

which   the  special  rights  of  the  Malays   are

mentioned.   This  is  in  the  preamble   of   the

constitution.  Therefore, if  the  running  of  the

government is based on this Constitution, it  means

that  the  P.A.P. Government respects and will  put

into  effect  the special rights of the  Malays  as

embodied  in the preamble of the constitution.  But

we  do not wish to take pride in saying that we are

going  to  fight for the rights of the  Malays.  We

wish  to show it by deeds. If we are going to fight

only  in  theory  but  not  in  practice,  that  is

deceiving the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the P.A.P. Government has been formed a few months, and I have been appointed to

take   office   in   the   Ministry   of   National

Development. As far as I know, among the people  of

Singapore  who  are  the  most  depressed  are  the

inhabitants of the Southern Islands. In  the  main,

they  comprise Malays. Therefore, I have been given

the  task  of making an investigation and rendering

all possible assistance to them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 197</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my efforts seem to have caused dissatisfaction

to  the Member for the Southern Islands because  he

was not invited to accompany the team which visited

one island after another in the course of its work.

Therefore,  I  feel,  Mr  Speaker,  that   it   is

necessary  that I should stress that my  visit  was

not  in  my capacity as the Member for Bukit Timah,

to investigate someone else's area but my visit was

made  in my capacity as the representative  of  the

Primary  Production  Department.  As  Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Ministry of National Development,

I   wished   to   investigate  to  get   first-hand

information. Therefore my visit to the Islands came

under  my official capacity. If every investigation

made  by the Government has to be notified  to  the

Member  concerned, I am afraid that the  Government

administration would not run smoothly.  It  may  be

that  even notice servers, if they wanted to  serve

notices,  would be obliged to inform the Member  of

the  division  concerned. It is very difficult  for

the  Government  to run a State or a  country  like

this.  So,  on this issue, I would like to  clarify

that   the  P.A.P.  Government  is  always   giving

priority to the most backward places with a view to

helping  them  first.  Mr  Speaker,  it  has  been

admitted  by  the  Member for the Southern  Islands

that  the  backward  areas  require  education  and

attention  to  be  given to the livelihood  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not my intention to make a full report of

my  visit  and  what  I  did  there.  But  for  the

information of the Member for the Southern Islands,

I would like to say that all these difficulties and

all  the  backwardness are the results of the  past

Colonial government. They must have forgotten  this

section  of  the  people who live in  the  Southern

Islands. This is clear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to draw the attention of this House to the

efforts  of the past Government. There was  in  the

year  1957  a  vote  for  the  development  of  the

Southern Islands amounting to $80,000, but in  1958

the vote was reduced to $60,000, and in 1959 it was

further reduced to $45,000. From the point of  view

of  people who think like children, this means that

if the vote is less, then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 198</b></font><br><br>



the area is very well developed. But this is to the

contrary.  This  is  most  regrettable  because  it

showed   that   the  officers  from  the   Ministry

responsible  for  the management  of  the  Southern

Islands  did not know how to make use  of  the  sum

voted.  I  repeat that in 1957, out of  a  vote  of

$80,000, only more than $8,000 was spent; in  1958,

out  of  $60,000, only more than $12,000 was spent.

The  balance went to the Government. It means  that

the  people of the Southern Islands did not receive

any help at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, out of the $45,000 voted until the

12th  of  April,  only $175 has  been  spent.  This

clearly  shows  that  the past Government  had  the

money but they did not know how to use it. For that

reason  we  hurriedly went to the Southern  Islands

without  a permit from the Member for the  Southern

Islands  because  I know the conditions  there  are

very backward, and if we are to wait for permission

from  each  division,  it  is  possible  that   the

Government cannot function smoothly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning education, I know what conditions will

exist in the Southern Islands, if no positive  step

is  taken by the Government. I think as to the fate

and  destiny of the people in the Southern Islands,

their children will be bequeathed with a much  more

depressed  state  of  life than  that  which  their

forefathers    experienced.   The    re-orientation

programme which was carried out last year  was  not

implemented  in the Southern Islands because  of  a

shortage of teachers. Therefore, they only  receive

Malay  education  today. On this matter  also,  the

programme of the Malay Education Council, which was

accepted  by the Government in 1957, has  not  been

carried out to the full in the Southern Islands. So

much  so  that  there is no teacher  to  teach  the

subject  of  English  or religion,  the  Government

having  failed  to  send teachers  to  teach  these

subjects there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, I wish to emphasise, on the

state  of the Southern Islanders, that if there  is

no effort to resettle them or improve conditions, I

think  they  will face a bleak future  because  the

Islands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 199</b></font><br><br>



will shrink through erosion and the fishing grounds

will  become  very  limited. This  will  result  in

hardship  for  the people, and their children  will

have  no further opportunity for education. On some

of  the  islands there is a school with 30  pupils,

but  consider how we are going to educate 30 pupils

up  to  Standard VII with only two, three or  seven

teachers. If we do not find new ways and means, the

people will face hardship in future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly with the livelihood of the people. We

are not a Party which likes to boast, as alleged by

the  Member for Southern Islands who said  that  it

was  far from the truth that we were going to  help

the fishermen in the Southern Islands. However,  we

did  visit  them,  made  investigations  and  would

render  any help that is required by them. But  the

Member for Southern Islands was not even aware that

I  was in the Southern Islands! It would only be  a

fuss  to publicise, say, a visit there on such  and

such  a date by the Parliamentary Secretary to  the

Minister  for National Development, or by  a  party

from the Primary Production Department. We make our

visits  quietly, get the results, and then announce

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, on the establishment of co-operative

societies  or  on  the question of capitalists  who

have  oppressed the fishermen, we already know  the

position and have a plan which will be carried  out

in the not too distant future, and which the Member

for  the  Southern Islands will then know.  In  the

meantime, I would like to say to the Member for the

Southern Islands, who has expressed doubts  because

he had no opportunity of being with the party, that

on the co-operation which he has promised we of the

Government  say. `Thank you', and I am prepared  to

accept  complaints  from  Opposition  Members   for

submission  to my Minister. If the suggestions  are

good,  we  will willingly accept them. However,  we

cannot  inform the Member for the Southern  Islands

of all our efforts because, as a Government, we are

responsible  to all the people, and if  the  Member

for  the  Southern Islands wishes to  be  similarly

responsible, the best way is for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 200</b></font><br><br>



him  to  cross the Floor. We are responsible  as  a

Government, not the Opposition Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for the Southern Islands has expressed

regrets  that  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's  speech

did  not  touch  on  the suppression  of  Communist

ideologies in Singapore. Copies of the speech  have

been  sent to Members, and I think people  who  say

there is no mention of the Communists in the speech

must  be asleep when the speech was being read,  or

have  not yet read it. Page 12 of the copy we  sent

to  every Member concerns subversive activities and

indicates the policy of the P.A.P. Government.  The

Member  for the Southern Islands need not therefore

touch  on  this  subject  because  the  P.A.P. has

already   taken   a   firm   stand   on   Communist

infiltration.



<br><br>6.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, we have indeed in this House a

very  strange Opposition, and that is an Opposition

which  cannot decide on its attitude to the  recent

cuts  which  Government has had to  impose  in  the

variable  allowances of its officials. We have  had

from   one  of  the  SPA  representatives  in   the

Opposition,   that   is,  from   the   Member   for

Mountbatten,  a bouquet, and that was very  strange

indeed,  coming  as it did from  a  Member  of  the

Opposition.  She said that she had no objection  to

the  principle  underlining the  cuts  in  variable

allowances.   In   fact,   she   complimented   the

Government  for  the  fair  way  in  which  it  had

distributed  these  cuts  in  variable  allowances.

Well,  there was good reason for what  she  had  to

say.  She was doubtless aware that when these  cuts

were  imposed, they were imposed from the  top.  It

was the Ministers and the Parliamentary Secretaries

who  bore  the greatest proportions of  the  salary

cuts. I need not labour this point, but I think  it

is common knowledge that there are Ministers in the

present Government today, who are carrying out  the

portfolios of two Ministers in the past regime  for

less than half the money which one drew.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Mountbatten had only one criticism

to  make.  She  said that she felt that  a  month's

notice should have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 201</b></font><br><br>



been  given  to the Staff side so that the  persons

concerned  would  be  able  to  make  their  budget

adjustments to lessen the shock from a  sudden  cut

in these variable allowances. Now there was another

Member  of the SPA, the hon. Member for Tanglin - all

the  Members  of  this House know  he  is  a  great

believer  in  moral  rearmament, but  nevertheless,

though  he has his strong convictions, he  realises

that  being a headmaster he would also be  affected

by  the rather sudden reduction in emoluments, that

after  working  so  hard to  get  a  seat  in  this

Legislative Assembly, which is worth $500, he finds

that,  in fact, after having lost $400, he will  be

to  the good only by $100. That did not square with

his   beliefs   which   were  inspired   by   moral

rearmament, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the hon. Member for Tanglin shouted in this

House  that  he had heard whispers of rumours  that

the  cuts  were inspired by spite, and he expressed

the hope that this was not true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, we have also heard what the

former Chief Minister - he is the present Member  for

Cairnhill - had to say about these salary  cuts  this

afternoon.  He  carried  the  charges   very   much

further.  He  pointed  an  accusing  hand   at   me

personally,  at  my  colleague,  the  Minister  for

Finance,  and  at the Deputy Speaker,  and  charged

that,  with duplicity, we had wormed our  way  into

the  confidence of Government servants, we had  got

into  their associations, we had climbed over their

backs to political power, and only then we face him

here  in  this Assembly on the Government side.  He

said   that  we  were  behaving  in  a  crude   and

irresponsible  way in our dealings with  the  Civil

Service with whom we had been closely associated in

the  past. We were meting out to them the  sort  of

treatment  which  we had never  expected  from  our

Colonial masters at a time when we were united with

the  Staff  side  in  a common  opposition  to  the

Colonial  masters, Sir. Now, is that a fair  charge

to  make?  I can assure the ex-Chief Minister,  the

Member for Cairnhill, that there are no grounds for

these  charges. What was the position in the  civil

service  as I knew it? It is true that the Minister

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 202</b></font><br><br>



Finance, the Deputy Speaker and myself were closely

associated with the government servants' unions and

staff   associations   in   pressing   for   better

conditions of service in the past. It is true  that

we  were very closely associated with them; but for

the  past  two or three years before  we  left  the

government   service  we  were  not  in   any   way

associated with the staff associations and  unions.

So  there  is no truth whatsoever in the suggestion

that  we climbed on their backs to political power.

I  can  say that I was closely associated with  the

Staff side of the Civil Service Council, but I  can

remember  no  occasion when any of us  brought  any

political considerations into the work that we were

doing.  I can assure the Member for Cairnhill  that

had  we done so we would have broken our esprit  de

corps.  There would have been no team spirit  among

ourselves and there would have been no hope of  our

achieving  the things that we were able to  achieve

for our colleagues in the government service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, and Members of the House, I do

not  think  I  need say or need maintain  that  any

consideration  should be given  to  the  accusation

that  the  leaders of the present  Government  were

inspired  by spite when they found it necessary  to

reduce  the variable allowances of serving officers

in  the  civil service. The whole of the people  of

Singapore know that this Government's policies  are

not  based on personal vendettas but are  based  on

programmes  submitted to the electorate  and  which

are  approved by the electorate. The leaders of the

Government  are well known for their  anti-colonial

attitude. When power has passed into our hands,  do

we  deal  ruthlessly with the expatriate  officers?

No,  we  are prepared to negotiate cuts in variable

allowances with their associations in the same  way

as  we  were prepared to negotiate with  the  Staff

side  of  the Whitley Council. What the Member  for

Cairnhill overlooked to mention just now  were  the

considerations which had led the present Government

to  reduce  the variable allowances of its  serving

officers.  He  has  said  not,  a  word  about  the

depletion of the past reserves, built up by  former

Governments  over  many years, by  the  spendthrift

Government of the past. He



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



has  not  told  anybody here  that  large  sums  of

money - sums amounting to $400,000 - were spent by  the

last Government in joy-rides round the world at the

taxpayers' expense. He has not said anything  about

the  alarming  growth  of expenditure  on  personal

emoluments in relation to total expenditure and  in

relation  to  Government  income  in  the  post-war

years.  The  ex-Chief  Minister,  the  Member   for

Cairnhill,  would  doubtless  have  at  least  once

looked at the present state of the Estimates. If he

did  take  the trouble to look at page 378  of  the

Estimates,  which his own Government had  approved,

he  would  have  seen  there listed  and  itemized,

department  by department, the expenditure  of  the

various  departments  which  were  then  under  his

charge.  He  would have found that  under  Personal

Emoluments, the total expenditure was $115  million

for  1959. The estimated total expenditure for 1959

was   $268  million.  For  Other  Charges  Annually

Recurrent,  more  than  $118 million;  for  Special

Expenditure, more than $35 million. If he had taken

the  trouble to go through the Estimates, he  would

have  found that the total expenditure on  Personal

Emoluments  alone was 42.82 per cent of  the  total

expenditure on the public service. Now, the  actual

expenditure  on  salaries is very  much  more  than

42.82  per cent because, as everybody knows,  under

the  item for Other Charges Annually Recurrent  are

to be found a lot of items relating to the salaries

of  Government servants, so that it would be  fair

to  say  that out of the total expenditure of  $268

million, more than 57 per cent has been expended on

the  Personal Emoluments of Government officers.  I

am informed that in a highly industrialised country

like  the United Kingdom, the total expenditure  on

Government services does not amount to more than 15

per  cent of the Government revenue. If I am wrong,

I stand to be corrected by the Minister for Finance

when it comes to his turn to speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I will deal with the charges that were made

by  the Opposition that the Government did not  put

its  proposals  to the Staff Side  of  the  Whitley

Council.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



I  would  say, Mr Speaker, that there is no  truth

whatsoever in that charge. I know it as a fact that

my  colleague the Minister for Finance did put  the

Government's  proposals to the Staff  Side  of  the

Whitley Council. Now, what did the Staff Side  say?

It  had no mandate to negotiate. It must wait until

its  constituent bodies held general meetings in  a

month's  time before it could negotiate. It  wanted

an indefinite postponement. It did not want genuine

negotiations  with  Government.  My  colleague  the

Minister for Finance has already said publicly that

agreement to this would have meant expenditure  and

a  loss  to the Treasury of more than $1 million  a

month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, and Members of the House, we

have published our Five-Year programme. We need  to

find  the money to finance that programme. We  have

to find it first by putting our own house in order,

by pruning unnecessary expenditure and reducing the

cost  of  government. That is the function  of  all

reputable governments - governments that do not spend

the   taxpayers'  money  to  the  extent  of  about

$400,000 a year on personal jaunts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it true that there was a unilateral imposition

of  these  cuts? Now, Mr Speaker, and  Members  of

this House, I have been closely associated with the

Whitley system and I know that the essence  of  the

system is that both sides should always be ready at

all  times to enter into negotiations resulting  in

binding  agreements. What did the Staff  Side  mean

when  it  said that it had no mandate  to  discuss?

When I discussed the constitution of the Staff Side

with  the  former colonial Government,  I  made  it

plain to that Government that we on the Staff  Side

would  never accept the position that we  would  be

treated as a mere consultative body. We pressed  it

home  to  them  that we wanted to be treated  as  a

genuine  Staff  Side  that  could  always  conclude

binding  agreements  with its employers - the  former

Government.  It  was  explained  to   us   by   the

Government  that  the  Official  Side   could   not

conclude  any  such agreement with us  because  the

officials who met us were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



at most representatives of the Government whom they

served,  and the constitutional position  was  that

they  could  never be sure whether the monies  that

would  have  to  be found to honour  the  agreement

which the officials made with us would be voted  by

the   Government   in  power.  The   old   colonial

Government  did nevertheless give us an undertaking

that,  as far as possible, agreements made  by  the

Official Side would be constitutionally honoured by

the  Government of the day. Did the Staff Side make

any  counter  proposals?  Did  it  suggest  to  the

Government  that  it should, in the  words  of  the

Member  for Mountbatten, be given a month's  notice

to  make Budget adjustments to lessen the shock? It

did  nothing  of the sort. It tried  to  shirk  its

responsibility by passing the matter  over  to  its

constituent bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, and Members of the House, I

know  the Minister for Finance quite well. He is  a

very  hardheaded,  practical man,  and  will  never

allow  himself to be taken for a ride  by  anybody,

much  less by the Staff Side of the present Whitley

Council. Now, why did the Staff Side want to  "pass

the buck" to its constituent bodies? The Staff Side

knows   that   there  are  31  unions   and   staff

associations in its organisation, and it also knows

that  only 6,000 represented by the unions  out  of

the  total number of more than 25,000 employees are

affected by the salary cuts - only 6,000 out  of  the

total  number of more than 25,000 are  affected  in

any  way  by the salary cuts. The Staff  Side  knew

this  and also knew that it would be difficult,  in

view of this, to get unanimity from its constituent

members to oppose the Government proposals. After a

genuine  attempt at negotiations and  when  it  was

clear  to  the Minister for Finance that the  Staff

Side  did  not intend to have any negotiations,  he

was forced to issue a directive that the cuts would

be  imposed with effect from 1st July. Is there any

breach of trade union practice? Show me!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me refer to what the Staff Side did in

the  last year of the Lim Yew Hock regime.  On  the

grounds  that  the  Lim  Yew  Hock  Government  was

reorganising the Government services including  the

teaching service, normal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



trained  teachers  who  formed  the  bulk  of   the

teaching service were asked to agree to a reduction

in  their  basic  pay  scales.  Their  maximum  and

minimum  and  incremental steps in the  pay  scales

were  to  be  lower than they were  then,  and  new

normal class recruits were to be recruited on  even

lower basic pay scales. The same thing was done  in

respect of the nurses. Did the Staff Side make this

an  issue  when the former Government was  fiddling

about  with  their pay scales and  not  their  mere

variable  allowances? When I was on leave prior  to

retirement,  I associated myself with  the  normal-trained  teachers  in resisting the  Lim  Yew  Hock

Government  plan on the grounds that if there  were

to  be  sacrifices, it would be more  equitable  to

place  the  burden  on those in the  higher  income

bracket  than  on those in the lower in-come  group

who  might very well be unequal to the burden. What

did  the former Chief Minister do? He got the Chief

Secretary,  his subordinate, to warn  me  twice  in

writing that, as I was being paid a salary when  on

leave  prior to retirement, I should not get myself

involved  in  such matters. Then again,  the  Staff

Side  representatives came to see me when I was  on

leave  prior  to retirement, and asked  me  whether

they could get the firm of Lee and Lee to represent

them  in  arbitration proceedings in respect  of  a

claim  for  overtime  against  the  Lim  Yew   Hock

Government.  I had been associated with  the  Staff

Side  in  negotiating a new structure for  overtime

with  the previous colonial Government which  would

have  cost the Lim Yew Hock Government millions  of

dollars  to implement. What did the Staff  Side  do

when  the  previous Government refused to implement

the  new structure for overtime on the grounds that

it  was too costly? And we can even give credit  to

the Lim Yew Hock Government that it was quite alive

to  what the Staff Side had in mind. They asked  me

and  Lee  Kuan Yew to represent them at arbitration

proceedings,  which our Prime Minister  refused  to

agree to. There had never been a bleat against  the

former Government for refusing to implement the new

overtime structure for the civil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



service, despite the fact that it had received  the

support  of officials who represented the  Lim  Yew

Hock Government in that discussion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the expression "the

Lim  Yew  Hock  Government"  is  getting  a  little

tedious,  and perhaps the hon. Member would  rather

say "the former Government".



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> My apologies and my respects to you,

Mr   Speaker.  I  should  say,  "the  Member   for

Cairnhill's former Government".



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think perhaps that even is

a bit long-winded, shall we say?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> My apologies, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, the Staff Side representatives came

to  Lee  and Lee with a proposal that it wanted  to

enlist  the support of Lee Kuan Yew and  myself  to

help them to get all or a greater proportion of the

variable  allowances incorporated  in  their  basic

pay.  When the former Government told them that  it

was  afraid  to  play, did they  press  the  matter

further?  No,  because  they  knew  this   was   an

unreasonable proposal which would never receive any

public support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker and Members of the House, I am not mentioning all this with any malicious motives to

vilify  my former colleagues in the civil  service,

but  I am mentioning this to show that there is  no

truth  in  the  charge  made  against  the  present

Government by the Staff side and by the Members  of

the  Opposition  that Government  has  unilaterally

imposed   cuts   in  variable  allowances   without

consultation with the unions, which is a breach  of

trade   union  practice.  Rather  the  facts  would

suggest  that  the  Staff side,  representing  only

about a third of the Government employees affected,

did  not  at any stage want negotiations  following

cuts  in the variable allowances. Now what has  the

Staff  side  been  doing?  They  have  smashed  the

Whitley machinery which we had taken years to build

up,  and have inaugurated a new organization  which

they termed the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



Council of Joint Action. The Staff side itself does

not  think  that the Whitley machinery is  a  good-enough forum for collective bargaining in the civil

service. It has said that it has taken the step  to

form a Council of Joint Action to bring it home  to

Government that it must follow accepted trade union

practice in its dealings with the Staff side.  This

is  the crowning act of stupidity by those who  are

behind this move.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I just interrupt for a

moment?  I think the hon. Member has been using  an

expression  which I have noted here,  "Mr  Speaker

and  Members  of  the House". Of course,  the  hon.

Member  knows the Standing Orders which say that  a

Member desiring to speak shall rise and address his

observations  to  the Chair only  and  the  Members

indirectly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I must apologise because

I am not used to parliamentary traditions here.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Of course, I think the

Speaker is entitled to assume that the Minister for

Law is acquainted with the Standing Orders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, there was a need for a

Council of Joint Action in the days when there  was

no   Whitley  machinery  available  in  the   civil

service,  and  it  was  for this  reason  that  the

Council  of Joint Action was formed when  both  the

present  Minister for Finance and  myself  had  the

privilege and the honour to be associated with  the

Government unions in bringing home to the  colonial

Government of those times, of which the Member  for

Tanglin was the most distinguished member, that  it

was  inequitable to grant a family allowance to one

section  of the civil service and not at  the  same

time to others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may digress for a moment, Mr Speaker, I

think I see the presence here in this House of  the

hon.  Member  for  Tanglin. At the  time  when  the

question   of   family  allowances  was   furiously

debated,  we  approached Mr  Thio  Chan  Bee  [and

pointed at the Member for Tanglin]-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> -the Member for Tanglin-



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sorry to keep

interrupting-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, a Member entered the Chamber.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. No Member shall cross the

Floor when the Speaker is standing. Will the Member

please come in and take his seat?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member took his seat.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I was saying that possibly in

addressing  the Chair, if anybody is to be  pointed

at,  I suppose the Speaker ought to be pointed  at.

The hon. Member should address the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, I must apologise for the

slight misbehaviour on my part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I remember that when we approached the hon. Member for Tanglin to support us in our

fight  against the colonial Government for  denying

us  family  allowances and giving family allowances

to  the expatriate officers, he assured us that  he

was  completely  on our side. I was  horrified  one

morning,  when  I  had to report to  my  expatriate

superior to receive certain instructions,  to  hear

him  making  arrangements for the hon.  Member  for

Tanglin  to  go  on  a very sudden  trip  to  Kuala

Lumpur, to enter into an agreement with regard  to

those family allowances. I understand that the hon.

Member  for  Tanglin and another left Singapore  on

that occasion, not in an ordinary commercial plane,

but  in  a plane belonging to one of the Services,

because  he feared that if he were seen around  the

precincts  of the Kallang Airport it would  not  do

him any good. But that, Mr Speaker, is by way of a

mere digression.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of

explanation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, the hon. Minister

just now was implying that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



I had done certain things which I never did,  that

is   to  say,  I  supported  the  claim  to  family

allowances when I promised him that I would  oppose

it.  I  did  oppose, Sir, but the proceedings  were

secret and I suppose I cannot divulge what happened

in Kuala Lumpur.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In any event, I think all that is

completely irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, you yourself played a

small  but, nevertheless, very significant part  in

trying  to  resolve this dispute, with  the  result

that  a  very senior member of the Board of  Inland

Revenue  in  the  United Kingdom  had  to  come  to

Singapore to enunciate a principle which  all  good

employers   in  Singapore  have  always  known - that

payment  on account of wages must always be related

to the principle of the rate for the job.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, all of us just now heard the Member for Cairnhill claim that he had done a lot for the

labour movement in Singapore. He claimed credit for

the  Shop  Assistants  Ordinance,  for  the  Labour

Ordinance, for the Clerks Employment Ordinance, and

what have you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, in the very short time that I

have  been in office, I have been astounded to find

defects in our labour laws which completely escaped

the  attention  of a former Chief  Minister  and  a

former  Minister for Labour. I have looked  up  the

Labour  Ordinance, and I have particularly noted  a

section in it which is designed to punish employers

for  anti-union activities. What do I find? I  find

that  all that the section says is that an employer

commits  an  offence  only  when  at  the  time  of

entering  into  a contract of employment  with  his

employee  he places a restriction on that  employee

against  his  joining a trade union or against  his

participating  in trade union activities.  That  is

all that the Ordinance says. It does not prevent an

employer from dismissing an employee, after he  has

been  engaged,  because he joins a trade  union  or

associates himself in trade union activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government, unlike the former Labour

Front  and  the  S.P.A. Governments,  is  genuinely

backed by the labour movement in Singapore and is,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



unlike  the former Governments, openly on the  side

of  labour.  Go to the Ministry of Labour  and  Law

now.  As you come into the entrance you will see  a

notice  board, in the clearest of terms in writing,

inviting  any representative of any trade union  to

call  in; and if he does so, he will have the right

to   speak   personally  to   the   Minister,   the

Parliamentary  Secretary, the  Permanent  Secretary

and the Controller of Labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, employers know that this Government is very

loyal to labour and very pro-labour, and because of

that  they are trying to adopt a get tough attitude

with  their  employees. The legislation  which  the

Member   for   Cairnhill  claims  credit   for   is

completely inadequate for the purposes that I  have

in mind. That section of the law does not enable me

to  deal  with  the  situation adequately.  Powers,

however, will be taken under amending Ordinances to

enable  employers,  who impose such  conditions  on

their  employees  after they have been  engaged  or

dismiss  them  on  their  joining  a  union   after

engagement, to be adequately punished.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, as a Government, shall see to it that such

punishments are adequate for these purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another inadequacy in the labour law which the

former  Labour Government seems to have  overlooked

is  that  section of the law dealing with  payments

for  overtime.  The  law as it stands  enables  the

employers   to  apportion  the  same  wages   which

employees used to receive before statutory overtime

was  introduced  to include a portion  representing

wages  and a portion representing overtime, and  in

this way a large number of employers have been able

to  evade the provisions of the law regulating  the

payment of overtime. Cases have been brought to  my

notice  where before the introduction of the Labour

Ordinance employees were receiving as little as  $3

a day. When this Ordinance was introduced employers

took the opportunity of apportioning that wage into

two portions, one portion representing the wage and

another portion representing the overtime element,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



so  that the employer said to his employee:  "$2.50

is your wage and 50 cents is the overtime which you

will  receive."  Was anything done  by  the  former

Government to correct this position?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, under the present law, if an employee who

is  daily-rated is paid by the day, he has no  wage

period  for the purposes of these laws and  can  be

dismissed  without notice. In addition, because  he

has no wage period, he is not eligible for many  of

the  benefits  under these laws. I can  assure  the

Member   for  Cairnhill  that  we  shall  introduce

amending legislation to correct all these defects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, what about the apprentices? Apprentices

who  work  long hours without payment of  overtime,

annual leave, sick pay and other benefits which are

provided under the existing laws for adult  workmen

are  not  protected by these laws, on  the  grounds

that  they do not work under a contract of service.

This also we shall put right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again, there is the question of contract

labour.  It  is  well known that the employment  of

labour  on contract terms leads to the exploitation

of man by his fellowman. Cases have been brought to

my  notice  where  large factories  which  own  the

buildings and machinery in them, which control  the

processes  used  in  those factories,  nevertheless

choose  to employ labour to work in those factories

on  contract  terms. Was the former Government  not

aware of all this? It looks as if they did not want

to be aware of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are only a few instances which I have had

time   to   mention  this  evening,  to  show   the

inadequacies in our existing labour legislation. Is

the  Member  for  Cairnhill  prepared  to  say  now

publicly that he wants to claim the credit for  all

these Ordinances?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Cairnhill just now cast a number of aspersions on the Members of the

Government  has  expressed very grave  concern  for

trade  unions.  He  said, "The  Government  on  the

question  of  their  concern for  the  trade  union

movement,  and has promised to build a Trade  Union

House costing millions of dollars to assist the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



movement."  He said that it was the same Government

which   was  trying  to  destroy  the  trade  union

movement.  He  said  that if  he  had  had  similar

designs, he would have closed down many unions when

he  was  in  office  as Chief  Minister.  Now,  Mr

Speaker, I can assure you that we, as a Government,

have  a  real interest in the trade union movement,

and the labour movement generally, in Singapore. It

will  be  our  first  task this session  to  create

conditions of industrial stability without which it

will  not be possible for us to give effect to  our

Five-Year  plan  as  announced  during  the  recent

election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also aware that not only must the trade

union  and  labour movement be placed on  a  proper

footing  for industrial stability, but it  is  also

equally  important  that this  movement  should  be

provided with the facilities and amenities  whereby

its   special  contribution  to  the  life  of  the

community  can be enhanced and manifested.  We  are

determined  to correct past neglect on that  score.

Pending the selection of a suitable site and  plans

for  the erection of a Trade Union House worthy  of

our  new  policies  in  these matters,  a  spacious

Government building within easy reach of the centre

of  the city is being renovated and redecorated  to

serve  as a temporary trade union house until  such

time as the permanent structure we have in mind  is

erected. We are sincere in everything that  we  say

in  regard  to  the labour movement and  the  trade

unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have prepared delightful things to say here this evening to show the close association

between  the  Member for Cairnhill and unions  like

the   Petty   Traders  Association,  the  Singapore

Painting and White-washing Workers Union and  other

such  like  unions with which hon. Members  in  the

previous  Government were closely  associated.  You

have  ruled, Mr Speaker, that all this  should  be

reserved  till the debate on the Second Reading  of

the Bill which was tabled two days ago, so that  we

do not enter into discussion on this matter at this

stage.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I did, of course, indicate

that any debate oii the relevant Bill at this stage

would be out of order,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



but  I  did not guarantee that what the hon. Member

was going to say would be relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I would not like to take any risks,

Sir.   Mr   Speaker,  I  think  the   Member   for

Mountbatten  did make certain charges  against  the

Government for having desires to destroy  community

associations    in    Singapore.    She    referred

particularly  to the pathetic cases of  a  few  ex-politicians who had spent a lot of time  and  money

in  building  up  their prestige in such  community

centres to advance their own political interests. I

think  one of them mentioned recently that  he  was

surprised that, in spite of all the efforts he  had

put in, others who left the community centres alone

were  able  to get seats in the present Legislative

Assembly,  whereas  he and others  were  very  much

disappointed, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, experience of the Department of Social Welfare has revealed that some politicians

make  use  of  community  centres  for  their   own

political activities and, in one case, a politician

had for several years been using a community centre

as  a centre of operations in order to build up his

prestige in that area for the last election.  I  do

not  think it will be necessary for me to name that

politician. In another case, a politician tried  to

make use of members of youth clubs in order to help

him  in  his  political campaign.  But  fortunately

members  of the youth clubs concerned resisted  his

approach.  Mr  Speaker, if  there  should  be  any

political activities in community centres, they are

bound  to  result in friction between  the  various

parties,  and  activities in the community  centres

will  suffer as a result. For example, in the Upper

Serangoon  Community  Centre  when  two  candidates

standing  for  election in the  area  used  it  for

political purposes, the community centre remained a

dead  centre  for many years, Sir. Mr Speaker,  we

have no such designs. It was not necessary for  ex-Government servants like the Minister for  Finance,

the  Deputy Speaker and myself to get mixed up with

community centres to gain seats in this Legislative

Assembly.  We were brought here not by  such  petty

considerations. We were brought here by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



the masses of the people which supported the P.A.P.

in   its  work,  both  in  the  former  Legislative

Assembly and in the City Council. It was that  mass

support  that brought us to this Assembly.  So  let

this  serve  as  a  warning to all  those  who  are

bleating  about  the way in which we  handle  these

community  centres.  By this time  they  should  be

aware  that the way to get a seat in this  Assembly

is  not by getting themselves involved in the  work

of   these  centres  but  rather  in  getting   for

themselves  and their policies the support  of  the

masses of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I think it is necessary for me to say a few words on the attitude of the present

Government  towards  these community  centres.  Mr

Speaker, Government is alive to the need to  foster

community  living and to enrich  the  life  of  our

people through healthy, purposeful and constructive

activities. The reorganisation of the community and

recreation  services  that  are  afforded  to  the,

public, especially to the young, will be proceeded

with  the utmost despatch by this Government and  a

new  spirit  will be infused into those responsible

for  the  control  of these services  so  that  the

centres in which these services are given will more

truly  reflect  the  needs and the  wishes  of  the

masses  of the people. Government is interested  in

those community development projects which directly

assist  the economic and living conditions  of  our

people.  It is, therefore, hoped to centralise  the

control   of   these   centres   under   a   single

organisation truly representative of the masses  of

our   people,  and  to  afford  these  centres  the

facilities and the amenities which will enable them

to  stimulate  the creative, cultural and  artistic

activities  especially of our young people.  It  is

our intention to make these centres the foci of the

educational,  social, cultural and artistic  uplift

of our young population. If community centres could

be successfully utilised for such purposes and also

for  the integration of communal groups, this  will

assist   materially   towards  achieving   national

consciousness  and  solidarity.  The  Ministry   of

Education, the Ministry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



of  Culture  and my Ministry will play  their  full

part in bringing about the reorganisation that  the

Government  has  in  mind.  Let  me  explain,   Mr

Speaker,  what  the aims and objects  of  community

centres should be. Community centres are the  media

through  which  the  aims  and  intentions  of  the

Government can be communicated and explained to the

people.  They  are focal points for  programmes  of

activities  organised to promote  the  welfare  and

recreational needs of our people and involve  group

participation  in  social,  cultural,  health   and

educational   projects  on  a  mass  basis.   These

projects  include  language  classes  for   adults,

music, drama, folk dancing, vocational training for

the  underprivileged, and recreational  activities.

These  centres also are the basis for the  training

of  future  leaders. Let me say here and  now,  Mr

Speaker, that it is not the intention of Government

to    take   over   full   control   of   community

organisations,  as  these organisations  can  still

carry  on  if  they  succeed in finding  their  own

premises.  Government has only taken over  its  own

community  centres and intends to  run  these  with

staff  from the Department of Social Welfare  under

the   control   of  a  single  organisation   truly

representative of the masses of the people. Leaders

are not debarred from taking part in the activities

in  these  centres  as they are organised  for  the

masses.   I   hope  that  that  will  clarify   the

Government  stand  on  the  question  of  community

centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I have recently been charged with being a dictator because I issued instructions

recently  that open-air cinema shows and activities

in  youth  clubs and community centres must  cease.

What   were  the  circumstances  which,   made   it

necessary for me to issue those instructions? It is

well  known  that  some youth clubs  and  community

centres exist mainly on the proceeds of such cinema

shows  and  a  few  members  of  the  committee  of

management year after year monopolise the  business

as  a result of' which members lose interest in the

clubs  and  these community centres. I am  informed

that  some  committees of management have  not  had

annual general



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



meetings for years because of the possibility of  a

change  of management and the fear that new members

may  get  control  of  the  cinema  show  business.

Further,  the  accounts of many clubs  are  not  in

order  and  this  is a regular source  of  conflict

between members. These do not contribute towards  a

healthy  development in youth clubs  and  community

centres. Cinema shows are not limited to members of

youth clubs and community associations only, as the

idea is to get large audiences in order to make the

shows pay. The result of this is that gangsters and

secret   society  members  have   found   these   a

convenient  meeting  place during  open-air  cinema

shows.  The Police could not arrest them as members

of  an  unlawful assembly since they  could  always

give  the excuse that they were attending a  cinema

show.  Further,  it gives them a chance  to  demand

protection   money,  not  only  from   the   cinema

operators  but also from the hawkers who are  bound

to  congregate  around when there  is  an  open-air

cinema  show. In a recent case in the  Sims  Avenue

Community  Centre,  a member of  a  secret  society

murdered a member of the staff of the film operator

and  he was subsequently hanged. Most of the  open-air  cinemas are operated on a commercial basis for

gain  so  that  only popular films likely  to  draw

crowds  are  exhibited. Since the majority  of  the

audience  are  boys and girls of school-going  age,

shows  involving fights and gangsters are regularly

shown.  These exercise a very bad influence on  our

growing  young population. It is the  intention  of

Government to undertake to provide educational  and

cultural films in youth clubs and community centres

to take the place of these commercial films.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is one last point which I wish to refer to and that is a reference by the Member

for   Cairnhill  earlier  on  in  his  speech  that

Government has not stated what policies it has  for

dealing with the question of unemployment. I  would

inform   Members   of  the  Opposition   that   the

Government has plans for the relief of unemployment

on both a short-term and a long-term basis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



and  these  plans  will  in  the  near  future   be

published.  The  intention  is  to  concentrate  on

projects  employing the maximum number of unskilled

or  semi-skilled workers and these short-term plans

will be closely related to national development. In

the  formulation  of  these  plans,  the  need  for

keeping our young and growing population in gainful

employment,  so as to reduce the opportunities  for

and  the  incidence  of anti-social  activities  in

which  they  might otherwise be engaged,  has  been

constantly  kept in view as well as  the  need  for

affording immediate relief to those suffering great

hardship through prolonged periods of unemployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been taken to task by the Member for

Cairnhill  for having instructed the discontinuance

of  sugar  and  rice rations to all those  employed

under  the  unemployment relief  scheme  which  the

previous  Government had initiated. Mr Speaker,  I

found  when  I  took office that there  were  about

1,200 persons employed on these unemployment relief

schemes and they were paid at the rate of $3 a day.

In  addition, they were geting dry rations  costing

about 80 cents per person. Mr Speaker, I have been

very  closely associated with workmen in the course

of  my  political activities and I know that  there

are  many  workmen in Singapore  who  are  in  fact

receiving  $3 a day as a living wage. The  previous

Government  was  paying $3 a day  plus  rations  as

relief for unemployment. I considered that if these

rations were withdrawn we would be able to save  as

much as about $1,000 a day and that would enable us

to  employ another 300 on this unemployment  relief

work.  Is there anything wrong because we did this?

Have  we  done anything wrong because we did  that?

That  is  just  common  sense  in  dealing  with  a

practical situation. If there are workers  who  are

prepared  to work for this wage, was it  not  right

that  we  should withdraw these rations  to  enable

another 300 to be employed on the proceeds?  Surely

that cannot be wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  on a point of explanation. I was said to have-

<br><br>7.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, concerning the debate on

the  policy  speech today in principle and  on  the

whole,  it is not without reluctance on my part  to

accept the speech but it should be remembered  that

at the moment when we are faced with the problem of

establishing a society and we should  know  how  we

are  going to implement these policies in  a  self-governing state. I have carefully examined what has

been  said and what has been embodied in the papers

which  have  been circulated to all the Members.  I

offer  my congratulations to the Government in  its

sincere desire to prove that it will implement  the

policies laid down, particularly that Malay will be

made  the  national  language. That  is  a  serious

matter  for  attention which  the  Malays  on  this

island and I personally support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To revert to what is embodied in the speech

delivered  by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  we  only

want  to  get clarification particularly  from  the

Government  side  that we have  no  desire  at  all

whatsoever  to  create  misunderstanding   in   our

attempt  to establish a new society which we  think

fit.  This,  I hope, will receive consideration  so

that  everything will be made known to this  House,

the  people  in Singapore, and the whole  world  at

large.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the Government's education

policy,   I  would  like  clarification  from   the

Government  as  to  the  true  state  of   affairs.

According  to  my interpretation, I would  ask  for

clarification  as  to whether  the  policy  of  the

Government is to put aside the policy of the  Malay

Education Council. It has been explained  that  the

education  policy  of the Government  is  based  on

three principles. Firstly, the Government accepts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



the  All-Party  Report on Chinese Education,  1955.

The  Report mentioned equal treatment for  all  the

four channels of education: English, Malay, Chinese

and  Tamil.  Secondly,  the  Government  agrees  to

accept   Malay   as  the  national  language.   The

Government will encourage non-Malays to  learn  and

study  the  Malay language, but in the  meantime  I

hope  the Government will clarify the position with

regard  to  encouraging the  growth  of  the  Malay

language.  Thirdly, the syllabus, which  apparently

will  be  reviewed, will give priority to practical

subjects such as mathematics and science, which are

of use to industry to fill the needs of society and

priority  will also be given to the  study  of  the

Malay language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, and the Hon. the Minister for Education, according to my interpretation of the

education policy of the Government, education is of

the  first  importance, and the first principle  of

the  education policy of the Government shows  that

priority is given to the acceptance of the 1955 All-Party  Committee Report on Chinese Education  only.

That   is  a  Committee  formed  by  the  coalition

Government four years ago. Mr Speaker,  this  goes

to  show  indirectly  that the  present  Government

perhaps   unconsciously  adopted  such  a   policy.

According  to  my  opinion, it is contrary  to  the

policy  of  a Party holding the reins of government

today,  although it mentions that similar treatment

is  given  to all the four languages. Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  if  it  is  true that this Government  is  to

uphold  the  interests of the masses,  it  has  not

mentioned  at  all or clarified in the  speech  the

acceptance  of  the Malay education policy  of  the

Malay  Education Council, Singapore, a policy which

was accepted and carried out by the old Government,

and  may  be carried out by the present Government.

What has happened is that the rights of the Malays,

or  to be more accurate, their special position far

from   receiving   equitable  treatment - let   alone

recognize  the status of Malay education - has  been

neglected  or deliberately belittled. This  is  our

concern when we heard the speech delivered  by  the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara concerning  the  education

policy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not the slightest intention of creating

things  which  are undesirable in our struggle  for

the rights of the Malays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second principle says "revitalising Malay

education itself". The phrase "revitalising itself"

as  I  understand it is not firm, not positive.  We

cannot use vague or loose phrases, but we should be

more  firm  or  positive. The  terminology,  in  my

opinion,  should  be  as follows:  "will  give  new

spirit  in  uplifting and the  development  of  the

Malay   language   itself",   because   the    word

"revitalising" can be construed to mean that  Malay

education  which was previously vitalised,  is  now

dead,  and  therefore,  this  Government  tries  to

revitalise  it is this the true intention  of  this

Government,  Mr Speaker? This is  the  fact  which

should be emphasised to all. The general opinion is

clear, that Malay education, about which previously

there  had  been  an  attempt  to  bury  through  a

programme  of reorientation, has been reestablished

by   the   Malay  Education  Council.  It  is   the

responsibility of this Government, elected  by  the

people,  to  govern, and time to  give  new  spirit

towards   uplifting   the  development   of   Malay

education. Then only can we implement Malay as  the

national language of our country, in order to  meet

the   needs  of  a  multi-racial  society   in   an

industrialised country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we now come to the stage where we would like to make a common policy regardless of

race.  This has become our policy, and I once again

extend  my  congratulations to the  policy  of  the

struggle  of the P.A.P., which has the  courage  to

make  Malay the national language. It can  be  said

that this policy was inspired and backed by my  own

organisation,    the   United    Malays    National

Organisation,  but  I  would  like  to  remind  the

Government that the Malays in particular would take

this opportunity to voice our opinions in order  to

find  a healthy and constructive way so that  there

will  be  no room for doubt in the future. We  have

supported  the  policy to make Malay  the  national

language, and I have also explained the position of

the education policy of the present Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to make the Malay language

specially  the  national language is  not  an  easy

thing  to  accomplish, but could it be accomplished

within  the  period  of  the  five  years  of  this

Government   or  maybe  longer?  Accordingly,   Mr

Speaker, the Malays, or my own Party in particular,

support the policy of the P.A.P., which is  in  the

government  today,  in making  Malay  the  national

language, but I would like to draw the attention of

the  Government  to the fact that  whilst  we  make

Malay the national language, let every Ministry  of

the Government that exists today help the Malays in

their  struggle  to  achieve a higher  standard  of

living,  which is part of our struggle to eradicate

communalism from our land forever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Malays, as I have explained

just now, always adopt a spirit of compromise; that

must  not  be overlooked. They support, as  I  said

just  now,  the policy of the P.A.P. to make  Malay

the national language. But, Mr Speaker, Sir, in my

long-term  view,  if I am wrong I  am  prepared  to

accept  criticism,  what  is  the  policy  of  this

Government  in  the  process  of  doing   what   is

contained  in the Singapore Constitution concerning

the  position of the Malays, which has been  agreed

to  by  the  P.A.P  during the Rendel  Constitution

Government.  I  do not wish to remark unnecessarily

but  I  would  explain to this House that  if  this

Government does not provide special privileges  for

the  Malays,  they  will continue  to  become  taxi

drivers,  etc, as has been expressed. I  heard  the

explanation just now of the Member for Bukit Timah,

"The  preparations  to shape  the  new  nation  are

ready."  I am prepared to say that the preparations

may   be  ready,  but  these  preparations  do  not

emphatically stress to raise the standard of living

of  the  Malays who are backward and poor; they  do

not  come  from the capitalist or the  intellectual

class  and  others.  I  would  like  to  draw   the

attention of the Government whose policy it  is  to

make  Malay the national language. Is this the  way

to help the Malays today? How many Malays are to be

the  future graduates of the University of Malaya,

as compared to the Nanyang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



University    graduates?   Whether   the    Nanyang

University  degrees  will  be  recognized  by   the

Government, only time will tell. In my opinion, the

policy  speech  delivered by  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  omitted to mention the special position  of

the  indigenous people of Singapore,  that  is  the

Malays,  and  therefore it has become an  important

issue which has nothing to do with encouraging  the

Malay  language. This will not help the  Malays  to

compete  against the foreigners, if  their  special

positions  are  not  implemented,  not  to  mention

communalism.

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Does the Member for Kampong

Kembangan consider non-Malays in this country to be

Bangsa  asing? Bangsa asing is the Malay  term  for

"foreigners".



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, concerning the question of a nation which  was

asked  by  the Hon. the Prime Minister in reply,  I

would  like  to clarify before I continue  with  my

speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have hurt the feelings of the Hon. the Prime

Minister,  I  wish to apologise. I  would  like  to

explain that, in my opinion, we are today only in a

state  of  self-government. Just as the Member  for

Bukit  Timah has explained just now, the  state  of

nationhood is absent. Similarly, the Federation  of

Malaya, which is independent, has not been able  to

formulate  a nationhood. This is in the process  of

being  formed. The language I use is Malay. What  I

am  aiming  at are the non-Malays. Mr  Speaker,  I

would   like   to  emphasise  that   that   is   my

interpretation  as to what was asked  by  the  Hon.

Prime Minister. I do not for a moment consider that

the  non-Malays who are domiciled in Singapore  are

not  our  brothers. They are our brothers and  have

the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



rights  in  all matters according to the rules  and

laws of the country existing today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to emphasise to this House

today  is the education policy which I talked about

just  now. The non-Malays have good experience  and

qualifications. Many of them are in the  University

of  Malaya and in Nanyang University, and they will

graduate  with degrees which will be recognised  by

the   Government  and,  in  the  case  of   Nanyang

University, have perhaps already been recognised by

the   Government.  Therefore  there  is  no  golden

opportunity for Malays at all to stand on the  same

footing.  It is left to the Government  to  clarify

the  ways and means of attaining this, so  that  we

can  move  on a par with others, with one aim,  one

method and with one objective. That is what we  are

aiming  for, because the Malay middle schools  have

not  yet  been  established. We all understand  the

inadequacies.  The  percentage  of  Malays  in  the

fields  of engineering, medicine, and law, as  well

as  others  is very small. This too has  become  an

important  issue  to us. How can  the  Government's

policy  help the Malays, so that they can be  on  a

par  with others, so that within five years we  can

create  a  society with one aim-as I have explained

just now-namely, that Singapore will be one hundred

per   cent   free   from  the  Colonial   clutches.

Therefore,   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government's

education policy is still a source of concern to my

organisation,  particularly with  regard  to  Malay

children, whose standard of education is  very  low

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, there is another point, Mr

Speaker.  It  is  connected with  the  question  of

education.  Can  the  Hon. Minister  for  Education

clarify the education policy of the Government with

regard  to  the  teaching  of  religion  in   Malay

schools?   Are   the  teachers  who   are   trained

recognised by the Government? The time has now come

to leave the question of the education policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now turn to other matters, that is to say,

matters   concerning  culture.  On   culture,   Mr

Speaker, Sir, it is mentioned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



that  the  Government  will give  encouragement  to

existing cultures. "It will help foster the  growth

of a Malayan culture which while drawing sustenance

from  the  communal  cultures  now  flourishing  in

Malaya   will   nevertheless   develop   its    own

distinctive characteristics."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I myself am still in the dark,

in  the  true  sense  of the  word,  regarding  the

intentions of the present Government. As the Member

for  Bukit Timah has explained in the debate today,

when  referring in this House to the  news  in  the

Utusan  Melayu,  that  His Excellency  Tunku  Abdul

Rahman  Putra  did  not  agree  whatsoever  on  the

question  of communalism. Therefore, I am still  in

the  dark as to what has been stated, that is, "...

communal  cultures now flourishing in  Malaya  will

nevertheless    develop   its    own    distinctive

characteristics."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to remind the House that the independence achieved by the Federation of

Malaya was the result of the co-operation and  help

given by the non-Malays. There, people of all races

united  to eradicate and bury colonialism  forever.

Therefore,  how  can the Government  now  say  that

communal  cultures  which are  now  flourishing  in

Malaya   will   nevertheless  develop   their   own

distinctive  characteristics? In  my  opinion,  the

Government   policy  on  culture   will   lead   to

confusion.  Therefore, I sincerely  hope  that  the

Government  will  elucidate or  clarify  what  real

culture  is,  which has become  the  basis  of  the

struggle of the Government to establish culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Mr Speaker, I will move now to

another matter which concerns Home Affairs. On this

matter   I  also  would  like  to  read   for   the

information of this House. It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The future of Singapore lies ultimately in re-uniting with the Federation of Malaya as a state in

an  independent  country. It  is  the  Government's

intention  during its term of office to create  and

bring  about conditions favourable to an early  re-unification  with  the Federation.  The  Government

will  take firm action to prevent any irresponsible

activities  by  individuals  or  organisations   to

negate this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



paramount  interest of the people of Singapore  and

Malaya.  The  Government will always  consider  the

views  of  the Federation Government. In  the  same

way, the Government hopes the Federation Government

will  understand the hopes and aspirations  of  the

people  of  Singapore, and the ways in  which  this

Government seeks to fulfil them."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I would like to add further before  I comment:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The basic political situation in Malaya has not

changed  today.  The  shooting  war  waged  by  the

Federation  Government  and the  Malayan  Communist

Party enters the eleventh year. This Government has

stated   its   position  clearly   on   subversion.

"Subversion" is any political activity designed  to

further  the  aims and interests  not  of  our  own

people  but  of  foreign powers. By foreign  powers

this  Government means not just Russia  and  China,

but also America and Formosa, and the Western bloc.

The Government will fight and counter subversion be

it from the Right or from Left."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to draw the

attention of the Government to its policy  on  home

affairs. In principle, it is favourable. But at the

first sitting of this Assembly, I remarked that  if

this  Government wish to unite with the  Federation

of  Malaya  as  a State in an independent  country,

then  there  would be many matters which  we  would

have  to  discuss in this House, matters  in  which

opinions would be contradictory. Yesterday, when we

discussed this matter I explained that it  was  too

premature  not  to have certain legislations  which

are  in existence in the Federation, like City Town

and  Kampong Councils. Why did I say this? We  know

that  Singapore is only a self-governing State.  We

have   not  achieved  independence.  We   have   no

representatives abroad, no ambassadors abroad, even

no  consulates  in  other countries.  Therefore  we

understand the reason why we wish to merge with the

Federation which alone can save Singapore from  the

clutches of Colonialism.
