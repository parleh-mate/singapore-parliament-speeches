$10   million  for  the  construction  of   hawkers

centres.  These centres will be built in  areas  to

serve  the  `needs of workers for cooked  food,  to

relieve  congestion  by  street  hawkers,  and   to

control water pollution. While we are concentrating

on  the urban areas where the problem of hawking is

more  acute, we are not neglecting the rural areas.

Wherever  there is a real need for one,  a  hawkers

centre will be built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang may be pleased to note

that  the Ministry proposes to build a cooked  food

centre  near Chong Pang Police Station. A site  has

been  earmarked for this purpose, and  the  Hawkers

Branch  and  the  P.W.D, are now  working  out  the

details.

<br><br>2.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Main and Development Estimates of

Singapore for the financial year 1st April, 1973 to

31st  March,  1974, contained in Paper  Cmd.  3  of

1973.  For convenience, I shall take the totals  in

respect  of  the Main Estimates and the Development

Estimates  for  each  Head of Expenditure  as  they

appear   on   the   sixth   and   seventh   columns

respectively   of   the   Summary   of    Estimated

Expenditure in pages 53 and 54 of the Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I draw the attention of hon. Members to the

Statement which appears at the bottom of  page  51?

The  total in respect of the Main Estimates for the

two  Heads, Head 0101 Civil List for the  President

of   the  Republic  of  Singapore  and  Head   0102

Statutory Expenditure, are not to be voted. I shall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



therefore not take those totals. Further, the total

amount to be voted in respect of the Main Estimates

as  shown  on  page  54 is $1,547,038,440  and  not

$1,854,441,910.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal first with the Heads of Expenditure

in  respect of which amendments stand on the  Order

Paper Supplement.

<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampung Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0105 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past, Members of Parliament have been

given  free Government Gazettes, and also Hansards,

both the loose copies as well as the bound volumes.

But  at  the moment Members of Parliament  are  not

given  any more free Government Gazettes, and  with

this vote, I would like to know whether Members  of

Parliament  will continue to be provided  with  the

bound  volume of Hansards at the end of the current

series.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer to the

question   raised   by  the  Member   for   Kampung

Kembangan,  I  would  say that  hon.  Members  will

receive a bound copy, with an index, of the current

volume  32  of the Official Report of Parliamentary

debates, i.e, the Hansard, in addition to the loose

copies  or  the single issues which  they  are  now

receiving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, commencing with the next volume, that

is,  Volume  33,  it is proposed to supply  Members

only with the loose copies or the single issues  of

the  Official Report. Nevertheless Members may have

their  loose  copies bound with an index,  free  of

charge,  through the Clerk of Parliament. When  the

volume  for  this series is closed, the Clerk  will

notify hon. Members so that those Members who  wish

to  have their loose copies bound can send them  to

him for binding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0108 --



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0108 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1080.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the establishment of a special Commercial

Offences  Investigation Department  with  specially

qualified staff to investigate commercial crimes in

Singapore  is a long overdue measure.  However,  my

original  expectation, and perhaps those of  others

too,  had  been  that this would  mean  giving  the

Commercial Crimes Department of the Police  a  real

skilled  and  qualified fraud squad,  and  that  it

would also mean raising that unfortunate department

from  the  status  it has acquired  in  the  Police

itself,   i.e, of  being  a  sort  of   elephants'

graveyard,  to  a more respectable  condition.  But

now,  for  better  or  for  worse,  the  Commercial

Offences  Investigation Department has been  wedded

to the Attorney-General's Chambers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we know what advantages there are in this

measure?  And  how, will the obvious  necessity  of

liaison  with  the Police and other  organisations,

like  the  Monetary  Authority  of  Singapore,  the

Registrar  of  Companies, and so on,  be  effected?

Does  it  also  mean, Sir, that  the  newly  passed

Securities   Industry  Bill  will  be  partly   the

responsibility  of  this  Unit  in  the   Attorney-General's Chambers?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Law and National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it was found that commercial

offences in Singapore were becoming more varied and

sophisticated.  The facilities  of  the  Commercial

Crimes   Branch   of   the  Police   as   presently

constituted  were  inadequate  to  cope  with   the

problem. It was therefore decided to create  a  new

department    called   the   Commercial    Offences

Investigation Department, which will have  a  staff

consisting not only of Police officers but also  of

lawyers  and  accountants. The  functions  of  this

department  will be to investigate  offences  under

the  Companies Act and the Securities Industry Act,

as  well  as  to investigate offences of  cheating,

criminal   breach   of  trust,   falsification   of

accounts,   forgery  and  other   offences   of   a

commercial nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Estimates have provided for a new

department  under the Attorney-General's  Chambers,

the  objectives can equally be met by an  expansion

and restructuring of the existing Commercial Crimes

Branch under the Commissioner of Police. The Police

prefer  to do this and the Attorney-General has  no

objections.  A final decision on this  question  is

expected to be made shortly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Sir, in view of the Parliamentary

Secretary's answer, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0108 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sorry that this query regarding

accidents involving Government vehicles seems to be

cropping  up from year to year. In 1970 the  matter

was  raised by me during the Budget session and the

Minister  for  Law and National Development  agreed

that  drivers of Government vehicles should  set  a

good  example in courtesy and caution on the  road.

Last year the Member for Punggol also raised this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



question and expressed his concern in this  regard.

The fact that I am raising it again this year is, I

think,  an  indication that nothing much  seems  to

have  been  done  `with  regard  to  improving  the

standards  of  driving  by  drivers  of  Government

vehicles, and to courtesy and caution on the  road;

although in the case of the Singapore Armed  Forces

vehicles,    their   drivers   have   shown    some

improvement.  Perhaps  the Parliamentary  Secretary

could enlighten us in this regard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should emphasise as often as possible

the  importance of courtesy and caution on the road

and  I am prepared to raise this matter again  next

year,   as   the  result  so  far   seems   to   be

unsatisfactory.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Cheng Choon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the amounts

incurred  over  the last three financial  years  in

settling  claims arising out of accidents involving

Government vehicles in cases which did  not  go  to

trial, and the number of such cases are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1970-71, there were 224 cases in all, and the

amount paid out was $87,667.89.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1971-72, there were 194 cases in all, and the

amount paid out was $72,091.92.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1972-73 (March), there were 237 cases in all, and

the amount paid out was $124,742.87.



<br><br>These  figures show that the number of  cases  that

have  been  settled  remains  at  a  steady  level,

although the amounts expended have increased.  This

is  attributable to the fact that the  average  sum

involved in each case has increased rather sharply.

Drivers   of   Government  vehicles   involved   in

accidents  through their negligence are subject  to

departmental   proceedings   with   a    view    to

disciplinary action in cases of proven negligence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Ministry of Defence vehicles,

the  drivers  are  not only liable to  disciplinary

proceedings  but  may also be  ordered  to  pay  or

contribute towards the cost of the repair of  their

vehicles. Improvements have also been made  to  the

training



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>



courses which these drivers have to undergo.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures to try and reduce the number

of   accidents   arising  out  of  negligence   are

additional  to  the work planned  by  the  National

Safety  First Council, the Traffic Police, and  the

Registrar of Vehicles, to obtain a better all-round

standard  of  driving, courtesy and safety  on  our

roads.  However,  these figures do  not  cover  the

position in respect of the various statutory boards

which  come under the general direction of  various

Ministries.  If the Member would give notice  of  a

question,   we  can  try  and  get  the   necessary

information  on the extent of the problem  and  the

steps taken to reduce the accident rates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will take

advantage  of  the  invitation  extended   by   the

Parliamentary  Secretary to ask the question  which

he  has advised me to ask. In view of that,  I  beg

quoting  Hansard, Volume 30, No. I, col.  8,  dated

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I am not increasing my own salary of $3,500 a

of  1972,  by  which  time  Singapore  should  have

overcome  the  economic  problems  caused  by   the

rundown  in British military expenditure,  provided

we all work hard for higher and higher productivity

and more and more industries.'



<br><br>I  am  not  particular about the  Prime  Minister's

salary  as  such, but since he had  already  stated

that it would stay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



until the end of 1972, I must, therefore, bring  it

up  again.  It  is only a few weeks  ago  that  the

salaries of top civil servants were increased by  a

great percentage. Some of them were, in fact, given

more than double their former salaries. I feel that

it is time our Prime Minister's pay be increased in

proportion  to  the  recent  pay  rise  for   civil

servants;  and  it  should  not  be  lower  than  a

Minister's pay. Our economy is booming,  and  I  am

sure  that  our Prime Minister, on looking  at  our

economy, can afford to smile now.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0201 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1041.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since anti-pollution measures were introduced

about  three years ago, air pollution in  Singapore

has  been  considerably reduced.  I  believe  three

scientists were sent abroad for training  specially

to counter pollution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to know, more about the

mysterious  haze  which  had  been  "misting"   our

environment   off  and  on  sometime   ago,   which

experience  we have not had for many years.  During

the  time it happened a number of people complained

of  irritation in their eyes. The only reason given

for  that appearance of haze was that there  was  a

forest fire in Sumatra. Whether this is true or not

has  not  been verified. Even now we seem  to  feel

that  our  air is not clean. I wonder  whether  the

Ministry of the Environment is planning anything to

counter  pollution of the air. Otherwise  later  on

the  polluted  air might affect the health  of  our

people and give rise to greater problems. Probably,

in  the  future, we may have to wear  gas-masks  in

this, smog-affected island.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another point that I wish to raise. I

believe   that  sea  pollution  comes   under   the

jurisdiction of another department. But what  about

smoke  emitted  from the funnels of  some  vessels?

This  seems  to  be the responsibility  of  another

department.   In, any  case,  what   precautionary

measures are taken against air pollution caused  by

the  smoke of some of the vessels coming  into  our

port?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson may not

have   been   aware  that  the  Ministry   of   the

Environment  did  issue on 11th  October,  1972,  a

press  statement  on  the  subject  of  haze   over

Singapore.  It  advised people  not  to  be  unduly

concerned about the haze which spread over  a  very

large area in this region. It also pointed out that

it  was  not  of local origin and that it  was  not

photo-chemical smog. This was confirmed by the Anti-Pollution Unit whose air monitoring station did not

indicate any increase in the pollution level except

for a reduction in visibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure the Member for Anson that

the   level  of  air  pollution  in  Singapore   is

permissible and under control, though he  may  feel

otherwise. We use scientific instruments to measure

the pollutants and the level of various pollutants,

particularly  sulphur dioxide,  and  oxidant  which

cause photo-chemical smog, as monitored by the Anti-Pollution  Unit, is still low and well  within  the

international air pollution standards and criteria.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of smarting eyes, if

the  Member for Anson can be more specific and give

more details, then an investigation will be carried

out.  But' I doubt whether the cause is due to  air

pollution in Singapore. I would like to remind him,

however,  that  there are many causes  to  smarting

eyes, e.g, cigarette smoke, spicy food, late nights

and  not  enough  sleep and, last  but  not  least,

conjunctivitis.  If  anyone  should   suffer   from

conjunctivitis, I would suggest that he refer it to

a doctor or see the Minister for Health!

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

has  given an explanation which I think is not very

clear.  How  did  the haze come to  Singapore?  Has

anything  been  done with the other  Government  to

prevent the haze from coming to Singapore? I do not

think  so. The Minister only replied that  "we  are

doing  everything possible to see that  it  is  all

right."  But  the  Minister,  in  replying  to   my

question,  should have said, "We  will  try  to  do

something about that." Then I would accept it.  But

it is all right in any case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0201 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1101.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the boundaries of the electoral divisions

should  be  properly checked and  voters  who  have

removed from one place to another should have their

change  of  addresses recorded immediately  in  the

Register;  otherwise, when voting day comes,  these

voters  will  not be able to vote.  In  fact,  this

happened  during the last elections, when  so  many

voters  complained that they did not receive  their

voting  cards. A voting card may show that a  voter

is  staying in Hoe Chiang Road, but he may have  to

go  to  Jurong  to vote. But he might already  have

gone  to Hoe Chiang Road to vote, only to find that

he  has to go to Jurong to vote. Or it may even  be

Hoe  Chiang  Road! That is the trouble many  voters

have  experienced. Why is it so? The names  of  the

roads  and  also the names of the polling  stations

must  be properly checked and recorded. I want this

done, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the

information of the Member for Anson, when  a  voter

changes his address, he must report directly to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



Commissioner of National Registration or to those

community  centres designated for this purpose.  At

the   moment,   there  are   82   centres   in   63

constituencies to which they can make a report of a

change  of  address. All these reported changes  of

address  are  notified to the Elections Department,

which will then compile a list known as List  B.  A

separate List B will be compiled for each of the 65

electoral  divisions  and  will  be  exhibited  for

public  inspection for a period of 14 days upon  an

annual revision of the Registers of Electors.  This

annual revision of Registers is always announced on

TV,  over  radio and the press. I therefore  advise

every voter to inspect the electoral registers  at

any  of  these 82 centres, whenever it is announced

that   these   registers  are  open   for   public

inspection. Every elector who has reported a change

of  address  should also inspect the  Registers  of

Electors during such an annual revision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, members of the public can always go

to  the  Elections Department at City Hall to  seek

advice on this and other election matters. Further,

whenever an election takes place, polling cards are

sent  to  all electors at their last known official

addresses. Those who fail to receive polling  cards

can go to the Elections Department for such cards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past, there has been a lot of talk

about making Singapore a brain centre in South-east

Asia. What efforts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



have  been  made to this effect? We  have  quite  a

number   of  students  going  abroad  for   further

studies.  There  is no doubt that Singapore  cannot

cope  with  certain  fields of  study.  However,  I

wonder why many of our students still go abroad for

their  basic  studies,  facilities  for  which  are

available in Singapore. Obviously, they are  either

dissatisfied with the facilities available here  or

that  many facilities are not available.  All  this

talk  about making Singapore a brain centre  should

show  more  concrete forms. We should put  in  more

effort into what has been planned so that Singapore

can truly be a brain centre.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of making

Singapore  as  a  brain centre, there  are  various

developments  towards this objective.  The  Applied

Research Corporation at the Ministry of Science and

Technology  for Services in applied scientific  and

technological     research,    the    International

Development     and    Engineering     Construction

Organisation   at   the   Ministry   of    National

Development  for  engineering and allied  services,

and    the    various   developments   in   medical

specialities  are  some  of  the  examples  of  our

efforts  to make Singapore a brain centre  in  this

part of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Member's query on the large

number  of  students going overseas, let me  assure

him  that  the institutions of higher  learning  in

Singapore are one of the best equipped and  staffed

in  this region. However, there are various reasons

for  students  going overseas. We can  divide  them

into  various categories. Firstly, there are  those

who   are   on   scholarship  awarded  by   foreign

governments and they are required to study in those

countries.  Secondly,  there  are  those   who   go

overseas  for  post-graduate  research,  either  on

scholarship  or  on their own. Thirdly,  there  are

those who go overseas for subjects not available in

Singapore,   such   as   music   and   aeronautical

engineering. And finally, of course, there  is  the

group of people who are on their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



fathers' scholarships, and they go overseas because

they cannot gain admission into our institutions of

higher  learning.  The number of this  category  of

people  amounts to no more, than one-fifth  of  the

number who go overseas.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I am happy with the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I rise merely to seek information regarding

this subhead in respect of "Research". What sort of

research  is  being done with Grants  amounting  to

$90,000,  and whether this research is in  relation

to  the  Applied  Research  Corporation  which  the

Minister referred to just now, or whether  this  is

something  else? Where Contract Work is  concerned,

how  is  it  given, and for what purpose?  For  the

other two items, Patent Search and Miscellaneous, I

just want some information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Research

Grants under this subhead have been provided  since

1969  to  finance and encourage applied  scientific

and  technological research which are practical and

relevant to our industrialisation programme. It  is

a  bit  difficult to describe what type of research

is  being carried out. Perhaps 1 will just quote  a

few   examples:   research  on   telecommunications

problems, methods of shielding heat from walls  of,

high-rise  apartments and, design  characteristics,

of  waste  disposal, incineration, etc. Each  year,

project  proposals are invited from  .the  teaching

staff   and  research  personnel  of  our  tertiary

institutions,   for  consideration   of   financial

support.  Therefore, this is quite  different  from

the  Applied Research Corporation which I mentioned

just  now. The proposals are then evaluated by  the

Science Council and, upon its recommendations,  the

Ministry makes the grants.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Patent Search and Miscellaneous,

these  sums  are provided for search as to  whether

any  invention has not been developed and  patented

elsewhere.

reply, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our conversion to the metric system in

weights and measures is highly commendable. I would

like  to know how far has metrication been extended

to  the hawkers. I hope that during the process  of

metrication  the  markets in particular,  could  be

looked into, with careful attention, because  there

is  a tendency for them to carry on a great deal of

unfair,  means. The daching system of weighing  has

always rendered the customer the loser. It is hoped

that the daching would be entirely got rid off as a

system  of  weighing, and instead a proper  balance

scale be introduced so as to reduce the possibility

of cheating.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, with the promotion of metrication,

may  I suggest that each market be provided with  a

spring  balance weighing machine where  members  of

the  public can check the weight of the  food  they

buy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, at the outset, we

recognise  the difficulties involved in introducing

metrication at the retail trade level. That is  why

the  White  Paper presented to Parliament  in  1970

recommended  that  the metrication  in  the  retail

trade be allowed to be implemented over a period of

time.  Notwithstanding this, we have been  able  to

introduce  metrication into  certain  trades,  e.g.

petroleum, textile, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With, regard to the suggestion for the provision

of   weighing   machines  by  the   Government,   I

understand   that  a  large  number  of  Government

markets  at the moment do provide weighing machines

calibrated in the customary units for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



the  benefit  of  the customers. As  and  when  the

metric  system is introduced into the  markets  and

the retail trade, this will be provided for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0301 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 11.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it cannot be denied that since its inception

the  Ministry of Science and Technology has done  a

great deal for Singapore under the enlightened  and

qualified   Minister,  who  is  now   attending   a

scientific  conference  in  Tokyo.  In  regard   to

research   in   science,   he   has   made    great

contributions. This is very commendable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the contribution to the Science Centre Board

for  1973-74  is only $4.5 million, an increase  of

$0.5 million over 1972-73. This means that the work

of  the Science Centre Board has increased. I would

like to ask a few questions about the work done and

to be done by the Board:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Since the establishment of the Science Centre

Board,  what work has been done in connection  with

scientific research and science?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) What plans in hand are to be implemented, and

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Mr P. Govindaswamy  and  Tuan Haji  Mohd.  Ariff  Bin Suradi.).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry of Defence, in a very short

space  of  time,  has  done a great  deal  for  the

defence  of  our country. Our young people  in  the

national  service understand the  problems  of  our

country  and they have actively taken part  in  the

national service to shoulder the responsibility  of

defending our country. Since this task has now been

established on a firm basis, we should now  proceed

with  lesser  speed.  On  this  point  of  view,  I

remember  that  at the opening of this  Parliament,

when   the  President  delivered  his  speech,   he

mentioned that we can now proceed with the task  of

nation  building and defence at our own  pace.  The

sum   to  be  allocated  now  is  $65  million  for

development.  It is only half that  of  last  year.

This is a good trend. For this reason, I would like

to   make  two  suggestions  for  the  Minister  to

consider.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, relax the applications for part-time national service. There are some people who

have  to  provide for their families. Some of  them

may  be  graduates and they are very much  required

both by the Government and, the private sector. May

I  quote  an  example? There is a hawker  for  soft

drinks.  Because  of ill-health (he  was  suffering

from  high blood pressure) his business was carried

on  by his children. However, his son was called up

for  national  service last year.  This  particular

hawker,  that  is  the father, applied  to  Central

Manpower  Base for his son to do part-time national

service. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



reason he gave was that his health was failing  and

that   he   could  not  look  after  his  business.

Unfortunately,  his application was rejected.  When

we deal with applications like this, I suggest that

the   Department   concerned  should   give   their

sympathetic consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, for those who are studying abroad, we

should  either  relax the conditions  for  national

service or we grant them deferment. The parents  of

these  students  have  paid  a  deposit  with   the

Government  to  guarantee that their children  will

return  to  serve national service  when  they  are

required to do so. This is, of course, a reasonable

arrangement.   Some   of  these   students,   after

graduation, may be granted scholarships  and  would

therefore like to proceed for another year  or  two

to  do post-graduate research. The parents of these

students  therefore apply for deferment of national

service for their children, and I hope the Minister

will   also   give   such  cases  his   sympathetic

consideration.  These graduates  will  be  able  to

contribute  more  for the country  when  they  have

further  equipped  themselves with  qualifications,

and  I  hope the Minister will help them to  fulfil

their wishes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another case where two brothers have

received  call-up  notices. As  both  brothers  are

called  up, the family will be affected to a  great

extent. Their parents have applied for deferment or

exemption  for one of the boys until the other  boy

has  at  least completed his national  service,  so

that  this  arrangement will  not  affect  whatever

business  the  parents have.  This  will  help  the

family to carry on. I think requests of this nature

are  reasonable, and the Minister should  therefore

consider them sympathetically.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, a few years ago the

question of the standard of driving of our national

servicemen  was  brought  up.  The  Minister   then

replied  that  disciplinary action would  be  taken

against those drivers for careless driving.  For  a

time  the  standard of driving showed  improvement.

But  of late I must say that their standards  have

gone down a great deal. It is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



an uncommon sight to see the jeeps, land rovers and

trucks  with MID number plates speeding  along  the

road  and  causing a danger to other road users.  I

wonder  if the new type of training course has  any

beneficial effects on the MID drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that some students from the

Polytechnic  were asked, at short notice,  to  lake

over  the duties of the ground technicians  at  the

Changi Air Base from our national servicemen. If it

is  true,  why do they ask students, who are  still

engaged'  in  their studies in the Polytechnic,  to

do, the duties at the Changi Air Base?



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, the

Minister of Defence has said in his press statement

that  people  who are domiciled in Singapore,  i.e.

permanent  residents,  will  be  given  citizenship

because they have proved their loyalty to Singapore

by  enlisting  for  national  service.  A  test  of

loyalty  in  such  manner can  be  carried  out  on

persons who are domiciled in Singapore and who  are

within  the call-up age limit for national service.

But  for  those permanent residents whose ages  are

beyond the required age for national service,  what

will  be  the alternative test of their loyalty  so

that  they  can  become  Singapore  citizens?  This

question  of  citizenship has been relaxed  as  the

Minister  has  said  previously.  I  believe  these

permanent residents require citizenship very  badly

in  order  to  get  jobs and  education  for  their

children,  etc.  I believe these  people  are  more

loyal than those who are within the call-up age  of

18  and  21  years,  because  they  are  grown  up,

elderly,  and  they have their wives  and  children

born  in  Singapore. They expect their children  to

have  a  future in Singapore. Can the  Minister  of

Defence  give these people an opportunity to  prove

their   loyalty  in  order  that  they  can  become

citizens?

an  ice-water hawker was not allowed deferment. May

I explain to him the way in which such applications

for  deferment of national service are  handled  in

the  Ministry of Defence? These requests go  before

an  Appeals  Committee, which consists of  ordinary

citizens, teachers and workers and so on, and  they

will  examine the circumstances of the applications

in  some detail. Where it has been established that

the  family  income  will  be  adversely  affected,

deferment is invariably granted. In fact, more than

300  young  men  have  had their  national  service

deferred,  and  in cases where they have  not  been

called up for full-time national service; they have

been asked to do part-time national service. So  it

is not true that we are being very harsh and pay no

heed to the economic circumstances of applicants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, regarding people who study abroad. The

Member  wants us to be more generous.  Actually,  I

think we have been over-generous to the extent that

we  are  now  in  some trouble. May I  explain  the

circumstances?  I  think  I  made  a  statement  in

Parliament some months ago about requiring  parents

of  children who are studying abroad to furnish the

Government  with a bond. And we then  decided  that

this  bond will be forfeited if the young man  does

not  come  back  when he is asked  to  do  national

service.  As a safeguard, we appointed a  committee

to  hear appeals in the event that people say  that

they  cannot furnish this bond. This bond does  not

come  up  to  an awful lot of money  -  $30,000  or

$50,000.  For  some strange reason which  I  cannot

understand,   the  Appeals  Committee   allow   all

appeals. As a result, most of the children studying

abroad,  even  in secondary schools,  are  now  not

under bond. The Minister for Home Affairs and I are

re-examining the whole subject, and we may want  to

re-establish  the amount of bond and  override  the

decision  of the Appeals Committee. The trouble  is

this:  the Member says that those who have  done  a

University first degree should be allowed deferment

to do their Ph.D. It starts actually from secondary

school,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



not  at  the  university. We allow them  to  finish

their  secondary schooling abroad. When they finish

the Cambridge School Certificate or its equivalent,

they   say  they  want  to  do  the  Higher  School

Certificate. So we allow that. And when we do that,

they  say,  "Look,  I  have  got  a  place  in  the

university." If we still allow that, they say, "You

know,  I am doing the Master's Degree." After that,

then they will say, "Now I am going to do my Ph.D."

When  we have done all that, then the parents  come

round and say, "Look, my son is very brilliant.  He

now  wants to do a doctorate of Science." This goes

on,  and by the time we get him, he probably  is  a

grandfather.  This has got to stop,  and  we  shall

have no more nonsense.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I am not in sympathy with what the Member has

said.  If  you  can  maintain your  son  abroad  in

England,  Australia, or America, or whatever  place

it  is, you are not a poor man, and we cannot allow

such  families to form a privileged group to  evade

national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as regards drivers, the Member for Anson

said  that  Army  drivers  are  becoming  dangerous

again. Actually I can give some details of what has

happened  since  I  last  reported  to  Parliament.

Sometime  in  1970, Army trucks  were  involved  in

accidents  at  the rate of about one  accident  per

10,000  miles of travel. This is a rather  shocking

rate  because in the British Army in Singapore  the

accident  rate  was  one  in  every  40,000   miles

travelled. So I enquired very closely into why  our

accident  rate was so high, and it appeared  to  me

that  there were certain faults in the system.  The

first was that when an Army driver got involved  in

an  accident, he was not dealt with by the Army but

by  the  Police. So he was charged before a Traffic

Court  and  usually he would appear in the  Traffic

court  only  after he had left the Army because  of

delays  in  the civil courts. So Army  drivers  who

committed  one offence after another virtually  got

away scot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



free.  They were not punished. I therefore  decided

that  the moment Army drivers are involved  in  any

accident,  they are to be placed under open  arrest

immediately.  The  Commanding  Officer  will   then

investigate the circumstances of the accident,  and

if it is found that the driver is the guilty party,

he will be sentenced to detention. That measure had

an  immediate  effect in making Army drivers  drive

more  carefully.  Hon. Members must  remember  that

these  drivers  are,  not  old  people.  They   are

teenagers, 18 to 19 years old. A 19-year  old  boy,

driving  a three-tonner, will generally feel  quite

grand  about  it  and  will  try  to  push  smaller

vehicles  off the road. But when they get  punished

immediately for any driving offence, they will say,

"Look, we had better be more careful."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other defect in the system was that national

service drivers also act as driving instructors  to

the  new recruits. Hon. Members can imagine  a  19-year  old  boy teaching an 18-year old boy  how  to

drive  a  three-ton truck! This is  not  the  ideal

system. So we have to recruit a lot of regulars  to

make sure that the system of driving instruction is

more satisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of all this, we also have to ensure that

the  trucks  are  better  maintained,  with  proper

brakes,  clutches, and so on. This meant  improving

the  maintenance of Army trucks, getting more spare

parts and recruiting experienced mechanics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that has been done, and the result is that

the  accident  rate has been reduced substantially.

From  one  accident in every 10,000 miles travelled

in  1970,  it  has improved to one in every  23,000

miles in 1971, then to one in every 27,000 miles in

1972.  This rate includes accidents where the fault

lies  not  only with the Army driver but also  with

the  other party. So if you say that half the cases

is  the  fault .of, the Army driver and  the  other

half  the fault of the civilian, you will  get  an,

accident  rate of one in every 50,000 miles,  which

means that we have at least reached the standard of

driving of the British Army in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards speeding, here again the reports of

the  Traffic  Police are taken  seriously  and  are

reported to the Commanding Officer of the  Unit  in

which  the  driver is attached, and the  driver  is

dealt  with by his Commander. I do not quite  agree

with  the  Member  for Anson that  there  are  more

speeding  cases. In fact, my statistics  show  that

the   number  of  speeding  cases  has  gone   down

slightly.  In 1971, there was a monthly average  of

34  complaint of speeding. In 1972 it has gone down

to  26  per month. This is still a lot of cases  of

speeding, and I intend to make sure that Commanding

Officers punish speeding drivers more severely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Polytechnic students at Changi Air

Base,  we  did not `kidnap' any students  from  the

Polytechnic.  These are people who  have  completed

their  studies,  done their national  service,  and

have  completed their basic military training. From

there,  they  are  sent  to  Changi  Air  Base   as

maintenance and repair personnel, where the  skills

they  have learned can be put to good use. The  Air

Force Engineers' tell me that they are doing a good

job there. So that is a good thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampung Kembangan put to me a

poser  as  to how I can test the loyalty of  people

who are outside military age and who are too old to

become soldiers. Well, I really do not know.  I  do

not  think  it is for me to test their  loyalty.  I

think this is something for the Minister for Health

and Home Affairs to deal with these matters. It  is

his problem, not mine.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated to Head 0501 be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 669</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the independence of our country, we have

actively  pursued  a  policy of  non-alignment  and

neutrality,  maximised the number  of  friends  and

minimised  the  number  of  enemies.  This  is  the

fundamental of our foreign policy. As a  result  of

this   policy,   we  have  established   diplomatic

relations with many countries in the world and have

maintained very close relations with many of  them.

We  have  built  up our reputation in international

circles. This is the result not only of the  policy

of  the  Government, but also  the  result  of  the

performance   of  our  knowledgeable  and   learned

Minister for Foreign Affairs. The implementation of

our foreign policy has been very smooth and has met

with no obstacles whatsoever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, we can say we have been very

busy  in  our foreign activities. For example,  the

Prime  Minister  went to Europe and  Thailand;  the

Minister for Foreign Affairs went to India and  Sri

Lanka  for  State visits. In all these visits  they

have accomplished their mission and our country has

been  able  to  further strengthen and  consolidate

relations with these countries. Now there is  peace

in   Vietnam   and  international  relations   have

progressed further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister, in view of this

development,  whether our foreign  policy  will  be

modified. I would also like to ask: now that  there

is  peace  in Vietnam, in what direction  will  our

foreign  policy be taking? Will there be any  basic

change? What are the new diplomatic missions to  be

established   in  foreign  countries   to   further

strengthen  the  relations between these  countries

and Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with the

recent  signing  of  the peace  treaty,  peace  has

become a reality in Vietnam. May I ask how it  will

affect us in our relationship with Southeast  Asian

countries,  and  how  will our commercial  projects

benefit as a, result?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, I brought .up the question of

diplomatic  relations  with  China;  to  which  the

Foreign Minister replied



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 670</b></font><br><br>



[Hansard, Vol. 31, col. 730]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I have stated on many occasions that, in

principle,  since we have recognised and  supported

China's  admission to the United Nations  we  must,

sooner or later, have other forms of relation  with

them. But we are an island-state situated in South-east  Asia. We have many neighbours whose interests

and  views  must be considered should  we  want  to

enter  into  negotiations to establish a diplomatic

mission in the People's Republic of China.'



<br><br>He also mentioned that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Members of ASEAN have discussed this matter and

there  is general agreement that before any  member

of  ASEAN enters into diplomatic relations with the

People's  Republic of China, he  must  consult  the

body and co-ordinate his action.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I know what is the outcome

of  this issue at the moment? Are the ASEAN leaders

still  contemplating on this issue, or  is  it  too

early to discuss the issue?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also one more point which I would like

to  raise,  and that is, the proposal by  the  Thai

Government to construct a canal through the Isthmus

of  Kra which is scheduled to be completed in a few

years'  time.  I  believe that the result  of  this

construction would be that our international  trade

and  foreign policies may be affected. May  I  know

the  views of the Minister whether there  would  be

any threat to our country, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

seems  to  me that the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs

has  had  great difficulties in recruiting suitable

persons to head several overseas missions.  Out  of

the  existing  17 overseas missions, four  missions

are  without representative Heads and some of these

top  posts have been vacant for quite a long  time.

Sir,  I do not think this situation is healthy  and

helpful   in   promoting  or   strengthening   good

relations  between  Singapore and  those  countries

where the missions in question are stationed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are several factors contributing to

the  vacancies of these posts. I wonder whether the

out-dated  and unsatisfactory terms and  conditions

of our Foreign Service are not .the deciding factor

which deters persons of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



good  calibre from joining the Foreign  Service.  I

hope the Minister can quickly remedy this situation

of having embassies without ambassadors.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the past we were often led to believe

that  our future as well as that of Southeast  Asia

as  a whole would to some extent depend on the  way

the  war in Vietnam was to he settled. Now  that  a

settlement  has been reached through  negotiations,

the  dust  has  settled and the post-war  situation

assessed.  I  think it is high time for  us  to  be

informed  as  to  the way in which  the  negotiated

peace in Vietnam will affect the direction of ASEAN

and  whether Singapore has, in accordance with  the

concept of a global city, found a realistic formula

for establishing links with the post-war Indochina.



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, just a brief

intervention,  Sir, one stumbling block  to  better

relations between countries is the difficulty posed

by  differences of ways of life, by differences  in

cultural  attitudes and the poor  understanding  of

the  different forms of these cultural expressions.

Perhaps  one  way  to reduce this obstacle  is  for

cultural   relations   to  be  encouraged   between

countries.  This  may  take the  form  of  informal

discussions  over  exchange  programmes   or   even

cultural agreements or treaties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister for Foreign Affairs enlighten

the House about such cultural arrangements that  we

may have with other countries, formal or otherwise,

and  whether  we intend to extend such co-operation

in the near future?



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I always like to

listen  to  the Member for Sembawang because  every

year  he gives me a diploma for my performance!  In

fact,  his  estimation of my  performance  is  even

better than my own estimation of myself. However, a

number  of  Members have asked a  general  question

about Singapore's foreign policy in view of the end

of the war in Vietnam. Obviously, the settlement of

the war in Vietnam creates new conditions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



and new problems for us, because it will definitely

bring Vietnam into Southeast Asian politics for the

first time since the end of World War II.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to our objectives, of course, they have

always been consistent. First, it is to promote the

national  interests  of  Singapore,  whatever   the

changes  in  the environment. That is our  constant

goal.   Secondly,  it  is  to  promote  Singapore's

security.  Thirdly, to make friends  with  all  who

want  to be friends with us, and fourthly, to  join

with  all nations, both in this region and outside,

who  would ensure peace, stability and progress  in

the  area.  These are constant objectives.  But  we

cannot be assured of what the concrete situation in

the  region  would be, whether there  will  be  one

Vietnam or two Vietnams, and whether the end of the

American    intervention    in    Vietnam     would

automatically end all conflicts in Southeast  Asia.

I  do not know. It is obviously clear that we would

first have to wait and see what the outcome of  the

peace  agreement is. Will there be peace? If  there

is  peace,  then  things will be  much  easier  for

Singapore and for this region. But if there are new

conflicts, then we must study the nature  of  these

conflicts  to see how they will affect any  of  the

four  objectives that I have outlined, and we would

have  to make adjustments accordingly. There is  no

finality  about foreign policy. Foreign  policy  is

something  which you change according  to  changing

circumstances, bearing the four constant objectives

in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with regard to the specific questions asked,

first,  by  the Member for Sembawang. He has  asked

how  many new missions we intend to set up. At  the

moment, as Members know, we have about 17 missions.

It  has  been the policy of the Government  not  to

establish  missions  for the sake  of  prestige  or

establishing  a mission just because  everybody  is

doing  it.  We only establish a mission when  there

are   specific  political,  financial  or  security

interests  involved. If we feel that any  of  these

interests  can best be promoted and safeguarded  by

having  a  mission, then we will have  it.  We  are

rather



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



cautious  about  establishing  missions.  Over  the

years we have gradually increased the number of our

missions as our relations expand. This year, as far

as  our  thinking goes, we intend to establish  two

new  missions in Europe, one in Paris and the other

in  Bonn. This is because of the emergence  of  the

European  Economic  Community  not  only  in  world

politics   but   possibly  also  in  the   economic

development  of  our region. This is  an  important

factor,  and  therefore  we  feel  that  we  should

establish  these two missions. It is also  possible

that  we may, if not this year then later on,  have

to  establish some kind of mission in Vietnam. This

will  depend on how things work out in Vietnam.  If

it  works  out according to the terms of the  peace

agreement,  I think there should be no  problem  at

all  in  establishing  a mission  either  in  North

Vietnam, South Vietnam or in one Vietnam.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has asked what is the latest

with   regard  to  our  developing  new  forms   of

relations  with  the  People's Republic  of  China.

Broadly,  what  I  said last year is  still  valid,

except  that  clearly the establishment  of  closer

relations between China and the countries of South-east Asia is far more imminent now than it was last

year.  But  in view of the particular character  of

Singapore  society  and  the  particular  image  of

Singapore among some countries in Southeast Asia, I

think it would be convenient and definitely prudent

for  Singapore  to allow other countries  first  to

establish  diplomatic missions. We can then  follow

suit  soon  after,  without undue difficulties  for

ourselves.  This  is  one of the  reasons,  as  the

Member for Anson has quite rightly pointed out, why

the  ASEAN countries had an understanding - not  an

agreement -- that before any such move can be  made

by  any  one of the ASEAN countries to establish  a

diplomatic  mission  in  China,  there  should   be

consultation. However, in the case of Indonesia,  I

must  point out that they had diplomatic  relations

with the People's Republic of China



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



before, and they suspended it only because  of  the

difficulties they had a few years ago. But in  view

of   the   fact   that  in  the   present   context

establishing diplomatic relations with  China  will

have  repercussions of varying degrees on  some  of

our  neighbours, it is only fair and  proper  that,

before  any  member-country makes such a  move,  it

should  discuss  the matter with  the  other  ASEAN

countries with a view to determining whether or not

such  repercussions may affect their own  security,

national   interests   or  stability.   Singapore's

position at the moment is this: we are prepared  to

be at the tail-end of the queue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Kra Canal, this matter was

discussed  even when I was a school boy.  It  is  a

perennial subject which comes up from time to time.

But,  as far as we know, only a survey is going  to

be carried out. Even if the canal is going to be  a

fact,  it  will  take  at least  ten  years  before

anything  can  be done. Therefore, I think  we  can

afford  to  be a little bit more relaxed about  the

problem. We can give it serious consideration  only

if it is going to be a fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta raised the question of four

missions which are without Heads of Missions at the

moment.  He  wants to know whether this is  because

the   conditions  of  pay  and  service   are   not

attractive. I can assure him that this is  not  the

case.  We  have no difficulty in finding  Heads  of

Missions  if we want to. But what we are  concerned

is  to  have a Head of Mission who can perform  his

functions  effectively in the country to  which  he

will  be sent. It is more a question of the quality

of  the  person.  A  Head of Mission  may  be  very

effective in one country, but he may not be able to

perform  or  fulfil his functions equally  well  in

another   country  because  of  language   or   the

personality  of the man in relation to  the  place.

For  example,  an  ambassador  in  Washington  must

behave  differently from an ambassador  in  Moscow.

They have different approaches. That is the problem

we are confronted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



with.  It  is really a problem of finding  suitable

persons  for the particular countries, and not  the

conditions of service. However, I think it is quite

likely that some of these missions, in fact all  of

them, would have Heads of Missions fairly soon.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Katong raised the question of

encouraging cultural relations and having  treaties

with  other countries. As a matter of fact, we have

cultural treaties with a number of countries.  Some

countries  do not sign such treaties but  we  still

have  cultural  exchanges,  whether  in  terms   of

visiting   troupes   of  musicians,   painters   or

artistes.  Over  the  years,  this  has  tended  to

increase.  What  has  fallen  short  is   that   we

ourselves   have  not  been  in   a   position   to

reciprocate.  It  is  largely  because  it  is  not

feasible  or financially possible for  us  to  send

cultural  missions  abroad as frequently  as  other

countries do. But I hope that in the near future we

may  venture  a little bit more than what  we  have

done  in  the past and send some cultural missions,

especially in Southeast Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we define "culture" a little bit more broadly,

we do have cultural exchanges. We have students who

come  and  study here. The Institute  of  Southeast

Asian   Studies  holds  seminars  and  affords   an

opportunity  for  intellectuals  and   experts   in

various  fields  to meet together  to  discuss  and

understand one another's problems. In the field  of

cultural  exchanges, we are not  doing  too  badly,

although  it  is quite true that we can  always  do

better.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in view of

the  detailed  reply given by the  Minister  to  my

satisfaction, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1006.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is our Government planning to open any more

embassies in other countries



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



in the near future? In view of the fact  that

nowadays  some elements may have hostile intentions

towards  certain countries, I wonder if  any  extra

security  precautions  are  being  taken   at   our

embassies abroad? This is to ensure that we do  not

suffer the fate of one embassy in Bangkok or,  more

recently, one in Sudan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, in view of the fact that our

stated policy is to be friendly with all countries,

I  hope  the  fears that the Member for  Anson  has

manifested  in  regard  to  the  security  of   our

ambassadors  overseas would not be  as  serious  as

that.   We   are  relying  mainly  on  the   Vienna

Convention which governs diplomatic relations under

which the host country or the receiving state  must

guarantee  the  security of both the  personnel  as

well  as the mission in the country to which it  is

accredited. However, in the normal course of events

we  have taken certain elementary precautions,  not

because  we  believe  that  we  are  in  a  hostile

territory and not because we fear any hostile  acts

against  us,  but  because we want  to  ensure  the

normal security, like making sure of the bona fides

of  visitors, fencing of missions where we can, and

taking  normal security precautions with regard  to

documents,  confidential reports and so  on.  Apart

from  that,  there  is no likelihood,  I  hope,  of

Singapore  embassies in foreign countries suffering

the  same fate as that of the Saudi Arabian embassy

in Sudan.

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2021.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I just want to know more about the rental of

a photo-copying machine. Is this vote provided only

for the financial year 1973-74, or will there be  a

similar  provision for the coming years? There  was

no  such  provision for the financial year 1972-73.

If  the photocopying machine is also to be used  in

the  coming  years,  does the Ministry  of  Foreign

Affairs  not  think  of saving money  by  buying  a

machine rather than renting it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, as far as I know, this is a

charge for the hire of a photocopying machine.  For

financial  reasons,  it is  cheaper  to  rent  this

machine  than  to buy one. Because of  the  various

sizes  of  documents  to be copied  and  the  large

numbers  required for distribution to our missions,

we  have found that the small machine which we  now

have  is quite unsuitable for this purpose. On  the

other  hand, the cost of purchasing a big  machine,

advanced enough to handle the material for copying,

would   be   unduly  expensive,  in  fact,   almost

prohibitive if we are to add yearly depreciation to

the  cost.  It is felt that for the time being,  an

expenditure  of  $5,000 a  year  on  rent  is  more

economical than to buy one. But if, at some  future

time,  the  volume of material churned  out  by  my

Ministry for distribution justifies this,  then  we

may  consider  purchase of  the  machine.  For  the

moment, I understand it is not at all economical to

buy the machine.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, in view of

the  reply  given by the Minister, I beg  leave  to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg

to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3003.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I merely wish to

seek  clarification from the Minister  for  Foreign

Affairs  as  to the number of awards  to  be  given

under the ASEAN Training Awards scheme, and in what

fields  of training. I notice that there  has  been

almost a two-fold



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>



increase in the provision, from $52,000 in  1972-73

to $100,000 for the financial year 1973-74.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, the increase in the provision

for  the  year  1973-74 is really to finance  ASEAN

training awards which, as the Member knows, started

in  1971.  Over the years the call on Singapore  to

train  people  from  ASEAN countries  has  steadily

increased. According to statistics that I have, for

the  first  year  there were 17 places  in  various

fields  of  studies, like poultry training,  public

works,  road  construction, building  construction,

sewerage,  and  so  on. For  the  second  year,  it

increased to 41 places for some 13 courses such  as

botanic   studies,  fire-fighting,   librarianship,

market   gardening,  prison  work,  public  health,

nursing, social welfare, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the financial year 1973-74, there will be

some   47  places  in  16  different  courses  and,

therefore, this increase is to meet such demands as

we  feel would be made on us to train. I think this

is  a good thing and Singapore is doing far more in

this respect. The money is worth the goodwill,  and

it  also  affords an opportunity for  Singapore  to

pass  on  on  what  skills as it may  have  to  our

neighbouring countries in the spirit of  ASEAN  co-operation.  This money is well spent  and  we  hope

that if further calls are made to increase the  sum

next year, we shall be happy to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, in view of the Minister's

reply, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3104.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Foreign Affairs mentioned

just  now that two new missions will be set  up  in

Europe this year, and also "some kind of mission in

North Vietnam or South Vietnam or one Vietnam" will

also  be  set  up, if necessary. According  to  the

Memorandum on the Main and Development



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



Estimates of Singapore, it says that Trade  Offices

would  also be set up under this vote.  If  it  is,

could I ask the Minister to inform this House as to

where would the trade offices be set up.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I think the trade offices may

be  the  first step towards establishing diplomatic

relations  with Indo-china. We may have  to  do  it

progressively  in the Indo-chinese states.  As  you

know,  a  trade  office is less  political  than  a

diplomatic mission. Sometimes it is better to enter

through the non-political gate first, before moving

into much closer relations at once.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may set up a few others, but we are not quite

sure  yet.  Perhaps in Europe, if the need  arises,

but there we do not yet know how our relations with

the  EEC would develop. So it may be possible.  But

primarily this vote is really for Indo-china.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am satisfied

with  the  Minister's reply, and  I  beg  leave  to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $18,903,820 for Head 0501 ordered to

stand part of the Main Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0601 --



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0601 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

(*The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr P. Govindaswamy.).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise two matters:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) how to prevent industrial accidents, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) relaxation of the requirements for work

permits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the rapid development of our

industrialisation  programme   all   these   years,

industrial  accidents  have been  on  the  increase

recently.  Workers are either injured, disabled  or

have  lost  their lives. The Government  has  taken

various steps to prevent industrial accidents,  but

the  situation still remains the same. In fact,  in

spite of the various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



measures   taken   by  the  Ministry   of   Labour,

industrial  accidents are still  on  the  increase.

According  to statistics given by the  Ministry  of

Labour,   over   the  past  ten  years   industrial

accidents resulting in death increased by 258,  and

the   number   of  workers  involved  in   nonfatal

accidents increased by 500 per cent. What  are  the

causes  for all these increases? We must find  them

out  and take preventive measures. According to  an

explanation  given  by  the Minister,  one  of  the

reasons  for  these accidents is that  the  Factory

Inspectorate  is  still  under-staffed,  and  as  a

result,   inspections   cannot   be   carried   out

extensively, and that there is really  very  little

that can be done to improve the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, during the debate on the Budget

statement,  the Minister for Labour  revealed  that

the  Factory Inspectorate has a staff  of  only  20

members. This number may have remained the same for

the  past  ten years. This is a very unsatisfactory

state  of affairs. We know that ten years  ago  our

industrial  development was still  in  the  initial

stages.  The  number  of factories  was  then  very

small, around 300 to 400 factories. But now we have

some 2,000 factories in Singapore. In spite of this

increase in the number of factories, the number  of

factory  inspectors still remained at 20.  How  can

this number be enough? Because of this gross under-staffing,  a  lot of Labour regulations  cannot  be

enforced  or  implemented. This shortage  of  staff

should  be  overcome. Are we going  to  allow  this

shortage to carry on and do nothing about  it?  No.

We  can  recruit  more  inspectors.  Is  there  any

problem  about  the  salary or  the  terms  of  the

conditions? There should be no problem because  the

number is small, only 20. We have a surplus of some

$20  million. So, to increase the number of factory

inspectors will only mean increasing our burden  by

a  very  small  degree. I hope  the  Minister  will

recruit more factory inspectors to go on rounds  in

the factories to enforce the rules and regulations,

and to ensure that old machines are not allowed  to

be used any more. Employers must be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



held  responsible for the continued use of old  and

inefficient   machines.  It  is  only   then   that

industrial   safety  measures  can  be  implemented

properly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the question of relaxation of

requirements for work permits. Although  there  has

been   some  improvement  in  recent  years,   this

improvement  is  only in respect  of  the  building

construction industry. So a review has to  be  made

in  other  respects. For example,  shopkeepers  and

clerks  are still in short supply because  of  this

over-restrictive requirement for work permits. As a

result  of  this,  some shops for  example,  barber

shops and coffeeshops are still shorthanded. It  is

my  hope  that the Minister will consider a further

relaxation  of the requirement for work permits  in

respect of clerical staff and shop assistants so as

to help these shopkeepers.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have

another three remaining amendments* under the  same Head,  may I seek your permission to speak on these

amendments,  as  it  will then be  easier  for  the Minister to answer?

            be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1351.

</pre>

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, we are experiencing a

boom of enormous proportions. It is greatly due  to

our  present economic policy. We have brought about

a sound government. A good and practical government

has  brought in investors flocking into this island

to invest. All this is good for us, considering the

fact  that many of our neighbours are not so lucky.

Whereas there is unemployment in many parts



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



of  Asia, we are experiencing the reverse. Thus  we

have  a  good number of work permit holders  and  a

number  of  temporary  work permit  holders.  These

temporary  work  permit  holders  have  created   a

problem.  Do  you not think, Sir, that  these  work

permit  holders, who are non-unionised, are  liable

to  exploitation by unscrupulous employers?  It  is

time  we introduced a minimum wage limit for  these

poor  unfortunate  people  who,  because  of  their

circumstances,   have   to   seek   employment   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding fire-fighting equipment and other

professional appliances to combat fire in firms and

factories, could the workers not be taught to  make

use of these facilities in case of emergency? Fires

can  break  out  at any time during the  course  of

their   duties.  There  are  also  instances  where

applicants  for work permits have used  decorations

and  titles to their names to claim certain skills.

But  when work permits are issued to them, they are

found not able to do any skilled work. This sort of

irregularity should be corrected. Though the Office

is  liberal with the issue of work permits to  non-citizens, at this stage I believe there are quite a

number of such "irregular" work permit holders.  Is

there  any  discrimination in  the  issue  of  work

permits?  I  have  heard of  a  complaint  of  work

permits being indiscriminately issued.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could the Minister also enlighten the House as to

the recent dispute which our seamen encountered  in

Australia?  And is there any remedial action  taken

on this subject?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, according to the Labour Ministry, more

than 10,000 accidents



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



have  taken place in work places, of which  over  a

hundred  cases  are  fatal. In view  of  the  rapid

industrialisation   in   Singapore,   we   have   a

phenomenal  increase  in the number  of  factories.

However, our Factory Inspectorate consists of eight

Inspectors who are expected to carry out spotchecks

on our factories. How can eight Inspectors check on

factories  throughout  the  various  parts  of  the

island?  No  wonder we have so many  violations  of

safety  rules,  and  safety precautions  have  been

found to be lax in most factories. If we are really

interested  in safety precautions in our factories,

it  is time the number of Inspectors were increased

several-fold  so that the Factory Inspectorate  can

do its work efficiently.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist (Potong Pasir):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  terrible  toll in the number of  accidents  in

factories in Singapore is causing great concern  to

the  NTUC. I am sure the Minister realises that the

four E's towards accident prevention is a necessity

for  his Ministry to uphold. The four E's are:  (1)

Engineering, that is, the safeguarding of machinery

and  assurance that safety equipment are being used

by   workers.  (2)  Enthusiasm,  the  creation   of

enthusiasm  of  the  workers and employers  towards

industrial health and safety. (3) Education,  which

is  a  means to ensure that accidents actually  are

limited. (4) Last, but not least, enforcement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang has touched on

enforcement, and I would like to ask what steps the

Minister   is  taking  to  improve  Education   and

Enthusiasm  to ensure that workers do not  continue

to  suffer  in  this terrible way where  industrial

accidents are concerned.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for Sembawang will

recollect that in Parliament last year I outlined a

three-prong  strategy  to  reduce  the  number   of

industrial accidents



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



occurring in Singapore. Firstly, appropriate

measures   were  taken  to  tighten   up   existing

legislation  to  provide for  higher  standards  of

health, safety and welfare in the factories and  at

construction   sites.   Secondly,   the    Building

Operations  and  Works of Engineering  Construction

Regulations,  1971, were promulgated to  deal  with

the problems of high accident rates in the building

construction   trade.  Thirdly,  the   quantum   of

workmen's  compensation payable under the Workmen's

Compensation Act was trebled to encourage employers

to  provide more adequate safety measures for their

employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will also recall that a two-week long

national  campaign on industrial safety and  health

was launched in March last year. This was aimed  at

creating public awareness to the increasing rate of

industrial  accidents in the Republic  and  driving

home  the message that industrial accidents,  quite

apart  from  bringing sorrow  and  anguish  to  the

victims  and their families, also result in  social

and economic losses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new Factories Bill has gone through its Third

Reading  in  Parliament recently. Upon coming  into

force, the provisions relating to the establishment

of  safety committees and the appointment of safety

officers  and industrial nurses would be  enforced.

Although  I  quite agree with both the  Member  for

Sembawang and the Member for Anson that the  number

of  factory inspectors should be increased if it is

to be more effective - nevertheless, with the force

that  is  available at present,  the  Ministry  has

stepped   up   its  inspection  of  factories   and

construction worksites with a view to ensuring that

the  safety regulations under the law are  strictly

complied with. For the information of hon. Members,

a  total of 11,000 inspections were carried out  in

1972, doubling that of the previous year, resulting

in  234 court actions. This result was achieved  in

spite  of  the fact that the establishment  of  the

Inspectorate has been rather small, as pointed  out

by some Members



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ministry is also setting up study groups

to  consider  and make recommendations  on  various

aspects of industrial health and safety in specific

industries.  I  think  the shipbuilding  and  ship-repairing  industries will receive prior attention,

as  the accident rates have been particularly  high

in  the last year. These study groups will comprise

persons  who  are conversant and directly  involved

with  the  problems in the industries concerned  so

that  their  recommendations  can  be  adopted  and

implemented. Furthermore, the services  of  an  ILO

expert   on  industrial  health  and  safety   have

recently been enlisted. Among other things, he will

help   organise  and  conduct  courses  for  safety

officers both in the public and private sectors. As

a  further  step,  the Ministry is also  finalising

plans  for the registration of contractors. Certain

minimal  safety  standards  will  be  imposed  upon

registered   contractors.  It  must,  however,   be

stressed that prevention of industrial accidents is

a  tripartite responsibility. Without  the  sincere

and   wholehearted  support  of  the  workers   and

employers, stern and punitive measures on the  part

of  Government alone can at best only  bring  about

partial  solution.  In this respect,  it  is  quite

heartening  to  note that the  NTUC  is  taking  an

active  interest in educating its  members,  and  I

hope  that  with the effort of both Government  and

the  unions as well as the employers, the  rate  of

industrial  accidents may be reduced in the  coming

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also made a plea for

further   liberalisation  of  the  issue  of   work

permits, while the Member for Anson held a contrary

view.  Mr  Speaker, Sir, in so far as the issue  of

work  permits is concerned, the Ministry  has  been

granting work permits liberally to non-citizens who

possess   the  skills  Singapore  needs,  who   are

hardworking  and who, because of their  educational

or  other  qualifications, can be trained  for  our

necessary  skills and disciplines. The request  for

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



liberal  issue  of  work  permits  to  white-collar

workers, such as clerks and shop assistants, cannot

be  granted, because the need for immigrant workers

is  in  the factories i.e, in the blue-collar jobs,

not  the white-collar jobs. The Government  has  no

intention  to liberalise the issue of work  permits

for shop assistants and clerical workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a limit to which the issue of work

permits can be liberalised. The Government  has  to

ensure  that only those who can contribute  to  the

growth  of  the economy and the well-being  of  the

State are admitted, so that the social services for

our  own  citizens  are  not overstrained  and  the

quality  of  life is not lowered. So  work  permits

will  continue to be liberally given to technicians

and  skilled workers. If they prove to be an  asset

to  the  country,  the  Government  will  take  the

necessary  measures to enable them  to  have  their

yearly work permits renewed on a three-yearly basis

on   the  recommendation  of  their  employers.  In

addition,   they   will  also   be   eligible   for

consideration  for  permanent  residence  within  a

period of five years. This, we hope, will encourage

those  who  would  be an asset to  the  country  to

remain in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I think the Minister's reply is reasonable  as

we  feel  that  there  is  a  shortage  of  skilled

workers.   It   is   my  hope  that   the   Factory

Inspectorate  will  get  the  necessary  staff   to

enforce  the rules and regulations more effectively

against  industrial accidents, so that we need  not

have  to  talk about industrial accidents any  more

next year. On this note, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Cheong Yuen Chee, Ong Teng Cheong and Ho Kah Leong.).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise two matters: (1)

improvement to bus services in Singapore; and (2)

improvement to electrification programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of public bus services, Sir, it

cannot  be denied that after the reorganisation  of

the  motor  transport service two years ago,  there

has been considerable improvement. For example, the

routes  of  the bus services have been extended  to

cut  down the necessity to change buses. These  are

very  good  measures. But in  spite  of  all  these

improvements,  there  are still  some  shortcomings

which merit our attention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, buses fail to keep to their schedule. We

have received many complaints from the public about

this, and I myself have seen that at many bus stops

there are always crowds. The complaints are that  a

lot  of  people have to wait for more than half  an

hour  for a bus, resulting in their being late  for

work.  At  other times, half a dozen or more  buses

will  arrive at the same time, as if they are on  a

rampage, thus causing traffic congestion. This is a

serious  situation,  and it is  my  hope  that  the

Minister will take immediate and effective measures

to remedy this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there are many accidents involving

buses.  Over  the past year, we can  see  that  the

number  of accidents involving buses is increasing.

Many people have been injured or even killed on the

roads  because of such accidents. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

what  are  the causes for such an increase  in  the

accident rate? Is it because of the poor driving of

the  bus drivers, or because of lack of experience,

or  because of some other reasons? Or is it because

buses  are too old and the engines are not in  good

condition?  I hope the Minister will take  measures

to improve this situation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, we should take immediate steps to ensure

that  the  over-aged buses are replaced. I remember

that  in  April 1971 when the White  Paper  on  the

Reorganisation of the Motor Transport  Service  was

published,  the Minister explained in great  detail

how  a  time-table would be provided in  which  old

buses  would  be replaced gradually. Every  year  a

certain  number  of  old buses  would  be  replaced

according  to  a time-table. But in spite  of  that

time-table we still see old "bone-shakers"  on  the

road. There are many breakdowns of old buses on the

road,  and  some  bus  drivers  would  just  put  a

triangular Safety sign at the tail-end of  the  bus

and walk off leaving the bus behind for display. As

a  result of such breakdowns, traffic congestion is

frequently  seen on the road. I hope  the  Minister

can  tell this House whether the replacement of old

buses  has been carried out according to the  time-table,  which  is  to  ensure that  old  buses  are

replaced   completely   in  due   course,   thereby

improving our public bus services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Sir, the attitude of bus conductors

should  be improved. We have read in the newspapers

many  complaints  about  the  trouble  between  bus

conductors and passengers. Many people have written

to   the  newspapers  to  complain  that  there  is

discourtesy  on  the  part of  bus  conductors.  Of

course,  explanations have been given  by  the  bus

conductors, and there have also been accusations by

bus  conductors  against  passengers.  We  are  not

arbiters in such disputes. In any case, it  is  bad

to   hear  of  disputes  and  trouble  between  bus

conductors and passengers, no matter who  is  right

or  wrong.  It may be due to some misunderstanding.

But  bad impression is created for tourists because

of  these disputes. It is my view that the Ministry

concerned should hold consultations with the unions

of bus workers and the Association of Bus Employers

for the general improvement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>



of the services provided by the bus workers. We can

hold  courtesy campaigns and training  courses  for

the bus workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the next point I wish to raise

is the improvement of telephone services. Generally

speaking,  telephones  arc  a  common  feature   in

Singapore.  They are even available  in  the  rural

areas.  However,  the popularity of  telephones  in

Singapore does not mean that our telephone services

are  efficient.  We all have this experience,  Sir.

Very often, we cannot get through a call because of

some  faulty  lines, particularly when  a  call  is

being  made to Government Ministries, for  example,

the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Education,

or  even the Ministry of Communications itself.  We

have  a Ministry of Communications which cannot  be

communicated with! Sometimes when I try  to  put  a

call through to these Ministries, it would take  me

more than half an hour to do so. As the Member  for

Sembawang,  I have to make a number of calls  every

day in order to get in touch with either the branch

officials  or the Management Committee  members  of

the  Citizens' Consultative Committee because  many

matters have to be attended to. Very often  I  have

tried  to  get a call through for half an hour  and

even  then I might not get through. After  dialling

5-0, I cannot get beyond that number. In some other

instances,  I cannot get through when  I  dial  the

last  digit.  It  may  well be  that  the  line  is

engaged.  But  sometimes before  I  could  complete

dialling  the  number, I would not get  the  proper

signal.  Other  than the fact that  the  lines  are

engaged,  what is the explanation for my not  being

able to get through a line after dialling the first

digit?  I  hope  the Minister will  look  into  the

causes   of   these  breakdowns  in  our  telephone

service.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

what  I  intend  to raise has already  been  partly

covered  by the Member for Sembawang. Nevertheless,

I  would  like  to  share his views  that  our  bus

services have indeed deteriorated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>



since the reorganisation of the bus services

in   April  last  year.  There  are  more  frequent

breakdowns of buses, and more buses are involved in

accidents.   As   mentioned  by  the   Member   for

Sembawang,  this may be due to the recklessness  on

the part of bus drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To emphasise the seriousness of these accidents I

would  like  to enumerate a few accidents  which  I

myself have seen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two buses ran off the road in Toa Payoh as they

were  coming out from the depot. One bus overturned

when  taking the bend at the circus in  Toa  Payoh.

These  accidents occurred three days in succession.

Recently one bus rammed into the Toa Payoh flyover.

I  also  witnessed an accident in which  two  buses

were  sandwiching a small Fiat Marvellette in Upper

Bukit Timah Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest, firstly, that the Minister for

Communications  should take more adequate  measures

to  prevent loss of life or serious injury  to  bus

commuters.  Secondly,  I would  also  suggest  that

heavier  penalties  be imposed on  bus  owners  for

failure  to maintain the buses in proper condition,

which  could  lead  to frequent breakdowns.  Checks

should   also  be  made, on  the  bus   companies'

workshops  to  ascertain that they are sufficiently

equipped to handle repairs and maintenance of their

vehicles.   Thirdly,  there  should   be   adequate

technical  staff to maintain and man the workshops.

And, in connection with accidents, severe penalties

should be imposed on drivers involved in accidents,

such as a longer suspension of their licences. This

may  to  a  certain  extent deter  them  from  rash

driving.  Imposition  of fines,  as  has  been  the

practice, is not a sufficient deterrent so far, and

we  find that more and more drivers are reckless in

their  driving. It is not uncommon  to  see  a  bus

following closely behind you, possibly about a foot

away from your car, and stepping on the accelerator

as  though it is breathing down your necks. I think

this behaviour on the part of bus drivers should be

stopped. I fully



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



support   the  point  raised  by  the  Member   for

Sembawang  for more effective control  of  our  bus

drivers as well as bus operators.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

Government  is  aware  of the  deteriorating  urban

traffic  situation.  It has, in  the  recent  past,

introduced measures to improve the public transport

services  and  to  retard the  increasing  rate  of

private  car  ownership and usage with  a  view  to

achieving  a  more balanced traffic situation.  For

example,  the White Paper on the Reorganisation  of

the Motor Transport Services in 1970 and the recent

Ministerial statement introducing increases in road

tax   on   private  cars  are  highly   commendable

measures,  but  they alone do not provide  a  total

solution to the urban transportation problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the public transport service has greatly

improved  since the last reorganisation, there  are

still many shortcomings. We should not forget  that

bus commuters have to walk from their homes or from

wherever  they are to the bus stops, and having  to

wait  for  the buses under local climatic condition

is an experience which we all know what it is like.

Many  bus  stops  are  still without  any  form  of

shelter.   As  a  representative  from   a   highly

urbanised domestic constituency, I would be failing

in  my  duty if I do not bring to the attention  of

the  Minister that there are only about a dozen bus

shelters in the whole of Toa Payoh New Town,  which

presently houses some 100,000 people. Some of  them

have  been  living  there since 1965  and  1966.  I

cannot  see  any reason why we should  continue  to

allow  our fellow bus commuters to be subjected  to

the  dangers, humiliation and inconveniences  which

most of them are facing today. I would like to  see

the  Government put in more effort to make the  bus

commuters'   journey   less  miserable   and   less

dangerous  by providing proper and safe  pedestrian

footways  either  along the  ground,  overhead,  or

underpass   and   also  providing  sufficient   bus

shelters,  especially in highly  populated  housing

estates, within the earliest possible time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are aware that there is a study currently in

progress   to   advise  the   Government   on   the

feasibility  of introducing the Mass Rapid  Transit

System.  The  failure  or  success  of  the  system

depends  very  much upon the rate of  switching  of

commuters  from  buses to private cars  before  the

Mass  Rapid  Transit System is put into  operation.

Experience  elsewhere  has indicated  that  once  a

commuter   has   experienced   the   comfort    and

convenience  of  travelling in a  private  car,  it

would  be  extremely difficult to persuade  him  to

give up his car and to travel in a bus or in a Mass

Rapid  Transit  System. Even if we  are  eventually

going to have a Mass Rapid Transit System, we would

still  have  to  provide  good  and  efficient  bus

services  to  supplement  the  Mass  Rapid  Transit

System  to  form  a totally balanced transportation

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is estimated that the total revenue from

road  tax and motor vehicle registration alone  for

the  coming financial year will amount to some  $73

million.  However,  the  vote  allocated   in   the

Development  Estimates  for  the  construction  and

improvement  of roads and bridges total  less  than

$23  million. Of this figure, only half  a  million

dollars has been set aside for the provision of bus

bays, bus shelters, vehicle parks, road-side curbs,

etc.  This  is  obviously  grossly  inadequate.  It

appears   that   there  should  be   no   financial

difficulty  in ploughing back more funds  from  the

Revenue  for  the provision of bus  shelters,  foot

bridges  and  other facilities for  the  commuters.

Since  the  Ministry of Communications  is  looking

after   the  public  transport  services  and   the

Ministry of National Development is responsible for

the  construction of bus shelters, foot bridges and

footways etc., I would suggest that there should be

closer co-ordination between the two Ministries.



<br><br>5.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during last year's Budget debate, the

Minister  for Communications quoted the  conclusion

of a critical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



article from the New Nation, and I like to quote it

again [Hansard, Vol 31, No. 12, cols. 806-7]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It would also be nice to bear in mind that

Singapore has the best public transportation system

in the region, if not the whole of Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tax-paying public can rejoice in the fact

that it is also one of the few-non-Government-owned

non-subsidized services in the world.  It  makes  a

profit!'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to ensure that our bus commuters

give  their continued support and patronage of  the

public  transport service, for which  they  deserve

comfort  and  convenience, and  that  part  of  the

profits  made  by these bus operators  is  ploughed

back to serve the bus commuters, I wonder if I  can

suggest to the Minister for Communications to  look

into the possibility of requiring bus operators  to

make  financial  contributions in  future  for  the

provision of bus shelters along new service routes,

as an integral part of their services.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, under this amendment, I would like to

raise  two questions. The first question  is  about

trunk  calls.  I  understand that many  businessmen

have  complained that trunk calls take a long  time

before  they  can  get a connection.  Sometimes  it

takes three to four hours. And sometimes when trunk

calls have been booked in advance, they do not  get

any  reply.  When they inquired from the  Singapore

Telephone  Board, they found that the operator  had

forgotten about the booking. Perhaps the staff  are

overworked,  so  much so in some  cases  they  have

forgotten about the bookings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that Singapore is going to be a

regional  financial  and  industrial  centre   and,

therefore, the communications link between overseas

countries  and  Singapore must  be  maintained  and

improved.  Part  of this is, of course,  the  trunk

call service. I hope that this inadequacy will  not

handicap  the  development of our country  in  this

respect.  I  would like to know what  the  Minister

proposes  to do to improve our overseas trunk  call

service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is in regard to the telephone

service  in  Jurong.  We know that  Jurong  is  our

largest  industrial  estate. There  are  about  400

factories  in  full production. But  the  telephone

service in Jurong has not improved very much.  This

is particularly obvious in the mornings between the

hours  of 10 a.m, and 12 noon. Very often we cannot

get  our calls through. This is the peak period.  I

do  not  know  what  plans the Singapore  Telephone

Board  has  to  improve  the telephone  service  in

Jurong.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ivan Baptist -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ivan Baptist:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, permit me to

echo  the  sentiments of the Members for Sembawang,

Toa  Payoh and Kim Keat regarding the bus transport

system  in our Republic. I would, however, like  to

add  that  the  state of the buses in Singapore  is

atrocious  indeed. They are rarely kept  clean  and

their  smoky  exhausts pollute the  environment.  I

would  urge  the  Minister  for  Communications  to

consider these matters and let us know if plans are

ahead  to ensure that the buses are kept clean  and

pollution-free. I hope the Minister, in considering

the  matter,  will not peeve the  Chairman  of  the

Public  Utilities Board by using too  much  potable

water.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may I add to the comments that have been voiced  by

various Members of Parliament? I think we should be

fair when we talk about the poor bus service. If we

have  a  poor bus service today, it is not  because

the  bus service itself, in isolation, is poor.  If

indeed  we have a system that is somewhat short  of

ideal,  it  is  only a reflection of what  we  have

existing in Singapore, and that I take to mean more

than  just  the bus service. We have at  fault  the

ordinary  bus driver, the ordinary vehicle  driver,

the  ordinary lorry driver and the pedestrians.  If

we  want  to teach the bus drivers to drive better,

we  must  also  at the same time try  to  inculcate

better driving habits in other drivers as well, and

our  pedestrians  too. It is quite  common  to  see

pedestrians not using the, pedestrian paths or  the

overhead



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



bridges  but  to  run  across  or  to  jump  across

railings just to take the shortest way to the other

side  of  the  road,  thus adding  to  the  traffic

congestion that we already have. Therefore,  if  we

are  to  consider right now any measures to improve

the bus service, let us take it in toto, and unless

we do that we are not being fair in our comments on

the bus drivers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest to the Minister for

Communications that, with haste, he might  consider

setting up a committee to study this problem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

on  the question of bus services, I would also like

to  take the opportunity of asking the Minister  to

look  into the question of assigning new buses  for

the  rural  areas  and not some  broken-down  bone-shakers.  My  constituents  have  time  and   again

written  to the newspapers to complain. It  is  all

very  well to extend the bus routes, but  it  takes

two  hours  to  get to town. I am quite  sure  this

applies to areas like Jurong, Chua Chu Kang and the

other  outlying rural areas. I cannot see  why  the

rural  folks should be penalised just because  they

are staying in the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the Member for Jurong  just  now

mentioned  something  about  overseas  trunk   call

services.  I feel that generally such a  difficulty

exists. Usually when people try to make trunk calls

overseas, they find that they cannot get through in

a  short  time  in  order to communicate  with  the

persons  abroad. Even when there is a  booking  for

the trunk call, they cannot get their calls through

at  the scheduled time. I feel that this is a waste

of  time,  particularly of businessmen, because  if

they  have  to wait one or two hours  just  to  get

through  a  short message, then this  is  really  a

waste  of time and it is very uneconomical. I would

like  to suggest to the Minister to look into  this

matter in order to rectify the situation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, considering the number of

Members  who have commented on the bus services  in

Singapore,  may I begin by saying that my  Ministry

is not complacent about the state of affairs of our

bus  services, although we feel that ever since the

reorganisation which took place two years  ago,  we

can  say  that there has been quite an  improvement

over   previous  years.  There  are  many   factors

pertaining  to the public bus services  which  have

got  to  be looked into before we pass any comments

or  criticise without knowing the actual background

and history.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only two years ago, before introducing the

reorganisation  of  the bus  services,  we  had  to

contend  with getting about 8,000 to 10,000  pirate

taxis off the roads and to get the bus companies to

meet  the  vacuum  once they were  off  the  roads.

Another difficulty, which perhaps we may lose sight

of,  is the fact that after having reorganised  the

bus services in April 1971, which is just less than

two  years ago, one great casualty occurred in that

the Singapore Traction Company collapsed. It is all

very well, now that everything is over, for you  to

forget how tragic this event actually was. It  was,

now  that it is all over, a very large company with

$14 million paid-up capital, employing nearly 3,000

workers.  The  reorganisation  brought  about   the

collapse  of this company and 400 of its buses  had

to  be  taken over by the other three companies.  A

great  number  of  these 400 buses  are  derelicts.

Today,  very  often  we see  them  in  a  state  of

breakdown  on our roads. But what is most important

was  the  fact that nearly 3,000 workers  were  not

unemployed. They were given employment by the other

three  bus  companies without any single cent  from

the  Government. These were private companies which

rose to the occasion. So, to be fair to these three

companies,  let us not keep saying that  they  have

not played their part.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the hon. Member for Kim Keat took

the opportunity to quote what I said last year from

a  newspaper  article.  The reason  I  quoted  that

article  was  just that here was a newspaper  which

probed  into  the  matter and  came  to  a  certain

conclusion. It is true that the three bus companies

managed to make a profit, whereas the STC which had

a  monopoly  of the bus services for umpteen  years

showed  losses  of  over $5 million.  To  be  fair,

therefore, I would say the three bus companies took

over  this  bankrupt bus company of 400  buses  and

nearly 3,000 workers into their midst; and they are

running  it to the best of their ability.  We  must

give  them time to re-adjust to the new conditions.

It is only just one year since they have been given

this  opportunity,  before we begin  to  criticise.

They  must  be given time to earn the revenue  with

which they can buy more new buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the suggestion by the hon. Member for Kim

Keat that perhaps the profits from these three  bus

companies  should  be used for  building  more  bus

shelters  is  a good one. But I would  prefer  that

their profits, if any, should be ploughed back  for

the purchase of more new buses because the question

of erection of bus shelters rightfully falls on the

Government.  In  fact,  it  is  the  Public   Works

Department  that  handles this. I  agree  that  not

enough  bus  shelters  are being  provided  at  the

present  moment. But here again let  us  give  them

some  time  to  allow money to be  properly  spent,

because there is still a period of adjustment.  The

present  bus shelter sites are not necessarily  the

best. They may have to be moved. So we do not  want

to  tear  down $30,000 worth of bus shelters  today

and then move them elsewhere in a few months' time.

I  think it is a question of time really before  we

can  bring about a state of affairs of which we can

be  proud. But I do ask for time to be fair to  the

companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me assure hon. Members that whilst they may

appear  to show some profits - I must confess  that

up  to  today, my Ministry has not received audited

accounts of these three bus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



companies  - I have asked for monthly figures,  and

on  the  face of those figures, I believe they  are

making  a  profit. I suppose only  the  Income  Tax

Department  can tell us the truth. And  I  have  no

recourse to those documents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, criticisms have been levelled and 1

think  it  is only fair that I should endeavour  to

give an explanation as best I can. Let me say again

that we are not smug or satisfied with what we have

achieved. We think there is still a long way to  go

and  much  has to be done. But there are priorities

and  I do plead for some patience. Let me say  that

over  the last year, two of the three bus companies

were  owing  Government taxes, one as  much  as  $1

million, and the other $1/2 million. And it is only

after talking to them and pleading with them,  that

their  accounts had been brought up to-date.  So  I

must  say  that we are keeping a very close  watch,

and I think the hon. Member for Boon Teck knows the

position  best. He has been able to get all  10,000

bus  workers to join his union, SILO,  and  it  was

only  in  December 1972 that all bus  workers  came

under  one  union for the first time and they  were

able  to  get  a  fair  deal  from  the  three  bus

companies.  Here  again,  first  things  must  come

first. The 10,000 bus workers should feel that they

are  getting  a good deal as a result  of  the  bus

services reorganisation. They never had a chance in

the past. You must have a group of happy, satisfied

workers,  before  you can have a  good  public  bus

system.  So I must allow for these things  to  move

step by step. I think, this year, we should be able

to  see  more new buses on the roads, and  all  the

broken-down buses, known as low ya chia,  will  not

be found on our streets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now come to the various criticisms

levelled  against them. The Members  who  spoke  of

their dissatisfaction with the bus services are the

Members  for  Sembawang, Toa Payoh, Kim  Keat,  and

Potong Pasir. I think the Member for Kim Seng  very

gallantly supported the need to be a bit fair,  and

I am very grateful to him for that. But we have got

to take other things into consideration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



The  hon.  Member for  Jalan  Kayu  is  very

unhappy  that  old  buses are  made  to  serve  the

countryside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards time schedules for buses and commuters

having to wait a very long time before they can get

on  to a bus, there are many factors. Congestion of

the  roads can bring this about. I am sure everyone

in Singapore knows that traffic today has increased

considerably, and with congestion time schedules of

buses  are naturally upset. Sometimes we see three,

four, five or even six buses all "bunching up".  Of

course,  it would be simple to say that bus drivers

somehow  or other make it a habit to come together,

as  if  coming for a meeting! It is not true.  When

there  is congestion, all time schedules are  upset

and so at a certain point of time all the buses are

there.  So  I do not think we should say  that  bus

drivers  are unco-operative, and that they  do  not

seem  to care for passengers. Sometimes people seem

to  pay too much attention to letters in the press.

But  we do know that some of those letters are  not

genuine. This can happen. We do not deny that  such

a state of affairs can exist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, congestion is a problem. We hope we can

tackle this in a number of ways. One way will be  a

long-term solution, which is the possibility  of  a

mass  rapid transit system. That is a subject under

study,  as  mentioned by the hon.  Member  for  Kim

Keat.  But it will take time for a decision  to  be

taken.  It is for the long-term. Even if we make  a

decision  today, it will perhaps be five, eight  or

10  years before we can see the mass rapid  transit

system  operating  in Singapore.  However,  we  are

asking  the bus companies to introduce express  bus

services  for commuters from large housing  estates

to  their work areas. This is not something new. It

has been done in the past by the STC in city areas.

The  bus  companies  have agreed  to  consider  the

matter, and I think they would themselves be  quite

happy to bring this about. But here again we should

give them time to work things out before putting it

really into effect.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of accident rates, there are so

many factors. If the roads are congested, then  the

chances of accidents occurring are greater.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards recklessness, it is not a question of

bus  drivers only but drivers of all types of motor

vehicles.  We do have an Enforcement Section  which

attends  to  complaints of  this  nature,  and  bus

commuters themselves can help to stop the dangerous

practice  of  buses  pulling off before  passengers

have  boarded or alighted by giving the particulars

of  the incident when reporting to the Registrar of

Vehicles. It is not enough to say: `I saw this  bus

do this and that'. Please let us have more details,

such  as  the number of the bus concerned, and  the

time and date, so that we will be able to follow up

on those reports. Where a complaint is proved to be

genuine, then the bus driver or conductor  will  be

pulled up. But to make general statements will  not

be  of  much  help. The ROV Inspection Centre  also

conducts field inspections, and they will follow up

cases when we have more evidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the question of over-aged buses, ever

since  we  reorganised the bus  services  in  April

1971,  less  than  two years  ago,  the  three  bus

companies  have replaced about 290 buses  of  their

own.  As  for the bus fleet itself, this  has  been

increased  from  1,339 in April 1970,  three  years

ago,  to  2,103 buses as at the end of last January

1973, i.e, an increase of 764 buses. Now if we  add

up  these two figures, 290 plus 764, there has been

an  increase of 1,054 new buses on the roads within

the last few years. And what is the total bus fleet

in Singapore today? 2,000. One-half of the fleet is

new,  over the last two or three years. And  if  we

work  on the basis that each bus costs $40,000,  we

can arrive at what is the capital sum that has been

invested  on these 1,000 buses. It is $40  million.

We  do not just produce $40 million from thin  air.

It has got to come from somewhere. So we should not

push  it  too  hard. The companies themselves  know

that an old bus, or a bus that is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



broken down, means less revenue for them. They will

of  their own accord replace old buses as  fast  as

they can, even without intervention on our part.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the lack of so-called courtesy on the

part  of drivers and conductors. Here, I think  the

Member  for Boon Teck can tell us how hard  he  has

worked.  The first courtesy campaign was  organised

between  the bus companies and bus workers.  I  had

the  privilege  of  being present  at  the  opening

ceremony.  This was done for the first time.  There

never  was  an occasion before where employers  and

workers    combined    their   efforts    together.

Unfortunately,  of  course, the companies  did  say

that  it  cost a bit too much, for the results.  So

they are a bit shy about repeating it. I mean,  let

us  be  fair.  People are not going to spend  money

only  to  find that the results are not  worth  the

money  spent. So it does not mean that  nothing  is

being  done.  We want to see more new buses  rather

than  all  the ramshackle buses serving  the  rural

areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards cleanliness and smoky exhausts, as

brought up by the Member for Potong Pasir,  I  must

say  that this has been done. On air pollution, may

I  just  say  that  air pollution  is  a  very  big

subject.  There is such a thing as pollution  which

you  do  not  see but which constitutes  a  greater

danger. For example, pollution from petrol engines.

The  pollution that you see is a lesser evil. Smoky

exhaust, which is visible pollution, is really  the

lesser  evil. We have attempted to tackle only  the

lesser  evil.  I  do  not say  that  we  have  been

completely successful, but I think there is less of

smoky  exhaust in Singapore today. As  regards  the

greater evil of pollution by petrol driven  cars  - we  do  not  manufacture those cars, but  they  are

manufactured in the United States of  America  -  I

think  President Nixon has asked that by 1975  cars

with  a  minimum amount of pollution will  only  be

allowed  on the roads. That is something that  will

stretch not only our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



finances but also our imagination. I hope  that  if

we have succeeded in reducing visible pollution, we

would  have already gone some way towards our fight

for a cleaner atmosphere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards clean buses, it is expected of them.

But  as  one  Member himself has already indicated,

perhaps  we should try to persuade the Chairman  of

the PUB to allow more water to be used for cleaning

of  buses. So you can see the difficulties we  have

to face.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have covered most of the grouses in

respect of the bus services, and may I then move on

to  the  Singapore Telephone Board and the Overseas

Telecoms  Service,  which is  being  handled  by  a

separate  authority,  at  present  known   as   the

Telecommunications Authority of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I first deal with the Singapore Telephone

Board. The Members for Sembawang, Jurong and  Bukit

Panjang  have  complained about the  difficulty  of

getting through a telephone call. First of all,  it

is  the  rapid  development of  our  own  telephone

services.  Normal developments in  other  countries

would  be  perhaps 5 per cent per  annum.  Ours  is

easily  15,  20 or even 30 per cent per  annum.  At

this  rate of development, it is very difficult  to

catch  up with the provision of services of a  high

standard.  There  is  generally  a  breakdown.   Of

course, we do not wish for this to happen,  but  we

are  doing our best. May I say that in this respect

we  were  let  down by a firm of manufacturers  for

telephone equipment. I will name it. It is the L.M.

Ericsson  of  Sweden. As a result of a contract  to

provide  equipment, we entered into a joint venture

to manufacture telephone equipment in Singapore, to

be  known  as the Telephone Industries of Singapore

Pte.  Ltd.  At the end of 1971, just  when  it  was

supposed to start manufacturing, this company  L.M.

Ericsson,  decided not to go on with  the  project.

That  upset  our  plans and also  the  delivery  of

equipment  all  the way from Sweden.  This  problem

went  on for quite some time, and you may have read

in the newspapers very recently that we have signed

a contract



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



with  a  well-known firm of manufacturers in Japan,

known   as  Fujitsu,  for  the  supply  of  100,000

telephones.  So  if we do have some  unsatisfactory

service in certain exchanges, it is partly  due  to

this  unfortunate  decision on  the  part  of  L.M.

Ericsson  not  to proceed with the  joint  venture,

which  resulted  in  withholding  the  delivery  of

equipment, etc, by them. So we were in a bit  of  a

jam,   but  that  has  been  put  right  now.  Past

contracts for delivery are now in the pipeline  and

we have also changed our contractors. In due course

it  should  be  possible to improve  our  telephone

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong mentioned the fact that our

overseas telephone services are also very bad.  Our

overseas telephone services have been increasing at

the average rate of 30 per cent per annum. Over the

last  six years, the development rate has been much

too great for the personnel concerned, and there is

a  limit  to  human endeavour to meet with  such  a

terrific   rate   of  increase.  As   stated,   the

difficulty  in meeting this growth was due  to  the

equipment  manufacturer not meeting  the  Singapore

Telephone  Board orders placed before 1971.  A  new

order  has since been placed with another supplier,

and a new exchange equipment is now being installed

and  will  be operational in August this  year,  in

other words, five months from now. This will double

the  capacity of the existing exchange  in  Jurong,

and congestion should then be eliminated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Member for Jurong also mentioned the

case  of  a telephone operator having forgotten  to

put through a call. I would say, please let us have

the name, the time and date when this happened,  so

that whichever operator was then in charge could be

pulled  up.  I  would appreciate it if  the  Member

could supply me the particulars. We will deal  with

the case only if we have the full facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Jurong proper, it is true, as he has

said,  that there are 400 factories in Jurong.  The

peak  period  is  between 10 and  12  o'clock  when

everybody wants to talk to everybody; I do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



not  know  why. There was acute congestion  in  the

Jurong  Exchange during the third quarter  of  last

year,  but  I understand that this has been  eased.

The  Singapore Telephone Board has replaced the old

2,000-line equipment with new equipment to increase

the traffic handling capacity of this exchange.  In

December  1972,  1,000 lines  were  added,  and  in

February  1973  another  1,000  lines  were  added.

Additional  juncture circuits  between  Jurong  and

other  exchange areas were also installed  to  ease

the  congestion. To cater for traffic growth, there

will  be  another 3,000 lines to be  installed  and

they should be operational by the third quarter  of

this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have given adequate answers to all the

points  raised  by the 10 Members in  the  opposite

Bench.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I be

permitted to ask whether the Minister can elaborate

on  the  failure  of  the Telephone  Industries  of

Singapore?  Has  it involved us  in  any  financial

loss?  If so, what is the amount, and whether there

are  any legal means by which we can hold the other

party responsible for our loss?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I can only say that the

matter  is under liquidation at the moment.  Up  to

this  moment of time, the Singapore Telephone Board

is involved to the tune of $1 million. But how much

of it is recoverable has yet to be ascertained. But

whatever it is, may I say this: even if we suffer a

million dollar-loss, by changing the contractor  we

have saved many millions of dollars on equipment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Minister has replied to the  queries  in

great   detail.   I  agree  with   him   that   the

reorganisation of the public bus services is a very

great  task  indeed. The Ministry of Communications

has  done  its  part,  and the  Minister  has  also

admitted that the reorganisation is still going on.

It  is  not yet completed. I hope that his Ministry

will   put   in   more  effort  to   complete   the

reorganisation of the bus services in the shortest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



possible  time. If he can undertake to do  that,  I

will withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the names of

Messrs J. F. Conceicao and Ng Kah Ting:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 11.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Conceicao is not here. Mr Ng Kah

Ting.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0701 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 11.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this subhead covers the Mass Transit

Planning Unit. According to the Memorandum  on  the

Main   and  Development  Estimates,  this  sum   is

"provided  for  the completion of  the  feasibility

study on the proposed Mass Transit System". In  the

past I have raised in this House this matter of the

feasibility  of  the proposed Mass Transit  System.

But up to this date, Sir, we have still "forgotten"

to  apportion  another half a  million  dollars  to

finalise the completion of this feasibility  study.

Just now in his reply to an earlier amendment,  the

Minister  mentioned  hopefully  that  it  would  be

another  five to 10 years before such a system  can

be  introduced in Singapore. Upon the completion of

such  a  feasibility  study being  in  hand,  I  am

wondering whether it will take yet another five  to

10  years before we can actually get the System off

the  ground. We know that a lot of money  has  been

spent  on  this  feasibility  study,  and  also  by

getting   the  assistance  of  the  United  Nations

Development Programme. I would like to seek further

elucidation from the Minister for Communications as

to  when  will the feasibility study be  completed,

and  whether a decision would have to be  taken  to

put the Mass Transit System into being. If so, when

will we come to that stage?



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I begin by

answering  the  Member for Punggol that  the  total

cost of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



project,  the  Mass Transit Study, is approximately

$3.5 million, of which Singapore's contribution  in

cash and in kind is approximately $1.1 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that this Mass Transit Study is being

carried  on in two consecutive phases. Phase  I  is

concerned  essentially with the  economic  aspects,

and  includes the examination of existing transport

demands and services, forecasts of requirements for

transport  facilities, and the systematic  analyses

and    comparisons    of   alternative    transport

investments and policies. Phase II will deal mainly

with the engineering aspects and will consist of  a

detailed  feasibility  study  of  those  investment

projects   for   which   engineering   design    or

construction  is  programmed to start  before  1977

within the Mass Transit System recommended.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The studies are being undertaken with the

assistance   of  the  United  Nations   Development

Programme  (UNDP) and the World Bank  as  executive

agency. The Mass Transit Study Office was set up in

mid-June  1972  with  staff from  the  Ministry  of

Communications  and  officers  seconded  from   the

Public  Works  Department, the Planning  Department

and the Housing and Development Board. For Phase  I

of the study, the World Bank has appointed the firm

of   Wilbur   Smith  and  Associates   to   provide

professional   services.   The   consultants   were

mobilised  in  Singapore  in  July  last  year.   A

Steering  Committee has been established to  review

policy matters that might require decisions in  the

course of their study. The Committee is chaired  by

the     Permanent    Secretary,     Ministry     of

Communications,  and includes representatives  from

the  Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of  National

Development,  and  the  World  Bank.  The  area  of

studies  covers  the whole island of  Singapore.  A

minimum   of  four  alternative  public   transport

systems  would be formulated and tested. The  study

will  also  estimate the comparative  magnitude  of

investment,  because  it  runs  into  hundreds   of

millions of dollars and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



operating  costs  of the various alternatives.  The

relationship between travel demand and travel cost,

and  the  effect of pricing policies, may  also  be

examined. The alternative Mass Transit Systems  are

to  be compared and evaluated on the basis of cost,

service characterisation, the economic benefits and

environmental  and social implications  leading  to

the   recommendation  of  a  system  for   detailed

feasibility  studies in Phase II. Phase  I  of  the

Study  is  scheduled for completion by the  end  of

June  this  year. In April, that is  to  say,  next

month,   the   consultants   will   present   their

preliminary  findings  and  recommendations  on   a

preferred Mass Transit System and subsequently  the

final  report.  When this report is  available,  of

course,  it would go up to Cabinet for a  decision.

It  is  only when Cabinet decides that there should

be a Mass Transit System that we will get the money

to get on with the job. I am afraid I might perhaps

be  somewhat optimistic when I say that in five  or

eight  years'  time  we shall  be  getting  a  Mass

Transit System. That is my wish.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I am just wondering whether

it  is  wise  to spend money to the  tune  of  $1.1

million, as the Minister has pointed out,  just  on

the  study  of  a  project, and  then  to  consider

whether  the ultimate project, running into several

hundreds of millions of dollars, will be worthwhile

to  implement. I believe, as the Minister has said,

that when the preliminary findings of the Committee

are put up, then only will they be decided upon  by

the  Cabinet. However, I will cut short my  remarks

now  and reserve my other observation until a later

stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, may I beg leave to withdraw my

amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,054,830 for Head 0701 ordered to

stand part of the Main Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $500,000 for Head 0701 ordered to

stand part of the Development Estimates.







<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0703 --



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 he

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

(* The  same amendment also stood in the name of  Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to raise two questions under

this  amendment. First, it is the  matter  of  taxi

services at the Paya Lebar Airport. Secondly, it is

the  slowness  of  the  terminal  services  at  the

Airport. Mr Speaker, Sir, Paya Lebar Airport is one

of  the  busiest, if not the busiest,  airports  in

Southeast  Asia.  Everyday many  tourists  come  to

Singapore   through  the  Singapore   International

Airport.



<br><br>6.22 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, more taxis should be made available at

the  Airport for the convenience of tourists.  Sir,

at  present  there  are about 200  taxis  operating

between   the   City  and  the  Airport   for   the

convenience  of  tourists and others.  So  far  the

services  rendered  by these 200  taxis  are  quite

satisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I would like to mention that I have

received   a  complaint  from  the  Taxi   Drivers'

Association.   The  Association  applied   to   the

Director  of Civil Aviation for an office space  at

the  Airport  so  that  better  services  could  be

provided   for   the   tourists.   However,    this

application   was  turned  down  by   the   Airport

management.  There  is,  however,  an  office   for

operators  of  SZ vehicles which are  for  hire  to

tourists.  Since  both the SZ cars  and  taxis  are

meant  for the convenience of tourists, how  is  it

that  operators of SZ cars for hire have been given

an  office space whilst operators of taxis have not

been  given any office space? In fact, I would  say

that  the  taxi  drivers provide a  more  important

service  to the tourists. I wonder why the officer-in-charge  of  the Singapore International  Airport

did   not  approve  the  application  of  the  Taxi

Drivers' Association. If the operators of taxis are

given  some  office  space, then  there  is   some

fairness. In fact, there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



should  be no discrimination between the two  types

of  operators. I hope the Minister will  look  into

this   matter   and  ensure  that   there   is   no

discrimination.  There should be  fair  competition

between  the  taxis and SZ cars for hire.  We  must

allow  both services to operate on an equal footing

for a fair competition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point concerns the handling of luggage

at  the  Airport. Sir, recently I have  received  a

number  of complaints from tourists. Some  of  them

are  my  friends.  They have  complained  that  the

handling  of  luggage  at  the  Airport  is   still

inefficient  and slow. Passengers arriving  at  the

Airport  have to wait for half an hour before  they

can  collect their luggage. The Minister  has  said

that  that is not the case. Perhaps he should  send

special  investigators  there  to  look  into   the

matter. If the handling of luggage is too slow,  it

will affect tourism in Singapore. The tourists will

get a bad impression of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I am sorry to hear from

the  Member  for Sembawang that the representatives

from the 200 taxis have applied to the Director  of

Civil  Aviation for an office space  and  that  the

application  has been turned down. I am  not  aware

either of the application or its rejection. If  the

SZ car operators have an office there, I cannot see

any  good reason why taxi operators should not also

be  provided with an office. I shall therefore  ask

for this matter to be reviewed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second question about the delay in the

handling of baggage, there seems to be all sorts of

complaints. However, they have not been directed to

my  office.  Whatever it is, I  think  it  is  fair

comment.  May I say that there will be a change  in

the management of the baggage handling services  at

the Airport. At the moment, the Department of Civil

Aviation  is handling the baggage for six airlines.

But  a  subsidiary of the Singapore Airlines, known

as  the Singapore Airport Terminal Services (SATS),

will  take  over the services from 1st April,  next

month.  With  this  takeover,  there  will  be  one

handling authority,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



and  it  should therefore provide a more  efficient

service.  Perhaps next year we would  not  have  to

listen to this complaint again in this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr P. Govindaswamy is not here. Mr

Teong Eng Siong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am glad

to  get a very reasonable answer from the Minister.

I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

P. Govindaswamy:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1431.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence of Mr P. Govindaswamy, the

amendment was not proceeded with.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 22*.

(*The  same amendment also stood in the name of  Mr Ong Teng Cheong.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is an allocation for the extension to

the  Airport  runway  from 3,350  metres  to  4,020

metres, and it amounts to $4.5 million. This is  an

indication of further improvement to our Airport. I

would  like  to  raise  one  question  under   this

amendment.  When  will work  on  the  extension  be

commenced, and when will it be completed?



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, I am going to talk about

invisible  pollution. The chief medical adviser  of

the  Industrial  Health Unit  in  the  Ministry  of

Labour has very recently stressed the importance of

controlling noise in the Republic. He claimed  that

noise  levels  up  to  90  decibels  is  considered

dangerous,  as exposure over a number of  years  to

such   levels  will  give  rise  to  a  number   of

undesirable effects and consequences. Sir, many  of

the  residents  in urban areas, especially  in  the

Geylang and Katong districts, are already suffering

from aircraft noise of 80 to 100 decibels. Whenever

a  plane flies over, one would have to give up  his

television viewing, telephone conversation,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



or suspend his class temporarily.  I  am

sure  we  do not want to allow these conditions  to

deteriorate  any  further. In  this  connection,  I

wonder if the Minister for Communications would  be

prepared  to categorically rule out the possibility

of  extending  the existing airport runway  further

southwards in the future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I do not know whether the

Member  is  aware  that if the existing  runway  is

extended  southwards, the noise pollution would  be

even  greater for a larger number of people in  the

Katong  area. But whatever it is, whether we extend

it  southwards or northwards, I am afraid that  the

people of Singapore will have to contend with noise

pollution so long as Singapore remains an  aviation

centre.  After all, we are a small island  of  just

224 square miles. I am afraid that this is part and

parcel of our life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only remedy perhaps would be for the

manufacturers  to  begin  developing   aeronautical

engines with lower decibels. I think this is  being

done.  For  example, the Rolls Royce  engine  which

powers  the Lockheed Tri-Star is supposed to  be  a

very  quiet engine for its size. I believe all  the

manufacturers of aeronautical engines  are  working

towards that end. For example, people thought  that

when the Boeing 747 Jumbo arrives in Singapore, the

noise of the engines would be too difficult to bear

with. In reality, it turned out to be no worse than

the  Boeing 707. So we hope that, in due course  of

time, engineers will be able to reduce the decibels

of aircraft engines, so that people living close to

airports will be less bothered by noise. That is as

far  as  I can go. Today I do not think I am  in  a

position  to  move the airport from Paya  Lebar  to

some  off-shore  island. I do  not  think  we  have

enough space to move around. At the most, we  might

have to move to Changi. Then, of course, the Member

for  Changi  will stand up and say,  "Why  come  to

Changi?  Why  not go to Sembawang?",  or  something

like that. This is a problem which can be resolved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>



in  course of time. We are trying to build a rugged

Singapore. We all have strong eardrums to withstand

all  this noise, and hope for the best in the years

to come!



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the

Minister has not answered my query. Perhaps he  was

not paying attention when I spoke on the amendment.

All  I want to know is when will the extension work

begin, and when will it be completed. It is a  very

simple question, and I have not got an answer yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, work has

already  commenced,  and it will  be  completed  in

1974.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg

leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

Ng Kah Ting -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 he

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 23.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (4), Mr Ng Kah Ting.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I am not moving amendment

(4). I am moving amendment (5). Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 31.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment. I merely wish to

suggest to the Minister for Communications to  look

into  the possibility of air-conditioning that part

of the terminal building where passengers check in.

One  half  of  the building is at the  moment  air-conditioned, but the other half is not.  There  are

many passengers checking in and they find the place

a  bit  small. During the hot days, when  one  gets

into the terminal building, he will notice that one

part  of it is air-conditioned while the other part

is not. In this respect, I am wondering whether the

Minister would look into my suggestion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I think it is a very good

suggestion,  and  I  will do my  best  to  get  the

Ministry  of  Finance to agree to extend  the  air-conditioning  to the warmer half of  the  passenger

terminal building.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, the position is that there

is   a  sum  of  $380,000  to  be  voted  for   the

redevelopment of the passenger terminal building. I

wonder whether part of this sum could be set  aside

to  air-condition the warmer part of the  building.

It  is  not a question of either asking more  money

from  the Finance Ministry, or the Minister to say,

"Right,  this is what I will do, and  I  intend  to

take  it  up." If that is the case, then I will  be

too happy to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I am afraid the Member for

Punggol  does  not  know how Government  Ministries

work.  It  is not that the Minister can  just  say,

"Yes,  you  can  have  the air-conditioning."  Good

Lord!  I wish I can do that. It would have been  so

much  simpler. My officials will have  to  go  into

this   with   the   Development  Planning   Control

Committee. All that we can do is to make proposals,

and  the  Finance officials will then sit down  and

generally prune every request.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sum of money asked for has already been

allotted  for  the extension to the departure  hall

and  the  ticketing wing, at an estimated  cost  of

$8 1/2  million,  and  the  procurement  of   three

additional conveyor belts at an estimated  cost  of

$270,000.  Work on the extension to  the  departure

hall  has begun, and even approval for the cost  of

the   conveyor  belts  amounting  to  $270,000   is

awaited.  So I am afraid that all I can  do,  as  I

said   just   now,  is  to  make  a   very   strong

recommendation   to   the  Finance   officials   to

reconsider  the  matter  of  air-conditioning   the

warmer half of the terminal building.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, whilst I appreciate the

difficulty  of  the Minister for Communications  in

trying to solicit funds to air-condition that  part

of the passenger terminal building, however, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



would  strongly urge him to put up this  suggestion

so   that   the  entire  building  would  be   air-conditioned. It is ridiculous to have  a  situation

where  three-fourths, or even  four-fifths  of  the

entire  ground floor of the terminal building  air-conditioned,  except for that small remaining  part

of the floor not air-conditioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may just stretch the argument, the Minister

pointed  out  that  approval for the  provision  of

$270,000 for the additional conveyor belts for  the

terminal  building  is  still  awaited.  If  I  may

recall,   this   was   a   matter   which   several

Backbenchers  had in the past been suggesting  that

the  baggage  clearing facilities through  the  two

existing    conveyor   belts   were   very,    very

unsatisfactory. It was because of this, I  believe,

that   provision  has  been  made  for   additional

conveyor belts. So if the Minister would take up my

suggestion  -  bearing in mind  the  difficulty  of

getting  funds from the Ministry of  Finance  -  he

would   put  up  a  strong  recommendation  on   my

proposal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect, there was mention in this House

earlier  in  the  day that fantastic  increases  in

salaries  have been given to two per  cent  of  the

civil servants in the senior grades. If we view  it

from that angle, I do not think the cost of the air-conditioning would be too great to bear.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I have already said that I

will  follow up on the Member's suggestion. I would

like to thank him for it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, in that case, I beg leave to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 32.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision for the New Air Freight

Terminal is $1 million, which is a considerable sum

of  money. I would like to ask the Minister whether

this project has commenced and, if so, when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



is the completion date? On completion, what sort of

services will this Terminal provide?



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, our Ministry has appointed

a   firm   of  consultants,  the  Northrop  Airport

Development  Corporation, to advise the  Government

on  the need for a new air freight terminal. It  is

the  view  of the consultants that such a  terminal

would  be  required by early 1975. In that  year  a

total  of  65,000 metric tons of cargo are expected

to  pass through our airport. Plans are now in hand

to complete the air freight terminal by this target

date.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In view of the

Minister's  reply,  I  beg  leave  to  withdraw  my

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0703 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 34.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the provision here is $2 million for the

construction  of  a  new sub-terminal  building.  I

would   like   to  ask  the  Minister   when   will

construction   of   this  building   commence.   On

completion,  what sort of better services  will  be

provided?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, the number of passenger

movements in Paya Lebar Airport for last  year  was

2.5  million.  The  airport  consultants,  which  I

mentioned earlier, have estimated that this  number

will  increase to over 3 million by this year,  4.6

million by 1975, and so on. It is felt that  a  new

passenger  terminal building will  be  required  by

1976 at the latest. To keep to this target date,  a

preliminary  building  plan  of  this  terminal  is

presently   being   drawn   up   by   the   airport

consultants.  The capital cost of  the  project  is

estimated  at  $31  million, of which  the  foreign

component  cost of $24 million will be financed  by

the Asian Development Bank.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0704 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sometime ago there was mention about the

transfer  of  the  meteorological  facilities  from

Fullerton  Building to the Airport.  Why  was  this

done? How much progress has been made so far? As  a

result  of this transfer, will our weather forecast

readings  in  the  city area  be  affected  to  any

extent?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, the Meteorological

Department  always  has  certain  offices  at   the

Airport, because one of its functions is to provide

weather  information  for the  safe  and  efficient

operation  of aircraft within the Singapore  flight

information  region,  which is  about  one  million

square  miles of space. What the Member  for  Anson

meant  perhaps was the administrative headquarters,

which is being moved.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> What I meant is the forecast.

Will  the weather forecast be correct by a transfer

from the City to the Airport? Fullerton Building is

so high, and the building at the airport is so low.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I do not think the matter

of   height  of  a  building  counts.  After   all,

Fullerton  Building  is not very  high.  There  are

towers at the Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I assure the Member for Anson that the

Meteorological  Department  has  offices   in   the

Airport itself to provide weather information. Even

if the administrative headquarters of the Meteorological



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



Department at Fullerton Building is  moved

elsewhere,  it  will not in any way interfere  with

the  accuracy of the readings. So everything should

be all right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I think the Member for Anson is concerned

about  is the safety of aircraft and ships.  May  I

assure him that even if the headquarters has to  he

moved   out  from  Fullerton  Building  to  another

building,  the  functions of the Department  should

all be in order. In fact, at almost every quarterly

meeting  with my heads of departments, I  hear  the

director say that he is about to he moved from A to

B, or B to C, or C to D. Life goes on.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw

my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0705 be

(*The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs P. Govindaswamy and Ng Kah Ting.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I first congratulate the Minister for in

the  past  year the Postal Services Department  has

shown a tremendous improvement in efficiency.  This

is  because I have raised many criticisms last year

in  the  House.  Only when there is  criticism  can

there  be  progress and improvement. The number  of

letters  handled by the Postal Services  Department

comes  to  millions. The Postal Services Department

is  efficient  and letters for local  delivery  are

received  on the same day. Very seldom do  we  find

letters   misplaced.  This  is  a  sign  that   the

efficiency is pretty high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to put forward a suggestion for the

consideration  of  the Minister.  Can  he  consider

setting  up a small post office in Kampung  Tengah,

15 m.s., Sembawang? There are about 10,000



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



people  living in the four kampungs in  that  area.

The  only  place  they can go to now  is  the  post

office  at the third milestone, which is about  two

miles  away from the kampungs. So if the  residents

can  go  to  this suggested post office in  Kampung

Tengah,  which will be nearer their homes, it  will

be so much more convenient for them. I am sure that

the  expenses involved in building the post  office

will  not  be very much. We need perhaps one  clerk

and one jaga.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I read in the newspapers

that the Postal Department has been reorganised  to

suit present day requirements, and it is heartening

to see that much has been done for the better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, more spectacular progress can be

realised  if  new  blood  is  injected  into   this

important   department.  I  understand   that   top

officers,   who  are  in  Division  I,  cannot   be

transferred to other departments of the  Government

service  because this has been the  practice  since

colonial  days. If this is true, then  if  officers

are  allowed to be there too long they will  become

stale  and  cannot foresee any way to  improve  the

service. The Postal Service is a great asset to the

Communications Ministry, and I recommend  that  the

Postal  Service  be  given a  change  of  life.  If

Division  1 officers are interchangeable  from  one

Ministry  to another, I am sure greater improvement

in postal services will surely result and the needs

of the public enhanced by this recommendation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's population is growing. It is

therefore  true that if the postal  service  is  to

keep pace with the growth, more pillar boxes should

be  introduced.  This is not going  to  be  a  very

costly   item,  nor  is  it  going   to   be   very

inconvenient  to  the postmen. Further,  the  metal

plates  showing the collection times of many pillar

boxes have either faded or been tampered with.  Yet

no  action has been taken about it. Could something

be done to remedy this situation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more point I would like to raise, Sir, is the

working environment of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>



Sorting  section at Nelson Road. It  needs  further

improvement.   The   ventilation   is   still   not

sufficient. The dust and heat there is a hazard  to

the workers.



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, I rise to make merely a

small  suggestion.  I notice  that  in  the  Postal

Services  Department  a small  unit  known  as  the

Philatelic Bureau has been set up. This  Bureau  is

mainly concerned with the sale of first-day covers.

When  the  Minister  of  State  for  Communications

opened one of the stamp exhibitions, I remember  he

made a point with regard to encouraging more people

to  acquire the habit of stamp collecting. I think,

Sir, this is very good encouragement, and it is  in

this  respect that I would like to see  this  small

Bureau expand its activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there are several stamp collecting

groups  or clubs in some schools. I would  like  to

know  whether  this Bureau can give assistance  and

guidance   to   schools  with   regard   to   stamp

collecting.  Stamp  collecting,  Sir,  is  a   very

interesting hobby because through the collection of

stamps  school children will be able to  know  more

about  the countries from which they have collected

stamps.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this respect, may I ask the Minister for

Communications  whether he will consider  expanding

the  Philatelic  Bureau with a  view  to  assisting

schools to set up stamp collecting groups?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, may I first reply to the

hon. Member for Sembawang in respect of his request

for a sub-post office for Kampung Tengah? If, as he

says,  there  is  a population of  10,000  in  this

kampung,  I am sure the Postmaster-General  can  be

asked to review this matter as to whether or not it

would  be economical to provide such a service.  We

try  to improve our postal services as best we  can

with the funds that are made available to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the hon. Member for Anson on the

question  of the interchangeability of  Division  I

staff  in  the Postal Services, I think this  is  a

very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>



good  idea,  except for the fact  that  this  is  a

matter  for  the  Treasury (Establishment)  in  the

Ministry  of Finance. I understand that Division  I

posts  in  the  Postal  Department  are  graded  as

departmental  posts. This means  that  they  are  a

closed  Service. In other words those officers  who

are appointed to these posts stay within the Postal

Department.  But  it  may be  desirable  for  these

officers to be posted out and for new blood to come

in,   and  I  will  therefore  certainly  put   his

suggestion   to   the  Ministry  of   Finance   for

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the tampering of mail, I am afraid this is

part and parcel of society.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I did not refer to

tampering  of  mail. I mentioned  about  the  metal

plate  on pillar boxes showing the collection times

of mail, not tampering of letters. There is a metal

plate  on  the  pillar box showing  the  collection

times, and this has faded.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I hope I have now got the hon.

Member  right. Per, haps the metal plates  on  post

boxes showing the times for the collection of  mail

have  been  defaced so much so that people  do  not

actually  know what the collection times are.  Sir,

what is really needed is only a new coat of paint.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It shall be done. Lastly, as

regards  working  conditions at  Nelson  Road,  the

former  PSA  warehouse, I am  glad  that  the  hon.

Member  is  in the position to say that  conditions

have improved, but could still be improved further.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> If possible, air-condition

the place.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> That is asking a lot. I am all

in  favour,  Sir, if only the Minister for  Finance

will provide the money. Whatever it is, as a result

of  discussions with the AUPE in June last year,  a

study was made with the PSA



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



and the Industrial Health Unit on ways and means to

further improve working conditions at Nelson  Road.

As a result, 39 additional wall and stand fans were

provided in August last year to supplement  the  14

extractor  fans and three blower fans. In addition,

two improvement projects at a total cost of $59,000

were  recently approved by the Ministry of Finance.

The  projects  provide  for  the  installation   of

special  heat insulation material and  fibre  glass

sound  insulation material for the roof  to  reduce

heat, and for the installation of additional blower

fans  and silencers to improve air circulation  and

to  reduce  noise. The roof insulation  project  is

expected to commence in the next few weeks, and the

other  project will be carried out as soon  as  the

equipment  has been purchased. All in  all,  it  is

considered  that working conditions at  the  Nelson

Road  centre are much better than those  prevailing

at  the  basement  of the General  Post  Office  in

Fullerton Building.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply to the hon. Member for Punggol regarding

the  Philatelic  Bureau which  was  established  to

encourage the sale of first-day covers, stamps  and

commemorative issues, I remember when  I  opened  a

stamp fair recently, it included a number of school

stamp  clubs.  So  we are already  getting  schools

interested to form stamp groups. The suggestion  of

the   hon.  Member  will  be  made  known  to   the

Philatelic Bureau so that they can spend more  time

with  our  school children to set up  school  stamp

clubs, and hence result in more stamp enthusiasts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Registry of Vehicles undeniably is a

very  busy  department because it takes  charge  of

nearly   470,000  motor  vehicles.   Its   function

involves  the  registration of motor vehicles,  the

collection  of  road taxes and the registration  or

transfer  of motor vehicles, inspection  of  taxis,

and  other  related work, in the  past,  when  this

Department  was under the Lim Yew Hock  Government,

it  was  one of the departments most criticised  by

the public because the supervision of work was in a

mess  at  that time. However, ever since our  Party

came to power we have tried our best to improve the

running of this department. It cannot be denied now

that  this  department is run more efficiently  and

output  has  been raised to a greater extent.  Also

there  is improvement all round. However, there  is

still room for further improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are two matters which I would like to

raise  with the Minister. I hope he will look  into

them.  Firstly,  there  are many  people  who  have

complained  that when they send their  vehicles  to

the   Registry  of  Vehicles  for  inspection,  the

inspection   has  been  too  strict.  Certain   new

vehicles after testing have been found to emit  too

much smoke. Even new vehicles cannot pass the test,

and  have to go through various tests again.  After

several days they still cannot be passed. I do  not

deny  that  at the moment we are carrying  out  the

anti-pollution campaign which involves paying close

attention  to  the possibility of doing  away  with

vehicles which emit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>



too  much smoke. But all cars will emit smoke to  a

certain  extent.  In  view  of  this,  I  hope  the

officers  in  charge will adopt a more  sympathetic

attitude when testing new cars, and not just  apply

the  regulations  in  a very  strict  manner,  thus

causing suffering on the part of the car owners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second matter relates to the inspection of

taxis   which  is  being  carried  out  even   more

strictly. Taxi drivers have to send their taxis for

inspection  at the ROV when certain  parts  of  the

taxis  are  found to have corroded or when  certain

parts  need replacement or repair. They cannot  get

through  the  test as the procedure  is  also  very

strict.  Hence they do not get approval. Therefore,

this  brings about great difficulties to  the  taxi

drivers  because  their income is reduced  as  they

have  to  send their taxis for inspection again.  I

hope   the   Minister  can  consider   their   case

sympathetically  and  apply a  certain  measure  of

flexibility  to  help  them  clear  the  inspection

tests.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi):</b> Sir, I would like to

draw the attention of the Minister to the number of

second-hand  motor  dealers whose  business  is  to

import second-hand trucks or lorry bodies. They re-condition   and   re-assemble   these   second-hand

vehicles  and  then re-export them to  neighbouring

countries  or sell them locally. Sir,  due  to  the

rapid  growth of our trade and industry  a  lot  of

these  re-conditioned vehicles  are  sold  locally.

Those  sold  locally must have a weight certificate

which  is  issued by only a few so-called qualified

big motor firms. The dealers must obtain the weight

certificates  first,  before  they  can  send   the

vehicles   to   the   Registry  of   Vehicles   for

registration.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these weight certificates are charged at $50

each  by  the  big  motor firms.  The  dealers  are

therefore  faced with a lot of difficulties.  Apart

from  having  to pay $50 for a weight  certificate,

what is worse, Sir, is that they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



have to pay a few hundred dollars "under the table"

to  the  person in charge for an early issue  of  a

weight  certificate. Sir, if it is not paid,  these

big motor firms may ask them to wait for days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand why the ROV has appointed

only a few big motor firms to carry out the process

of issuing weight certificates. The dealers told me

that they are prepared to pay the ROV about $200 to

$300   per   vehicle  if  the   issue   of   weight

certificates for registration could be  dealt  with

directly by the ROV. If this move is possible, then

I  think  the Government will receive more  revenue

from the ROV.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, although some Members

have  already spoken about cars and buses,  I  have

yet  to say something about them. The Minister will

probably only take note of my remarks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the daily traffic on our roads seems to be

increasing at an alarming rate. Is it possible  for

the  schools,  Government  offices  and  commercial

firms  to  co-operate with the  Traffic  Police  to

stagger their working hours effectively so that our

roads  do not become congested during peak periods?

Or is it possible to close certain key roads in the

city  area  to  private vehicles  during  the  peak

period?  This  will ease the flow  of  buses  which

transport  most  of the office workers  and  school

children. In the meantime private vehicles could be

diverted  to  some other routes which are  not  too

busy during that period. I suggest that a study  be

made on this proposal and to implement it if it  is

feasible. At the rate our office workers experience

the daily traffic jams at the moment they will soon

have  bad lungs by inhaling the 5.00 p.m. dose  of

carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. It is no wonder

that  our office workers do not seem to be  in  the

least rugged!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of box junctions is commendable.

But  I  wonder  how many persons  have  since  been

booked for ignoring the box junction rules. Some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



drivers  seem to think that the yellow box junction

is a chess board and they block traffic coming from

the other side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our buses have earned such a notoriety that

it will be recorded in the annals of Singapore. Not

only  do  the buses cough out poisonous  fumes  and

pollute  the air but they are the cause of  a  good

number  of accidents in Singapore. Surely something

can  he done to remedy this increasingly deplorable

situation. We see daily the familiar triangle  sign

on  the road indicating that a bus has broken down.

This  has  become so common that one  has  only  to

travel  along  any  bus route to  see  broken  down

buses.  Either  these buses are not being  properly

maintained   or   the  owners  are  straining   the

efficiency of the vehicles to their utmost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, inside the bus, it is not an uncommon

sight to see the Seats damaged, litter bins without

a  bottom,  and used tickets thrown  all  over  the

place.  And  although  a litter  Bin  is  provided,

cigarette  butts  can be seen  here  and  there.  I

wonder  whether we can introduce a complete ban  on

smoking in buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our bus drivers and conductors are

supposed  to have gone through a refresher  course,

but  of late instead of giving better service,  the

public  are  getting more and more  experiences  of

rudeness   by  bus  drivers  and  conductors.   The

numerous letters written to the press regarding the

behaviour   of  bus  drivers  and  conductors   are

testimony  to this fact. Some bus drivers  seem  to

think that bus bays or bus stops are only meant for

show  and not for use by them. It is not infrequent

to  see buses damaging road dividers and pedestrian

walks.  They will endanger the lives of road  users

if   no   remedial  action  is  taken  immediately.

Moreover, bus drivers often ignore commuters by not

stopping  or stopping far away from the  bus  stops

only  to let down passengers and will not pick  any

passengers at all. The passengers wait hopefully at

the  bus stops for the buses, but quite often their

wait has been in vain.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What positive action is being taken by the

Ministry   of   Communications   to   bring   about

discipline  in  our  public transport  system?  The

public  is  fed up and disgusted with the behaviour

of  some of our bus drivers and conductors. I would

call  upon the Minister to set up an urgent inquiry

into  the  matter to find out why the  drivers  and

conductors  are  deliberately  behaving   in   that

manner.  If necessary, it should recommend whatever

benefits  they deserve, such as more pay, in  order

that we may have a better transport service. It can

also  be  further  improved by the introduction  of

more new buses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the growing number of vehicles on our

roads  from year to year there is greater pollution

of  air  and  noise, and the fumes emitted  by  the

buses,  lorries,  motor cars and motor  cycles  are

offensive  and  poisonous to the people.  Will  the

Minister  seriously  consider  enacting   laws   to

eliminate such pollution? One suggestion  would  be

to enforce the compulsory installation of silencers

to  all  motor  vehicles and the  compulsory  half-yearly inspection and overhaul of old vehicles.  If

this suggestion is carried out, Singapore will be a

better  and  healthier place to live in.  Otherwise

our vehicles seem to he literally getting away with

blue murder.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the computerisation of vehicle records has

created  a  mess  at the Registry  of  Vehicles  in

Middle  Road.  Not only is there no  one  to  guide

members  of  the public as to where to  queue,  but

there  is  also a racket going on by those  in  the

queue. What measures have the Registrar of Vehicles

taken  to  remedy the situation? It seems that  the

offices on the ground floor of the Registry are not

well  sited.  All  this will project  an  image  of

inefficiency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, I think I should answer

the  Member  for Anson first. Most of  the  grouses

about  buses,  as  he himself has said,  have  been

answered  earlier on. I will therefore  attempt  to

answer the few new points that he has raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards air pollution, early last year we did

introduce restriction on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



new  petrol driven cars, that is, they should  have

special crankcase devices, like after-burns,  which

will  therefore reduce air pollution. This has been

introduced  for  new  cars. However,  we  have  got

hundreds  of  thousands of old cars,  and  it  will

therefore take time to replace them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the suggestion to reduce congestion

by  the introduction of staggered hours for schools

and  offices.  This was, in fact, proposed  in  the

White  Paper  on the Reorganisation  of  the  Motor

Transport Service for Singapore three years ago.  I

think  this can be quite upsetting as people  would

have  to change their present ways of life.  Nobody

seems to be interested in changing routine, but  we

hope  that  ultimately the schools and offices  may

think it desirable to introduce staggered hours for

the  staff and the school children. This  has  been

found   to  he  reasonably  effective  in   certain

countries. For example, in Germany the staff  could

walk  in  and clock the time they enter the office,

and  leave at any time they wish provided they make

up  the hours in other days. In fact, they can walk

in and out of the office as they like provided they

do  their lot. They have found that this system  is

very   effective  from  the  point   of   view   of

productivity.  But I think this is only  applicable

to  a  small number of progressive firms.  This  is

something   idealistic,  except,  of   course,   in

Communist  states. When I was in Leningrad,  I  was

told  that the factories did have staggered working

hours  and  workers could go to  the  factories  at

different  times,  at 7, 8, 9  or  10  o'clock.  Of

course,  in  Leningrad there are not  many  private

cars  on  the road, so that even without  staggered

hours there is very little traffic on the streets.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> On a point of explanation,

Sir,I  was  referring to heavy-duty  lorries  and

motor vehicles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Sir, heavy-duty lorries

carrying  heavy  cargo  should  be  restricted   to

certain hours? I think that is a good point which I

will  ask the Registrar of Vehicles to look into  -

the suggestion to restrict the movement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



of  lorries. There will be a yell. And perhaps,  as

adviser to the Singapore Lorry Owners' Association,

I  will soon get a petition from them through  you,

Sir?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other suggestion is the closing of certain

roads during peak hours. This may help. There is  a

committee  comprising  officials  from  the  Public

Works  Department,  the  Traffic  Police  and   the

Registry  of  Vehicles. Officials from these  three

departments have formed what is known as  the  Road

Improvement  Committee, and they are  looking  into

this  proposal. They have, in fact,  introduced  in

August last year a special bus lane for buses along

New  Bridge Road. It is that stretch of road  close

to Outram Road to the Havelock Road junction. It is

a very small stretch, perhaps 200 yards. But it has

been  considered a success, and it is  likely  that

more  such bus lanes will be introduced, Even in  a

one-way  street, where other vehicles will have  to

obey the one-way street sign, the buses are allowed

to  go  against the traffic stream,  to  cut  short

their  journey time and to avoid the  traffic  jam.

This  has  been proved successful in large  cities,

including  London.  It is, therefore,  likely  that

from   this   year  onwards,  we  shall   see   the

introduction of more special bus lanes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now move on to the question raised by the

Member  for  Changi? If I heard him  correctly,  he

said  that it cost second-hand dealers $50 each  to

get  what  is  known as a weight  certificate  from

certain motor firms, which have been authorised  by

the Registry of Vehicles, before they can either re-export  the  vehicles or re-sell them in Singapore.

He  has  questioned why the ROV has restricted  the

issue  of  such certificates to just  a  few  large

motor   firms.  It  is,  therefore,  more  like   a

monopoly. What I am interested in is the allegation

that several hundreds of dollars have changed hands

"under the table" to get things done. That, to  me,

is  a very serious allegation, and I would like the

Member for Changi to provide more evidence for  the

CPIB to look



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>



into.  I  do not think we can tolerate any  "under

the  table" gratification of, I presume,  officials

in the ROV.



<br><br>7.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Officials in the motor firms.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Even in the motor firms, I see

no  reason why this should be done. I would be most

happy  indeed if the Member for Changi can  provide

information  direct  to the CPIB  against  the  ROV

officials or even those in the motor firms.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, I am not complaining about

the ROV.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> I am very glad indeed that it

is  not the officials in the ROV. Otherwise I  will

be  a  very despondent Minister to know that  these

things are happening under my nose. I am glad  that

that  has been put right. But I was happy  to  hear

that second-hand dealers would be very happy to pay

$200 to $300 direct to the ROV for this service  so

that  there  would be additional  revenue  for  the

Ministry. I am pleased to tell the Member that I am

very  happy to accept his proposal, and I will  see

to it that our officials will provide this service,

and it may not cost as much as $200 or $300 each.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Instead of going through the

other channel.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Certainly, I would like to make

it  quite  clear  that  we will  not  tolerate  any

nonsense,  even in motor firms; if they think  they

can  get some illegal money just because we  insist

on certain things to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, as regards the Member for Sembawang's

request  not  to  be too stringent over  mechanical

inspections, especially if there is a  wee  bit  of

smoke,  it is very difficult to be lenient  because

the Member for Potong Pasir has asked, "What is the

Minister  doing  about smoky exhausts?"  I  do  not

think I can please the Member for Sembawang.  I  am

afraid the standard of mechanical inspections  will

have to be maintained.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



I would not say that it would be strict nor would I

say  that  it  should be too lenient, but  we  have

certain standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that the Member for Sembawang himself

has admitted that in the past very little was being

done  about inspections. It is because very  little

was being done in the past that, when you begin  to

reorganise and decide to maintain certain standards

of performance, people begin to grumble, "Oh, it is

too  strict."  So I will say that, as  he  is  well

aware,  taxis are subject to bi-annual inspections;

there will be an inspection every six months.  Even

a  new vehicle has got to be looked into. And if it

so  happens  that a new taxi emits too much  smoke,

therefore,  that engine is not properly  tuned.  It

has  got  to  be  put right, and  therefore  it  is

necessary   for  certain  standards  of  mechanical

inspection   to  be  maintained.   I   am   afraid,

therefore,  that  we  cannot  reduce  the   present

standard  of  inspections. That  would  defeat  the

reorganisation programme which is to achieve higher

standards  in our public service vehicles.  If  the

taxis have been reasonably maintained and serviced,

they  should have no difficulty in getting  through

the mechanical inspection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been a general misconception that

mechanical  inspections are strict.  They  are  not

strict.  They  are  just minimal,  because  certain

minimal   standards   must   be   maintained.   The

misconception arises from the fact that nine  years

prior  to June 1971 - that goes back to 1962 -  the

ROV   Mechanical   Inspection  Section   had   been

understaffed  because of the inability  to  recruit

qualified  personnel. Inspections,  therefore,  had

been  cursory. But since 1971 more qualified  staff

have been recruited, and all of them are now in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



Sin  Ming Road centre where there are adequate pits

for   the   examination  of  vehicles.   Mechanical

inspections, therefore, have been brought up to the

standard  as  they  ought  to  be.  This  has  been

misinterpreted as stricter inspections. So  let  me

assure  the  Member for Sembawang that we  are  not

being  too strict. We are just maintaining  certain

minimal standards of maintenance of vehicles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I thank
