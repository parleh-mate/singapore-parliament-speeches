<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>OVERSEAS MEDICAL DEGREES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for Health if he will

review  (i) the policy of restricting the number of  overseas

universities for approved medical studies; (ii) the  criteria

for  the  recognition of overseas medical degrees; and  (iii)

the   list   of   universities  with  degrees  approved   for

registration in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1572</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Lim Hng Kiang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the intake into the NUS medical school is currently  200

a  year.  Each year, we expect about 80 overseas graduates to

be  registered  for  practice in  Singapore,  including  both

foreign  doctors and overseas trained Singaporeans.   The  20

universities whose medical degrees are registrable  with  the

Singapore Medical Council are in various developed countries,

such  as  the  UK,  USA and Australia, so we have  sufficient

choice  of graduates.  This number also excludes the  160-odd

doctors who are under temporary registration in Singapore  at

any one time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overseas medical schools are top ranking

institutions  in  their respective countries  and  have  been

assessed  to  be of a standard comparable to the NUS  medical

school,  or better.  The list is reviewed from time  to  time

and  updated.  The present list remains relevant  and  serves

our needs.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> May I ask the

Minister  if we are in fact short of doctors here again  and,

if  it  is  so,  why  are  we adhering  with  the  policy  of

restricting the number of recognised universities for medical

students?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> When we debated the health policy in

the  White Paper in 1993, we made it quite clear that we want

to   prevent  over  supply  of  doctors  and  specialists  in

Singapore.   Because  if  there  are  too  many  doctors  and

specialists, the demand for medical services will be inflated

and  healthcare  costs  will go up.  So  that  has  been  the

fundamental  pillar of our policy.  In the  White  Paper,  we

would  control the output from NUS at 150 per year  and  also

from foreign trained doctors at 50 per year.  Because of  the

change in population policy, we have increased the intake  in

NUS  to  200 and also the intake from foreign trained doctors

from 50 to 80.  So we have made the necessary adjustments  to

meet  the  higher population that we have.  The situation  is

quite comfortable today.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether it is

likely that we will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1573</b></font><br><br>



requiring many more doctors for multi-factorial reasons,  one

of  which  will be the ageing population that will need  more

medical  care.   And will a shortage of doctors  in  fact  be

perpetual  in  the coming years, especially  if  we  have  to

depend  mainly  on our own university for the supply  of  our

medical personnel?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We are constantly reviewing our

requirement for doctors.  The need for doctors for an  ageing

population  is  in fact factored in the White Paper  when  we

studied  the  issues in the White Paper  in  1992/1993.   The

population profile and the ageing phenomenon in Singapore are

quite  well  understood.   This is  something  that  you  can

project  30-40 years ahead of time.  What is new now  is  our

thrust into life sciences.  That is a new factor which we are

taking into consideration.  As you may know, Dr Tony Tan  has

set  up  a task force to look at how Singapore should respond

to  life sciences.  It is entirely possible.  Because of this

new  requirement,  we  may have to  increase  the  intake  of

doctors, both in servicing for clinical trials as well as for

research.   So  I do not rule out the need for  more  doctors

from  both our local intakes, local training as well as  from

overseas   sources.   But  for  the  time   being,   the   20

universities  that  we have, as registrable  under  the  SMC,

serve our need because we can recruit what we want from these

20  universities.   And  those who do  not  come  from  these

universities,  we  can  put  them  either  on  temporary   or

conditional registration.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Will the Minister be able to get better

postulation  on  our  medical staff requirement,  considering

that  medical training takes many years to complete and  that

many years of advance planning is necessary?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> That is indeed one of the

considerations, that it takes many years to train  a  doctor,

and  also  the people, particularly Singaporean  parents  and

students, make their decisions based on what we put up.  When

we say that there are 20 registrable universities, they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1574</b></font><br><br>



would put their children in these universities and those  who

have  done so since 1993 will have reason to be upset  if  we

chop  and change every other year.  So when we do projections

for medical personnel, particularly doctors, we have to do so

in  a  very  deliberate manner.  And we did so in  1992-1993.

The  situation has changed somewhat.  We have adjusted it  in

1998,  not  so  long  ago, by increasing the  intake  in  our

university  and  allowing more registrations  from  overseas.

Now,  there  is  another new consideration, how  to  position

ourselves  for life sciences.  As I said, this  is  something

that  we are studying and it is conceivable that, because  of

this   very  major  change,  we  may  have  to  make  further

modifications to our plans.  But I would be reluctant to chop

and change because people are making very important decisions

based on what we publish as registrable universities.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> May I just ask

the  Minister  whether he has the figures for the  number  of

doctors per year that come from the overseas institutions?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I do not have the detailed breakdown

with  me.  But I presume the 80 doctors that we recruit every

year  will  come  from  these 20 universities.   Because  the

people who can come in and are registrable without having  to

go  for  extra examinations are the ones listed in  these  20

universities.  So I assume the 80 doctors come  from  the  20

universities.



<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Would the Minister be

prepared to review the earlier list of universities  that  he

had  delisted  and  consider reinstating them?   He  has  the

original  list of the universities when he first started  and

he  had  delisted some of them.  Will he be able to reinstate

some of these comparable universities?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> I thought that has been the purpose

of  my  whole  answer.   In  1993, we  changed  from  170-odd

universities and we trimmed it down to 20.  People made their

decisions  based on this list of 20 universities.  They  have

committed their children to study in these 20



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1575</b></font><br><br>



universities.  If now we change without good reasons, I think

if  I were a Singaporean parent, I will be quite upset.   But

if  there  is a significant change in the direction  that  is

needed,  say,  for  example, life  sciences,  and  we  cannot

generate the graduates to meet this requirement from within - that  is the subject of a task force set up by Dr Tony Tan  - then, of course, we may have to broaden or widen the list  to

take in the necessary numbers from overseas.  But, today,  we

have   expanded  from  50-odd  to  80  doctors  and  the   20

universities  can  provide  the  80  doctors  that   we   are

recruiting  every  year.  Those who do not  come  from  these

universities, we will put them under temporary or conditional

registration, that means they work under certain hospitals or

VWOs  for very specific purpose.  The situation today is that

our   needs   are  met  through  temporary  and   conditional

registration of these foreign doctors.  My primary concern is

if  you  tell Singaporeans that you will recognise  these  20

universities and they have gone overseas for studies, I  will

be very reluctant to chop and change so frequently.



<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> May I ask the Minister how accurate is this

manpower  projection because it is always changing from  time

to  time?  Since it is changing all the time, how accurate is

your projection for such manpower needs?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> We do not have a fixed ratio that we

target for.  It is not to say that if you have one doctor  to

700  population, you are going to get so much better  medical

care  than 1:750.  These are not critical numbers or planning

norms. Basically, the indigenous population of Singapore  can

be  quite easily projected.  What happens is in 1996, we made

a  major strategic decision to increase the intake of PRs and

that  changed the scenario quite drastically.   Now,  we  are

considering  the second strategic decision that  we  have  to

take  probably  this year and, that is, we have  to  look  at

doctors  not  just as servicing the healthcare industry,  but

also as participants in this new life sciences industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I see these as two major changes in the strategic

scenario.  Other than that, you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1576</b></font><br><br>



cannot project accurately how many will stay after they  have

passed  out from their university.  Give and take  10  or  20

every   year,   it  does  not  change  your  situation   that

drastically.  What we are looking for are significant changes

in  direction, ie, the 1996 population intake of PRs, and now

what  we  are  going to do strategically for  life  sciences.

These are major decisions which of course will have an impact

on  the  production of doctors.  Beyond that,  we  are  quite

comfortable.  Our primary care sector is well taken care  of.

We  are building new hospitals, and all these projections are

taken care of.



<br><br><!-- Dr Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Vasoo:</b> In view of the move by Singapore to make our

place  a  medical  hub  and to develop a  medical  centre  of

excellence, are these factors taken into consideration in the

projection for manpower?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> This is nothing new. This was

already anticipated in the 1993 White Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the total sum to be allocated for Head O of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100." - [Dr Ong Chit Chung].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Sir, yesterday on Foreign Affairs, many Members raised issues

on  a  wide variety of subjects, our relations with Malaysia,

Indonesia, the position in ASEAN, East Timor, United Nations,

technical  assistance,  amongst  others.   My  colleague,  Mr

Zainul Abidin has touched on Singapore-Philippines relations,

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1577</b></font><br><br>



this  morning,  we will address the other issues  which  were

raised.



<br>12.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Malaysia-Singapore relations, a matter

which  several MPs touched on.  They asked me about the state

of  relations  as  well  as some specific  aspects,  such  as

updating  on the package negotiations. As far as the  overall

relations  are  concerned, I last  touched  on  this  at  our

sitting on 17th January this year when I updated the House on

the   status  of  the  package  negotiations  on  outstanding

bilateral issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would describe our relations with Malaysia to be

in  a  "holding  pattern".  Following three rapid  rounds  of

discussions  on outstanding issues in March,  April  and  May

last  year, the momentum of negotiations except on  CLOB  has

grounded to a halt.  We all know that for the better part  of

last   year,  Dr  Mahathir  and  his  Government   had   been

preoccupied   with  domestic  issues  such  as  the   general

elections  in  November and there has not  been  a  focus  on

relations with Singapore. Now that the elections are over, it

is  our  hope of course that efforts can be resumed to  renew

and enhance the cooperation between our two countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, let me emphasise that Malaysia and

Singapore  are  indeed bound by a multiplicity  of  different

ties.  Any such close relationship inevitably must go through

different phases.  I think it is natural that there  will  be

ups   and   downs  during  our  relations.   But  Singapore's

relations  will be marked by both competition and cooperation

to advance our respective national interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's position remains unchanged, that is, we are

committed   to   forging  a  mutually  beneficial   long-term

relationship  with Malaysia based on mutual  respect,  trust,

reciprocity  and mutual benefit. We believe in the  principle

of  prosper-thy-neighbour and we would  continue  to  take  a

constructive approach towards realising the full potential in

our bilateral relationship.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1578</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members also asked for an update on the package

negotiations.  As I said, the senior officials met in  March,

April  and  May  last  year  on the  package  of  outstanding

bilateral issues.  Singapore tried to be helpful and took the

approach  of  offering "maximum benefits for both  sides"  by

trying  to accommodate new Malaysian requests on issues  such

as  the  POA  and  the  CPF withdrawal  by  West  Malaysians.

However, Malaysia has not given any indication yet that it is

prepared  to  accommodate Singapore's request on the  various

issues, especially the supply of raw water to Singapore after

the expiry of our water agreements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have informed this House previously that it is

Malaysia's  turn  to  host  the next  round  of  talks.   The

Malaysians have on several occasions indicated that they  are

aware that the ball is in their court. But they have not  yet

responded  with  specific dates.  We want  to  resolve  these

issues  as soon as possible. When Malaysian Foreign  Minister

Datuk  Seri Syed Hamid visited Singapore last year, we agreed

that  officials from both sides should try to narrow the gaps

on  the  issues, so as to arrive at a win-win  package  deal.

That continues to be our expectation and our approach.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it would seem that the immediate priority of

the  Malaysians is on the UMNO General Assembly elections  in

May.  As  such, it remains to be seen whether there  will  be

significant  movement  on the discussions  of  the  bilateral

package  before  that date.  But it is clearly  in  the  best

interest of both countries to resolve the issues as  soon  as

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not touch on the CLOB issue where the Singapore

Exchange  and the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange have reached  a

comprehensive  and  legally  binding  solution,  because  the

Deputy  Prime  Minister had dealt with  this  in  this  House

comprehensively yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the railway land, which is also part of the package

deal,  all I need to do is to reiterate what I said  in  this

House  before.  The  fact that there is a package  discussion

going on and that it has taken some time



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1579</b></font><br><br>



to resolve this matter does not, in any way, affect the legal

position of these agreements and undertakings under the  law.

Some  of  these  issues involve questions of  principles  and

questions of law.  And these positions of principles, whether

it  is  sovereignty or on legal interpretations  of  existing

agreements,  such as the railway land, have to be  maintained

by Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, under the Points of Agreement, Members will

recall   that   there  are  clear  legal   undertakings   and

responsibilities and a time schedule which has to be  adhered

to.   There  are  certain obligations  to  be  performed  and

undertaken under the agreements and that continues to be  our

position.   As I pointed out in Parliament on 5th June  1997,

the  POA  provides  for  a "maximum period  for  the  railway

station  to be moved from Keppel, that is, within five  years

from  the  time the MRT reaches Woodlands New Town, which  it

did on 10th February 1996."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members also referred to Pedra Branca, but I wish

to  point  out  to the Members and they will  recall  that  I

informed this House last year in January that officials  from

Malaysia and Singapore did reach an agreement in 1998 on  the

text  of  a  special agreement to refer Malaysia's  claim  to

Pedra  Branca to the International Court of Justice.   Hence,

this matter is no longer a pressing issue which explains  why

it  was not included in the package of outstanding issues for

bilateral negotiations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong had reiterated his suggestion for an

economic union between Singapore and Malaysia.  I would refer

to what Prime Minister Goh said in reply in this House on 5th

June 1997, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He (Mr Chiam) got his economic history of our Malaysia

days   wrong,  and  he  has  ignored  important  non-economic

factors,  but the economic logic of his proposal is  correct.

However,  cooperation takes two willing parties.   I  do  not

think  this is the right time to talk about an economic union

when bilateral relations are strained and we are still having

difficulties implementing specific items of cooperation."



And he said:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1580</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singapore and Malaysia share a symbiotic relationship.

I fully subscribe to Dr Mahathir's philosophy of 'prosper-thy-neighbour'.  It  is  an important way to strengthen  our  two

countries'  symbiotic relationship and  help  each  other  to

become developed."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was what Prime Minister said. What Mr Chiam was

saying  yesterday is whether an economic union of the  Suzhou

type  of  project or other economic projects, there are  many

opportunities  for the two sides to undertake  to  strengthen

economic  cooperation.  I agree.  I would say that there  are

endless  opportunities for both countries  to  cooperate  for

mutual  benefit.  But there must be political will  from  the

other  side to respond to Singapore's efforts.  If  there  is

any  perceived lack of progress on economic cooperation,  let

me say that it is not due to any lack of effort on our part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will recall that Prime Minister Goh

had  proposed a framework of wider cooperation with  Malaysia

in  line with the 'prosper-thy-neighbour' philosophy which Dr

Mahathir  has  espoused.   Under  this  framework  for  wider

cooperation,   Prime  Minister  Goh  had  proposed   concrete

cooperation  projects  such  as  the  development  of   water

resources  in  Malaysia for sale to Singapore and  the  joint

development  of  Malayan Railway land in Singapore.   Members

may also be aware that Prime Minister Goh spent a lot of time

and  effort and, in fact, he met with Dr Mahathir eight times

in  the  past  two years.  More recently, Prime Minister  had

indicated  that he is prepared to meet Dr Mahathir.  We  will

continue  to  press  on and persevere  with  our  efforts  to

promote bilateral cooperation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli Baharudin's suggestion was for more

resources to be made available to the civil societies, and in

particular,   the  Singapore  International  Foundation   and

Singapore   Institute  of  International  Affairs   for   the

promotion  of people-to-people cooperation between  Singapore

and  Malaysia.   I  would agree that the  fostering  of  good

relations  is  not the sole prerogative of governments.   The

private  sector, civic organisations, cultural organisations,

sporting organisations, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1581</b></font><br><br>



name  a  few,  all  play a role in promoting  good  relations

between our neighbours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his specific suggestion that more finances and

resources  be  made available to civic bodies, if  there  are

specific and worthwhile projects and a request made  to  MFA,

we  will of course be prepared to consider them on a case-by-case  basis.   Of course, Members have to bear in  mind  that

many  civic  organisations are autonomous  organisations  and

might want to retain their autonomy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong, Mr Hawazi Daipi and a few other

Members  spoke about the letter by Mr Malik Tahir  which  was

published recently in our local press. They asked whether  Mr

Malik  Tahir's  views typify the general  feelings  of  Malay

Malaysians.   I of course cannot speculate if his perspective

respresents  the  views of the majority of Malay  Malaysians.

But  let me say that we should make a distinction between the

views  expressed by such individuals and private  parties  on

the one hand, and the official views of a Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I mentioned before in this House on several

occasions, after separation, Singapore and Malaysia have,  in

fact, evolved and developed into two distinct societies.   It

would  not  be possible for Singapore to give up  its  system

which  is based on meritocracy and multi-racialism.  But  our

approach  would  be, notwithstanding the differences  between

our two systems, both countries stand to benefit greatly from

bilateral cooperation. Such cooperation must be on the  basis

of  sovereign equality and mutual benefits.  It cannot be  on

the  basis of unequal or differential relationship prescribed

by Mr Tahir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connected with this matter, Mr Sin Boon Ann asked

whether we are doing enough to put our position across to the

Malaysians  so  that our views, stand and  positions  can  be

disseminated better or more effectively in Malaysia.  Let  me

say that when issues arise, we do, in fact, take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1582</b></font><br><br>



considerable measures to put our views across, not only here,

but  also  in Malaysia.  And where there are reports  in  the

Malaysian media which are erroneous or false, we rebut  them.

We also publish our speeches, press releases and rebuttals on

our  MFA website as well as in the website of our Mission  in

Kuala  Lumpur.  Therefore, I wish to assure Members that  MFA

and  our  Missions  abroad  have been  proactive  in  putting

Singapore's views across when necessary.  This has even  been

noted by the Malaysian media. For example, on the CLOB issue,

the  New  Straits Times reported on 29th February this  year,

and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of the lessons of the CLOB affair is perhaps the

value  of  effective public relations.  The Singaporeans  had

their  whole  Government involved, including  their  overseas

missions,  telling their side of the CLOB  story.   In  Kuala

Lumpur,  for  example,  the  Singapore  High  Commission  was

sending  copies of CLOB-related documents to the media.   The

same intensity was absent from the Malaysian side."



So I think this speaks for itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong asked about the latest developments, if

any,  on  the  Singapore-Johor  bridge  which  Malaysia   was

reported  to  have  proposed  to  construct  to  replace  the

Causeway. The answer to that is that we have not received any

official proposal from the Malaysian Government. As  this  is

an   important  issue  involving  two  sovereign   countries,

naturally,  we  can only consider this matter when  a  formal

proposal  is received from the Malaysian Government  and  not

through any other party.



<br>1.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Charles Chong also referred to newspaper

reports  in  Malaysia  to  the effect  that  Malaysians  have

briefed Prime Minister Goh during his recent visit to  Johor.

Indeed,   during the Hari Raya party which the  Johor  Mentri

Besar  hosted  for  the Prime Minister on 30th  January,  the

Mentri  Besar,  Dato Abdul Ghani, showed Prime Minister  some

models  and  pictures  of  a possible  new  bridge  over  the

Causeway,  but  there was no discussion of  the  issue.   The

Prime  Minister made it clear to the Johor Mentri Besar  that

it should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1583</b></font><br><br>



regarded  as a non-briefing.  In other words, it was  not  an

official briefing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said before, Singapore has, to date, not

received any official proposal from Malaysia.  If and when an

official  proposal is received, I think there  are  obviously

some  key questions which will have to be considered.   First

and  foremost,  what  is  the justification  for  wanting  to

replace  the Causeway with a bridge?  If there is a proposal,

we need to consider carefully whether it is feasible.  And to

consider and conclude whether it is feasible, one would  have

to  make a careful cost benefit analysis.  If the study shows

that  the proposal is not feasible, then we will not be  able

to  support it.  Anyway, as I said, no proposal has been  put

to  the  Government and therefore, at the  moment,  there  is

nothing to study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members then turned to the situation in Indonesia. They

asked me about the state of our relations with Indonesia  and

also  certain specific questions.  If I may make  some  broad

observations about the situation in Indonesia,  I  would  say

that  Indonesia is actually in transition.  There  have  been

political, economic and social changes there, and there  have

also  been greater demands for regional autonomy, as well  as

regions requesting a greater share of local resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The election of Abdurrahman Wahid as President and

Megawati   Soekarnoputri  as  Vice  President  represents   a

legitimate  leadership.  Notwithstanding  its  legitimacy,  I

would  say that it has a difficult job in dealing with  post-Soeharto  changes.   With  this new leadership,  other  power

centres have also emerged.  They are seeking a greater say in

government  as  well as acting as a check and  balance.   The

role of the armed forces is also being reshaped.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Wahid has begun a process of political

consolidation,   national   reconciliation   and    restoring

international confidence.  This is important for  the  return

of  economic  stability  and foreign  investment.   President

Wahid  also  sought to deal with the regional  pressures  for

greater autonomy and, in some cases, even calls



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1584</b></font><br><br>



for independence.  But he has received the endorsement of the

international community on Indonesia's unity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President Wahid continues to face considerable

challenges.   Singapore  supports the Indonesian  government,

and  wishes President Wahid well in his efforts to deal  with

the political, economic and social changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards our relations with Indonesia, I said in last

year's  Committee of Supply debate that relations  then,  one

year  ago,  were going through a difficult period.   At  that

time,  various Indonesian leaders and officials had made  all

sorts of allegations and negative comments against Singapore.

Members  will recall that,  subsequently, later in the  year,

in  November, responding to a question on bilateral  ties,  I

said  that Indonesia was one of our closest neighbours and  a

major  trading partner, and we would like to see a prosperous

and stable Indonesia.  That is our position.  We are ready to

work  with Indonesia to assist in its economic recovery.   We

are  a small country and our contribution can only be modest.

But  we  can  play a catalytic role to help restore  investor

confidence through practical measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore and Indonesia now enjoy warm and friendly

ties.   The  foundations of our relationship are  strong  and

have  withstood many storms.  We have cooperated  for  mutual

benefit  for  many years, and Singapore is one of Indonesia's

largest  foreign  investors and our bilateral  trade  remains

strong,  notwithstanding  the economic  crisis.   We  have  a

vested   interest  in  Indonesia's  stability,   growth   and

prosperity.     Furthermore,   Indonesia   is   strategically

important  for both Singapore, for the region and for  ASEAN.

It  is  therefore in everyone's interest to see a  prosperous

and stable Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even during the difficult times, Singapore did not lose

confidence in Indonesia.  Members will recall the West Natuna

Gas  project  and  the  Pertamina-Singapore  Power  agreement

reflected  Singapore's  faith  and  long-term  confidence  in

Indonesia.   I would add that President Wahid's  decision  to

make Singapore his first stop



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1585</b></font><br><br>



in  his  ASEAN tour also underscores the importance he places

on  relations with Singapore.  And the return visit by  Prime

Minister   in  January  continued  the  process  of   further

strengthening bilateral relations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the questions by Mr Sin Boon Ann and Mr

Hawazi  Daipi about the recent troubles in Bintan and whether

it  has  affected Singapore's investments there, this  matter

has  been  addressed by the Minister for Trade and  Industry.

But  let  me say that the demonstrations in Bintan were  over

the  issue of land compensation.  It was unfortunate that the

issue  resurfaced.  When development works by the  Indonesia-Singapore  joint  venture company on  the  Bintan  Industrial

Estate  began more than five years ago, compensation for  the

land  had  been  fully  settled and  the  land  was  free  of

encumbrance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demonstrations which occurred recently caused losses

for companies operating there as work had to be stopped.   It

also   affected  tourist  arrivals  and,  consequently,   the

livelihood  of  the people was also affected.  Therefore,  if

such disturbances are unchecked, it would affect investors in

the  Bintan  Industrial Estate and, in turn,  dampen  foreign

investors'  confidence in Indonesia.  And it will affect  our

role to act as a catalyst to enhance investor confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have conveyed to the Indonesian authorities at

all  levels  the  importance for Indonesia  to  resolve  this

matter.   But  let  me  add that the disturbances  in  Bintan

should  be  seen in the context of other incidents of  social

unrest in various other parts of Indonesia.  President  Wahid

himself  has  said that the outbreaks of unrest in  Indonesia

were the product of a conspiracy against his government.  The

Indonesian  authorities have indicated  that  the  disruptive

elements  from other parts of Indonesia had been involved  in

Bintan.   They recognise the nature and potential  impact  of

the  problem,  and they have taken swift action  to  end  the

disturbances.  Since then, the situation in Bintan  has  been

stabilised, and it is our hope that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1586</b></font><br><br>



investor   confidence   will   not   be   affected   by   the

demonstrations.   Such incidents should not  deter  Singapore

from   pursuing  bilateral  cooperation  projects  with   the

Indonesian government in the Riaus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Chiam asked whether the Government could

consider  leasing from the Indonesian government one  of  the

Riau  islands  to  develop  it into  an  economic  area  with

Singapore   having  full  control  on,  such   as   security,

immigration and allowing entry by Indonesian nationals and so

on.   I think Mr Chiam must know that this is not a practical

proposal, because he himself pointed out that this is a  very

sensitive  issue.  I think he knows that it will be  open  to

all    sorts   of   misunderstandings   and   interpretation,

particularly  when what he proposed may be seen as  impinging

on  Indonesia's rights of sovereignty.  This is especially so

when   Mr  Chiam's  proposal  envisaged  that  the  Singapore

Government  will  exercise  what  may  amount  to   sovereign

functions  like immigration and security control  in  another

territory.   At  a time when there is so much sensitivity  in

Indonesia  over calls for separatism, autonomy, independence,

I  think  Mr Chiam will agree when I say that it is  unlikely

that  this proposal would be considered, in his words,  as  a

purely "business" or commercial deal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Related to Indonesia, some Members also asked about East

Timor.  Three questions were posed.  One is to ask about  the

assistance  which  we have already given; second,  about  the

technical  assistance or training which we may give  to  East

Timor;   and,  thirdly,  prospects  of  East  Timor  becoming

independent and they applying for ASEAN membership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the assistance we have given to East Timor up to now,

as  a  member of the UN support group for East Timor, we have

contributed  US$230,000 to the UN Trust Fund for East  Timor.

The  Trust  Fund  was  set up to fund UN activities  in  East

Timor.    Then,   as  Members  will  know,  there   was   the

International  Force  for  East  Timor  (InterFET)  and   our

contribution   comprised  a  medical   detachment,   military

observers,  logistics  support and two  landing  ship  tanks.

Altogether, a total of 250 personnel



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1587</b></font><br><br>



were involved.  The cost of maintaining our contributions  in

East Timor was not small.  We incurred some $22.2 million for

maintaining  our  contributions to InterFET  and  the  United

Nations Assistance Mission to East Timor.  InterFET then  was

replaced  by United Nation Assistance Mission in  East  Timor

(UNAMET)  and  our contributions to UNTAET  are  40  civilian

police, 8 military observers and staff officers, a level  one

medical  team  comprising  up  to  26  members.   The  40-man

civilian  contingent will be deployed to East  Timor  on  6th

March  and  I assume they are already there.  An SAF  officer

has  also  been  appointed as a deputy  chief  of  staff  for

military and civil affairs in UNTAET.  If the UN accepts  all

our  contributions,  the  total  contribution  to  UNTAET  is

estimated to cost about $9.1 million for one year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the kind of technical assistance and training

which  we  can  give  to East Timor, the leaders,  Mr  Xanana

Gusmao and Jose-Ramos Horta, visited Singapore in January, as

part of their regional tour to establish the  groundwork  for

future  relations with friendly regional countries, and  they

were   also   wanting  to  gain  support  for  East   Timor's

construction   efforts.   They  expressed  an   interest   in

Singapore's  development experiences since independence.   At

their request, briefings were arranged with EDB, HDB, MPA and

PSA.   They  also  visited  a  HDB  new  town  and  met   our

businessmen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Gusmao thanked us for our contributions to InterFET

and  UNTAET,  and  he also requested our  help  in  providing

technical  assistance to East Timor.  They were  particularly

interested in the area of human resource development such  as

port  and airport management. We have assured him that within

the  limits of our resources, we would do what we can to help

out.  We  have extended an invitation to a team  of  Timorese

officials  to visit Singapore to discuss how we can  dovetail

some   of   our   technical  assistance   to   East   Timor's

requirements.  I expect the team will come in due course.



<br>1.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards East Timor's independence and thereafter

applying for membership,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1588</b></font><br><br>



we  had  informed  Mr Gusmao and Mr Jose-Ramos  Horta  during

their  visit  that  while Singapore  would  be  open  to  the

question  of East Timor's membership in ASEAN, it was  really

premature  to consider this issue now.  Our message  to  them

was  that  in  the next few years the priority should  be  to

achieve  independence, reconstruction  and  nation  building.

East  Timor's  reconstruction needs  are  enormous  and  will

require  massive assistance and strong political backing  for

some  time.  The UN and the international community  will  be

the   people  with  the  resources  and  experience  to  best

facilitate  East Timor's transition to independence.   It  is

important that the international community and the UN  remain

engaged  in  East Timor.  ASEAN countries themselves  do  not

possess all the necessary capabilities to undertake this task

of  reconstruction  for  East Timor.   Many  ASEAN  countries

themselves  are  recovering from the financial  crisis.   But

this  is  not  to  say  that ASEAN should  take  a  hands-off

approach.   ASEAN  will be involved, as  we  have  been  with

INTERFET  and  the  UN  support group  for  East  Timor,  and

individual  ASEAN countries, I am sure, including  Singapore,

will  continue to support the international effort  for  East

Timor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for membership of ASEAN, when they eventually apply

for  membership, I am sure ASEAN will have to give it serious

consideration.   East Timor, like any other aspiring  member,

will  have to meet certain criteria and we will have to  take

this  one step at a time.  In any case, ASEAN membership  has

to be decided by consensus.  They have to follow a procedure.

There  has  to be an application first.  Usually the  country

becomes an observer, after that they apply for membership and

membership  comes  after undertakings to  adhere  to  certain

basic  ASEAN  agreements, including the Bangkok  Declaration,

the  Treaty  of  Amity  and  Cooperation  and  various  other

agreements.   There  are some six agreements  which  aspiring

members will have to undertake to be bound.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members then asked about ASEAN. A common question was:

has ASEAN



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1589</b></font><br><br>



outgrown itself?  I think Dr Ong Chit Chung asked that.    Mr

Ravindran asked: have we expanded too fast?  Because  of  the

expansion, has ASEAN slowed down?  These are valid  questions

which  even members in ASEAN are asking themselves.  I  would

say  that ASEAN is going through an important testing period.

It is going through a difficult period because, firstly, many

of  the  countries are recovering from the financial  crisis.

Secondly,  ASEAN has been touted for many years as  the  most

successful  regional grouping.  If it was considered  as  the

most successful regional grouping, it was because many of the

members were doing well economically, and there was political

stability.   That is not so now:  Economically, some  of  the

countries  are  having problems.  Politically,  some  of  the

countries  like  Indonesia are going through  very  difficult

challenging   times  in  their  political  transition.    The

perception  is that ASEAN's reputation has been  dented.   It

has lost its shine or lustre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the challenge for ASEAN is how it can reorganise

itself,  re-invent  itself,  so  to  speak,  to  recover  its

relevance  as  a  vibrant  regional  grouping.   This  is  an

important  challenge and ASEAN will have to demonstrate  that

it  is  relevant to the region, and relevant to the  external

players.   As  I have mentioned in my answer to Dr  Ong  Chit

Chung on the strategic situation, ASEAN has been relevant  in

the  past  because  of its ability to engage  key  powers  in

discussions on security in the region. If ASEAN does not live

up  to  this challenge, then it will be marginalised  and  it

will be just another one of those many organisations that  we

have  seen in the world today.  But I am confident that ASEAN

will face this challenge squarely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions were asked about Singapore's chairmanship of

ASEAN  for the previous year, which culminated in our hosting

the ASEAN meeting and the ARF meeting.  As Chairman of ASEAN,

we  initiated an honest reappraisal of ASEAN at  the  meeting

which  Singapore chaired.  It is precisely because  of  these

difficulties  that ASEAN is going through that I  introduced,

with the agreement of the other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1590</b></font><br><br>



Ministers,  for  the  first  time  ever,  an  ASEAN   Foreign

Ministers'   Retreat,  in  other  words,  just  the   Foreign

Ministers without officials at all.  We had a frank  exchange

of  where  we are going.  The consensus was that this  was  a

very  candid exchange of views.  To indicate the candour,  we

took  note  of  the  danger  of  ASEAN  becoming  a  two-tier

organisation,  in other words, some of the new entrants  like

the  Indochinese countries on the one hand, and on the  other

hand,  the  original ASEAN member states.  It  was  important

that  we  should  prevent  ASEAN  from  becoming  a  two-tier

organisation.    To  prevent  that,  it  was   important   to

concentrate  on  efforts to integrate and  assist  the  newer

members of the organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Singapore's role during our chairmanship and

after  our  chairmanship, I would say that we have  tried  to

play  a constructive role by coming out with practical  ideas

to  advance  ASEAN's role.  For example, Members will  recall

that  the  Prime Minister proposed, and the leaders accepted,

the  idea  of  sending  missions  or  road  shows  abroad  to

demonstrate  to Europe, America and elsewhere that  ASEAN  is

determined  to  get  back on its feet.  These  missions  were

agreed upon, and one mission already took place to Japan  led

by  Malaysia with other members of ASEAN.  BG George Yeo, the

Minister for Trade and Industry, will lead this ASEAN mission

to  the  United States in May.  Thailand will also  lead  the

third   mission  to  Europe  in  May.   Singapore   will   be

represented   in  all  these  missions.   Other   Singapore's

initiatives and efforts which were agreed upon were the Prime

Minister's e-ASEAN initiative, which is intended to transform

ASEAN  into  a borderless and seamless market instead  of  10

fragmented  markets.   They  also endorsed  Prime  Minister's

proposal to accelerate AFTA.  So Singapore continues to  play

a  constructive role in ASEAN by coming out with ideas  which

have been agreed upon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also to indicate how ASEAN is trying to adjust, the

leaders  agreed that we should have an ASEAN Troika.  Because

once  you  have  10 members and if you meet once  a  year  at

Foreign Ministers' Meeting, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1591</b></font><br><br>



leaders meet once a year, how do you deal and respond to fast

changing events?  So it was proposed at the Leaders'  Meeting

that  we  should  have a troika of three members  to  have  a

faster mechanism for ASEAN's response.  This was agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was Singapore's major task ahead this year for

ASEAN?  I wish to inform Members that we will be hosting  the

Fourth  ASEAN  Informal Meeting in November  this  year.   We

intend to build what has been achieved in Manila.  I doubt if

we  want  to  have some grand visions or themes.  Rather,  we

hope to focus on the message that ASEAN has to renew itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ARF, responding to Mr Simon Tay, I agree with him

when  he  says that moving into preventive diplomacy is  very

important.   Singapore is very mindful of that and  Singapore

supports the practice of preventive diplomacy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the other Members who might not be very au fait with

ARF,  the ASEAN Regional Forum had three phases of evolution.

First was confidence building measures.  The second phase  is

preventive diplomacy, and the ultimate objective is  to  make

the ASEAN Regional Forum into a body which can be engaged  in

conflict  resolution.  For the past few years we really  have

been  focusing on confidence building measures.  Some of  us,

like  Singapore, feel that we should now nudge ourselves into

the preventive diplomacy phase.  So I agree with Mr Simon Tay

when   he  says  that  Singapore  should  support  preventive

diplomacy.  I want to assure him that we are ready to do  our

part  in  terms  of preventive diplomacy.  But  in  terms  of

Singapore itself engaging in preventive diplomacy, that is  a

slightly   different  matter  because  he   knows   that   in

international  practice  and  international  law,  preventive

diplomacy, if you offer yourself as good offices, depends  on

the  consent  of whichever parties are disputing.   You  just

cannot  impose yourself on disputing parties.  We  will  work

with  the  other  ARF countries to see how we can  accelerate

slowly   the   process  of  ARF  moving  towards   preventive

diplomacy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked about Myanmar. I can say that the

situation there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1592</b></font><br><br>



generally  calm  and the State Peace and Development  Council

remains  firmly  in  control.  I  understand  that  they  are

concerned over Myanmar's economic slowdown as a result  of  a

combination of various factors including the Asian  financial

crisis.    He  asked  about  ASEAN's  role  and  constructive

engagement.  I have explained in this House before that being

an   ASEAN   member,   Myanmar  has  greater   exposure   and

opportunities  to come into contact with the other  countries

in  ASEAN.   We take this opportunity to have a quiet,  frank

discussion.  Many of us, individually and separately, quietly

exercised some suasion in trying to persuade Myanmar  on  the

ways  of  achieving normalcy, as in some of the  other  ASEAN

countries.   But we do not take the approach  of  some  other

countries like in the East who are inclined to imposing their

views and insisting that various measures be taken.  We think

it  is  better to have quiet diplomacy.  Notwithstanding  the

help  and  encouragement Singapore and other ASEAN  countries

can give Myanmar, in the end the pace of reform measures must

still be left to them to decide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong asked about ASEAN-EU relations. It is

true  that  there  is  a difficulty and  that  difficulty  is

because  the  EU has a common policy with regard to  Myanmar.

Because  of the common policy, they maintain that  they  will

not  be  able to allow the Myanmar Foreign Minister to attend

any  meetings held in Europe.  Therefore, for the first  time

last year, the ASEAN-EU Foreign Ministers' Meeting, which has

taken place regularly for many years, was cancelled.  It  was

to  take  place  in  Berlin.  It was  cancelled  because  the

European  Union insisted that they would not give a visa  for

the  Myanmar  Foreign  Minister but the  rest  of  the  ASEAN

Foreign  Ministers could come.  Naturally,  ASEAN  could  not

accept that condition, and the meeting therefore did not take

place.



<br>1.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our position on Myanmar vis-a-vis the European Union is

to  tell  the  Europeans that they are free, and should  feel

free, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1593</b></font><br><br>



take whatever position they want with regard to Myanmar,  but

to  distinguish their relations with ASEAN as an organisation

from  their  relations with Myanmar.  Just as  when  we  held

meetings  here, as I chaired the meetings last year,  we  had

the Myanmar Foreign Minister and the European Union here, and

they  had  no difficulty in sitting down in the same  meeting

with  Myanmar  Foreign Minister.  So this is a real  problem.

We  have  persevered  with European Union.   There  are  many

countries in the EU who would like to break this impasse  and

get back to the productive ASEAN-EU relationship.  So we will

work  with  them  to  see  how we can  revive  this  ASEAN-EU

Ministerial  process,  and many behind-the-scene  discussions

are going on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Mr Charles Chong also asked, if we should have

a  "tit  for tat", and will ASEAN take a similar position  on

the  Austrian  government.  I cannot speak for  the  rest  of

ASEAN,  but  I  doubt  it.  Because  if  ASEAN  wants  to  be

consistent  over  the  position we  have  taken  with  EU  on

Myanmar, then it should follow that ASEAN's relationship with

EU,  which  is  a bloc-to-bloc relationship,  should  not  be

contingent on whether a particular government or a particular

Minister is in that government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay and a few others asked about our United

Nations  Security  Council candidature.  First,  to  give  an

update.   Singapore is bidding for a seat, which is in  Asian

Group  seat,  for the United Nations Security  Council,  non-permanent  member.   The election will be  later  this  year,

around October or so.  Because it is in Asian Group seat, and

there is no rival Asian candidate competing with us, and  the

Asian  Group earlier has endorsed Singapore's candidature  as

the  Asian  Group's agreed candidate, I would  say  that  the

prospects of us being elected are very good.  But we are  not

being complacent.  We are continuing with all our efforts  to

talk  to  other countries in other regions to ensure that  we

have  a  good  result when voting takes place in  the  United

Nations.  But I am reasonably



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1594</b></font><br><br>



confident that we will be elected, and the election is for  a

two-year term starting in January 2001.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to say this. If we can get elected to

the  UN  Security Council, we should not get carried away  by

the  fact  that  we will be in the Security Council  for  two

years.  And it does not mean that we have suddenly arrived or

that  for  two  years we will have some magical power  status

bestowed on us.  That is not the case.  During the two years,

if  we  are on the Security Council and thereafter,  we  will

still continue to be a small country and we cannot pretend to

be  otherwise.  I thought I should emphasise this.  We should

have a sense of proportion and not have any delusion that  we

are  not  a  small country.  And the reason why I  make  this

point  is  yesterday,  as  I was listening  to  some  of  the

comments,  questions and observations in the cuts on  Foreign

Affairs,  I  thought  that  there  was  a  little   lack   of

proportion,  a  little lack of realism.  When I  listened  to

some  of  the comments, say, "look, can we send so many  more

military missions, peacekeeping operations, can we expand our

technical assistance, not just human resources but  also  try

to  influence the policies in these countries", and so on,  I

would say, you better come down to reality and remember  that

we  are a small country with limited resources.  We shall  do

our  best  to  be active in foreign policy - to  advance  our

interests, to be a responsible international citizen  and  to

have  constructive ideas on issues, whether in the region  or

in international organisations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me say that if we are elected to

the  Security  Council, we will do our best to contribute  to

the  work of the Council by bringing to the Council -  and  I

think this is Mr Simon Tay's question - the perspective of  a

small  country,  and  we  will try  to  demonstrate  wherever

possible  that a small state can also play a useful  role  in

the Council.  And we will work with like-minded countries  in

the  Council,  including those from the Non-aligned  Movement

and  the  G77, on issues of common interest.  As the endorsed

candidate  of  the Asian Group, naturally we will  also  work

with the Asian Group to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1595</b></font><br><br>



reflect their views and concerns in the Security Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay asked whether on issues we would side with

the  big  powers.  I think our record speaks for itself.   In

all  these  years, people consider Singapore  to  have  taken

positions on the basis of principle and that we would have an

independent foreign policy, and we shall continue to  do  so,

whether we are in the Security Council or we are not  in  the

Security Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now ask your permission, Sir, for my colleagues

Dr  Ow  Chin  Hock  and Mr Zainul Abidin  to  deal  with  the

remaining issues.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock (Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Dr Ow Chin Hock):</b> Sir, on Singapore-Japan relations, I agree with Dr

Ong  Chit  Chung that the bilateral relations  are  warm  and

close,  and  I  may  add,  the  relations  have  strengthened

significantly in recent years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, during the Asian financial crisis, both countries

have  consulted  closely to assist the  regional  economy  in

overcoming  their economic difficulties.  Japanese government

delegations  visiting the region also visited  Singapore  and

had substantive discussions with our leaders and officials on

regional development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, bilateral cooperation and interaction have

broadened   and  institutionalised.   Several  key  bilateral

projects  endorsed at the highest political level  have  been

implemented.   These include the Japan-Singapore  Partnership

Programme for the 21st Century, Japan-Singapore Symposium and

Japan-Singapore  Business Council.  Further,  Prime  Minister

Goh's  visit  to Japan in December last year was  successful.

The  visit provided more opportunity for Singapore and  Japan

to  explore  new areas to further enhance bilateral  economic

cooperation in the new millennium.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the visit, Prime Minister Goh and Japanese Prime

Minister  Obuchi  agreed  to launch  a  joint  study  on  the

feasibility to establish a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between

Japan and Singapore.  Both sides



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1596</b></font><br><br>



hope  that  the  joint study will help to  enhance  bilateral

economic  integration  and cooperation  as  well  as  further

complement ongoing efforts of the two countries to strengthen

the multi-trading system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong asked for the progress on FTA. The first meeting

or  inaugural  meeting  of  the joint  study  has  just  been

concluded.  It was held on 7th and 8th.  Both countries  were

represented  in  the  joint study by  senior  officials  from

various  Ministries  and members of the  private  sector  and

academia.   The first meeting had made positive  progress  in

identifying the scope of such an FTA.  The next meeting  will

be  in Japan in late April this year.  Both sides will strive

to  complete the study and to submit by November 2000 a joint

report   to  their  respective  Prime  Ministers,  with   the

recommendation on whether both countries should proceed  with

formal negotiation for such a Free Trade Agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me turn to Singapore-China relations.

Singapore-China  relations  are  good,  underscored  by   the

frequent  exchange of high level visits.  There are no  major

bilateral  issues between our two countries.   Following  the

resolution  of the Suzhou Industrial Park issue  or  dispute,

relations have been problem-free.  The strongest basis of our

bilateral  relation  is in the area of economic  cooperation.

Bilateral trade between Singapore and China has been steadily

increasing  at  an  average annual rate of  14%  since  1990.

Singapore is also one of the top investors in China.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China's impending entry into the WTO is expected to

provide  new opportunities for our businesses and  investors.

Some  new  areas for cooperation, such as public housing,  IT

and the financial sector, have already been identified during

Premier  Zhu  Rongji's  visit  to  Singapore  last  November.

Singapore   would  continue  to  explore  stronger   economic

cooperation with China in these new areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year also marks the 10th anniversary of the

establishment of diplomatic relations.  We are confident that

future cooperation between Singapore and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1597</b></font><br><br>



China will continue to expand and strengthen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong also commented on the PRC's White Paper on "the

One-China  principle and the Taiwan Issue".   Some  observers

have  pointed out that the White Paper has introduced  a  new

condition,  that  China will resort to force  if  the  Taiwan

authorities  refuse indefinitely the peaceful  settlement  of

cross-strait settlement or reunification through negotiation.

But  the Chinese leadership has countered that this has  been

its  consistent position.  However, the fundamental  position

of  the White Paper is that China would not renounce the  use

of force to settle the Taiwan issue.  This is not new.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, China has clearly set their OB markers against

independence for Taiwan which Taipei would not breach.  Given

that  both  China  and  Taiwan are  currently  enjoying  high

economic  growth, it is unlikely that they will  want  to  be

drawn into a conflict at this time.  However, as the Minister

has  pointed out yesterday, the Taiwan issue is  one  of  the

most  significant uncertainties in the region.  An escalation

of  cross-strait tensions would be disastrous for the  region

at  a  time  when it needs stability to sustain its  economic

recovery.   In  the  interest of the region's  stability  and

prosperity,  it  is our hope that the parties  involved  will

continue  to exercise restraint in their efforts  to  resolve

differences across the Taiwan Strait.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong also asked what is Singapore's stand on the cross-strait relationship. We have always abided by the One-China

policy.   The  release of the Chinese White  Paper  will  not

affect  our  policy.  Nonetheless, we hope for  the  sake  of

peace, regional peace and stability, any cross-strait problem

can be resolved peacefully between the two parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong further asked whether Singapore can play a role.

Let  me  point out that cross-strait relations are considered

by PRC as an internal matter or family affair.  Singapore can

play  a  role only if we are invited to do so by both  sides.

For instance, in 1992, we facilitated the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1598</b></font><br><br>



Wang-Ku  Hui Tang, or Wang-Ku Talks, by providing  the  venue

for their dialogues.



<br>1.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed):</b> Sir, I would

like  to respond to two questions raised by Members,  one  on

EALAF and the other on technical cooperation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member, Mr Ravindran, mentioned yesterday, East

Asia  has  got  institutional links with both  North  America

(through APEC) and with Europe (through ASEM).  There is this

obvious missing link between two dynamic regions of East Asia

and  Latin  America.   Thus to bridge  this  gap,  EALAF  was

initiated  by  Singapore, in fact by our Prime  Minister,  to

provide  opportunities for closer interaction  in  political,

economic, social and other spheres.  This is how we feel that

Singapore  can  play a facilitator role in the  international

scene.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some update, which was asked by Mr Ravindran, the

inaugural  meeting  of officials was held in  September  last

year  where  in fact 27 countries participated.   There  were

three major outcomes out of this meeting last September.  The

first was the Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Chile which would

be held in the first quarter of 2001 and would be preceded by

two  preparatory Senior Officials' Meetings (SOMs).   Second,

EALAF  should  be  the  working name for  the  Forum  pending

consensus  on  the new appellation to be agreed  upon  later.

Third,  EALAF  will have a multi-dimensional nature  covering

political, economic, social, cultural and other tracks.   The

meeting  also has confirmed 17 projects, three of which  were

offered by Singapore in different areas, to give substance to

EALAF's  multi-dimensional  character.   The  three  projects

which Singapore has offered include (1) an economic study  on

obstacles and potential for greater economic linkages between

East  Asia  and the Latin American countries, spearheaded  by

ISEAS;  (2)  a Journalists' Visit Programme (JVP)  for  Latin

American countries.  One journalist each from Brazil and Peru

has been selected for the first JVP.  In fact, Thailand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1599</b></font><br><br>



has   also  indicated  interest  in  dovetailing  a   similar

programme  in  Thailand with the JVP; and (3) a Travel  Trade

Fair  (TTF)  for  Latin  American countries  to  be  held  in

conjunction  with the PATA Travel Mart in April  2000.   Thus

far,  three  countries - Mexico, Venezuela and  Ecuador  have

agreed to participate in this fair.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next EALAF meeting, the Chileans have proposed

the  dates of 16-18 August 2000 for the next EALAF SOM to  be

held  in  Santiago,  Chile.  And this  will  be  followed  by

another  preparatory SOM meeting back-to-back with the  first

Ministerial  Meeting scheduled also to be held  in  Santiago,

Chile, in the first quarter of 2001.  A summit is planned  to

be held later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, EALAF is a Singapore initiative, and we

will  continue to actively pursue it.  Although EALAF  is  in

the  initial  stages, we are heartened from the responses  of

member  countries  thus far, and remain optimistic  that  the

EALAF process will take off as planned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, on the cut on technical and developmental

assistance.   Mr  Simon  Tay has raised  quite  a  number  of

observations.   This  is  the  second  year  he  is   raising

questions on technical development assistance.  Mr Simon Tay,

in  his  cut,  has asked that MFA need not say "yes"  but  to

agree  to at least review its policy on technical assistance.

Let  me  first  say  that MFA always makes  it  a  policy  to

evaluate  the programme's effectiveness and we will  continue

to  do  so.  Nevertheless, it is unlikely that we will change

the fundamental thrust of the Singapore Cooperation Programme

(SCP).   It is time-tested and has been proven right  by  the

feedback we get from its beneficiaries.  The basis of the SCP

has always been human resource development.  This is what was

asked  for by the beneficiaries and we will need to  continue

with that thrust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I answer some specific questions and comments

raised  by Mr Tay, allow me first to give a broad picture  of

the  SCP  and  its  achievements.   The  SCP  is  Singapore's

contribution to the international community for  the  benefit

of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1600</b></font><br><br>



developing   countries.    We   believe   in   sharing    our

developmental experience with developing countries,  just  as

Singapore  had  benefited from assistance from  international

organisations and developed countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its inception in 1992, the SCP has grown not only

quantitatively, but also qualitatively.  From a modest budget

of  S$8.1  million in 1993, it has doubled to S$17.8  million

last  year.   The  total number of participants  grew  nearly

three  times from 849 in 1993 to a projected 2,500  (and  not

1,200  as stated by Mr Simon Tay) this fiscal year.  To train

2,500  participants in one year is significant  for  a  small

country.   They are from 123 countries with the  majority  of

74.5%  coming  from Asia.  On 22nd November  last  year,  the

programme celebrated its 10,000th participant to the SCP.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also the Third Country Training Programme (TCTP)

with  other  partners in order to organise and  run  training

courses  jointly for developing countries.  This has  enabled

us  to stretch the SCP dollar to reach out to more developing

countries    and   tap   the   expertise   of   international

organisations and partner countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, Singapore has signed TCTP MOUs with 21

partners,  including the World Bank, IMF,  the  Commonwealth,

Colombo Plan, UNDP and WTO.  And we will sign an MOU with the

International  Atomic Energy Agency shortly and  negotiations

are also going on with the EU for another possible TCTP MOU.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual total cost of Singapore's technical

assistance to foreign countries is estimated to be more  than

$50  million.  This includes training provided under the  SCP

and those organised by other Ministries and their agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Simon Tay would be happy to know that yes, when

special circumstances arise, we do provide special responses.

Do not forget, during the financial crisis, our assistance to

the region included -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1601</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Humanitarian assistance comprising S$10 million of

rice and S$2 million of medical supplies that was provided to

Indonesia in three tranches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) 150 undergraduate scholarships to ASEAN countries,

including Indonesia, over a period of five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Increased technical assistance in financial

management   and  healthcare  training  to  assist   regional

countries  develop  sufficient  capacity  to  overcome  their

crisis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) We also incurred S$22.2 million for our

contributions to InterFET and UNTAET in East Timor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also said that our SCP programmes are labour-intensive and attach foreigners to our Government

departments.   That  is not true.  All our  SCP  courses  are

conducted   by   our  training  institutes   established   by

Government  Ministries or departments to  train  Singaporeans

and  foreigners.   And our SCP participants are  attached  to

such groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the examples of training agencies which we are

using  include the NUS and NTU for estate management courses,

urban  and  building  and  economic  development  programmes;

Polytechnics  for tourism and healthcare and  IT;   RELC  for

English  Language; the Singapore Aviation Academy  (SAA)  for

Civil  Aviation,  Search  and  Rescue  programmes;   PSB  for

productivity;   PSA,  or their training institute,  PSI,  for

port management; and EDB Consultancy and TDB Consultancy  for

investment and trade promotion programmes respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attachments of foreigners to Government departments are

arranged only during study visits.  But these are done at the

request  of  recipient countries.  Some 30 study  visits  are

arranged   as  opposed  to  over  200  training  courses   or

programmes per year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our SCP offers are different from other donor countries.

No strings are attached.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1602</b></font><br><br>



Recipients  are not expected to purchase Singapore  products.

Our objective is to share development experience and generate

goodwill.   No  one has misconstrued our objectives  so  far.

Instead,  many have praised Singapore's technical  assistance

programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback we received confirm that participants are happy

to  see  Singapore's  economic and social  developments  with

their  own  eyes.  This is better than flying out consultants

overseas as our experts cannot be away for too long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the question of learning from our experience

about policy reforms, as raised by Mr Simon Tay, our approach

is  to  show  developing  countries  how  correct  Government

policies   can   assist  countries  in  overcoming   economic

difficulties,  for  example,  our  recent  CPF   cuts,   wage

restraint, training and retraining.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses on reforms in civil service, good governance,

financial management, judicial reforms, productivity are  all

aimed  at  showing  right  policies  to  overcome  structural

problems.



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> May I seek

clarification from the Senior Parliamentary Secretary on  his

response  on  the  technical  and  developmental  assistance.

First  of  all,  on the attachments.  Clearly these  training

institutes,  as I understand them, are run by  the  statutory

boards  which he has named. I take it also that  his  comment

that  the experts cannot be away for long would mean that  we

are  on the same manpower.  Some of the institute people  are

also from the agencies that run the institutes.  Am I correct

on  that?   Secondly,  while I accept his  reassurance,  this

arrangement  means that most of the money we are spending  is

based in Singapore and most of the training happens here.  Am

I  correct on that?  Thirdly, I am gratified again  that  the

Ministry  is  willing  to consider the policy  again,  as  it

always  does.  May I ask the Senior Parliamentary  Secretary,

in   this  ongoing  review,  will  the  Ministry  take   into

consideration  the Minister's own remarks  that  there  is  a

newly recognised danger of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1603</b></font><br><br>



a   two-tier  ASEAN,  and  will,  in  this  sense,  this  new

recognition of a development since 1992 spurs us to do more?



<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed:</b> My Minister will answer the

last  question.  On the first two questions, since  they  are

ongoing  programmes  which  are  conducted  by  our  training

agencies, I do not think it is an extra imposition  on  them.

So  they  are  run concurrently with the existing  programmes

where Singaporeans also benefit from.  These participants who

are from overseas are also part of the training programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of money spent, if we go on the

principle that it is best held here, and as beneficiaries  of

these  programmes  themselves  request  that  they  come   to

Singapore  to  see how Singapore implements its developmental

programme,  they will have to come here.  When they  do  come

here.   ,  they  will  have to live  in  our  hotels  or  our

accommodation  and  the  training  programme  costs  will  be

expended here.  So I think it is only natural that it  should

be  done  that way and that in fact is also the way  done  by

many donor countries.



<br>2.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, when we want to prevent a two-tier ASEAN, the other ASEAN countries have to help these

newer  countries to integrate with the rest of ASEAN  and  in

this  regard, I should say that, firstly, we have  a  special

Indo-China  Assistance  Fund  under  our  Technical  Training

Programme specifically dedicated to the Indo-Chinese country.

And  secondly,  on  the figure that the Senior  Parliamentary

Secretary  mentioned that we train over 2,000  persons  every

year, more than half are for ASEAN countries.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ow Chin Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ow Chin Hock:</b> Sir, Dr Ong Chit Chung asked about

Foreign Service staff careers and training.  I thank him  for

his concern. I agree with him that MFA must have a fair share

of local talents.  Indeed, for Singapore to remain successful

in  carving out diplomatic space for itself in spite  of  its

small size, MFA must ensure that it has high quality and well-motivated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1604</b></font><br><br>



Foreign   Service   officers  through  a  comprehensive   and

integrated   recruitment,  training  and  career  development

programme and an attractive scheme of service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our recruitment, I must say, so far so good. Dr Ong may

be  pleased  to learn that in spite of the severe competition

from  the  private sector and other Government agencies,  MFA

has  so far been able to attract good quality officers to the

Foreign  Service. Currently, more than half  of  our  Foreign

Service  officers  have  at least a  Second  (Upper)  Honours

degree.   In addition, since 1996, 17 PSC scholars have  been

attracted to the Foreign Service. We also complement our pool

of   Foreign  Service  officers  with  talent  injection   of

Administrative  Officers and PSC scholars. At  the  Heads  of

Mission  level,  we  have  as  Ambassadors  people  who  have

distinguished  themselves in their  respective  careers,  for

example, Chan Heng Chee and Walter Woon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On terms and conditions, the foreign service is a

challenging but tough career.  The prestige and glamour of  a

diplomatic career is no longer an attraction or draw for  our

younger  Singaporeans as it used to be.  On the  other  hand,

the  disruption to family, in particular, to  the  career  of

their  spouses and their children's education is  becoming  a

disincentive.   MFA has put in place a good  training  scheme

and  package of overseas cost of living allowances and  other

allowances  to make MFA career more attractive.  However,  we

are   mindful  that  nowadays,  Singaporeans  who   like   to

experience  living  and  working overseas,  have  many  other

attractive  career  options,  in  both  private  and   public

sectors.  MFA would have to continuously review  and  improve

the  terms and conditions of its scheme of service to  ensure

that we continue to attract good quality officers to join the

Foreign Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ong raised two specific points: First, on language

training, let me say that MFA administers three main  schemes

to  encourage officers to acquire, maintain or upgrade  their

language skills. Firstly, officers who are going for overseas



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1605</b></font><br><br>



posting  where  the  language that is commonly  used  is  not

English, are given intensive training in that language before

they  assume duty. The training is conducted in the  form  of

part-time  class or tuition in Singapore at  the  country  of

posting  or  at  a  third  country.  Secondly,  officers  are

eligible  for language allowance if they attain  the  minimum

required  proficiency  level.   Thirdly,  part-time  language

courses  are  open to everyone in MFA. The  course  fees  are

fully reimbursed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question on the education of the children

of diplomats, under the Education Assistance Allowance (EAA),

officers with school-going children up to the age of  18  are

fully  reimbursed for tuition in an approved  school  in  the

country of posting. For officers stationed in countries where

the  educational  facilities are  inadequate  and  the  child

cannot  remain  in Singapore for his education,  the  officer

receives  the  EAA for the child to be educated  in  a  third

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their return to Singapore, MFA facilitates the

reintegration  of  these children into the  Singapore  school

system in close cooperation with the Ministry of Education.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, I want to thank

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head R of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, at the last National Day Rally,

mentioned that we should develop Singapore into a renaissance

city or a global arts city to provide the cultural ballast to

our  nation-building  efforts.   Artistic  creativity  is  an

important component of a knowledge-based economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our local arts scene has made good progress and

strides  in the last ten years or so. Credit must go  to  the

National  Arts  Council whose activities and programmes  have

helped  nurture  a  more  vibrant arts  scene  in  Singapore.

However, what has been achieved to-date is not enough to make

Singapore  a renaissance city.  We still have a long  way  to

go.   Our  arts  and cultural scene would  have  to  grow  to

support this vision of a renaissance city.  Singaporeans need

to  be  nurtured  to appreciate the arts and greater  efforts

need  to  be  made to attract, develop and support  both  our

local  and foreign arts talents. Local artists and  the  arts

community  should be rendered further assistance.  They  need

to  win  the  support and patronage of Singaporean audiences,

whose willingness to spend on the arts or on the various arts

forms will influence their progress and development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am disappointed with the grant given to the

National  Arts Council in the proposed budget.  The NAC  this

year  will  receive  some  $20 million  in  grant,  a  slight

increase  of  $3 million from the $17 million allocated  last

year  or  the  current financial year.  In  the  budget,  the

development grant comes to $620,000 and this is peanuts.  How

can we develop a renaissance city with this money?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this budget, our spending on the arts in the

budgeted year works out to only about $7 per capita per year.

In contrast, the budget allocated for the promotion of sports

comes  up  to  some  $80  million,  $40  million  on  current

expenditure   and   another  $40   million   on   development

expenditure.  Our funding for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1607</b></font><br><br>



sports  works out  to about $25 per capita per year.  We  are

not according the same priority to arts that we do to sports.

To  realise our dream for Singapore to be a renaissance city,

the  Government must commit more funds to promote  the  arts.

There should be a total plan to develop and promote the  arts

scene.  The current grant of $20 million allocated to NAC  is

grossly  inadequate.  Our per capita funding for the arts  of

$7  per  year is very low compared to cities like Hong  Kong,

where  the spending is $24 per capita per year; London,  $108

per  capita  per year, and even in the state of  Victoria  in

Australia,  the  arts spending comes to $15  per  capita  per

year.   So we have a long way to go to be a global arts  city

and more needs to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that MITA has embarked on a major study to

develop a total plan to make Singapore a renaissance city.  I

would  therefore like to ask the Minister if he is  ready  to

tell   the  House  his  Ministry's  plans  and  whether   the

Government  would  commit more financial resources,  and  how

much,  and  over what time-frame.  Unless we commit  as  much

resources  and  priority to arts as we do to sports,  we  can

never be successful in making Singapore a renaissance city.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, our Prime Minister

revealed  in  his  National Day Rally  speech  that  MITA  is

developing  a vision for Singapore to be a renaissance  city.

It  has  created  some excitement among people  in  the  arts

community and Singaporeans at large.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have come a long way. MITA has been proactive

in  the  arts  scene.  I am aware that both the Minister  and

MITA  officials  have  been  very encouraging  towards  local

artists.    The  National  Arts  Council  has   been   making

milestones  in  initiating  new  projects  and  strengthening

existing  programmes.  I am happy to see in  the  latest  NAC

magazine,  a message from their Executive Director where  his

appeal  to the arts community is "To work with us". He called

for a linkage of minds and efforts between the arts community

and the NAC.  His call is a win-win



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1608</b></font><br><br>



approach as both are dependent on each other and have to work

together if we are to make Singapore an arts hub.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must do more if we are to become a cultured and

cultural society.  All involved must do more if Singapore  is

to  become an international arts hub.  My wish list  for  the

arts  scene are many. Some of these are that we must  further

develop  local talent by enhancing training and  giving  them

more scholarships.  They must be given more opportunities  to

perform so that they can become professionals.  We must  also

help create more audience locally by educating the public  on

the  arts  as the key to the survival of our arts groups  and

artists are occupied seats, and not empty seats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also got to encourage and give incentives for

our local productions to be created and marketed both locally

and  overseas.   We  have  also got  to  increase  Government

financial support to our arts groups and individual  artists,

and I share the concern of my GPC Chairman, when he said that

the  funding  for  NAC is way, way below as compared  to  our

regional neighbours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also continue to build more performance arenas

and make it affordable for arts groups.  We have also equally

got  to  ensure  that  foreign talent  and  arts  performance

companies  set  up office here and would hold shows  here  so

that  they  not  only serve the local market,  but  also  the

regional  and international markets.  In this, I  would  also

urge   MITA  to  see  how  we  can  initiate  and  hold  more

international  arts events here to attract  both  locals  and

tourists  alike. I would also like to ask MITA how  they  are

working  with other Ministries, like the Ministry of  Finance

and  the EDB, to offer tax and other financial incentives and

grants to attract businessmen to pursue opportunities in  the

arts field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am confident that many Singaporeans share the

same  ambition  of  making Singapore  an  international  arts

centre  and  are  behind the Government  to  ensure  that  we

succeed. I would also like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1609</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister  to  share with us what  are  MITA's  plans  to

realise our vision of making Singapore a renaissance city.



<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, like the two

Members before me, I am rising to plead for more funding  for

the arts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alluding also to the Prime Minister's National Day Rally

speech  last August, we were most excited to hear that  there

was  a  promise for more funding to be going to the arts  and

that  unfortunately does not seem to have been translated  in

this  year's  budget.   It sounds good  in  terms  of  a  14%

increase  for the NAC's budget because the base is so  small.

In absolute terms, as Mr Chew has noted, at $20 million worth

of  funding for all of the arts programmes that we have under

the  NAC banner, I do not know how much you can achieve  with

that.  I also noted that when you look at the audience reach,

in the workload and in productivity indicators, you will find

that  the  reach in fact seems to be shrinking. For the  arts

programmes, we have about 277,000 audience reached  the  year

before  and  it is estimated to drop to 210,000  for  FY2000.

The  arts  education programmes and the outreach  programmes,

both  in  terms  of activities and outreach, seem  to  remain

static.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we have this comprehensive plan that MITA is

putting  together to turn Singapore into a renaissance  city,

and  if  that plan could be very quickly forthcoming, perhaps

we might be more successful in getting more resources for the

arts.



<br>2.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I take

my two cuts together?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, before I begin, may I

say  that I strongly agree with MPs before me on the need for

much more funding for arts activities.  Trebling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1610</b></font><br><br>



of the amount would be just about right, I should think.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, I received a very informative file

containing the programmes for the Singapore Arts Festival  in

June this year.  In it, I see a fascinating programme and the

organisers are to be  congratulated for it.  There are  shows

from  the  four  corners  of the  world  for  the  people  of

Singapore and visitors to enjoy, and it is indicative of  the

most  vibrant  cultural  scene in Singapore.   My  subsequent

comments should therefore be taken in this context.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the arts and culture scene to be ever

improving in Singapore and all that I would like to  do  here

is  to  contribute, if I can, to making it a  little  better.

While I admire the programme for our arts festival in June, I

am  slightly  disappointed to see that we do not invite  more

participation from our ASEAN neighbours.  There are only  two

items on the June programme from our ASEAN neighbours.   Now,

ASEAN  with 10 countries must be said to be one of  the  most

culturally  diverse areas in the world.  Some countries  like

ours   may  indeed  have  several  different  cultures,   all

exhibiting  different costumes, musical instruments,  dances,

songs.  If we add on the different artistic styles that  they

have, we have enough, I believe, for several arts festivals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that Singapore, as with other ASEAN countries,

has  a  national  ASEAN COCI secretariat.   And  one  of  the

objectives of this secretariat, I believe, is to preserve and

revitalise  ASEAN  cultures.   I  hope  that  ASEAN  COCI  in

Singapore  can  come  up with a flagship project  that  would

highlight ASEAN cultures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this brings me to my suggestion: can we not consider

in  Singapore  a permanent cultural centre devoted  to  ASEAN

cultures?   Such a cultural centre can be, to use the  phrase

of  the  times,  a  one-stop centre  -  a  museum  for  ASEAN

cultures  to  be  part  of  our  Asian  civilizations  museum

network,  a  theatre for performances by  ASEAN  artistes,  a

concert  hall  for musicians and so on.  Singaporeans,  young

and old, as well as visitors to our island, can enjoy the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1611</b></font><br><br>



vibrancy  of  ASEAN cultures in Singapore.  I am looking,  of

course, not at the centre only as a tourist attraction.  I am

hoping  that  it can be a well funded centre that  will  help

also  in  documenting and encouraging scholarly  research  on

ASEAN cultures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can such a centre hope to achieve? First of all,

the  centre's  activities will be to  educate  and  entertain

Singaporeans and visitors.  We have heard much about the lack

of understanding among Singaporeans for our ASEAN neighbours.

Unfairly or fairly, we are said to be xenophobic and tend  to

be  a  bit  smug towards our neighbours.  I believe a  centre

like  this would have great advantages.  It would be  a  good

learning experience for Singaporeans.  It would also  send  a

signal  to  our  ASEAN neighbours that we are  interested  in

learning about their cultures.  In so doing, we also increase

the  understanding  of  our people,  making  people-to-people

contacts  among  ASEAN countries much more pleasant  and,  of

course,  even  business  people may  find  understanding  our

neighbours in the region a bit easier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, such a centre can serve as a resource centre for

ASEAN  cultures,   promoting  the  idea  of  Singapore  as  a

cultural  hub for the ASEAN region.  Of course,  my  wish  is

that  all  other ASEAN neighbours will, in due course,  build

similar  centres, so that we can all be networked  to  become

one.   But  until  that  time  comes,  we  can  endeavour  to

establish  ourselves as a strong resource  centre  for  ASEAN

cultures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, and finally, we might want to regard the centre

as  a public statement of the commitment of Singapore to  the

ASEAN region, ie, our ASEAN peoples living together in a zone

of  peace, neutrality and harmony.  I hope that the  Ministry

will consider such a centre.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I have

read an article in which the author wrote about his stay with

his  friend in the countryside.  His friend was a blind  man.

During his stay there, every morning, he and his friend would

take a walk at the woods nearby.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1612</b></font><br><br>



One  day  when  he came back from the walk, his friend  asked

him,  "Did  you  have any new discovery in the woods  today?"

The  author  replied, "No.  Isn't everything  the  same  here

every  day?"   His  blind friend was very  surprised  by  his

reply.   He said, "How could it be?  Did you not notice  that

yesterday's  flower buds are in full bloom today?   The  wild

strawberries  are giving out the fragrance  of  ripeness.   I

think  they must have ripened."  The author was shocked  when

he  heard what his friend had said.  His blind friend  seemed

to  have  seen more than he did.  Although they  had  a  walk

together, the effect was quite different.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, the principle is very simple. Very often, we

look  but see not what is around us.  Our sensibility is  not

as  acute as the blind man.  We have eyes, but we do not  pay

attention  to  what we see.  We can only feel that  there  is

pressure  from  our work and we have forgotten  the  pleasure

that we can derive from mother nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should spend more time to promote more cultural

activities  to  widen  our scope and  to  let  us  enjoy  the

pleasure  in life.  Let the melodies and musical  notes  open

the  eyes  in  our  soul, so that we can really  enjoy  life.

Cultural activities will not only make us relax but also give

us a better harmony and balance in our life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that when I was young, I watched a lot of

shows put up by the children's drama groups, eg, a musical by

the  name  of "Tiny Screwdriver" left an indelible impression

on  me,  and  I learned about our traditional values  through

these performances.  Therefore, now that we have done well in

our  economic development, we should spend more resources  to

popularise cultural activities among our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, there has been a breakthrough in the

promotion  of culture and arts in Singapore.  The  Government

has  already  made  great efforts to  build  up  a  "cultural

garden".   We  are no longer a cultural desert.   However,  I

hope  that  on this basis, the Government should finance  and

support  our  cultural organisations  so  that  they  can  do

better.  I also hope that the National Arts Council and  MITA

would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1613</b></font><br><br>



bring  arts  and  culture to our working place  so  that  our

workers   will  have  the  chance  to  enjoy  some   artistic

performances.   The NTUC spends about $80,000 every  year  to

sponsor some 20 cultural activities for our workers, but that

is  not  enough.  I hope that the NAC and MITA would consider

encouraging  and financing more arts groups  to  bring  their

activities  to reach out to the workers.  Perhaps  we  should

also  give  discounts  on concert admission  tickets  to  our

workers,  like what we do to our SAF personnel, so  that  our

workers  would have more opportunities to enjoy  the  various

cultural performances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope that when these cultural bodies are putting

up  their  performances, they could  perhaps  set  aside  one

special  show for the workers.  I also hope that our cultural

organisations  would consider putting up some  not  so  heavy

performances for our workers to appreciate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, we are fortunate that many of our

arts  groups  are  given help in many ways by  MITA  and,  in

particular,  the  National  Arts  Council.   The   two   main

complaints  of  local  arts groups were  that  they  did  not

receive  financial  assistance and that the  cost  of  having

their own building premises was too high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first problem has been partly alleviated by

both  Government and the private sector joining hands to help

them.  It shows that many of our arts groups have gone on  to

bigger productions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second common complaint by our arts groups has been

that  they do not have their own buildings.  A home  is  very

critical  for arts groups.  It helps them keep their  members

and  audiences,  and creates a bond between  them.   It  will

certainly  remove  any  uncertainty, particularly  among  new

members  joining these groups, where it will be in  the  long

run.   It  also  gives  them a certain sense  of  permanence.

Here,  the National Arts Council has helped through the  Arts

Housing  Scheme.   Through the scheme,  one  gets  space  for

training,  practise peformance, administration  and  storage.

The NAC identifies suitable Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1614</b></font><br><br>



buildings  and convert these spaces to house arts groups  and

organisations at subsidised rental.  I understand that as  at

end  1998, the NAC had managed 17 buildings and 10  units  of

shophouses, housing 49 arts organisations, 26 visual artistes

and  two arts institutions, including NAFA and LaSalle  under

the Arts Housing Scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I would like to ask the Minister is: have we

done  enough?  I would like to ask the Minister  whether  his

Ministry could do more.  An innovative scheme was thought  of

when  some  of  the arts groups were co-located  in  two  new

community centres, namely, Marine Parade and Ulu Pandan  CCs.

Can  we  also work out a scheme whereby all arts  groups  who

wish to be co-located at an existing community club or a  new

community  club  can  register  themselves  either  with  the

People's  Association or with the National Arts Council?   Is

there  such a coordination already in place?  If not, can  we

establish such a form of coordination so that arts groups can

let know their intention that they are looking for a place?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to ask how can MITA facilitate

and  encourage  even  the private sector  to  co-locate  arts

groups within their buildings.  Here, Creative Technology has

shown  a  fine  example by offering $2 million  and  offering

12,000 sq ft of space at its headquarters building to be used

for  multi-cultural theatre training.  We must find new  ways

for  our  arts  groups to be housed not only  in  old  vacant

buildings  but  in new buildings as well.  Grants  should  be

given  to such groups who are prepared to co-locate in  these

new  buildings,  be they from the Government or  the  private

sector.  For the private sector, perhaps incentives could  be

given   whereby  selective  property  tax  and  other  monies

expended  for  the arts groups' housing should be  considered

for  tax  deductions to further promote this idea of  housing

the  arts groups.  Would the Minister share with us the steps

taken  by  the  Ministry to provide housing  for  local  arts

groups?



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

today, we are debating the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1615</b></font><br><br>



allocation for the Ministry of Information and the Arts,  but

everybody is talking about money.  So "Money Not Enough"   is

not  just a problem for the lower income group, it is also  a

problem for our arts groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Chairman of the GPC. The Government is

giving more money for sports but certainly not enough for the

arts.   Our  Minister for Education said  that  we  want  our

students  to  be thinking, and able to appreciate  the  arts.

But  with  all this emphasis on sports and so little  on  the

arts,  our  students may grow up to be physically strong  but

mentally  simple.   I  think the most  practical  way  is  to

practise  what  we  have preached.  Creative  Technology  has

donated  $2  million  for the promotion  of  arts.  It  is  a

laudable deed.  The Government should take the lead and  give

more  money to MITA.  Then it will inspire the private sector

to  follow  suit.   Sim Wong Hoo's gesture  is  a  very  good

example.  The media has given it good coverage.  He is giving

back  to  society  what  he  has  benefited  from  it.    The

successful entrepreneurs should also do the same.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, MITA presented commendation awards to

entrepreneurs who donated $50,000 or more to  the  arts.   If

you  have only donated $49,999 it is not good enough.  It  is

only  if  you  have donated $50,000 or more,  then  you  will

receive  an  award.  From this year onwards, so long  as  you

donate  more  than $10,000 you will receive  a  commendation.

There are many successful businessmen in Singapore. Let  them

donate whatever amount they so wish to donate.  Even if it is

a few thousand dollars, we should also commend them for that.

I hope MITA will seriously look into this matter and give the

arts groups the support they deserve.



<br>2.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from recognising the sponsors, we should also

recognise the performing artistes. They sacrifice their  time

and  energy  and  even money to present  their  arts  to  the

people.   For  most art bodies, we have not  given  them  due

recognition.  So in order to encourage more performing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1616</b></font><br><br>



groups  and artistes, we should give them more space so  that

they can perform in better facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the Istana is open to the public a few

times  in a year and a great number of members of the  public

have  been visiting it.  But on every occasion, we  saw  just

school  or  military bands playing music.   Why  can  we  not

invite  more local artistes to perform there?  In  fact,  our

performing groups should be very happy to be given the honour

to  perform at the Istana.  Every year, we have this National

Day Rally and every year we have just an orchestra performing

a few pieces of music there.  Why  can we not also invite the

local artistes to perform there?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on this cut, I would like to talk about money too.

Cable  TV  has reached almost all the families in  Singapore.

We  can now tune in to a lot of channels.  When any important

event   is  happening,  we can switch  from  one  channel  to

another channel to follow the coverage.  For example, at  the

Countdown  to the New Millennium, our Singapore  viewers  had

the  chance  to  view the various events taking  place  in  a

number  of countries in the world. Now our audience  can  say

the  programme in one country is more exciting than  that  in

another country.  The audience can  turn from one  channel to

another  channel at ease.  According to a survey,  viewership

for TCS programmes is declining, not significantly, but there

is some slight decline in viewership.  Our audience has now a

greater variety of programmes to choose from.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past one or two years, TCS has spent a lot of

money  on recreational programmes,  but there is still a  lot

of room for improvement in its current affairs programmes.  I

think we should do better in this aspect.  In current affairs

and  arts, our programmes are still lagging behind the  other

countries.  So, the opening of Cable TV is a good thing.   It

brings   competition.  The question is whether the Government

would  allot  more money to TCS to enable  it   to  send  our

journalists to other countries to make more detailed reports,

as it is done by the TV stations in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1617</b></font><br><br>



the  other  countries.  Otherwise, we will be lagging  behind

the others.

understand  that  the  main  local  television  channels  are

operated   by   subsidiary  companies  under  the   Singapore

International  Media  Private  Limited,  a  Government-linked

company.   Other foreign channels are relayed to the  channel

under  Singapore Cable Vision.  The TV media  here  are  thus

almost monopolised by either the Government-linked company or

SCV.   Is  this  situation desirable?  And does  it  not  run

counter to the principle of market economy?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the sitting of Parliament on 21st March 1995,

MITA's  Parliamentary Secretary said that the Government  has

to  be  certain that it will be economically viable before  a

licence  is given to another commercial TV station.  He  also

said that the SBA will monitor the industry to determine when

the  market should be liberalised.   I would like to ask  the

Minister  whether  the time is ripe now to allow  another  TV

station to be set up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of foreign TV station programmes, currently

it  has  to  be carried by SCV's cable.  Would the Government

consider  allowing foreign broadcasting stations to broadcast

directly into households?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, the new millennium saw our

MediaCorp  group  restructuring its various  TV  Channels  to

achieve  a new look, a new image and to meet the competition.

This is a laudable move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TV12 has restructured its existing channels (Prime and

Premiere)  to  a fully Malay Channel (Suria)  and  one  niche

channel concentrating on children and arts programmes as well

as   Indian  programmes  (Central).   Sports  programmes   on

Premiere  have  now moved to a new channel called  SportsCity

under  TCS.  Channel NewsAsia, which recently celebrated  its

first anniversary,  is now expected to go regional before the

end of this year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1618</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the increased segmentation and specialised focus of

the  various  channels  allow  them  to  cater  to  different

interest groups, reflecting our multi-racial society and  the

differing  needs  of different age groups. MediaCorp  has  no

choice.   Unless  it constantly changes and  moves  with  the

times, it will lose out to SCV and other foreign TV channels.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, restructuring is one thing. Equally, if not more

important,  is  the  need  to recruit,  motivate  and  retain

talents  within the MediaCorp Group.  On this  aspect,  I  am

concerned whether MediaCorp is ready to compete on  an  equal

footing with the foreign broadcast media.  In the last  year,

we  have  seen the departure of several big name broadcasters

and  artistes like Christine Tan, Darryl David, James Lye and

the impending departure of Lynette Tye from Channel NewsAsia.

And  recently, we read about the resignation of  TCS'  former

CEO, Lee Cheok Yew.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to be effective, competitive and relevant,

I  would like to suggest that the current HR policies  within

the  MediaCorp group be reviewed.  This is in order  that  we

can  ensure that with all the best laid plans such as Channel

NewsAsia's  intention to go regional, we  would  be  able  to

continually  attract and retain the best talents  to  achieve

this goal.



.     Sir, for MediaCorp to succeed in the long term, it  has

to  quickly address its manpower problem.  Unless it is  able

to recruit, motivate and retain talents in the group, it will

lose  out.   I would therefore like to ask the Minister  what

plans  MediaCorp  has  to  meet  its  challenges  ahead,   in

particular, its HR policies to attract, motivate  and  retain

talents in the group.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, 30th January 2000 saw the relaunch of

two  existing channels and the introduction of a new channel,

namely,  Suria, Central and SportsCity.  Last year,  we  also

saw  the  launch of Channel NewsAsia. These are new and  bold

initiatives  of TCS and the Media Corporation  of  Singapore.

First, let me deal with the topic of Channel NewsAsia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am impressed with the quality of Channel NewsAsia

programmes in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1619</b></font><br><br>



reporting.   It has certainly kept many Singaporeans  updated

on  local  and  international developments,  particularly  on

regional  developments.  Sir, my only complaint is, how  long

are  they going to keep their broadcast on Channel 5?  In the

mornings  between 6 am and 9 am, it gets boring to watch  the

same news being repeated on Channel NewsAsia between 6 am and

9  am.  One cannot get away from them if we switch to Channel

5.   While  I  understand the original rationale   that  some

Singaporean  homes could not access CNN, it has continued  to

slot  on  Channel 5 for far too long.  I long for a breakfast

programme  like AM Singapore on Channel 5, and I  also  think

there  could  be  better use of broadcast in the  morning  on

Channel 5.  I hope this could be looked into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the new Channel, which is Central.

There  are three slots here.  The first slot belongs to  Arts

Central.  I get good reviews on Arts Central because  it  has

got a good programme mix and is well received by arts lovers.

In  trying to meet the needs of three segments, MCS has  tied

its hand with strict time slots.  Arts Central was originally

scheduled  from  9.30 pm  to 1 am.  It  was  tough  for  arts

lovers  which  include students too.  Many  of  them  carried

heavy  eye bags under their eyes.  Sir, I am happy  that  the

time  slots  have been brought earlier to 9  pm.  What  I  am

worrying  is  that instead of restricting arts programmes  to

between 9 pm and 1 am, is it possible that some of these arts

programmes  be  shown  on earlier time slots  when  there  is

broadcast time, and even shifted to SportsCity whenever there

are no sports programmes being shown on SportsCity?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move to Vasantham Central, which caters to

Indian audience.  Sir, originally the time slot was from 7 pm

to  9.30  pm, and now it has become from 6.30 pm to 9  pm  on

weekdays.  The quality of the programmes has improved and  it

is  heartening  to see more local productions and  children's

programmes.  Sir, the feedback I receive is the concern  over

the  allotment  of  time for Tamil and non-Tamil  programmes.

There  is  a  fear that slowly more non-Tamil programmes  are

coming



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1620</b></font><br><br>



into  Vasantham Central.  Perhaps the Minister can allay  the

fear  by  explaining what is the proportion of time  that  is

allocated  for Tamil and non-Tamil programmes.   Perhaps  the

Minister could also disclose the viewership numbers for these

two types of programmes.  If there is indeed a programme from

the  non-Indians  for movies like Hindi  movies  and  dramas,

would the Minister consider removing this slot to Suria where

at  present  there is no broadcast before 5 pm  on  weekdays?

Two groups of audience can enjoy these programmes if they are

put on other channels provided a dual sound broadcast is also

provided.   Two groups of people can also enjoy on these time

slots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to Kids Central. Sir, I think it

has  got a good programming slot and meets the needs  of  our

kids,  whether they are from the morning or afternoon  school

sessions.  What  I  hope  to  see is  more  local  children's

productions and live broadcast of children's events from  our

schools on large scale community events.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, let me move on to SportsCity. It has

clearly  satisfied  the needs of many ardent  sports  lovers.

Many  of us who are sports lovers are happy to see more local

events  on  competition being broadcast live  on  television,

like  the  S-League games.  I certainly hope that more  local

events  can  be  shown  more  regularly  on  SportsCity,   if

possible, live on TV.  This will certainly raise the  profile

of  our  local sportsmen and motivate many others to take  up

sports seriously.   Perhaps the Minister can tell us how  the

Ministry  intends  to ensure a substantial  number  of  local

sports programme content and what is the future direction for

SportsCity.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, the Programme Advisory

Committee  (PAC) has once again completed its review  of  our

local  TV  programmes and released its  report  recently.   I

agree  with  most of its recommendations and  I  applaud  the

Committee for its efforts.  In particular, I agree  with  its

recommendations  that  our  locally  produced  TV  programmes

should  reflect  more of our multi-racial representation  and

that imported TV programmes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1621</b></font><br><br>



should  not  be biased towards American-produced  programmes.

Instead   we   should  source  more  programmes  from   other

countries,  so  that  our  citizens  would  not   be   unduly

influenced by any one culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am, however, not entirely convinced by the PAC's

recommendation that there appears too much violent content as

well  as  the promotion of negative values on prime time  TV.

The  report  cited prime time programmes such  as  Buffy  the

Vampire Slayer and Charm amongst others.  Many young people I

spoke  to disagree with the PAC.  They enjoy programmes  like

Charm  and  Buffy the Vampire Slayer for their  entertainment

value.   Frankly, I believe that Singaporeans today are  more

cosmopolitan  and are more mature to handle  and  distinguish

between entertainment and real life.  Indeed, a quick channel

check of Channel 8 shows that many programmes on Channel 8 as

well   involve  horror,  ghosts,  gangsterism  and  violence,

although  they are so called Asian content programmes.   They

too have good entertainment values.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, TCS has a difficult task. It has to stay

commercially viable, as well as relevant to our own  citizens

who have increasing access to alternative channels or mediums

for  entertainment including the Internet and cable TV.   TCS

also  has a critical role to serve in national education  and

information.   I would like to suggest that we  should  grant

them  as  much flexibility in their choice of programming  as

possible  so  that  they  can  continue  to  be  relevant  to

Singapore  and to Singaporeans as a whole.  They  would  then

continue to be an effective medium for national interests  as

well.   I  therefore would like to ask the  Minister  if  his

Ministry  agrees  with  the  PAC's recommendations  and  what

follow-up actions will the Ministry take as a result  of  the

recommendations.



<br>2.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in the past few

years,  there has been remarkable improvement in the standard

of Chinese programmes produced by TCS.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1622</b></font><br><br>



Many  TV  programmes have won not only the praises  from  the

audience but many international awards as well.  This is very

heartening indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our media are different from other countries because

they have to take into consideration the multi-racial, multi-lingual  and  multi-cultural characteristics of our  society,

apart  from  keeping  a high sense of social  responsibility.

Under  such  constraints, TCS is still able to  maintain  its

credibility  by not simply lowering its taste to  please  the

public,   and  has  even  managed  to  produce  some  quality

programmes.  This is indeed very remarkable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, apart from producing a number of TV serials with

local  flavour such as Stepping Out, they also produced  some

very good current affairs and informative programmes, such as

Cultural  Escapades,  Asia  - A  New  Horizon,  The  Forensic

Detectives, Tuesday Features, Focus, etc.  They are very good

and  have received good comments from the audience.  They are

informative and interesting, commanding very high viewership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mr Seng Han Thong has said, there are a lot of

channels and a lot of programmes available to the viewers.  I

hope that TCS could reinforce our current affairs section, so

that  they  will  be  able to produce more excellent  Chinese

informative programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for recreational programmes, I feel that so long as

MITA  can  give  TCS  more  flexibility  to  purchase  better

programmes  from  other countries, that is enough.   But  for

current affairs, they must have high credibility.  They  have

to  take into consideration our neutral position.  We have to

put  in  more  money and more human resources to improve  the

quality and quantity of our current affairs programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the locally-produced Chinese programmes, there is

another  aspect  that we should pay particular attention  to,

that is, the children's programmes.  I am glad to notice that

in  recent years, TCS has also attained some breakthrough  in

the children's programmes. For example,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1623</b></font><br><br>



there  are a number of very good children's programmes  which

are  very  popular.   My children are faithful  followers  of

these  programmes.  TCS should produce more  such  programmes

that   are   educational  and  appealing  to  the   children.

Hopefully,  they  will  pull the  children  away  from  over-indulgence in computer games.



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister to

find ways to increase the time allocated to the broadcast  of

parliamentary debates.  I do so because, first, Parliament is

a  key  institution in debating the important issues  of  the

day.  Second, many MPs, including PAP backbenchers, make good

speeches  and  deserve to be heard and they play  a  role  in

raising important questions and suggestions.  And thirdly, in

the making and understanding of public policy and law, it  is

important  not only to know the final results  but  also  the

discussion,  and even what has not been fully accepted.   The

present coverage gives too little time for this.  All we  get

are  the answers.  It is like watching a football match  with

just the goals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a Straits Times' journalist pondered whether

10  days were necessary for this Budget debate.  I believe it

is.  And as we all know, we move at a very brisk pace to keep

it to 10 days.  Many other parliaments take much longer.  But

I  cannot  help but consider whether the public  understands.

Can  they understand why we take a whole day or afternoon for

a  sitting, when all they get is 15 minutes of the compressed

answers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister to consider more air time. It

should  not be live; it should be edited down.  But it should

be  substantial enough to capture the exchanges, the mood and

the discussions.  Of course, this may be a minority interest.

But  it  is an important minority of open and active citizens

concerned  about  public  issues.  The  means  for  this  can

differ.   We  now  have  a  full time news  channel,  Channel

NewsAsia,   with  a  one-hour  news.   There  is   increasing

penetration  of  cable  and this gives  many  more  channels.

There  is  also  now web-casting of what could  otherwise  be

televised.   Parliament is a public forum and we  should  use

these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1624</b></font><br><br>



means  to  let  the  public see and understand  more  of  our

proceedings.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, Channel

NewsAsia, following its launch last year, has proved to be  a

successful  station.  It is now known as the news channel  of

quality and fair reporting, presenting not just a Singaporean

viewpoint but also an Asian viewpoint.  The coverage of major

events  is  timely  and  balanced.  The  success  of  Channel

NewsAsia  has strengthened Singapore's position  as  a  media

hub.  I congratulate the management and staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I would like to make a suggestion

concerning the one-hour news broadcast which, to many,  seems

a  bit  too long.  For most of us, we are interested  in  the

news  itself  and  not so much the analyses and  discussions.

Perhaps MITA can advise Channel NewsAsia to reformat the one-hour  news to a half-an-hour news, followed by a second  half

hour devoted to more in-depth discussions and analyses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Channel NewsAsia plans to launch the Asia service by

satellite  later this year.  Many of our business  community,

especially those who travel often, will welcome this service.

But  the  question is: why limit the broadcast to Asia?   Why

not  extend this service to the other countries?  In view  of

Channel  NewsAsia's  success, is there any  plan  to  have  a

similar  broadcast  also in Chinese?   Many  of  the  Chinese

business  community who are unable to understand English  are

currently unable to enjoy the benefits of this news  channel.

In the meantime, perhaps some Chinese subtitles could be used

to help the Chinese-speaking community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I go on to the next amendment, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin:</b> Thank you. Sir, over the years, TCS has

produced  many artistes; however, a substantial  number  have

left.   When  they left TCS, I believe they left the  station

but  not  their acting career.  But, unfortunately, our  film

industry is still



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1625</b></font><br><br>



small.  Ex-TCS artistes have to take up other jobs to earn  a

living.  This is a waste of good acting talent, especially in

the context of our limited manpower and talent pool.  We have

today  a  substantial  pool of acting talent  and  supporting

technicians  to support a film industry.  We  have  also  the

financial resources to develop Singapore as a film centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Film Commission was formed in 1998 in

response to the rapidly growing local film industry.  Some of

our  local  productions have been well received  locally  and

overseas.   The Commission helps to facilitate 12 productions

in the past years through grants.  The first locally produced

3-D  animation, Rex-2000, The Young Heroes, has high  quality

animation  and  an interesting story line.  We therefore  now

have the capability and the capacity to develop Singapore  as

a 3-D animation centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, film making is an expensive business, but it is a

high value-added industry.  MITA should work closely with EDB

to provide attractive grants and incentives to encourage more

local   productions.   Co-productions  could  be  encouraged,

especially co-production between local and overseas parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting permission to make a movie is still a very

tedious   process   in   our   regulated   Singapore.    Many

applications  have  to be filled and submitted  to  different

Government departments.  Would MITA consider setting up a one-stop  service  centre  where movie  production  houses  could

submit  all the relevant applications for permits, and  MITA,

with its efficient staff, help to get fast clearance with the

other relevant agencies?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ravindran:</b> Sir, the Singapore film industry is

making  a  comeback.  A number of production houses and  film

makers  have increased manifold.  With the recent success  of

films like Money No Enough, Liang Po Po, That One Not Enough,

more  companies  and  individuals are  looking  at  the  film

industry  seriously.  It will certainly encourage  more  film

makers to consider making films here.  The annual Film



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1626</b></font><br><br>



Festival has gone from strength to strength, and it has grown

to  bigger  shows.  It clearly shows that the  film  industry

enjoys good support from the local audience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am concerned whether we have enough talent to

make  film making a thriving and viable industry in Singapore

in  the  long  run.   Are we producing the necessary  actors,

directors, production technicians, sound engineers and  other

support  staff?  If not, are we liberal in admitting  foreign

talent to supplement these talents?  Are the right incentives

and  tax benefits in place for entrepreneurs to consider film

making as a business venture?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to ask whether enough is being done to

bring  foreign production houses into Singapore.  Is the  EDB

actively working with MITA on this score?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, the Singapore Film Commission was set up

in  1998 under the National Arts Council.  Its mission is  to

nurture,  support  and  promote Singapore's  talent  in  film

making, production of Singapore's films and the film industry

in  Singapore.  I would like the Minister to explain  to  the

House  as to how the Singapore Film Commission has gone about

fulfilling  its  mission  to-date.   I  also  would  ask  the

Minister to share with us his Ministry's programmes and plans

for  the film industry in Singapore and answers to the  above

matters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, in view of the greater

liberalisation of the news media and its impact on our  local

print media, I have a few concerns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are aware that our local print media, ie, our

newspapers,  are driven by commercial interests as  they  are

owned  by a publicly listed company.  In view of the scarcity

of  resources in a small country like Singapore,  it  appears

that, with increasing regionalisation and global competition,

it  is  inevitable that our local print media  will  have  to

promote  entertainment and more coverage of populist  stories

in its newspapers in order to sustain readership.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1627</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my concern stems from the fact that as the industry

consolidates and we open up to the world, our local media may

be  tempted  to  neglect its nation-building role.   If  they

continue  to play that role, will they succeed or be  dwarfed

by the major competition from the big boys?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also true that if they are perceived to be mere

mouthpieces  channelling  official press  releases  from  the

Government,  they  would  suffer a credibility  gap  and  our

citizens  would  simply  shift to  more  accessible  Internet

channels  or  other cable stations for their news.   I  would

like  to ask the Minister if there are indeed plans to ensure

that our local print media, ie, our newspapers, will continue

to  remain  relevant and to play an effective nation-building

role.   Or  are  there other viable alternatives  should  our

local  newspapers embark on pure commercialisation, in  order

to remain competitive in the future?  Should we, for example,

encourage  the  formation  of  a  second  newspaper  company?

Perhaps  the  Minister  could  enlighten  the  House  on  the

Ministry's  stand  on this, since he has taken  over  as  the

Minister for Information and the Arts for some months now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I just inform Members that we are

falling behind schedule on this amendment.  Mr Chew,  do  you

want to continue?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, the National Library Board

embarked on a major project to open a library at the Ngee Ann

City,  Orchard Road, in October last year, and  that  Library

targets  young adults or the yuppy crowd.  I understand  that

the  Library there is very popular now and that the  National

Library Board will continue to try out new strategies to make

our library services useful and accessible to all age groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the proposed Budget, some $86 million is

allocated  for current expenditure and another  $101  million

for  development  expenditure under  the  Library  programme.

Development expenditure shows a five-time increase  over  the

estimated   development  expenditure  for  the  current   FY.

Presumably,  a large portion of this development  expenditure

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1628</b></font><br><br>



earmarked for the new National Library.  We have heard  about

the recent debate and understood the decision to relocate the

National Library to Victoria Street.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister if he could elaborate

on  the special features that the new National Library  would

have,  the  costs of the investment, and what the public  can

expect  from what is to be the most technologically  advanced

facility  in  the  region  when  this  National  Library   is

completed  in  year 2003.  Further, could the  Minister  also

comment on any IT initiatives to increase library utilisation

as  well as participation by Singaporeans?  For example,  are

there  plans  to  improve accessibility such as  through  the

Singapore    One   network   or   through   our   educational

institutions?



<br>3.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I wish to speak

on  neighbourhood libraries.  I have spoken on  this  subject

before.   After  I  have mooted this idea in Parliament  some

years  back, I noted that not long after, such a library  was

built  in the Prime Minister's constituency at Marine  Parade

GRC.   The point is why such a neighbourhood library  can  be

built  in the Prime Minister's constituency but such  similar

libraries cannot be set up in other constituencies.   I  hope

that  it is not a case of favouritism.  Is it because  Marine

Parade is the Prime Minister's constituency that it is  given

preference  of  having  such  a  useful  facility  and  other

constituencies are deprived of them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I brought up this question of building such a

library  in Potong Pasir, the then Minister, Dr Seet Ai  Mee,

said  that  there were libraries already built at  Toa  Payoh

Central and the children in my constituency could take  buses

to  get there.  If that is so easy, why build a neighbourhood

library  at  Marine Parade constituency?  Why did  the  Prime

Minister  accede to the request of the grassroots leaders  to

build  a neighbourhood library in his constituency?  Why  did

he  not  ask the children there to take a bus to  go  to  the

community library or some other library in that area?  He did

not  do that and went ahead to build a neighbourhood library.

Because the Prime Minister knows



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1629</b></font><br><br>



that  it  is important that libraries must be built close  to

the  homes  of  the  children.  The library  must  be  easily

accessible  and within walking distance of their  home.   The

Prime Minister knows that for young children to take a bus to

the  central  or  regional  library  is  time-consuming,  and

sometimes  even  risky.  The round trip may  take  about  one

hour.   In  that  one  hour,  children  can  do  homework  or

something  useful at home.  Travelling by bus and walking  in

public   roads  may  be  dangerous  to  unescorted  children,

especially  female children.  If they are unlucky,  a  female

child may meet a molester.  Children can also be knocked down

by  careless drivers.  Therefore, it is not preferable to ask

children  to  go to a library which may be a  long  way  from

their homes.  But it is better to bring the library nearer to

where the children live.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building of neighbourhood libraries is within the

financial  means  of the Government.  The  Government  enjoys

budget surpluses every year and its coffers are bulging  with

funds.   What a neighbourhood library needs is about a  floor

space of about 3,000 square feet, walled up and tiled at  the

void  deck.  There must also be sanitary facility.  The  rest

of   the   job  could  be  left  to  the  residents  of   the

constituency.   I  am certain residents in  the  constituency

shall  be happy to help out to furnish the library with books

and furniture if they are asked to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am calling not only for such a neighbourhood

library  to be built in my constituency at Potong Pasir,  but

in  every constituency which does not have one at the moment.

Neighbourhood  libraries  are educational  tools.   They  are

necessary to teach children to read at an early age.  In this

way,  more future citizens shall learn to read and be  better

equipped for the knowledge-based economy.  Marine Parade  GRC

has one such library.  I cannot see why the Government cannot

provide other constituencies with such facilities.  Money  is

not a problem.  In fact, the Government's reluctance to build

a  neighbourhood  library  in  every  constituency  is  going

against its own policy in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1630</b></font><br><br>



the  Singapore  21  vision and the new economy.   I  ask  the

Government not to delay any further but to go ahead and build

at least one neighbourhood library in every constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

first,  I declare that I am a member of the Advisory  Council

on  TCS on Chinese Programmes.  It is in that capacity in the

last  two years that I realised how many Singaporeans watched

television and how important it can be as an educational tool

for families and children.  For example, 900,000 Singaporeans

watched the last episode of Stepping Out, a 30-chapter  drama

documentary serial on the successes and failures of Singapore

migrants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember clearly what Mr Wijeysingha, the former

Principal  of Raffles Institution, once said, that television

is  not  a  bad thing.  As long as adults are watching  these

programmes  with their children, there is less  fear  of  the

negative impact of some of the programmes because parents can

take  the opportunity to moderate the influence by discussion

and  guidance.   It is therefore an important  task  for  the

Ministry  to  continually review, support and strengthen  not

just the entertainment element, but the educational value  of

television.   More resources could be committed to  importing

and  developing  good programmes locally and internationally.

I  support  the call by Mr Chew Heng Ching and  Mr  Yeo  Guat

Kwang earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leads me to raise another aspect of television as

public  education.   I  was  most  impressed  by  the  latest

commercial series put up by the Ministry of Defence.  It  was

their  "Total  Defence" campaign which ran  over  two  weeks,

using  five  different versions of 15-second TV  commercials.

The messages were captured in a powerful visual that educates

and  communicates to the public about the role  in  defending

Singapore.  I congratulate the Ministry of Defence  for  this

series  of  brilliant commercial.  And I was  told  that  the

campaign  cost  $200,000 for a total number of  96  spots  in

prime time as well as fringe time programmes.  I was also



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1631</b></font><br><br>



informed that the Ministry paid the rates which apply  across

the board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of our concerns in doing social work is how do

we  reach  out  to the public with our messages,  how  do  we

inform Singaporeans what voluntary welfare organisations  are

doing.  The situation resulted in a frustrating vicious cycle

of  mismatch.   Good social service programmes are  available

but  they do not reach the kind of people who most need them.

Could I propose that TCS allocate some slots of air-time  for

community  services to publicise their activities at  a  much

subsidised  rate as part of a national commitment  to  public

education?   I  know  MCD  had in  previous  years  committed

resources to producing many good commercials, like the series

on  the  elderly people last year.  Sir, I am requesting  for

financial support for similar initiatives to emerge from  the

people sector to complement the work of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways television air-time could be

maximised by VWOs.  They can extend their reach by using good

visuals  during  commercial  slots  in  prime  programmes  to

present   their  services,  spread  their  messages,  recruit

volunteers  and publicise their programmes.  All  these  will

only  add  to public awareness in an extremely cost effective

manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what I gather, if I were to buy into a programme,

let  us say, Growing Up which has a loading of 6.5 times,  it

costs me $6,500 for a 30-second commercial spot.   Rates  for

buying into the fringe programmes are much less.  But  if  we

add  up,  all this is still too much for VWOs.  In  order  to

achieve  the reach and frequency, we need a mix of prime  and

fringe  programmes.  So I would urge the Ministry  to  really

consider  special rates for VWOs.  By lowering these charges,

more sponsors will be attracted to fund the commercial.  This

is  apart  from talking about funding the production  of  the

commercial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The potential of using television as an education tool,

an  instrument for raising social awareness and  the  bonding

process



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1632</b></font><br><br>



for  the  community  must  be  apprised  within  the  overall

objective  of  building community understanding  by  matching

services  and  people's needs in the social  service  sector.

This is just one more suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head R (cont.) -



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, I take the cue that we are

behind  time. I just like to ask the Minister on MITA's  plan

to promote good English.



<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, this

is  an  old issue.  With our society being more open and  the

advent  of  information  technology, Internet  is   impacting

heavily on our lifestyle. We know that it is not easy to curb

pornographic materials on the Internet and this has been  the

concern  of many countries.  However, we should try our  best

to  control  the  undesirable materials  in  our  movies  and

magazines.  I  feel  that  our  censorship  is  getting   too

liberalized now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this open society, people sometimes are so used to

all  strange  happenings around them  that  they  are  simply

immune  to them.  As it is said that if you are in  a  smelly

toilet  for too long, we would be immune to the stench there.

It  would appear that I am the only MP speaking on censorship

in this year's Budget debate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1633</b></font><br><br>



Perhaps I am really too old-fashioned.  Notwithstanding that,

I  would  like  to  know to what extent  will  censorship  in

Singapore  be liberalised and opened up?  Would the  lack  of

stringent censorship influence the minds of our people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a look at the reports in Shin Min Daily News, a

Chinese  evening  press.  There are more and  more  cases  of

molesting, rapes and abandoning of babies and there is even a

report  of a very bold and uninhibited female who is  in  the

habit of walking around stark naked in her flat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we have become too liberalised in the censorship

criteria.  If you look at the newspapers, you can see  a  lot

of  advertisements of R(A) movies, for example, "Virgin of  8

Wonders",  "That's it", "Holy Smoke", "Downfall  Prostitute",

"Women  Soup",  "Surrogate Woman", etc.  Must we  allow  this

kind of movies to flood our cinemas?  Why should we allow it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, I suggested to my children to go and watch the

movie  "Shakespeare in Love".  My children told me not to  go

because  I  am an MP and that we should not be seen  watching

this  kind  of  movie. It is a R(A) movie.   Since  when  has

Shakespeare been linked to a R(A) movie?  I insisted on going

because  I  wanted  to know what kind of censorship  criteria

MITA  was  adopting. In my view,  there were only two  scenes

which  were  objectionable.  Have them cut and the story-line

of  the movie would still be intact, and the R(A) movie could

easily be re-classified as PG.  And there is one lecturer who

showed  me a children's magazine and he asked me why  such  a

magazine  which contains pornographic material is allowed  to

be circulated in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our children are allowed to read such magazines. This

is  a  great  puzzle  to  me.  In this  year's  Asian's  Film

Festival,  we  have  got Asian pornographic  movies  and  the

Chinese readers' reaction is that these are no more than blue

films under the disguise of art.  Therefore, although we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1634</b></font><br><br>



cannot control Internet, we would be able to control the kind

of  films  to  be  shown here.  If we try our  best,  we  can

control  such  films.   I hope that MITA  can  look  at  this

problem  seriously.  We  should not  further  liberalise  our

censorship and I hope my views would be looked upon seriously

by the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I am urging the Government to

provide a systematic review of documents and information that

it holds, with a view to releasing as much as possible to the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? I make this suggestion because (1) information is

the  life blood of the knowledge economy; (2) people need  to

have  better  information in order to evaluate decisions  and

Government actions; (3) there is a danger otherwise  that  we

breed a culture of suspicion and secrecy; (4) there is a cost

in  keeping  too  much  information secret;  and  (5)  timely

release  will help foster greater understanding, transparency

and accountability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognise that something will always need to be kept

secret.  But we cannot reach the situation in which the  only

Government department paper that is not secret is the  toilet

paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be grateful if the Government will consider

setting up such a system of review and release.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, various reasons have

been  cited  for restricting public use of satellite  dishes,

such  as  control of content, censorship, prime time for  the

corportisation of TCS and for local broadcaster  to  compete,

and  that satellite dishes are bulky and unsightly.  However,

with  the meteoric rise of the Internet, several factors have

changed.  First, the cabling of our nation has  led  to  many

Singaporeans   having  broadband  access  to  the   Internet.

Images, news reports, video clips and whole programmes can be

downloaded  and viewed on the Internet. To add  to  this,  we

have  wireless  access to the Internet from portable  devices

such  as  3-G phones and WAP phones. All these mean  that  we

have the ability to view any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1635</b></font><br><br>



site and any information that is on the world wide web.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the technology has and will continue to

transform  the  ugly  duckling of the satellite  dishes  into

increasingly  smaller  versions.  While  this  has  made  the

satellite dishes more appealing in looks, technology has also

made  them  much  harder to detect and therefore,  harder  to

monitor and restrict.  In the light of these changes, I would

like to ask the Minister whether the prohibition of satellite

dishes  is  still necessary.  Is it time for  regulations  to

change to respond to a rapidly changing technology?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Information and the Arts (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Sir, I would like to thank Members for their comments

and suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching and Dr Jennifer Lee reminded us that

PM  Goh  promised  more  funds to promote  the  arts  at  his

National Day Rally speech last year.  PM announced then  that

MITA   was  developing  a  vision  for  Singapore  to  be   a

renaissance city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to inform Members that the "Renaissance

City  Report",  articulating this vision  and  proposing  the

strategic direction to guide our promotion of culture and the

arts  has been completed.  This "Renaissance City Report"  is

available  on  the  MITA website from  today  and  a  printed

version will also be available soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last comprehensive overview of our arts and

cultural  scene  was  in  1989, by the  Advisory  Council  on

Culture  and  the Arts.  That report laid the foundation  for

the  burst  of cultural activities that we witnessed  in  the

1990s.   It  has  been a decade since the Advisory  Council's

report.  It is timely to review the progress made so far  and

set  the direction for the future development of culture  and

the arts, in the context of our overall national development.

MITA  consulted  with  members of the cultural  community  to

gather  inputs  and  views.  The resulting  Renaissance  City

Report has been accepted by the Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1636</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report has two aims. First, it is to establish

Singapore as a global city of the arts.  We want to  position

Singapore  as  a key city in Asia and as one of the  cultural

centres  in  the  world.  The idea is to be one  of  the  top

cities in the world to live, work and play in, where there is

an  environment  conducive to knowledge-based industries  and

talent,  where Singaporeans can be creative and  well-rounded

individuals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it is to provide cultural ballast in our nation-building efforts. In order to strengthen Singaporeans' sense

of  national identity and belonging, we need to inculcate  an

appreciation of our artistic and cultural heritage.  We  need

to  strengthen the Singapore heartbeat through  the  creation

and  sharing  of Singapore stories, be it in theatre,  dance,

music, literature, film or the visual arts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to articulate a vision came about because we

wanted to explain how culture and the arts can contribute  to

the  national  picture  and how they can  enhance  individual

lives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We asked ourselves what kind of society we wanted

Singapore  to  have. How do we want to position Singapore  in

the  international context?  And what part does  culture  and

the  arts play in all of this?  The result was a vision  that

is  described at the level of the individual, the society and

the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the level of the individual, we envisage a

Singaporean  who  is  well-rounded,  has  an  inquiring   and

creative  mind,  a  passion for life, and is  a  civic-minded

active  citizen.  He appreciates and cherishes his  heritage.

His   graciousness  is  underpinned  by  a  fine   sense   of

aesthetics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the societal level, our Asian heritage is enhanced

even  as we evolve a Singaporean identity.  We encourage  and

reward  experimentation and innovation, whether in the  arts,

in  technology  or  in business.  Culture and  the  arts  are

mobilised to animate and add character to our city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the international arena, Singapore is an active

international citizen with a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1637</b></font><br><br>



reputation  for  being  dynamic and vibrant.   The  "Made  in

Singapore"  label  is  known  for  technologically  advanced,

aesthetically designed and creatively packaged  products  and

services.   Our arts and cultural scene helps  to  project  a

positive and well-rounded image of Singapore internationally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have used the term "renaissance" to embody the wide

and  diverse range of attributes that I have just  described.

This  is  by  no  means a desire to hark back  to  the  post-medieval  days of European Renaissance.  Rather,  it  is  the

spirit   of  creativity,  innovation  and  multi-disciplinary

learning  and  of socio-economic, intellectual  and  cultural

vibrancy  that  we want to help create.  In the  era  of  the

knowledge-based  economy, such qualities  take  on  an  added

imperative because they contribute to innovation, imagination

and the creation of new knowledge  - key inputs in the future

economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop our arts and cultural scene, the Report has

adopted two approaches:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, to nurture audiences with a deep appreciation

for the arts and keen sense of aesthetics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to attract, develop and support both local and

overseas creative talents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MITA will pursue six strategies. They are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Develop a strong arts and cultural base. This

involves  enthusing Singaporeans with an interest in culture,

particularly   through   arts   education   programmes,   and

supporting study and research in our arts and heritage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Develop major arts companies. Currently, only the

Singapore  Symphony  Orchestra  and  the  Singapore   Chinese

Orchestra  receive  a level of support that  allows  them  to

focus   on  raising  their  levels  of  professionalism   and

producing  works of an international standard that  Singapore

can  be  proud  of.   The  Report's  main  recommendation  in

financial terms



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1638</b></font><br><br>



is  that  a substantial amount of additional funding be  made

available  to  support and groom up to  eight  more  of  such

companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Recognise and groom talent. This calls for

initiatives  to  discover,  groom  and  recognise   promising

artistic talents that can contribute to the arts and cultural

scene in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Provide good infrastructure and facilities. The

provision   and  maintenance  of  good  infrastructure   will

continue to be an important factor in supporting culture  and

the arts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) Go international. In order for Singapore to be a

cultural  centre in a globalised world, we must  promote  our

arts  and  heritage in the international arena and  encourage

international  collaboration between Singapore  and  overseas

talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6) Develop what we call an arts and cultural

`renaissance' economy.  We need to invest in programmes  that

will  add  to  the excitement and attraction of our  cultural

scene, and do this in such a way that positions Singapore  as

an international city of culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MITA has projected that we will need additional funding

of  $50 million over the next five years.  The Government has

generally accepted the recommendations in the Report  and  is

prepared  to  provide the additional funds.   A  few  of  the

recommendations,   particularly   those   relating   to   tax

incentives would, however, require further study before  they

can  be  considered  for implementation.   This  sum  of  $50

million  is over and above existing Government arts  funding.

It  is not inclusive of capital and operating expenditure for

infrastructure projects for which funding will be  separately

considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching is right to note that our expenditure

on  arts and culture is below those of Hong Kong, the  United

Kingdom  and  Australia.  On a per capita  basis,  Government

operating  expenditure  on the arts in  Singapore,  which  is

currently  about  $7,  is about half that  of  the  state  of

Victoria  in  Australia, and less than a third that  of  Hong

Kong.  The additional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1639</b></font><br><br>



$50  million over 5 years will raise our per capita operating

expenditure to about $10.  While still modest compared to the

levels  of  funding  in more developed countries,  it  is  an

important step in the right direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next few months, MITA and its agencies will

implement  the  recommendations  in  collaboration  with  our

partners in the cultural community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Members have raised specific comments on what we

can do to promote arts and culture in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Seng Han Thong that we need to broaden

and  vary  the  form  of  recognition for  artists  and  arts

patrons.  MITA has identified a list of artists who could  be

invited  to attend suitable state events.  The National  Arts

Council  also  facilitates opportunities for arts  groups  to

perform at the Istana.



<br>3.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ravindran asked if we could look into providing more

facilities  for  arts groups.  NAC has been administering  an

Arts  Housing Scheme to provide arts groups and artists  with

rehearsal  and  administrative spaces at below market  rental

rates.   NAC  has  also been working closely  with  community

organisations and the People's Association to co-locate  arts

facilities  in residential heartlands as part of its  aim  to

bring  the  arts closer to the masses.  NAC will continue  to

explore  opportunities  for new arts housing  spaces  in  the

heartlands.  NAC would be happy to match-make arts groups  to

be  housed  with community centres, as well as  with  private

commercial spaces.  Creative Technology's gesture in  housing

a  drama  training programme is exemplary and we  hope  other

benefactors will follow suit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang asked what we are doing to bring the

arts  to  the  workers, while Mr Ravindran was interested  in

what more can be done to bring the arts to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audience development and outreach programmes are very

important in our efforts to promote the arts.   NAC has  been

organising a number of activities as part



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1640</b></font><br><br>



of  its  outreach programme.  Programmes such as  the  fringe

activities  under  the Arts Festival see tremendous  turnout.

NAC will continue to explore what further can be done in this

area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to Mr Yeo's query on workers, he may be

aware   that   concessions  such  as  a  10%   discount   for

performances  under the Singapore Arts Festival are  extended

to  NTUC  members and NTUC Income policyholders.  I  want  to

reassure Members that MITA has always emphasised the need  to

reach  out to our heartlanders.  This is acknowledged in  the

Renaissance City Report.  Arts and culture cannot just be for

an elite few, not if we want to be a society and a nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin Tet Yung has raised some points about the

ASEAN  Cultural  Centre.   I  think  it  is  something  worth

considering and given the opportunity, I will raise this with

my ASEAN colleagues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to some information and media

matters.   The  media  landscape is  changing  rapidly.   The

recent merger of AOL and Time Warner sent a loud wake-up call

around  the globe.  No one could have dreamt that an Internet

company with limited physical assets could buy up one of  the

largest media conglomerates in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wireless broadband technology will take off in the near

future.   It  will  enable  personal digital  assistants  and

cellular telephones broadband access to the Internet anytime,

anywhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The convergence of traditional media, such as

broadcasting and print, with the Internet has changed the way

people obtain information and are entertained.  The challenge

for  Singapore  is to ride the wave of media convergence  and

globalisation while enabling a Singapore identity to flourish

among   Singaporeans.   In  the  deluge  of  foreign  content

entering Singapore, especially via the Internet, Mr Chew Heng

Ching rightly asked if we should examine how local media  can

retain  their  nation-building role, yet compete  effectively

against  foreign  media. MITA shares his concerns.   We  have

been studying this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1641</b></font><br><br>



issue of creating a functional and competitive industry  with

great  care.   Whatever media structure emerges, Singaporeans

must  have  our own media which continue to report  on  local

highlights   and  viewpoints,  and  anchor  Singaporeans   to

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our local media should continue to cover local events

and  news attractively. They should also not be disadvantaged

when  they cover the events at home compared to foreign media

allowed  into Singapore to also report on Singapore news.  We

must  judiciously  create  a  level  playing  field.   During

election  time,  the  same campaigning rules  must  apply  to

foreign media as to MediaCorp or SPH.  We are working on  the

necessary guidelines and procedures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several Members asked whether we should introduce more

competition  by  granting new licences for newspaper  and  TV

stations.   One  thing is certain: our media  companies  must

gear themselves up quickly to face increasing competition and

to  seize  opportunities presented  by  the  Internet.   When

companies have to compete for customers, it quickens the pace

of  innovation, and spurs management to try out new ideas and

take risks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The media industry is both a local industry and a global

one.   There  is  no  shortage of competition  globally  and,

increasingly,  this is being felt here through  the  Internet

and cable TV.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the local market, we need to recognise that we are a

small  market, and have limited talents.  There are  only  so

many hours of time each person will spend on TV, Internet and

reading   newspapers.   There  will  be  competition  between

different  media, as well as within one particular  class  of

media.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition is still possible within a small market.

However,  we  need  to  consider how best  to  structure  the

industry  so  that  our  companies can  be  more  competitive

locally, grow regionally, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1642</b></font><br><br>



compete effectively against global media players.  Our  local

media  companies  will then be in a better position  to  hold

their  local  audiences and contribute to our nation-building

efforts.  MITA is studying this issue and we expect to  reach

certain conclusions this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Kian Min, Mr Ravindran and Mr Low Thia Khiang

have  asked if we should not lift the ban on satellite dishes

now and allow them to provide the competitive push, since  it

is increasingly untenable to continue the ban.  In the Budget

debate  last year, my predecessor BG George Yeo said that  we

would  allow wireless subscription TV service into  Singapore

to  compete with SCV when its monopoly ends in 2002.  As part

of  our study into the media industry, we are looking at  all

possibilities,  including the pros and  cons  of  introducing

another free-to-air or pay TV operator, be it terrestrial  or

satellite-based, into the market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked my colleague, Mr David Lim, to answer the

other questions concerning the media.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MITA will launch a Speak Good English Movement next

month.   It  will be known as a Movement because we  hope  to

make it a grassroots effort.  It will also take a more light-hearted  approach to encourage people to speak good  English.

The   Movement   will  be  led  by  a  Committee   comprising

individuals  from both the private and public sectors.   Col.

(NS)  David Wong, Senior Advisor, Ernst and Young, has agreed

to chair the Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Movement will not disparage Singlish as there are

Singaporeans, especially from the older generation,  who  did

not  have  the  opportunity  to learn  English  formally  and

therefore  cannot  speak it well.  As  such,  the  Movement's

initial  target audience will be Singaporeans under 40  years

old,   including  school,  ITE,  polytechnic  and  university

students, working adults and parents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh Chin Hua asked for more control to be exercised

on R(A) films, publications and the Internet.  MITA shares Mr

Peh's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1643</b></font><br><br>



concern  over  the  impact of undesirable  materials  on  the

young.   Our  position on censorship remains unchanged.   The

controls  over  R(A)  films  remain  strict.   Explicit  sex,

violent  scenes  and  objectionable  themes  continue  to  be

disallowed  in  R(A) movies, and R(A) cinemas are  still  not

allowed  in  HDB estates.  We also conducted 281  raids  last

year  against uncensored and pornographic videos.   Some  one

million uncensored and pornographic VCDs were seized and  the

distributors charged in court.  If Mr Peh could inform us  of

the children's publication he mentioned, we would be glad  to

follow up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been the practice for MITA to be slightly more

relaxed   in  relation  to  films  shown  in  the   Singapore

International  Film  Festival  as  it  caters  for  a   small

audience.   Even  then in this year's festival,  out  of  300

films  to  be  screened, only 14 are in  the  "Sex  in  Asian

Cinema"  segment.  They will be shown for one or two viewings

to small groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will leave the other points to be answered by my

colleagues, Mr David Lim and Mr Yatiman.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, can I have your permission to

seek one clarification?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> We are running out of time. Mr David Lim

has the floor.



<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim (Minister of State for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Information and the Arts (Mr David T. E. Lim):</b> Sir, my Minister has dealt with the broad

vision and the direction of the arts and media industry.  Now

let  me  deal  with  the field of more practical  and  easier

questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching and Mr Seng Han Thong have asked if

MCS  has  sufficient talents and financial resources to  meet

the  challenges of competition.  The short answer is yes, but

the  rate of change in the media industry is accelerating and

MCS will have to move even more quickly.  It is preparing  to

list  on the Stock Exchange within the next one or two years.

This  will sharpen their commercial sense and I think it will

also enable them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1644</b></font><br><br>



to better retain talent because they will be able to pay more

market oriented compensation packages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a number of Members have made various suggestions

about changes to TV programming.  They have suggested that we

should  have  more coverage of Parliament, more coverage  for

Tamil  programmes,  more  sports,  more  arts,  more  Chinese

current affairs, more Chinese children's programmes and  more

educational  programmes.  I think the only  thing  they  said

less  of was the news.  I am not sure that reflects anything.

At  least,  I think it reflects diversity in our society  and

how we are changing and how our interests are broadening out.

I  think MCS will be glad with all the Members' feedback, but

the  principle is this.  Unless there is an audience,  it  is

not commercially viable for MCS to put on the programme.  You

take  Parliament,  for example.  We put on  a  live  telecast

debate  some  years back, and less than 1% of  people  viewed

that  programme.  So it is not just a matter  of  putting  on

more  programming but also ensuring that there is an audience

for it, because what is the point if you screen something and

nobody watches it.  Then you might as well not screen  it  at

all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho Tat Kin also asked about CNA and whether we could

not  encourage it to go world-wide now that it has taken  the

first step to go to Asia.  Yes, but again, we must not forget

that  CNA  is barely one year old and going into  the  region

already  involves  a  great commitment of  resources.   Going

beyond  the  region will require even more.   So I  think  we

should take it one step at a time.  But in the meanwhile,  if

you  really want to watch CNA and happen to be in  New  York,

you  can always tune on the Internet, especially if you  have

got broadband.



<br>4.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang made a suggestion about buying more

foreign  Chinese  drama rather than producing  them  locally.

Local  dramas  are very popular.  As Mdm Claire Chiang  said,

the series Stepping Out received a very good reception.  She



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1645</b></font><br><br>



mentioned  the figure of 900,000 viewers.  I have a  slightly

more modest figure, but I think they are in the same order of

magnitude.   But the value of local dramas lies  beyond  just

the  popularity.  Local dramas may deal with the same  themes

as  foreign  dramas, whether they be about  love  affairs  or

about  entrepreneurs,  but  they  are  set  in  the  familiar

surroundings  that  Singaporeans  can  resonate   with,   the

buildings,  the  costumes,  the  language,  even  the  little

vignettes, the stories within stories.  These tend  to  bring

out  a warmer and more personal reception among Singaporeans.

This  is a good thing.  In the Internet age, we run the  risk

that   people  will  lose  common  experiences.    We   watch

different movies, we subscribe to different magazines, we  go

to  different  places on holiday.  So having dramas  produced

locally  that  everyone can relate to and talk about  creates

shared  experiences.  These are the basis on  which  we  give

meaning to shared values.  This helps to solidify a Singapore

identity  and it contributes to nation building. So I hope Mr

Yeo  will agree with me that spending a little bit more money

on  local  dramas is perhaps well worthwhile.  In  any  case,

many of them do travel overseas and are quite comfortable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew Heng Ching asked a specific question about the

Programme  Advisory  Committee regarding  Buffy  the  Vampire

Slayer  and  Charm.  I am neither a vampire slayer  nor  very

charming,  but the intent of the Programme Advisory Committee

was  more to caution about violence and supernatural  content

in  these programmes and not to recommend their removal.   We

do  recognise that again there are a variety of interests and

some people do enjoy these programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I address the question that Mdm Claire

Chiang  brought  up  about allocating  air  time  or  setting

preferential rates in the local media for community services.

She  has given many good reasons why it is useful for  us  to

publicise  and  raise  social awareness  about  the  services

provided  and  also  the purpose of these  voluntary  welfare

organisations.  But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1646</b></font><br><br>



I  think  it  is  better  that we  keep  separate  commercial

decisions  and  community service decisions.  As  Mdm  Chiang

herself  has  pointed out, air time is  very  expensive.   So

there  is a real opportunity cost involved.  But if  we  keep

these  decisions  separate, I think  it  ensures  that  media

companies will run their businesses competitively but without

ignoring their role in the community. So we can leave  it  to

SPH  or  MCS to decide on the rates that  they want to charge

for  commercial  services  as  well  as  to  what  amount  of

discounts or sponsorship they are willing or able to  provide

for  community  services.    Where  public  messages  by  the

Government  are concerned, Ministries can, within  their  own

budgets, buy air time for advertisements for their own public

education programmes and campaigns.



<br><br><!-- Encik Yatiman Yusof (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Information and the Arts (Encik Yatiman Yusof):</b> Sir, Dr Ho

Tat  Kin and Mr Ravindran asked about the development of  our

film  industry and of Singapore as a film centre and  whether

we have enough local talent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the formation of the Singapore Film Commission in

1998 was timely as its role of nurturing and supporting local

talent in film-making, the production of Singapore films  and

a film industry in Singapore will help us towards our goal of

becoming a Film Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year in this House, it was reported how the

Commission has been helping the local film industry in  three

main  areas: talent development, facilitation and  financing.

For    talent   development,   the   Commission   gives   out

scholarships,  bursaries and grants for film-related  courses

and programmes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ngee Ann Polytechnic's Film Sound and Video

School works closely with the Commission.  As the local  film

industry  grows and foreigners choose to produce their  films

here, we envisage a shortage of film professionals, which  we

gradually  have to build up through continuing programmes  to

nurture local



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1647</b></font><br><br>



talent and by bringing in foreign talent to supplement them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Facilitation is a key initiative of the Commission.

Local  film-makers can and indeed do come to  the  Commission

for  help  either  for a general letter  of  support  or  for

specific   requests.    Film-makers  sometimes   still   have

difficulty with some agencies and we are working with them to

see how these can be resolved.  In the area of financing, the

Commission gives out small grants to makers of short films.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho raised the matter of co-productions. I understand

that   discussions  on  two  co-productions  with   Singapore

producers  are underway, one with Canada and the  other  with

Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission also works closely with the Economic

Development  Board,  the  Singapore  Tourism  Board  and  the

National Arts Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help make Singapore an attractive Film Centre, the

Commission  is  currently studying what countries  with  more

mature  film industries offer in terms of business incentives

and  film financing and how we may learn and adapt from them.

These    alone,   however,   are   not   enough.     Creative

scriptwriters,  talented film-makers and  good  business  and

marketing sense are also crucial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to turn Singapore into a thriving film industry hub

including  3D features will thus require sustained effort  to

develop  talent  in  all  aspects of  film-making  and  sound

business  and  marketing  acumen,  essential  elements  to  a

vibrant  film industry.  I am hopeful that slowly but  surely

we shall get there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew asked about the special features of the proposed

new  National  Library  Building.  The  National  Library  is

Singapore's   main  repository  of  books,  information   and

resources.    The  new  building  must  reflect   Singapore's

aspirations  to be a learning nation. It will be  a  one-stop

library, offering an integrated learning experience with  its

special reference libraries such as the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1648</b></font><br><br>



Heritage, the Arts and Business Libraries.   For example, the

Singapore   Heritage  Library  will  hold   a   comprehensive

collection of all materials on or about Singapore.   It  will

be  a  world-class centre for research on Singapore. The  new

library   building  will  also  house  the  Central  Regional

Library.   Collectively, the building will  house  about  one

million library books and other library materials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the building will also have a multi-media

centre,  exhibition hall, auditorium and a  select  range  of

outlets  like  cafes and other shops to enhance  the  library

experience  of  the visitors.  The building will  incorporate

the  latest  technology  to  transform  the  library  into  a

borderless  library  with  state-of-the-art  facilities   and

connectivity to information all over the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chew also asked about IT initiatives to increase

library  utilisation.  Since 1995, with its NL.Line, NLB  has

opened  its  doors  to  a  network of  borderless  libraries,

linking  the  publicly  funded  libraries  in  Singapore   to

overseas libraries.  The amount of information available  on-line, such as databases, CD-ROMs and optical discs, has grown

tremendously  that  library users can  now  access  some  400

databases and news services worldwide.  The NLB has created a

network of borderless libraries by co-operating with overseas

sources  of  information including the  National  Library  of

China,  Shanghai Library, British Library and  Russian  State

Library.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NLB has also developed a Student Virtual Community

(SVC), launched in September 1999, to connect students to the

information  world and promote interaction  over  cyberspace.

More  recently, the NLB spearheaded the creation of HuayiNet,

a  major  resource portal on the Chinese Diaspora.  This  was

launched last month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chiam See Tong has asked for a neighbourbood

library  in Potong Pasir.  Somehow he assumed that there  has

been  some favouritism.  But I think he did not get his facts

correct.  The Marine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1649</b></font><br><br>



Parade  Library  was set up not as a new  library  but  as  a

replacement  of the old library.  The old library  in  Marine

Parade,  known as a regional library, has already been  there

since Marine Parade Town was built.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, he appears to be exaggerating the danger of

travelling in public areas in Singapore, picturing  Singapore

as  though it is like New York.  I think he has overdone  it.

Anyway, Sir, he had asked the same question in 1993, 1996 and

1997  without  fail.  I am offering the  same  reply.   I  am

afraid my reply will be nothing new to him.  I would like  to

inform him that the children's libraries here are built  with

the   support  of  the  NLB  according  to  certain  planning

parameters  such as geographical factor, population  density,

age group, proximity to other libraries, and not according to

the  parliamentary  constituencies.  We  are  targetting  100

CCLs  and  our objective is eventually to have it everywhere,

hopefully,  including Potong Pasir, many, many  years  later.

Nevertheless, if Mr Chiam is impatient, there is  nothing  to

stop  him or his Town Council under his charge to set up  his

own  library  subject to the approval of the  HDB  and  other

relevant authorities.  After all, Mr Chiam himself said  that

it  costs very little.  Just put tiles on 10,000 sq ft  area,

put up a wall and hence we have a library.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how green is our society? I mean in every sense

that  the  word  connotes,  that is,  environmentally  aware,

environmentally  friendly, actions and  practices  which  are

designed  to  minimise  damage to the  environment,  economic

development  that  is sustainable.  Here, I  mean  the  whole

community  or  businesses,  each  and  every  one  of  us  as

individuals.   If we were to consider our anti-littering  and

clean  toilet campaigns as surrogates, then I would  have  to

say   "not  very  clean".   These  campaigns  have  not  been

successful but it is not really the fault of the Ministry  of

the Environment.  In fact, I think they have done a fantastic

job  in keeping Singapore clean and green.  But that is their

job.   The job of keeping Singapore clean and green seems  to

rest  on  the  shoulders  of the Ministry  alone.   That  our

streets  are  litter-free  is  not  due  to  the  absence  of

littering  but rather due to the thousands of cleaners  going

about  their  jobs  to keep Singapore litter-free.  That  our

toilets  are not smelly and dirty is due more to the frequent

cleaning by the toilet attendants than the toiletry habits of

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite the efforts that we have put into trying to

make  Singaporeans  environmentally friendly  and  green,  we

cannot  honestly say that we have succeeded.  Perhaps  it  is

time to rethink on the way we tackle these issues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would really like to see a complete stock-take

of  where  we  are  now.  How green are  we?   What  are  the

practices  and habits of our community that can be considered

as  environmentally positive? What are the practices  of  our

businesses  considered as friendly to the environment?   What

are  the  governmental and regulatory measures that encourage

green  practices by businesses, the community and the people.

Let us have a complete report card on these and other areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I would like to set objectives on where we want to

go and the appropriate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1651</b></font><br><br>



desired time frames to achieve these objectives.  Having said

this,  the  next  thing  would  be  to  apply  all  available

resources,  public,  private  and  the  community,  including

financial  measures  to achieve these  objectives.   Periodic

report  cards  such  as  annual stock-takes  should  then  be

produced to provide markers on the progress made.  What I  am

proposing  is  not  really new.  We already had  successfully

used  this method in the cleaning up of Singapore River.   We

set  a time frame for the Singapore River to be cleaned,  and

we  applied  the  resources to that time  frame  and  we  had

periodic  reports  along  the  way.   Also,  the  green  plan

produced by the Environment Ministry some years ago will be a

good place to start for this environmental master plan.   The

green plan currently is more like a statement of what we want

Singapore  to be.  All that is needed, Sir, is  to  make  the

green  plan  more  comprehensive and to add in  the  specific

action plans and resources to achieve specific goals.  Sir, I

think this approach could work. At least, I think it would be

more  effective  than what has been done  so  far.   What  is

needed  is  the inclination and willingness of the Government

to put enough resources into this plan.  And by resources,  I

do not mean just more cleaners and attendants, but rather the

resources to change the mindset of the nation.  The  approach

should  not emphasise on the cleaning up but rather  be  more

directed  at prevention in the first place.  In other  words,

Sir, we should do all we can to ensure that we do not pollute

in  the  first  place and not spend most of our resources  on

cleaning up the pollution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that a comprehensive Master Plan and a total

approach can energise all three sectors - the Government, the

businesses  and the people - to make Singapore a truly  green

island.  It is an idea worth considering, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, a few years

ago,   recycling  has  been  promoted  actively.   Government

departments were using recycled papers and recycled bins were

placed  in  the main thoroughfares for recycled items  to  be

dropped in.  The public was reminded that recycling should be

practised whenever



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1652</b></font><br><br>



possible to preserve our earth's scarce resources and not  to

deplete our natural resources mindlessly.  There seems to  be

not  much  follow-up  action by the Ministry.   It  would  be

ironical  that the nation that is completely without  natural

resources  can afford to ignore the importance of  conserving

such scarce resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, on one of my visits to Canberra, Australia, I

observed  that the authorities have limited the size  of  the

refuse bin of each household.  The objective is to limit  the

amount  of  refuse generated, a compulsory way of  compelling

everyone to recycle and not to unnecessarily generate  refuse

by  needlessly throwing away reusable articles.  Perhaps  the

Ministry  can consider ways to encourage residents  to  limit

the  amount of refuse.  This can be done by making it one  of

the criteria to be included in giving rebates to blocks which

are judged to be the cleanest in our HDB estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I call on the Ministry to put through the message of

recycling and come up with more creative ways to promote this

cause.   For example, the Ministry can call on the people  to

limit  the  usage of disposable plastic cups and  polystyrene

food  boxes  and  plates,  as  they  cannot  be  recycled  or

biodegradable  and are harmful to our environment.   If  this

cannot  be  practised at the commercial places, at  least  at

home, for hygiene and time taken to clean usable utensils are

not  critical.   Any programme we can come up with  will,  of

course,  take  some time for everyone to get used  to.   This

involves  changing not only our daily habits  but  the  whole

mindset  of the nation.  But unless we can make a start  now,

we may create serious problems for our future generations.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Sir, half

of  the  water consumed in Singapore is supplied by  Malaysia

and  the  other half is from our own reservoirs.   The  first

water  agreement with Malaysia will expire in 2011.  To-date,

there is still no sign of what will happen upon the expiry of

the  said  agreement.   Much  has  been  reported  about  the

development of the water catchment in Indonesia and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1653</b></font><br><br>



exploration of desalination technology.  Lately, there was  a

report  about  selling  of  high-grade  industrial  water  in

Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, industrial water or recycled water could be an

important  source of water supply in meeting our water  needs

when we fail to secure other reasonable raw water supply deal

with  our  neighbouring countries.  In fact, almost  all  the

used  water enters into our sewer system, together  with  the

rain  water.  Our sewer system discharges more than what  PUB

has  supplied into the sea after treatment.  If half  of  the

water discharged is recycled, we shall be self-sufficient  in

our  water  needs.   Based  on today's  technology,  the  low

pressure  membrane is able to produce water of  good  quality

and  at  very  reasonable  cost.  This  is  why  high-quality

industrial water is able to find its market under the private

sector initiative in Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the people in the water business, I know that the

Ministry has an ongoing project on the research and study  of

recycled  water.  May I ask the Minister on the  progress  of

the  said  recycled water project?  Does the quality  of  the

recycled  water  meet  that of the Bedok  or  Chua  Chu  Kang

reservoirs'  standard?   What is the cost  of  producing  the

water?  What is the application of the water produced so far?

Is  there a possibility that the recycled water can meet  the

water  needs of Singapore?  If so, what plans do we  have  in

making people to accept recycled water as an alternative when

we should be self-sufficient in our own water supply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, in recent times, there has

been  much  talk,  and  unfortunately much  misunderstanding,

about genetically modified (GM) food.  This is not surprising

as the idea of having food that we consume, a product of some

form  of  modification by the addition of a gene from another

source  using  biotechnological  techniques,  can  be   quite

discomforting, to say the least.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sort of impact would such food have on us and our

descendants, since



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1654</b></font><br><br>



GM  food  is unlikely to occur in nature even with  the  most

sophisticated  form of cross-breeding?  Are  we  not  playing

God?  How would they square against our religious and ethical

beliefs?   What sort of impact would such organisms and  food

have  on  the  environment and the ecology?  Sir,  I  do  not

really  know  what the answers are.  The technology  is  new,

only  about 20 years old, and I doubt that there are many  in

the  world who would say that they have the complete  answers

to all these questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I can say, Sir, is that GM food is here to stay.

The world needs it.  The fact is that the spectre of Malthus'

prediction  is  not  upon us is due mainly  to  the  advances

scientists have made in the production of food.  GM  food  is

but  just another step in the same direction.  In fact,  with

populous  countries,  like China and India,  on  the  way  to

becoming  middle class countries, and with rising  affluence,

we  will have more demand on food.  The demand on food in the

world can only intensify in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a matter of interest, even in Singapore, can we

really  say that we have not been really consuming  GM  food?

Take the ubiquitous soya bean and the products made from  it.

We  take  it in the form of soya sauce, bean curd, soya  milk

and  in  various forms like tou chiu, tou gua, tou  pok,  tou

kee,  and  various types of tou.  Soya bean is also  used  in

many  of  the food we eat.  We also eat the meat  of  animals

which  feed  on  soya-based feed-mill.  The  reality  of  the

matter is that the US is the world's largest exporter of soya

beans,  and that is, about 50% of the soya bean crops in  the

United  States are already genetically modified.  So  can  we

honestly  say  that  the food that we consume  in  Singapore,

especially  processed food, contains none of those  beans  in

one form or another?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in light of this, I support the rationale and

practical approach taken by the Environment Ministry on  this

issue.   We  should not irrationally condemn all GM  food  as

unfit for human consumption.  On the other hand, if there are

reasonable alternative sources, then obviously we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1655</b></font><br><br>



should  avoid  GM  food  as much and  as  long  as  possible.

However,  I believe that on this issue, individual  consumers

should  have the final say on the type of food they  wish  to

consume.  It is therefore the Government's responsibility  to

provide  all available information for our consumers to  make

their  choices.  And here, Sir, I am referring to the subject

of labelling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Ministry should implement a labelling policy

immediately.    I   am   aware  that  there   are   technical

difficulties  involved  -  issues  such  as  threshold.   For

example,  what  percentage  would  the  use  of  GM  food  in

processed food have to be before labelling them as containing

GM   food?   Despite  all  these  difficulties,  I  think  an

imperfect labelling policy is better than no policy  at  all.

I  do  not  think that we have the luxury of  waiting  for  a

perfect solution to this issue.  Let us start, Sir, with some

form of labelling and change the labelling specifications and

standards  with improving technology and testing  techniques.

In this way, while the Ministry keeps the broad parameters of

ensuring that Singapore has safe food, the final choice  lies

with the consumers, with us, Singaporeans.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, I support the views

put  forward by my GPC Chairman, Mr Heng Chiang Meng, on  the

labelling of genetically modified food.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is genetically modified food? It is food

containing  ingredients coming from the genetically  modified

crop.   These  are  crops which have genes taken  from  other

organisms,   plants  and  animals  and  inserted   into   the

genetically  modified crop.  Soya bean is the  most  commonly

grown  GM  crop, followed by corn, rape seed and potato.   In

theory, anything containing these crops or lecithin, which is

made from soya bean, could come from the GM ingredients.   We

consume food every day which is genetically modified  but  we

do  not  even notice it.  If you ask the manufacturer whether

the  food  is genetically modified, from experience of  other

advanced   countries,  clear  answers  are   hard   to   get.

Therefore, it is hard to know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1656</b></font><br><br>



whether  it is GM food or it is safe to consume, unless  they

are forced to disclose by law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dangers of genetically modified food are unknown.

The main concern is that food has subtle and long-term effect

on  health  and we seem to be making a significant change  to

our  food supply without checking whether or not it  will  be

having  any  impact on our health.  There are  also  concerns

about the effect of introducing genes which are resistant  to

virus,  herbicide,  as GM crops are certainly  a  cross-breed

with  weeds.   Morally, there are also other  problems,  like

introducing  genes of animals into the food which  may  cause

religious  and  also moral concerns.  It also causes  certain

species  of plants to lose their nature of reproduction.   On

the  contrary, it could also cause it to reproduce so quickly

beyond the control of human beings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the manufacturer's point of view, GM food could be

produced  at  a  much lower cost, lower risk  in  production,

fetch  better  price  for  the  product  and  will  be   more

marketable if the consumers preferred the characteristics  of

the  food to be enhanced.  These include the colour, flavour,

size  and  any other preferred ingredients.  There  are  also

hopes  that  there  will be increase in productivity  of  the

developing nation in increasing the food production.  To  the

consumers, they may get cheaper and better looking food,  but

the  impact  on health due to the food is relatively  unknown

and uninformed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent conference sponsored by the OECD held in

Edinburgh,  consumer groups, scientists and legislators  were

gathered to discuss the matter concerning GM food.  The  term

"substantial equivalent" used to assess the safety of the  GM

food  was  debated and strongly criticised  by  the  consumer

groups.   The modern GM technology was compared to the  early

days  of  nuclear  power technology development.   Scientists

then   expounded   on  their  incredible  potential   without

realising or warning about the danger of nuclear power.   The

scientists were urged to be more truthful about what they did

not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1657</b></font><br><br>



know  on  the  issue  of  GM  food.   The  term  "substantial

equivalent" was introduced by the OECD in 1993 to assess  the

safety  of GM food.  It was adopted three years later by  the

United  Nations  Food and Agricultural Organisation  and  the

World Health Organisation, and has been used ever since.  But

even  some  scientists  have  criticised  it  for  not  being

accurate enough to prove that GM food is safe.  It is only  a

guide   for   safety  assessment  and  there  are   different

interpretations and much is dependent on the expertise of the

people making the assessment.  When we deal with the GM  food

issue,  we  must  be  careful in the  adoption  of  the  term

"substantial  equivalent" in approving the sale  of  GM  food

here.   The  consumers' long-term health safety must  precede

commercial and scientific interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the consumers in Singapore are ignorant about GM

food  and  their  health implications.  They  deserve  to  be

better informed about what scientists are doing to their food

and  what they are eating.  If nothing is done, GM food  will

flood the market and the people will continue to consume  the

food  by not knowing the implications.  If GM food should  go

wrong  one day, the Government has to be responsible for  not

keeping  the consumers adequately informed of the matter.   I

feel that we should consider mandatory measures by asking the

GM  food producers and importers to disclose the content  and

what they had done to the food and compulsorily labelling all

GM  food  sold locally.  Mandatory labelling allows consumers

to decide for themselves whether they like to eat GM food.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Ministry to seriously consider the labelling

of GM food and the compulsory disclosure of the content of GM

food sold locally.



<br>4.30 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, despite concerted

efforts  to  eradicate the problem of littering in Singapore,

one  of  the  major complaints the town council has  received

from the residents is the untidiness and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1658</b></font><br><br>



lack  of cleanliness in the estate.  Although the legislation

provides   for   severe   fines   for   people   who   litter

indiscriminately, enforcement remains a big problem.  Keeping

the  estate  clean and tidy depends very much  on  the  civic

consciousness of the residents, and not on the  frequency  of

the   cleaning.   Theoretically,  if  nobody   litters,   the

environment will remain clean even without cleaning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good example is in the comparison between the public

housing  estates and the private condominiums.  The  standard

of  cleanliness in condominiums has always been higher and it

is  not because they are cleaned more frequently.  It is more

in  the  mindset of the residents that they regard  the  area

even  outside their units as their own.  Therefore, they  are

more conscious in keeping the estate clean and tidy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the necessary expenses caused by cleaning up

the  public  housing estates, it also affects the environment

we  live  in.   And Singapore being an urban  city,  we  must

cultivate  civic consciousness in everyone of us  whether  we

live  in private or public estates.  I hope the Ministry  can

put  more efforts in promoting public consciousness,  keeping

our environment clean and stepping up enforcement in catching

those who litter indiscriminately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One area which needs to be looked into is how to deal

with those businesses who send out fliers to the residents in

HDB   estates.   These  businesses,  while  saving  on  their

advertising  cost,  have  indirectly generated  a  tremendous

amount of litter as 99% of the residents would discard  these

fliers   immediately  after  taking   them   out   from   the

letterboxes.   Some  measures have been taken  by  some  town

councils  to  modify  the  letterboxes  to  prevent  this  by

building  a  trough under the letterboxes  to  collect  these

discarded  fliers.  But in most housing estates,  this  still

remains a source of environmental pollution.  Perhaps, a form

of   fine  or  levy  can  be  put  on  these  businesses  who

indiscriminately  send out fliers in our  public  estates  to

defray the extra cleaning cost incurred by the town council.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1659</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, Mr Kenneth Chen seems to imply

that  people who live in condominiums are more civic  minded.

I  am  not  too  sure whether his assessment is correct,  and

whether it is fair to the people who live in HDB estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, using punishment by inflicting economic losses

through fines and publicly shaming offenders seem to  be  the

cornerstone  of  the Government in solving  social  problems.

Heavy  fines  and  CWOs  to punish  litterbugs  is  one  such

example.   However,  these do not seem  to  be  effective  in

solving  the problem of littering in Singapore.  I share  the

same  view  as  Mr Kenneth Chen on the problem  that  we  are

facing  in  HDB  estates.   According to the  Straits  Times'

report, such offenders are on the rise.  And the Ministry  is

again considering harsher anti-littering penalties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder whether the Ministry of the Environment

will consider other measures, besides imposing a penalty,  to

minimise the problem.  I think one area it should consider is

how  to  encourage  the neighbours and the community  to  put

pressure  on the littering behaviour.  It could also consider

how  to  empower  individuals to deal with  litterbugs.   The

Ministry  of  the Environment has made offenders  to  perform

CWOs by cleaning up some areas.  So far, I have not known  of

any offenders being made to clean up areas in Hougang Estate.

I  wonder  how the Ministry selects which area to  clean  up.

Does the Ministry only select areas in the PAP wards?



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, I would like

to  say  to  Mr Low Thia Khiang that I am not aware  that  my

housing estates are being cleaned by CWO workers too.  So  it

is  not just Hougang that is being excluded.  I do not  think

the CWO serves the purpose of cleaning up housing estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, essentially, Mr Low is right in that it is not

fines and it is not CWOs that would ultimately solve the root

of  the  problem.   The  root  of the  problem  is  community

consciousness, as he has pointed out,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1660</b></font><br><br>



and a civic consciouness among people such that there is this

shame  or  perhaps  humiliation if  you  are  seen  to  throw

something  on  to the floor when it is clean.  Unfortunately,

we have a problem here in that, culturally, Singaporeans, and

Asians, in general, do not find it a comfortable thing to  do

to  confront  somebody  in public and tell  them,  "Hey,  you

dropped something.  Can you please pick it up?"  We have seen

also, where handphones are concerned, that the reaction could

be  something very violent.  So I think it is a long way more

and a big cultural change that we may have to institute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this because I do believe that this problem

affects  two other areas.  I want to talk particularly  about

the  Singapore  River and the Civic District.  Seven  million

tourists  visit us every year.  Some of these are journalists

and  government officials, and they leave Singapore with  the

impression  that it is clean and green and then  they  spread

the  word and send more people our way.  We have indeed  done

very  well and our Ministry of the Environment deserves  high

praise for the work they have done.  This is particularly  so

when  we  realise  that the cleanliness is  achieved  through

sheer  diligence in sweeping the streets and, as Mr Low says,

heavy  fines  and the Corrective Work Order for  recalcitrant

offenders of our anti-littering laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special efforts seem to have been put into keeping

Orchard  Road,  our prime tourist belt, and  Changi  Airport,

spotlessly  clean.  Somehow, I think cleanliness  does  beget

cleanliness  and, as I said earlier, if the place  is  clean,

the person who throws litter will feel a little bit conscious

if  he  were to be the first to make the place dirty.  But  a

person who wants to litter will feel less compunction if  the

street is already very dirty.  Ultimately, we must change the

attitude  of  the people.  But today, I am not here  to  talk

about what kind of civic campaigns we must introduce or  what

new fines we must institute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just have a small request of the Ministry. I walk

between this area - Parliament Place, the Padang, Empress



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1661</b></font><br><br>



Place  -  to my office in Battery Road every day.  Along  the

way, I pass a construction site:  naturally it will be a  bit

dirty  and  dust flies all over.  And I pass the historically

quaint  Cavenagh Bridge where I have the pleasure  of  seeing

fishermen  fish from the Singapore River.  This  River  is  a

long way from the black, smelly, immensely filthy river of my

childhood  30-40 years ago.  All credit goes to the  Ministry

again  for  the  miracle they have wrought.  People  actually

travel on this river now on pleasure cruises!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I appreciate that keeping up such cleanliness is a

difficult  task.   I just wish to alert the Ministry  to  the

fact that more attention should perhaps be given to the river

and the Civic District through which it runs.  I have had  on

many  occasions   written  letters to  the  Ministry  on  the

unsatisfactory  state of cleanliness during  my  daily  walk.

Beer  bottles  are littered at odd hours of the  day;  leaves

clog  drains;  debris float on the river; oil stains  on  the

river  and  on  the  roads;  tour  buses  running  their  air

conditioners while they wait for their passengers  to  rejoin

them  and  spewing, in the meantime, lots of pollutants  into

the air.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Ministry pay the same attention to this area as

they  do for Orchard Road and the Airport before many of  the

tourists  visiting  here  start telling  their  friends  that

Singapore is not really that clean after all?



<br><br><!-- Mr Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Harun bin A. Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, when

we  see,  read  or  hear  about floods occurring  in  Africa,

Europe,  America  and China through the print  or  electronic

media,  we  would be worried and fearful if it  would  happen

here where lives would be lost and properties destroyed.   We

live  in  a small island surrounded by water and the fear  is

more real when heavy rain continues for several days and  the

tide is high.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 70s, we saw the development of 3,178 hectares of

flood prone land involving $20 million worth of manpower



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1662</b></font><br><br>



and  about  $68  million in improving canals in  flood  prone

areas.  In 1998, there were 260 hectares of flood prone  land

left  that  can still be developed.  These flood prone  areas

can  cause  difficulties to the public when flood occurs  and

there  would  be  traffic  jams and damage  to  vehicles  and

properties.   The  question is: why did the Ministry  of  the

Environment not develop the 260 hectares of flood prone land?

Is  it  due to shortage of budget or other factors that flood

prone areas still exist?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the location of the 260 hectares of land? What

projects   are underway and will be carried out?  Can  I  say

that  in  10 years' time from today,  Singapore will be  free

from flood?



<br>4.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was reported in 1998 that there were about 5,183

dengue cases and 75 cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever.  With

regard  to  malaria there were 405 cases, of which  369  were

cases  reported  to be brought in by victims  from  overseas.

Only  36 cases of malaria occurred here.  Although the figure

is  quite  high,  only  one died from dengue  and  five  from

malaria.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibilities of reducing dengue and malaria

cases rest on the shoulder of the Vector Control and Research

Department,  Ministry of the Environment.  I  would  like  to

know whether the said department has thus far been successful

in  informing  the  public on the importance  of  eradicating

dengue  fever  and  malaria?  What are the figures  for  both

diseases?  At the end of 1999, were the figures going  up  or

down?   If  it  had  gone  down, what  are  the  contributory

factors?  If in 1998 malaria had taken five lives and  dengue

one, what about 1999? Is the death toll increasing?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were informed that 369 malaria cases were brought in

from  overseas.  What measures have been taken to reduce  the

figure?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, how many researches were conducted by the

Ministry  of  the  Environment so  that  dengue  and  malaria

problems could be overcome, if not eradicated?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1663</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry of the Environment will continue to

do the necessary to ensure that Singapore is free from dengue

and  malaria.  We do not want our country, known as a  "clean

and green city" to be otherwise.  Not many tourists will come

if there is a dengue and malaria epidemic in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is well-known for its cleanliness and greenery

and her citizens live in comfort. According to WHO, water and

air pollution is  well under control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public and private sectors have both actively

participated in various projects to enhance our  healthy  and

clean  environment such as the "Clean and Green  Week  1998".

All  these  activities will enhance public awareness  on  the

importance of living in a clean and green environment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 1996, refuse collection has been privatised and

taken   over   by  SEMAC  Pte  Ltd  (Singapore  Environmental

Management  Company).  I have been informed that  to  enhance

cleanliness,  the Ministry of the Environment has  introduced

competitors to collect 7,790 tonnes of refuse per day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the administrative point of view, the effort of the

Ministry   of   the  Environment  is  commendable   but,   in

practicality,  we  find  that in recent  months,  the  refuse

collection  has not been going on smoothly and  according  to

schedule.  At times, we find that the collectors were slow in

collecting   the   refuse   and   the   job   performed   was

unsatisfactory.  They used to collect the refuse  very  early

in  the morning.  However, they suddenly did not collect  the

refuse  for  one or two days.  What worries me is that  their

inconsistency  and slow clearance of the refuse  would  bring

about an unhealthy environment and various diseases.  Do  the

selected  contractors lack the experience?  Or is it  because

they  lack manpower?  In addition, they use smaller  vehicles

compared to the ones used by the Ministry of the Environment.

What  action would the Ministry take on the contractors  that

could not complete their tasks?  When will the new tenders be

released?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1664</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the selection of contractors for this task, I

hope  the Ministry of the Environment would be more selective

and  it  should impose heavier punishment to be  rendered  on

contractors who could not perform their job satisfactorily so

that Singapore's status as a "clean city" is ensured.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, my cut is on refuse collection

from   residential  properties.  When  the  Ministry  engages

private   contractors   to  collect  rubbish   from   private

residential  properties,  it sends a  letter  asking  private

house  owners  not to use rubbish bins, but to tie  up  their

rubbish  in plastic bags and leave them outside their  houses

early in the morning. Their collection trucks are supposed to

come early to collect those rubbish that are left outside  in

the open. The problems are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The rubbish trucks do not come early as promised

but  come in the late morning or sometimes past twelve  noon.

By  then, dogs and cats would have torn up those plastic bags

to  look for food and pieces of fish bones, chicken bones and

other perishable materials would be strewn on the road, which

are  not only very unsightly but also attract flies and other

insects;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Some householders do not employ maids and cannot

get  up at 5 am or 6 am to leave the rubbish outside. So they

take  out  the rubbish and leave them outside in  the  night.

That  is  even worse. The rubbish left out in the  night  are

sure to attract not only dogs and cats, but rats as well. The

plastic bags will be torn open and foodstuff and other  waste

materials would be strewn all over the place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another complaint is that private houses also have

gardens  and  they often leave cut branches, cut grass,  dead

branches  and  other debris outside their  houses.  For  some

unknown  reasons, the rubbish collectors do not seem  anxious

to  collect  them away in a hurry. Such rubbish left  outside

the  nice  houses situated in nice estates can  be  quite  an

eyesore  and  do not look well for the general appearance  of

the  estate.  Can you imagine if visitors from  overseas  are

brought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1665</b></font><br><br>



around  to see some of those private housing estates and  the

beautifully built houses, costing a few million dollars each,

with  piles  and  heaps of rubbish left  in  front  of  those

beautiful  houses?   The Ministry should do  something  about

rubbish  collection in private estates.  I still think  using

standardised  rubbish bins like the ones  used  in  Australia

would be the best solution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem which I would like to highlight is that

I  notice  nearly  all  the rubbish collectors  do  not  wear

gloves.  I do not know whether those rubbish collectors  take

on  second jobs as food handlers at hawker centres.   If  so,

they  need a lot of washing of their hands when they take  on

their second jobs at hawker centres.  I think it is good that

rubbish collectors be supplied with gloves and to ensure that

they  wear them.  It is also for their own safety.  They  may

sometimes  be handling broken bottles or pieces of glass  and

broken  branches with thorns, and they may get hurt.  I  hope

the Ministry shall take note and do something with regard  to

what I have just pointed out.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Bukit Gombak)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir,

recently, the issue of public toilets seems to be a hot topic

for public discussion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was reported in the TV news recently that some public

toilets in United Kingdom had to be closed down because  they

were  not  properly maintained.  The residents  and  visitors

were not happy and complained about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Korea, great care is taken to keep the public toilets

spick-and-span.   The people there are so proud  of  it  that

tourists  are often invited to visit the toilets, and  almost

without  fail,  the toilets would win full  marks  for  their

cleanliness.  In Japan, cleanliness of public toilets is also

taken  seriously.  When high-ranking officers from Japan  are

invited  to  visit your factory, the first thing  they  would

look  at  is your toilet. If your toilet is clean,  he  would

have confidence in the management of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1666</b></font><br><br>



your  company.   But if your toilet is dirty and  messy,  the

conclusion  he  would draw is that there  must  be  something

wrong with the management.  In China, the public toilets  are

notorious for their uncomplimentary characteristics, some  of

the  public toilets have no doors.  If you want to go to  the

toilet,  you  need  to  bring  an  umbrella  with  you.    In

Singapore,  of  course, we are not as good  as  in  Korea  or

Japan, but we are not as bad as those in China or England.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Mr Goh Chok Tong has said that if we want

Singapore to become a gracious society, we have to start from

our  toilets.  If  we  cannot keep  our   toilets  clean  and

presentable, how can we talk about having a gracious society?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, in the process of picking the cleanest hawker

centre  in Singapore, I found that some of the public toilets

in the hawker centres were very old and in very bad shape.  I

think  we  should  renovate  all  these  public  toilets   in

Singapore.  I have a few questions for the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know how many public toilets are there

in  Singapore  and  if we want to upgrade  all  these  public

toilets, how much would it cost the Government.  When can the

Government  start  to  upgrade them  and  when  can  this  be

completed?   Secondly, after upgrading these public  toilets,

can the Ministry of the Environment set up some guidelines on

how  to maintain these public toilets so that the money spent

on  upgrading them would not go down the drain? Thirdly,  can

the  toilets  in the coffeeshops in HDB estates  and  in  the

private  sector be also included in the upgrading  programme?

Fourthly,  can we have the cleanest public toilet competition

in  Singapore?  When we have this competition,  the  Ministry

can  pick  the three cleanest toilets and, at the same  time,

single out the three most dirty toilets so that something can

be  done  about them.  I believe we should take  this  matter

seriously. Only then can we enjoy the reputation of  being  a

country  with  the cleanest public toilets  around.   Lastly,

when we are upgrading these toilets, we should also look into

the facilities of these toilets.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1667</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I led a lion dance troupe to take part in a

competition in Guangzhou, China. When we reached the stadium,

some  members  of  our lion troupe went to the  toilet.  They

complained to me that all the taps were not working and there

was  no water. I was not convinced, so I went into the toilet

to  check  for  myself.   To my surprise, I  found  that  the

toilet  was  fitted with the latest type of  automatic  taps.

All  you  had to do was to put your hands under the  tap  and

water  would flow out and stop automatically.  They are  more

advanced  than we are, so much so that our boys did not  know

how  to  use  these  modern gadgets.  Yes,  we  are  actually

falling  behind  the Chinese.  Yet we are  frequently  joking

about  the  pathetic state of some of their  public  toilets!

Perhaps, it is time for us to catch up by installing some  of

these  modern taps which are more hygienic as we do  have  to

touch them to turn them on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister would consider my suggestions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, it is my understanding

that the Environment Ministry has since the late 80s, stopped

issuing    new   hawker   stall   licences   to   applicants.

Additionally, new markets and eating centres developed by the

HDB  are now tendered out en-bloc to private contractors  who

in  turn  rent  these  stalls  to  private  operators  at   a

commercial rate.  The operators will typically be  those  who

are  well-established in the trade, or are connected  to  the

party who won the bid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens is that common people who are interested in

renting  these  stalls  but who do  not  have  the  necessary

business experience or financial ability, or for that  matter

connection, have a hard time trying to get a stall  at  these

centres.  Unfortunately, the people who need to set up  small

businesses  to make a living for the family are  usually  not

the   ones   with  the  financial  ability  or  the  business

experience. They would invariably be people coming  from  the

poorer section of our community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of my work in the meet-the-people

sessions, I have come across,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1668</b></font><br><br>



and I am sure my colleagues do too, many requests for canteen

stalls in schools.  For many applicants, getting a stall  not

only  provides  them with an income but also  allows  them  a

certain  flexibility in time management.   These  stalls  are

usually  rented  out  at nominal rates  and  would  typically

provide  a modest income for the stall operators to  get  by.

Getting a stall in a school would mean great financial relief

to  those  in need. These would include cases where there  is

only one parent in a family to support young children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, as things go, there are many more

applications  for  such  stalls than they  are  available  in

school  canteens. For my constituency alone, there  were  500

applications  for four vacancies in a school canteen  when  a

new  school was opened recently.  While the school  tried  to

allocate  the  stalls on the basis of financial  need,  there

were  many other equally needy families who had to be  turned

away.   In  other  words, the fact that  there  are  so  many

applications for such stalls from a sizeable number of people

with financial need would suggest that there is a crying need

for more of such stalls to be made available to them. We have

always  advocated the principle that we should not only  just

give our people fish but we should teach them to fish so that

they can help themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister whether the Government

would  reconsider  its  policy of not  issuing  hawker  stall

licences  and to consider setting aside more stalls  for  the

needy. Perhaps as a suggestion, the Government should do  the

following.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, to have a certain number of hawker stalls or

market stalls set aside for the poor and needy families while

the  rest  can  be  tendered out.   Secondly,  to  set  basic

criteria  that  the families must meet in order  to  qualify.

Thirdly, to have information and advice on hand to teach  and

help  these families to run the business.  Lastly, to provide

some soft loans as start-up capital if necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to make Singapore the best home for our people.

We do not want this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1669</b></font><br><br>



statement  to  ring hollow for the poorer  Singaporeans.   We

must  be  seen to be doing more for them.  By doing  this,  I

think the Government would come across even more strongly  in

show that they really care.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, it is received wisdom

that  Singapore has no resources and therefore in  our  power

needs,  we  have to rely on fossil fuels like oil,  coal  and

even  natural gas.  It is, of course, important for strategic

reasons  that  we should vary the sources of energy  that  we

have and so we have actually signed deals with Indonesia, for

example, to use natural gas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, I think that we are sometimes wrong when we

say  that we have no resources and people would say that  our

resource  is  manpower but we cannot have people running  and

keeping  the power stations' turbines turning.  So,  we  have

got  to  think  of  realistic resources.  And  one  realistic

resource is sunshine.  We have lots of sunshine each year.  I

think  it is important for us to harness this energy to  give

us our needs in electricity.



<br>5.00 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do understand that solar power energy is

difficult  to  convert and the technology is still  not  very

advanced  and it requires huge amounts of money and  lots  of

space  for  the solar panels.  I would just like to  ask  the

Ministry  if they could give the House an update on  some  of

the  efforts that can be made in this area.  Perhaps we could

think of tax incentives or grants to the universities here to

do  research into solar panels, so that eventually  we  could

find some technology which we can use for our power needs.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the emission of

black  smoke from heavy vehicles is one issue that we discuss

year  in and year out.  Last year, this matter was taken over

by  the  Ministry  of the Environment.  Now the  Ministry  is

stepping  up enforcement against the offenders.  From  August

last year to February this year,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1670</b></font><br><br>



about  5,820  heavy  vehicles  and  1,900  motorcycles   were

summoned for emission of black smoke.  Perhaps these vehicles

were  too old, probably exceeding 10 years.  Therefore,  some

owners of these vehicles are suggesting that the Ministry  of

the   Environment  or  the  Ministry  of  Communications  and

Information  Technology could give them some incentives  such

as  reserving  COEs for them, so that they can replace  their

vehicles to solve the problem once and for all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, they have doubts on the accuracy of the video

cameras used to detect the black smoke.  Is there some way we

can  help  drivers  of  heavy  vehicles  to  condition  their

vehicles and to prevent the emission of black smoke?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Malaysian registered vehicles are running on

our   roads.   Will  they  be  also  subjected  to  the  same

enforcement  action?   Are  they also  issued  summonses  for

emission of black smoke too?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalty is too heavy. I believe for the first

offender,  the fine is $500.  At this time when  the  economy

has  not fully recovered, this is a very heavy burden on  the

drivers  of  these heavy vehicles.  I would like to  ask  the

Minister  whether  or  not we could give  them  some  rebates

during this difficult time.  Do not fine them so heavily and,

at  the  same time, use other ways to educate them on how  to

prevent  the  emission of black smoke and how to maintain  or

service  their vehicles so that they will not  have  to  face

this predicament.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, we all know that we

live  in the 21st century with advanced technology in  almost

every frontier of science.  Yet, we are still haunted by  the

difficulty in controlling diesel smoke from the more than 100

years old technology.  It seems to be an insult to mankind in

this modern information age.  As I said in last year's speech

on  diesel  pollution, the diesel technology is  so  advanced

that preventing diesel vehicles from having smoky exhausts is

no big deal.  Why do so many people still



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1671</b></font><br><br>



complain of being booked for emitting excessive diesel smoke?

They  are  either ignorant of the technology or they  do  not

bother about their vehicles until they are caught and fined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no doubt we are in the IT age. Some people just do

not practise the right thing.  Instead, they cut corners, try

to  save  some  work and some money.  In the case  of  diesel

vehicles,   some  vehicle  owners,  instead   of   practising

preventive  maintenance, they practise breakdown repair.   In

other  words, they only maintain their vehicle when it breaks

down.  This is really unfortunate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dealing with such diesel emission violation, the

Ministry  imposes  heavy fines on both  the  driver  and  the

owner,  and I have no qualms about this.  However, as a  form

of education, incentives and disincentives might perhaps help

to  improve  the present system of penalty.  As the  Ministry

is  responsible for the policy on environmental pollution  by

vehicles, certain incentive concept could be built  into  the

law  to  better achieve the goal in pollution  control.   One

could  ask  the recalcitrant vehicle owner for more  frequent

inspections, say, half yearly instead of annual, for  private

lorries  and  cars.  Those who always manage  to  keep  their

exhausts  clean could be granted incentives by having  lesser

inspections,  say,  biennially.   Those  who  are   genuinely

ignorant  of  how to keep exhausts clean could  be  sent  for

courses  in ITE.  Could the Minister comment on this proposed

measure?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2-stroke motorcycles, under the current

regulations,  registration of new  2-stroke  motorcycles  has

stopped.   But  there are still many on the road  which  were

registered  prior  to  the new regulation.   The  exhaust  of

unburnt  hydrocarbon  from  these  2-stroke  motorcycles   is

excessive,  visible,  smelly  and  irritate  our  visual  and

respiratory  system.   I  recall  that  once  I   entered   a

motorcycle  lane at the Causeway Checkpoint by mistake.   The

level of hydrocarbon from the motorcycles in the holding area

was highly unbearable and almost suffocating.  One



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1672</b></font><br><br>



hearing  this may just come to the conclusion that these  are

Malaysian  motorcycles.   To many  people's  surprise,  these

motorcycles bear Singapore registration plates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if that is the case, many of the old 2-stroke

motorcycles  are  already  being  disowned  by   our   fellow

Singaporeans.  It is time that we should consider phasing out

all these old and polluted machines from the road.  We have a

COE  system which entitles all vehicles to be on the road for

20  years  upon paying the prevailing COE premium, regardless

of  whether  the  vehicle complies with our current  emission

standards.   In the case of the 2-stroke motorcycles,  it  is

time  for  us to phase them out completely on the  ground  of

pollution  when their current COEs expire.   It is insensible

for  one  to pay so much for owning an environmentally  clean

vehicle, yet allowing this obvious pollution generator to  be

still  on  the  road.   Could the Minister  comment  on  this

matter?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our car users have invested very heavily in keeping

the  high quality of clean air in Singapore, because cars are

very  expensive,  partially  because  of  the  anti-pollution

devices.   I  would  like  to ask the  Minister  to  consider

imposing  the same vehicle emission standard for all  foreign

vehicles entering Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, motorcyclists are now

charged  for the offence of polluted exhaust based  on  video

evidence.  This topic was recently discussed in the media but

doubts linger.  The practice of using video evidence for this

purpose is a departure from previous practice where a vehicle

was  stopped  to  have its exhaust measured  for  pollutants.

Some  measurements were made and if the numbers  exceed  some

values,  the motorcyclist was then charged.  Today, it  seems

that  an  enforcement officer merely carries a video  camera,

takes  a  video  of  a vehicle with smoke emitting  from  its

exhaust and then sends the motorcyclist a summons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This description may seem simplistic, but this is how

the public sees it.   Many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1673</b></font><br><br>



questions  come to mind.  Some dangerous gases are colourless

and  not all coloured gases are dangerous.  Besides, what  is

captured on the video also depends on the lighting conditions

at  the time and place.  In the past, some numbers had to  be

adduced  by  measurement to substantiate the charge.   Unless

the  legislation has been changed, what scientific basis  has

been used to unmistakably correlate the video evidence to the

previously  used  measurements in terms  of  the  nature  and

density of the polluting chemicals?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask this question because some motorcyclists who have

been  so  charged had sent their vehicles for  the  mandatory

annual  check-up of their machines.  The vehicles passed  the

exhaust  test carried out in the traditional way.  I want  to

clarify that the check-ups were carried out at about the same

time  that  the  vehicles were said  to  have  committed  the

polluting  offence.  The motorcyclists assured me  that  they

did  not  modify their vehicles in any way before the  check-ups.   As a result, they were very baffled.  However, if  the

legislation has been amended to admit this form of  evidence,

then  I assume that there is some basis for its use that will

stand up to scientific and legal scrutiny.  This is important

as  most  vehicles, be it motorcycles, cars, lorries, trucks,

etc, do emit some smoke sometimes.  I would appreciate it  if

the  Minister could share with the House the basis upon which

video evidence is now used as evidence and, in so doing, help

to  answer some of the questions that I have just raised  and

hence  assure  the  public  of  the  soundness  of  this  new

practice.



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Sir, in Singapore, foul

smell  is  not  a pollution controlled parameter,  unless  it

causes  public nuisance or public health.  It is not uncommon

that  people are irritated by foul smell, either from rubbish

bin  centres,  rubbish chutes, liquid leakage   from  garbage

trucks  and smell from the farms.  Most of the people in  the

garbage   collection  business  proudly  claim   that   their

operations  are mechanised.  However, in their dealings  with

foul smell from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1674</b></font><br><br>



garbage, nothing much has been done, partly because there  is

no  environmental control requirement and partly because  the

people  are  immune to the smell after their  frequent  daily

contact with garbage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that some odour standard should be set by the

Ministry  to  keep all the odour generators  from  moderating

their  emission.   Certain operational  guidelines  could  be

recommended  for the bin centres, chutes and  liquid  leakage

from garbage trucks, so that some physical installations  are

in place to avoid or reduce the generation of foul smell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, foul smell is not only in Chua Chu Kang. I think

places  like Cheng San and other places also have  a  similar

situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Especially PAP wards!



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay:</b> Hougang also sometimes has

foul smell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to talk about other types of foul

smell, besides what happens in Hougang.  I would like to talk

about  smell from animal waste from the farms.  It is  common

that  people  complain about smell from the farms  and  point

their  fingers directly or immediately at the egg farms  that

generate  the  waste.   There is no doubt  that  these  farms

generate  the  waste.  But the smell of the  waste  could  be

intensified  by the widespread application of the  biological

fertiliser  used  by  the landscape companies  and  vegetable

farmers.   The  reason is that we now have so-called  organic

farm  products which are very attractive to consumers.  So  a

lot  of  biological fertilisers are used and they generate  a

lot of smell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain farms have their own waste treatment facility.

Those who do not have waste treatment facility supply the raw

untreated waste to farmers.  And the way the farmer uses  the

raw  waste  can cause the objectionable smell that  leads  to

people's complaint.  On one occasion, a NUS researcher wanted

to do a modelling of the pollution dispersion from a chicken



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1675</b></font><br><br>



farm.  When the farmer asked him to provide some data to know

what   will   be  the  acceptable  emission  level   at   the

complainant's end, no answer was given.  What does  it  mean?

It  means that even the pollution researcher himself  has  no

basic  pollution emission standard for him to use as a  basis

for  his study.  In other words, there is no standard of what

the  odour  level will be acceptable.  Without an  acceptable

odour  limit  on  the complainant's end, the complaint  would

then become relatively arbitrary.  In my view, we should  try

to find out from other advanced countries and learn from them

how  we  could set an acceptable odour limit.  Only by  doing

so,  our  farmers could then concentrate on their  production

issue  instead  of  having  to deal  with  the  environmental

officers every now and then when the people complain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also have guidelines for the planters to

follow if they are using the untreated biological fertiliser.



<br>5.15 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan (Minister for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for the Environment (Mr Lee Yock Suan):</b> Sir, I wish to thank all Members for bringing up a wide range

of  environmental  issues.  This gives me an  opportunity  to

clarify   the  situation  and  also  to  explain   some   new

initiatives on the part of the Ministry.  I was very happy to

note  also that the debate has been very lively and it  seems

to have provided a lot of room for humour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Heng Chiang Meng's point that environment is

everybody's  concern, and it is unfortunate that the  present

situation of our clean streets and low level of littering  is

mainly  due to the work of our cleaners.  Ideally, we  should

evolve  to  a  stage where people just do  not  litter.   The

schools are teaching the students this.  Day-in day-out  they

are teaching them not to litter, how to clean toilets and  so

on.    Unfortunately,  this  message  still  has   not   been

internalised.  I think this could be partly due to  the  fact

that a lot of people moved from the kampongs and the villages

in  the past.  In those days when you were in the village, it

did not matter, you just threw your rubbish everywhere.  If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1676</b></font><br><br>



you  were living in a low rise attap house, it did not matter

if  you  threw  out  your TV set, if  you  wanted  to.    But

nowadays  if you are living in a highrise building,  you  may

kill somebody.  In fact, some years back when I first started

as  an  MP, I think HDB had to station teams to catch  people

who  threw  bags of curry powder out from their  windows  and

caused a lot of problems.  Hopefully, this situation has  now

improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, littering is still a problem. If Members

have  good ideas on how to overcome this problem, I would  be

most grateful.  Of course, we are also trying to involve  the

community, and as mentioned by my predecessor, Mr  Yeo  Cheow

Tong,  we should have a civic group to help us in this  area.

Therefore,  I  am happy to announce that we  have  this  year

formed  a  private group known as the Anti-Littering Steering

Committee  which is chaired by Mr Wong Yew Kwan,  the  former

Commissioner   of  Parks  and  Recreation  Department.    The

Committee  consists of some 20 civic-minded individuals  from

both the private and public sectors as well as non-government

organisations.  So far, they have had two meetings this  year

since its formation and I am hoping they will be able to come

out  with some fresh perspectives and fresh ideas on  how  we

can tackle this problem.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br>5.20 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, for us, there are also other people who are

similarly civic-minded and I would like here just to  mention

a few groups.  One, of course, is the Singapore Environmental

Council  on which several Members are involved, including  Mr

Simon  Tay.  I think they are playing a very useful  role  in

areas,  for example, like the haze problems and other  areas,

the  green  plan, for example.  Also, there is the  Waterways

Watch  Society, which consists of members who  come  together

and  patrol the Singapore River in the Society's boats  on  a

regular basis every Sunday to look out for stretches  of  the

river that are polluted.  They will then provide the feedback

to my Ministry and to the Marine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1677</b></font><br><br>



and  Port  Authority to take action.  Fortunately, after  all

these  years  of  cleaning up the river, we have  achieved  a

tremendous result.  And if you compare the condition  of  the

river  at  the time when we were children, many  of  us  were

schooling  in town, the river was just terrible.  We  had  to

hold our noses when we went by.  Now it is clean and fish  is

able to breed.  We have not only cleaned up all the unsewered

areas,  but  we  have sewered them.  We have cleaned  up  the

rivers, provided drainage  and so on.  But also we have these

booms  which trap the rubbish.  These are placed  at  various

locations draining into the Singapore River.  Even now, every

day  my  Ministry has to collect some two tonnes of  rubbish.

We  must  continue to press on with our efforts to make  sure

that the environment is kept clean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to assure Prof. Toh that we do pay special

attention  to  the Singapore River and the civic  areas.   Of

course, these are very crowded places, especially where there

are  food  centres.   It is important that  these  areas  are

provided  with  adequate facilities to handle the  volume  of

rubbish.  We have our inspectors go around to make sure  that

they do not throw rubbish into the river.  Unfortunately,  as

it  was mentioned, the river is not spotlessly clean all  the

time.  We do have to be vigilant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh mentioned that some vehicles keep their

engines running in Chinatown when they drop the tourists off.

If  possible, they should shut off their engines  and  reduce

the  volume  of  pollution.  But it is fair that  before  the

tourists go on board they cool down the bus a little bit.  So

for  a  few minutes, they should run their engines  and  cool

down  the buses.  Otherwise they should shut down the engines

and avoid polluting the atmosphere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang seems to say that our fines are too

heavy and CWO is not working.  I am not so pessimistic.   The

data is a bit difficult to interpret because it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1678</b></font><br><br>



partly depends on where our officers are, whether they happen

to  catch the people and also the amount of manpower we  have

to  deploy.  This idea of empowering more civilians is a good

one.   Of  course,  I  do not know how many  individuals  are

willing  to do it.  We have offered it to grassroots  leaders

and  some  of  them are reluctant because they have  to  meet

their  neighbours and there is always this fear that  if  you

are  too  tough  you  might get a bloody nose,  or  something

worse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Kenneth Chen mentioned an interesting point, and that

is  the condominiums seem to be cleaner.  I think this has to

do with the mindset.  He has a valid point there, although Mr

Low  Thia Khiang seems to think otherwise.  It is a fact that

somehow  when they move into a better environment  they  have

this  feeling of responsibility.  I think within condominiums

and  private housing they have a greater sense of  ownership.

So  the residents are more careful.   For example, in private

estates  the lifts are generally cleaner.  Whereas  for  many

years, the HDB lifts are terrible.  Every time I went for  my

house-to-house visits we just had to bear the stench  in  the

lifts,  so much so that we have to depend not only on  public

education but also on installing the devices in the lifts  to

actually catch the people who urinate in the lifts.    So  we

can come out with new ideas, not just educating people, using

peer  pressure and so on, but maybe new devices, new methods,

new perspectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I want to touch on this point raised by Prof. Low

Seow  Chay about the recycling of sewerage effluent.   He  is

correct.   We are in the process of setting up a pilot  plant

of 10,000 cubic metres per day capacity at the Bedok Sewerage

Treatment Works.  It is currently under construction and will

be  in  operation in May.  So it is not quite operating  yet.

Thereafter physical, chemical and micro-biological tests will

be  carried out over a two-year period on water samples  from

the  plant.   The  purpose  of  the  plant  is  to  test  the

technology  and  costs for consideration  as  an  alternative

source  of  reclaimed water.  The reclaimed  water  from  the

plant will be used for non-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1679</b></font><br><br>



potable  applications  such as watering  of  lawns  and  golf

courses and for industrial use.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, in extreme cases, if you look just at water

scientifically, it can be shown that the quality is  as  good

as  water  from natural catchments.  It can even be used  for

drinking but  there is the psychological barrier we  have  to

overcome.   It is a fact that in some countries water  is  in

fact  recycled many times.  If you are living along the banks

of the Thames River, for example, by the time you receive the

water downstream, I do not know how many times the cycle  has

gone  through. Of course, the natural system is that sunlight

brings  up  the water and it comes down as rain and  you  are

quite  happy  with  that.  But when  you  use  the  technical

treatment to get clean water from the sewerage effluent,  you

can use it for industrial purposes.  I think we still have to

pause and do proper education if we ever want to put it back,

say,   as   a  source  of  raw  water.   So  these  are   the

possibilities we are experimenting.  Of course, we  are  also

doing  work on reverse osmosis processes for the desalination

of  sea water.  In Singapore, there is a good case for us  to

put  in all the efforts and allow research into various means

of  reclaiming  water,  both from  the  sea  and  from  other

sources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject of genetically modified food is, of course,

a  very  controversial  subject.  It is  the  result  of  the

tremendous  developments  in  gene  technology  where  it  is

possible  to take genes from insects, for example, and  plant

them  into  crops and so forth, and get qualities which  were

not there before.  As a result of this, people are fearful of

the  unknown.  At the same time, it promises us solutions  to

the  hunger problem, to diseases and all that, but it  raises

many  ethical questions.  It raises doubts.  That is why  the

Government is following this very closely.  It is a potential

area  for  us to develop.  We are putting a lot of  resources

into research.  We hope to be a centre of life sciences,  not

only  in terms of R&D, but in terms of manufacturing  and  so

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we monitor how the international

community is reacting to all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1680</b></font><br><br>



this.   It  is not a straightforward question of  wanting  to

know.  It is also a question of trade protectionism.  If  you

were  a  big  country like the US and 50% of the crops,  soya

beans  or  corns are from these sources, and your  scientists

have  already  done all they can to make sure that  they  are

safe and if you compare that the  qualities are the same  and

so  on, then you are fearful that if you start labelling, you

put  people  off  the crop.  That is why there  is  this  big

battle  between  the Europeans and the US over  whether  they

should  label.  The Europeans on their part have  not  had  a

good  record.  They have handled badly many instances of  the

mad  cow  disease and dioxin and so on, that the  public  has

lost confidence in the European governments. Therefore, under

pressure from the NGOs, they are now very forceful, and  also

pressure  from their farmers who are affected  by  all  these

crops.   They  are asking for labelling, they  want  to  have

their  right  to ban imports and so on.  The US says,  "Okay,

you can do all that, but is it WTO consistent?  Is it a trade

barrier?"   That is why in Singapore we have to  monitor  all

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, we want to be a centre for this area.

We  want to protect our citizens against some unknown  health

hazards.   We want to make sure that it does not pollute  the

environment  through introducing genes  that  would  lead  to

unknown  results.  Whether it is time to label, I think  this

is a question we have to consider very carefully.  There is a

committee  set up known as the Genetic Modification  Advisory

Committee.  This is chaired by Prof. Lim Pin and it  consists

of  all  the relevant Ministries, including my Ministry,  PPD

and  so on.  MTI is, of course, represented.  So we will have

to   follow  what  is  happening  in  other  areas   in   the

international  scene and then decide for  ourselves  what  is

best  for  Singapore.  The assessment has got to be rational.

It  must  not  be  coloured by all  these  hue  and  cry  and

posturings  overseas.   Look  at  the  basics.   Assess   for

ourselves, is it really safe, what you want to do  about  it.

At  the  moment,  it  is  still premature  for  us  to  start

labelling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of labelling, if you want to be very stringent

about it, can be prohibitive.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1681</b></font><br><br>



Take  soya  sauce,  if  you trace all the  way  back  to  the

producers  and  whether the producers are using gene-modified

crops,  it is going to be a tremendous effort, and I  am  not

sure whether it is really practical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, they had a meeting in Montreal where they

reached  an agreement known as the Cartagena Protocol.   This

was  really a conference on biodiversity, but somehow the 130

countries  which were represented managed to talk about  this

area as well, what they call living modified organisms.  Some

countries seem to have got the point that countries should be

allowed  to have the control, should be allowed to  stop  the

imports  of LMOs, or they should be in a position to ask  for

labelling,  and  so  on.   But, to  my  mind,   there  is  no

consensus yet, and we are monitoring the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members should be careful not to stir up a lot

of  irrational fears because this is an area of  the  unknown

and where it is unknown people tend to be very fearful.  This

is  an  area which is going to have so much impact on mankind

that so much attention is being focused on it.  When you  eat

an ordinary food

product, you do not know what goes into it.  You look at  the

label, so many chemical components.  Have you asked yourself:

Are  these components safe, and how safe is the world anyway?

So  we  have to be careful, but at the same time we  must  be

rational.



<br>5.30 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is quite a bit of interest in clean toilets. I

agree  fully that the measure of the culture of a country  is

the cleanliness of its toilets, putting on both my hats (MITA

and Environment).  Mr Ang Mong Seng mentioned some places  in

Korea where they are so proud of their toilets that they even

have  tourists visit the toilets.  And they say that you  can

have tea in the toilets.  Whether we can reach that standard,

I am not sure.  If you go to some hotels, they are very clean

and beautifully done up, and you have flowers, paintings and,

of  course,  you  have  regular cleaning.   And  it  is  very

important for hotels to have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1682</b></font><br><br>



clean  toilets, because the first thing that turns  away  the

guests is to see an untidy toilet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we hope to do the same thing in the other sectors.

Where  it  concerns the Government toilets, that is  an  easy

matter.   The Environment Ministry is already doing  it.   We

will  be upgrading the public toilets in all 34 hawker stalls

which  are  managed by Environment.  So far, three have  been

completed at a cost of about half a million dollars.  We hope

to  complete  the  rest by 2004 at an estimated  cost  of  $4

million.   HDB,  on  its part, has also upgraded  23  of  its

hawker centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ang asked how many public toilets are there.

Speaking  from memory here, I think there are something  like

30,000  public toilets, in coffee shops, hawker centres,  bus

stops, cinemas, and the rest.  Those are the difficult  ones.

I  think  for the hotels, the 4- and 5-star hotels, they  are

generally very good.  The shopping centres are generally good

too,  but there is room for improvement.  And there are these

small places where sometimes the facilities are somewhat  old

and lacking and upkeep is below expectation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our surveys have shown that there has been an

improvement overall, but there is still room for improvement.

Last   year,   the  Ministry,  together  with  the   experts,

consultants and others came up with this guide book,  "Better

Public   Toilets,   Design  and  Maintenance"   [indicating].

Hopefully,  one  day, all our public toilets will  look  like

this [indicating].  This will be a desirable goal.  But if it

is  a  toilet belonging to a coffeeshop owner, I am not  sure

whether  you  can use the force of law to say it  must  spend

$100,000 to upgrade its toilet.  I think there we have to use

persuasion and maybe incentives.  So this is an area where we

will be looking into and the Environment Ministry is chairing

a  committee, involving several other Ministries (HDB, NParks

and  so  on), to try and give this a special push.  Something

as mundane as the toilet actually plays a very important part

in  our  lives.  When people renovate their houses  nowadays,

they  pay  a  lot of attention to the toilets,  and  I  think

rightly so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1683</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several questions were asked about vehicle emissions,

the  use of the video camera to catch the heavy vehicles  and

motorcycles  which emit smoke.  This was done  up  to  August

last  year by the Traffic Police.  We decided that we  should

do  it  ourselves because pollution is more our  problem  and

they  have  other priorities.  When we took over, we  decided

that  the best way is actually to use a video camera, because

you  have  a  record of the black smoke or the blue-and-white

smoke  that  comes from the motorcycles.  For the  two-stroke

motorcycles,  if  the owner adds too much  lubricant  to  the

engine, the result is pollution - blue-and-white smoke.   And

this  smoke cannot be tested by the normal machine, which  is

HSU-based.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the regulations, if there is visible smoke, then

it  is  an offence.  There is no doubt about that.  The limit

for  this HSU test, or the Hartridge Smoke Unit test,  is  50

HSU, that corresponds to visible smoke.  So what we do is  we

have  CISCO  police shoot the exhaust of these vehicles,  and

based  on  these records, there will be a panel  of  officers

within the Ministry who will decide which cases are bad.  For

those cases, they will be issued with summonses to pay  up  a

fine  as well as to send their vehicles for testing.  In  the

past,  the Traffic Police have to actually test on the  spot.

And basically the HSU tests the same thing, whether there  is

visible smoke.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the past was that you have to stop

traffic,  and  it was very troublesome.  Many vehicle  owners

just depended on the Government to catch them.  It was a cat-and-mouse effort.  If I were caught, I would go and  maintain

my  machine, clean it up, and then send for testing, and when

I  pass, everything would be fine.  Now, we say that  if  you

are caught on this video camera, you will be fined, and after

that, you must still get your vehicle properly maintained and

re-tested.   If  the  person affected is  not  happy,  he  is

invited  to come to my Ministry to view the record.  So  far,

the  cases that come, the lawyers tell them that there is  no

case, that they better pay up.  Because it is very clear,  it

is all on record.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1684</b></font><br><br>



My  officers will give the benefit of the doubt to those  who

are borderline cases.  If it is clearly very black smoke, you

cannot  run  away from it.  But if it is slightly smoky,  you

just  tell the person, go and maintain and clean up,  and  go

for a test, and there is no fine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, because of the appeals from MPs and others, we

have reconsidered the level of the compound fines, especially

for  motorcycles.  The previous fine level of  $150  for  the

first  offence was rather heavy for some of these  low-income

people.   So  I decided to lower it to $70.  And  it  is  not

correct  to say that the first offence would incur a  penalty

of  $500,  as one Member has mentioned.  The actual level  is

$150   for  heavy  vehicles  for  the  first  offence.    For

motorcycles,  it used to be $150, but I have  lowered  it  to

$70.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Boon Wan asked how is it that they were fined,

and when they went for a test they passed the test.  It is  a

fact that it is possible to arrange the engines such that you

can  pass  the  test,  because the testing  is  under  idling

conditions.   So  if you rev up your engine, you  do  certain

things  to  it,  you  will pass the test.   But  when  it  is

running,  it  is  under load, you will  get  smoke.   We  are

planning to counter this problem by introducing what is known

as the chassis dynamometer test.  This is a test, CDST, which

has  already been introduced in Hong Kong, Canada and the US.

This  allows  you  to set the load level and  then  test  the

machine.   So  there  is no running away  from  this  system.

There will be no dispute.  We intend to start doing this from

September this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Malaysian vehicles, and they used to be very

bad  polluters, all the motorcycles coming in with their two-stroke cycle engines, and the heavy trucks, we catch them  at

the  location near the Causeway when they come in.  For them,

we  have to test them and fine them on the spot, because  you

cannot  go  and take record, send them letters and hope  they

will respond.  So for motorcycles and vehicles from Malaysia,

our teams will spot them, stop them and test them.  And



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1685</b></font><br><br>



if  they  fail the test, they will be fined on the spot.   In

fact, if the HSU limit exceeds 50, they will be fined.  If it

is  above 80, their vehicles will be turned back to Malaysia.

And  this  is, of course, a very heavy penalty for the  goods

vehicles which are carrying all the goods down from Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to leave the other questions to be answered by

my Senior Minister of State, Mr Sidek Saniff.



<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek Bin Saniff (Senior Minister of State for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for the Environment (Encik Sidek bin Saniff):</b> Sir, Mr Kenneth Chen asked about

recycling.  I agree with Mr Chen that we must learn to reduce

wastes and, wherever possible, reuse things rather than throw

them  away.   The  principle  of "polluters  pay  principle",

suggested  by Mr Chen, is a good principle which my  Ministry

has  adopted.  We have implemented a programme to remove  the

subsidy  in  waste disposal.  Disposal fees will increase  to

$87  per tonne over the next few years, as announced  by  the

Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are problems on the proposal to charge fees

for  the increasing amount of waste thrown by residents.   In

our  HDB estates, common refuse chutes make it impossible  to

identify  the resident and the amount of refuse he  generated

for  charging purposes.  In our landed property  estates,  we

have  considered the use of pre-paid bags, but realised  that

unidentified  bags would create collection problems,  and  we

have  these problems.  Nonetheless, we will continue to  work

with  our  public waste collection contractors on schemes  to

encourage the minimisation of waste generation.  Due  to  our

tropical  weather,  refuse has to be  disposed  of  daily  to

prevent  public health problems, rather than what the  Member

suggested, about three days once as in Canada.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Encik Harun Ghani asked about flood prone areas.

There  are now 250 hectares of flood prone areas as  compared

to some 3,200 hectares in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1686</b></font><br><br>



the  1970s.  These flood prone areas are located in some  117

locations  across  the island.  The permanent  ones  are  the

Chinatown  area, Alexandra Road area, including Jervois  Road

and  Margaret Drive, Opera Estate, Lorong 101, Changi and the

Farrer Park area.  Some roads which are prone to flash floods

include  Balestier Road, Killiney Road and Selegie Road.   At

the  moment,  we  are improving the Alexandra  canal  between

Tanglin  Road  and  Kim  Seng  Road  to  reduce  flooding  in

Alexandra  Road,  including Jervois Road and Margaret  Drive.

We  are  also  building a new drainage  pumping  station  cum

storage   pond   to   keep  the  Opera   Estate   flood-free.

Construction  work  for many other drainage  projects  is  in

progress.  These projects, when completed, will help to bring

down the number of flood prone areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, it is not feasible to completely rid

Singapore of all floods.  Firstly, some of the areas, such as

those  in  Chinatown, Boat Quay and Dakota Crescent are  very

low-lying and are barely above the high tide level.  The only

economically  feasible  method  at  present  to  resolve  the

flooding  in  these  areas  is  to  fill  up  the  land  upon

redevelopment.  Secondly, there is a limit to  which  we  can

widen  drains  because  land is a constraint.   Very  intense

rainfall which may occur once in every five years or so would

overwhelm  the  capacity of the drains  and  cause  temporary

flash floods.  Such floods, however, would be minor and of  a

short-term duration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encik Harun also asked whether in 10 years' time

Singapore  would  be  free  from flood.   Out  of  these  250

hectares,  we  are  left  only  with  about  70  hectares  at

Chinatown.    If   there  is  redevelopment,   there   is   a

possibility,  whether it is five years or 10  years.   So  it

depends on the redevelopment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Encik Harun also asked about dengue fever and malaria.

Sir,  the  dengue fever and malaria situation in 1999  was  a

huge improvement over 1998.  Dengue cases came down more than

70%, from 5,258 cases in 1998 to only 1,355 cases in 1999.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1687</b></font><br><br>



There were two deaths though.  One was a foreign construction

worker  and  the other was a permanent resident.  We  believe

they  sought medical attention too late.  Malaria cases  have

dropped  from  36  in  1998 to 10 in  1999.   The  number  of

imported malaria cases, that is infected outside of Singapore

but  was treated in Singapore, has also dropped from  396  in

1998  to  306  in  1999.  There was one  death  which  is  an

imported case.



<br>5.45 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will remain vigilant against these communicable

diseases  to  ensure that our population continues  to  enjoy

high  standards of public health.  My Ministry has also given

more  focus  on  research, especially  on  dengue,  and  also

working closely with the tertiary institutions on a number of

projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Harun Ghani also asked about waste collection.

We  are  satisfied with the services rendered  by  our  three

licensed  public waste collectors that we have  appointed  so

far.   All  of  them  are performing in accordance  with  the

service   standard   required.   One  of   them   encountered

difficulties  during  the  first  week  of  operation.  Their

workers  found the work too strenuous and could not  complete

their  route  on  time.  This resulted in a backlog  and  the

situation  of  course snowballed.  The company  remedied  the

problem  by  shortening the length of some of the routes  and

that meant having to bring extra vehicles and of course extra

manpower.   During  this  period, some residents  experienced

irregular  service, with no collection on certain days.   The

teething  problem  lasted 10 days.   The  company  was  fined

$25,500 for the lapse in service standard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry is currently reviewing the tender

specifications  and  plans to call the third  sector  in  the

first  half  of  this year.  Details of the  sector  will  be

announced later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chiam See Tong asked about refuse collection

from  residential properties.  If residents use proper refuse

bins with a cover and deposit their refuse



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1688</b></font><br><br>



inside  these bins, then it will be difficult for  strays  to

get  at it.  It would help further if residents do not  bring

out  their  refuse  at night.  However, I  agree  that  waste

collectors should communicate with residents about when their

truck will arrive so that the refuse need not be put out  too

early.   If Mr Chiam can give me more details, I will ask  my

officers  to  look  into  this  matter,  whether  it  is   at

Carmichael Road, Sennett Estate, or Woodleigh.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for 5 am, we have never asked any resident to put out

their  refuse at that hour because the truck will come around

9  o'clock.   Unless of course one is an early riser  like  a

Muslim, one loves one's wife and one does not want her to put

the rubbish outside so early in the morning.  One can put  it

out  oneself when one goes to the mosque.  But I  can  assure

you, Sir, that they start their collection at about 9 o'clock

and finish around noon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the use of gloves, we do not make it compulsory. We

leave  it  to the discretion of the companies.  If they  want

to,  they can ask, at their own discretion, their workers  to

use gloves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann asked about the allocation of market and

eating stalls.  Sir, the decision to tender out vacant hawker

stalls  to the general public instead of allocating  them  to

hardship  cases  was  taken  in  1990  for  several  reasons.

Operating  a  hawker  stall  is a business  that  requires  a

financial investment and good culinary skills.  Many hardship

cases  who  were allotted stalls in the past were  unable  to

operate  their stalls profitably and their businesses failed,

leading  to  more  financial  hardship.   Some  resorted   to

subletting  their  stalls illegally.  It was  felt  that  the

hawker  business  is  best left to the people  with  culinary

skills,  while  hardship cases should  seek  other  forms  of

employment.  The present method of renting out vacant  stalls

through public tender allows everyone with culinary skills to

venture  into  the  food retail trade.  He will  operate  the

stall  under market conditions and will strive to  work  hard

and  to do well, and this will benefit not only him but  also

his customers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of market produce stalls, there are

many vacant stalls available and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1689</b></font><br><br>



it  would  not  be difficult to get one at a very  reasonable

rent.   In fact, in two wet markets, that is, in Commonwealth

Avenue and Balestier Road, you can just walk in and apply  on

the spot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Prof. Toh See Kiat asked about solar energy. Sir,

products that harness solar energy to supply heated water are

well  commercialised, and they are already being used in some

commercial facilities and private homes in Singapore.  It  is

left  to  the  building  industry to  decide  on  their  cost

effectiveness.   On its part, the Government  encourages  the

use of such products.  My Ministry administers an accelerated

depreciation  scheme which allows the capital investment  for

solar  heating or cooling system and solar energy  collection

system to be expensed off in one year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One notable application is the solar heating system of

the  flight  kitchen  building of  the  Changi  International

Airport  Services (CIAS).  The system provides hot water  for

the   preparation  of  food,  cooking,  washing  and  bathing

facilities.   CIAS  has  achieved  substantial  cost   saving

through the use of this system.  MINDEF has also installed  a

solar  power  system at the Tuas Naval Base as a pilot  study

and  is  looking  into  larger scale  applications  when  the

technology  to  convert  solar energy  into  electricity  has

achieved further breakthroughs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while products to harness our solar energy to

supply  heated  water  are readily available  in  the  market

place,  the application of technology to collect solar energy

on  a large scale to produce electricity still faces a number

of   major   constraints.   Given  the  state  of  the   art,

electricity  production from solar energy is far more  costly

than conventional form of electricity generation.  The growth

in  the  use  of  solar  energy  will  have  to  depend  upon

technology  breakthroughs to harvest it in a  cost  effective

manner  and  minimum  space  utilisation.   That  is  another

constraint - space utilisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, research in large scale collection of

solar energy is limited.  I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1690</b></font><br><br>



would  like to encourage local researchers and private sector

companies to be involved in this area of research.  They  can

apply  to the National Science and Technology Board  for  R&D

funding for their research projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Prof. Low Seow Chay talked about foul smell. Sir,

our  refuse  will smell,  with the warm and humid climate  we

have.   For this reason, special attention must be  given  to

it,  starting from the person who generates the refuse to the

person who collects the refuse for disposal.  Refuse must  be

bagged  before  they are thrown down the chute and  cleansing

workers  must  cover the refuse when they convey  the  refuse

from  the chute chambers to the bin centres and do so without

spillage.   At the bin centre, the refuse must be  stored  in

covered  bulk  bins.  It is the duty of the town  council  to

ensure all this.  The refuse from the bin centres are removed

daily  by  appointed  contractors in  covered  trucks.   Town

councils  should  report  to  the  Ministry  if  the   refuse

collection contractors spill refuse after emptying  the  bulk

bins, or if they do not perform.  When everyone cooperates in

this way, then the smell nuisance can be minimised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are of course engineering solutions such as

the  use  of mechanised refuse handling equipment  like  dust

screw  conveyors  and compactors in bin  centres  which  will

minimise manual handling and consequently spillage.  All  new

HDB  flats  built after 1990 have such equipment.  Refuse  is

also  collected daily to reduce smell problem.  As for refuse

trucks, they should not be leaking sludge water because these

are  specially  designed vehicles, unless of  course  if  the

operator is careless, otherwise it would not leak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refuse trucks have internal compaction units and upon

compacting  the  refuse in the truck, they  are  required  to

drain  off the surplus water into sewers provided for at  the

bin  centres.   This will prevent sludge water from  spilling

out  when  the  vehicle  is driven.   Licensed  public  waste

collectors  are  penalised  if  this  happens.    Sir,   town

councils  should report cases of refuse truck  leaking  waste

water in their estate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1691</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of smell at Sungei Tengah Agro-technology

Park  arose  from the chicken dung generated by four  chicken

farms in the park.  Last year, one of the four farms operated

a  composting plant which will convert the chicken dung  into

fertiliser  and  this  aggravated  the  smell  nuisance.   My

Ministry, together with PPD, the licensing authority  of  the

farm,  intervened  and  the  farm installed  odour  treatment

measures.  The number of complaints dropped after  that.   My

Ministry will work with the Primary Production Department  to

see how best the problem can be further minimised.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I have your permission to

clarify?



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can you give Mr Sin the floor first?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Thank you, Sir. Just some points of

clarification for the Senior Minister of State.   The  Senior

Minister  of State said that, some years ago, the Environment

Ministry  allocated the hawker stalls to the poor  and  needy

and from past experience, many of these stalls had failed  in

their businesses.  I would like to ask the SMS whether or not

in  those  cases guidance had been given to these  people  to

operate  these stalls and to help them along,  or  were  they

just  given  a stall and were expected to make a  success  of

these stalls.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I am not saying that the policy should be

changed  in  its entirety.  What I am saying is that  perhaps

some  stalls could be set aside to be allocated to those poor

and needy families who can be trained to run these businesses

properly.   And my last point is that yes, SMS has said  that

there  are stalls available for rental to the poorer families

if they tender for it.  Could I also ask the Ministry to make

this information readily available at least to the Members of

Parliament  so  that they can inform the  residents  of  such

vacancies as and when these cases come to them?



<br><br><!-- Encik Sidek bin Saniff -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Sidek bin Saniff:</b> Sir, in my reply just now, the

second part of the question



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1692</b></font><br><br>



is  taken care of.  As for the former, times have changed and

the  society  has  also  changed.   Because  of  that,  as  I

mentioned earlier, there are people who are in need of  help.

By  giving them the stalls, it somehow makes them suffer even

further.  And the number is increasing.  And because of that,

the  Government came to the conclusion and made  a  decision.

As of now, the position stands.



<br>6.00 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I am not going to withdraw my

amendment yet.  While the Minister and the Senior Minister of

State have given replies to a lot of questions, I still would

like  to  hear  the  Minister's comments  on  my  idea  of  a

comprehensive  masterplan, including the  total  approach  to

resolving   some   of  the  issues  that   affect   us   and,

environmentally-wise,  are we using the  business  community,

the  people  and  all  resources  available,  including,  for

example, financial measures such as the stick and the carrot?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, since we still have time, I would like to ask

the  Minister for his views and comments on what his Ministry

would do in view of the many reported forest fires in Sumatra

and  the possibility that it might affect us in terms of  the

haze.   And  should the wind direction change and  bring  the

smoke  from  these  fires to Singapore  shores,  whether  the

quality of the air that we breathe in will be as bad  as  the

last  time,  about  11/2 years ago, when we  experienced  the

haze.   I think his comments on this would be very useful  to

us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b> Sir, I take Mr Heng's comments about

the  masterplan.  We will have further discussions  with  him

about  exactly  what he has in mind.  Of course,  we  already

have a green plan which we are updating and some of the ideas

could be incorporated into that plan.   And as I mentioned in

my  reply, we have already involved various community  groups

and others and it is our intention to continue to involve  as

many people as possible in this community effort.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1693</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the incentives, we already have green

awards,  we  have  incentives for people to conserve  energy,

reduce  pollution and so on. I take it that  we  should  take

stock and think of whether we can do more in a total plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the haze situation, we had a respite last year

because   of  the  wet  weather,  wetter-than-usual  weather.

Unfortunately,  we are coming to the tail  end  of  this  wet

weather phenomenon and now, we find that whenever it  is  dry

over  in  Sumatra or Kalimantan, they will start to burn  and

these  are not only the small-scale farmers but also the  big

plantations.   The satellite pictures show very clearly  that

these  are plantation owners.  The Malaysian Minister  and  I

myself  have written to the Indonesian Environment  Minister,

expressing our concern.  He had a meeting with the  President

and  the  Cabinet and I believe that they are doing the  best

they  can  to  try and resolve this problem.  It  is  a  very

difficult  issue because there are so many fires.  They  must

have  the  political will and really punish a  few  of  these

plantation owners. So far, they have threatened to suspend or

cancel  the licence of these plantation owners.   And  it  is

obvious from this satellite, you pinpoint the location, which

is the particular place.  But I am not sure, at this point in

time,  to  what extent the laws are watertight, whether  they

can  catch  these people, unless they have actual on-the-spot

evidence.  So  far, they have been able to blame  it  on  the

small farmers clearing the land and causing the fire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to work with them. I will be meeting my

counterparts  within ASEAN in Brunei in early April,  and  we

will  have to do our best on the Government side, as well  as

the NGOs, to see how we can resolve this problem. My fear  is

that  we are going to enter into another dry spell very soon.

The expectation is that the next El Nino phenomenon may occur

this   year  or  early  next  year,  and  if  this  situation

continues,  we will have a haze like 1997 and, in that  case,

if you are asthmatic, you had better put some filters on your

air-conditioner. There is really no escape



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1694</b></font><br><br>



from  the haze. The particles are so fine, they go into  your

house,  they  go  everywhere.  I dread to think  we  have  to

tolerate a few more months of such conditions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Clarification, Sir. The Minister

agrees  with  Kenneth Chen that people who  live  in  private

condominiums are more civic-minded than people  who  live  in

HDB estates.  That is what he said. I would like to ask ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. "Guillotine" time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen:</b> I have never said that they are more

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chiang Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chiang Meng:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister and the

Senior  Minister of State for their replies.  I am sure  that

most  of  us are quite satisfied with the replies and  I  beg

leave to withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head I -



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head I - Ministry of Communications and

Information Technology.  Mr Chay.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head I of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recent announcement by the Ministry on the

accelerated  pace of liberalisation of the telecommunications

sector by April 2000, and the lifting of foreign equity limit

in this sector immediately, are policies to be applauded.  It

will  facilitate the build-up of our city state into an info-communication hub.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this means that the Government has to make

compensation  to the two operators, SingTel and StarHub,  for

the loss of the so-called duopoly status. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1695</b></font><br><br>



is  of  interest to the public and to the investors  how  the

Government  intends to compensate them. Do  the  compensation

criteria  for the two need to be the same, and on what  basis

of real sunk investments?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that whatever the basis of compensation, it must

also  reflect the state of dynamic change in this  sector  of

business, with the attendant risk being a factor which has to

be discounted. Otherwise, public funds may not be put to good

use.   Will  the Minister tell the House what  has  been  the

interest by foreign investors since the liberalisation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there still a national strategic role for a major

national telecommunication player in Singapore in view of the

fact  that ready and appropriate access to telecommunications

technology is of critical importance to Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have also heard recently of the

telecommunications services development in Singapore and Hong

Kong.   In  many  surveys  and reports done  internationally,

Singapore  usually  comes across as a more regulated  economy

and   Hong   Kong   a  more  laissez-faire   one.    In   the

telecommunications services sector, this seems to work in the

favour  of  Hong Kong in the perception of business investors

who   have   the  capital  or  those  owners  of  proprietary

technologies intending to make their presence in Asia or  the

region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Minister give us some benchmark indicators of

how  we  stack  against  Hong Kong  especially  in  terms  of

infrastructures, pricing, inter-connectivity  and  the  range

and  quality  of  our  services?   This  will  also  put   in

perspective to the public how and where we stand in order for

us  to mount the next step forward.  And have we really  done

enough to market ourselves and to the right audience?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I take the third topic, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, carry on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> The next item I want to talk about

and ask the Minister is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1696</b></font><br><br>



on   the   licensing  fee  structure.    In   view   of   the

liberalisation  measures  taken  for  the  telecommunications

sector, almost anyone can come and join in the fun. In  order

to attract interest, it is necessary to see that the existing

structure  of  licensing  fees  for  operators  and   service

providers is appropriate under the liberalised regime.  Also,

we  have  to make the business competitive and the  consumers

get value for their money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I feel it is important that substantial revision

in  the  licensing  fees be done, so as  not  to  negate  the

benefit of liberalisation. Will the Minister be able to  give

his views on this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, first let me thank Mr

Chay  for his comments.   He has raised a few points  on  the

liberalisation  of the telecommunications  sector.   Firstly,

the  compensation to the two operators, SingTel and  StarHub,

that  is,  what is the basis and the criteria, and how  much.

The  compensation issue is being undertaken by  a  consultant

that we have engaged from the United States who undertook the

first  assignment when we first compensated SingTel in  1996.

The   criteria  are  being  worked  out  together  with   the

consultant and the companies, and we will have to  make  sure

that  we  are  fair to all parties. We do not want  to  over-compensate  them and, at the same time, we also  have  to  be

sure that we are fair to ourselves and the people because  we

are dealing with public money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has also asked about the interest of the foreign

investors  with  the  liberalisation.   Since  I   made   the

announcement,  IDA  and EDB have been aggressively  marketing

and promoting ourselves to companies in the United States and

Hong Kong.  In fact, shortly after I made the announcement, a

few  days  later, the first team left for the United  States.

Altogether, they have made three trips and they are  planning

a  fourth very shortly to Europe.  The response has been very

positive from the companies that they met, both in the United

States  and in Hong Kong. At the same time in Singapore,  the

Info-communications Development Authority



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1697</b></font><br><br>



has received over 80 enquiries from interested parties. These

companies  range  from companies that  have  an  interest  in

investing  in  infrastructure  or  facilities,  as  well   as

companies  that are interested in providing services.   There

are  also companies that have seen the IDA and have expressed

an  interest in coming to Singapore for the first  time,  and

using  Singapore, not just providing services  in  Singapore,

but  by  using Singapore as a base for their business in  the

region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect the service-based competition to be fairly

keen  and  because  the services-based  operators  can  begin

operation  very quickly, they do not require much  equipment.

We  expect  them to start operation around April  or  shortly

after. But for facilities-based competition, that would  only

be  developed  towards the later part of this year  or  early

next  year because, for the facilities-based companies,  they

require time to roll out their infrastructure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of whether there is still a strategic role for

a  national telecommunications company, I think SingTel  will

continue to play a very important role. The experience in all

countries    has    shown   that   the   dominant    original

telecommunications company, even after liberalisation,  tends

to play a very important role because they have the advantage

of having all the facilities and infrastructure in place, and

they have the advantage of having developed the market and it

is  very  difficult to take market share from  an  entrenched

provider.  I would expect that SingTel will still play a very

important  role in Singapore but I hope that would not  deter

the  new  companies from coming in because the new  companies

should  bring  with  them  new  technology,  new  value-added

services and, hopefully, a new approach which will allow them

to win customers away from SingTel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay asked about our competitiveness versus Hong

Kong,  whether  we  have  any benchmark  indicators.   It  is

difficult to draw a definitive and objective conclusion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1698</b></font><br><br>



between different countries because there are many factors to

take into consideration.  Mr Chay himself has mentioned quite

a  fair  bit - infrastructure, quality of service,  range  of

service,  pricing. There is a whole range.  Overall,  we  can

say  that Singapore compares fairly well versus Hong Kong and

other telecommunications hubs in the Asia Pacific.



<br>6.15 pm



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just quote two recent surveys that were

undertaken by different bodies.  One was conducted by NUS and

in  both these surveys, it shows that Singapore scored higher

in  certain  aspects while Hong Kong scored higher  in  other

aspects. For example, Singapore tended to come out very  well

in  terms  of competitiveness of pricing, quality of service,

reliability.   On the other hand, Hong Kong fared  better  in

terms  of consumer choice and the regulatory indicators,  and

that  is  because  Hong  Kong has a  more  open  market  than

Singapore.  I think with full liberalisation from  1st  April

onwards,  we  should  be  able to see keener  competition  in

Singapore,  in terms of both pricing and service innovations.

And  I  would expect that in this multi-operator environment,

our  telecoms sector should not just become more competitive,

but  in  the surveys, I think, we should come out even better

too in the future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay asked about the licensing fee structure, that

it is important to have an appropriate fee structure and that

we should ensure that we have a substantial reduction in fees

to  ensure  that we are competitive and we do  not  lose  the

opportunity to make ourselves more competitive.  As  part  of

the  effort to attract the key telecoms players from all over

the  world, in preparing for the liberalisation, we  had,  in

fact,  reviewed our regulatory framework, including  the  fee

structure.   We realise that it is important to  ensure  that

the  fee  structure is appropriate, because  that  forms  the

first hurdle that companies have to overcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In drawing up the new fee structure, IDA removed the

initial  upfront licence fee which can be quite  substantial,

and we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1699</b></font><br><br>



only  retained the annual licence fee of 1% of  gross  annual

turnover.  The reaction from the industry, so far,  has  been

quite  encouraging and positive.  So far,  in  our  promotion

work  in  the  US  and Hong Kong, the reaction  from  the  80

companies who have approached IDA, there has been no negative

reaction  at  all  with  regard to  the  new  fee  structure.

However, in the fully competitive environment, we can  expect

the  telephone  companies  to enjoy  a  much  smaller  profit

margin, and we will therefore have to correspondingly  reduce

the   annual  licence  fee  to  ensure  that  our  fees   are

competitive and attractive vis-a-vis the other telecom  hubs.

I have therefore asked my staff to review the various options

for  reducing  the annual licence fee.  The study  should  be

completed  very shortly and we will be making an announcement

thereafter.  I expect the fees to go down further and I  hope

that  the telecoms companies would then pass on these savings

to  the  consumers.  It is a win-win approach,  because  when

they  pass  on  the  savings to the  consumers,  this  should

generate higher demand, increase market size and in the  end,

the  telecoms  companies would benefit.  So it is  a  win-win

approach and we hope that they will make the effort  to  pass

on the savings to their customers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Yeo, I suggest that we hear Mr Iswaran

and the other Members.  Mr Iswaran.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Much obliged, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the digital divide is already upon us. We have

high  profile  technopreneurs who are  making  millions  from

esoteric  IT  ventures; yet there are  many  amongst  us  who

remain intimidated by the mere sight of a computer.  We  have

a younger generation of Singaporeans for whom techno-lingo is

second  nature; yet there are others amongst us who think  we

are referring to a rodent problem when we talk about a mouse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister for

Communications and Information Technology that the Ministry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1700</b></font><br><br>



will  allocate $25 million to bring the IT revolution  closer

to  the  heartlands.  My concern is how this  money  will  be

spent.   Because  a variety of purposes have  been  mentioned

like  training, computer ownership and even Internet  access,

I  think they are important and laudable objectives.  But the

key  challenge, in my view, is psychological.   Our  task  is

really  to reach out to a large group of predominantly  older

Singaporeans and to persuade them that they too are a part of

this new world of info-communications and it is not just  for

young techies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have three specific proposals for the Minister to

consider.  The first is on the organisational element.  I  am

glad  that IDA will be working closely with community  groups

and  grassroots organisations on this initiative to bring  IT

and "e" closer to the people.  But why not go all the way and

let  the People's Association drive the project.  I say  this

because the IDA is a new agency with expert domain knowledge,

but  we do not really need very high-tech knowledge for  this

effort.  Neither can we reasonably expect IDA's young, jeans-clad computer experts to effectively reach out to older, more

conservatively    dressed   Singaporeans.     The    People's

Association  and its grassroots are old hats at communicating

sometimes  quite complex Government policies to  the  average

Singaporean.  And I think they know the tricks of the  trade.

So, why not let them take the lead?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, icons. I think we need e-icons, not the

type  we  click on a screen, but the type who can  touch  our

hearts and click our minds, individuals whom we can relate to

and  who might face the same fears as us when venturing  into

the e-world.  To me, Sir, Liang Po Po and Tan Ah Tek of Under

One  Roof   would be fantastic e-ambassadors.  They are  well

known,  they strike a chord with many Singaporeans and,  most

important of all, they could inspire an attitude of "if  they

can  do it, so can I", amongst the average Singaporeans.  And

I  would  urge  the Minister to consider this  form  of  mass

publicity  and  sort of attitude-changing effort  through  e-icons.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1701</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, Sir, I would urge the agencies involved to

tread  the path of least resistance.  It is important because

when  delivering the e-message, we should do it in bite sizes

and in an entertaining manner.  There is no point diving into

the  deep  end  talking about word processing, web  browsing,

Windows 2000, Office 2000 and so on.  Rather, we should start

with  what  appeals, perhaps with games,  Solitaire  and  the

like,  just  get people comfortable with the  mouse  and  the

computer  screen,  and then graduate from  there  into  other

forms  of  entertainment before going into  e-mail  for  more

social  purposes, and then web browsing and so on.  My  point

in  saying  all of this is that these incremental steps  will

imbue confidence and comfort with what would otherwise  be  a

very  alien  medium to many Singaporeans.   And  I  urge  the

Minister  to  re-examine the process through  which  this  IT

revolution will be brought to the heartlands of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, the Internet

revolution  will  be  one  of the major  milestones  of  this

century.  It will have a major impact on business and also on

the life of the ordinary person.  The emerging importance  of

the  Internet  cannot be ignored, and Internet companies  are

now  able  to buy over established brick-and-mortar companies

with traditional business models.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major trend in the horizon is the emergence of e-commerce communities. The rise of the Internet will lead to

the inevitable strengthening of e-commerce as a challenge  to

conventional  businesses.   The  exponential  growth  of   e-commerce  procurement  and supply chain,  management  systems

will  increase  efficiency in the system and reduce  cost  to

businesses.    The  end-to-end  situation   of   the   entire

procurement  and  supply chain will also  mean  reduction  of

product  and  process costs.  E-commerce  business  can  make

traditional companies obsolete within a few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rise of the Internet has also created yet another

trend.  Increasingly, traditional



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1702</b></font><br><br>



companies  will lose top quality staff to Internet companies.

The migration of top quality talent to the virtual world will

only  strengthen the world of e-commerce.  This  is  a  trend

that is already happening in the USA and we are beginning  to

see this in Singapore.  The success of e-commerce is not only

dependent  on business concepts but also on strong management

skills.  Being an entrepreneur is only one of the ingredients

for  success.   It does not substitute for strong  management

skills.  Internet  companies  grow  rapidly  and  can  become

globalised   within a short period of time.   The  speed  and

pace   at   which  Internet  companies  move   far   outpaces

conventional  businesses.  If traditional businesses  do  not

evolve, they will be overtaken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is uniquely positioned to become an e-commerce

virtual global hub.  However, we must recognise these  trends

and   prepare  ourselves  to  meet  the  challenges   of   an

interconnected world.  We must change our mindset and  adjust

to the speed of the Internet world.  Hence, we must groom and

train  people constantly to meet these new demands.  We  must

also  adjust our policies to position ourselves to meet these

challenges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liberalisation of the telecoms sector is a move in the

right  direction.  With full liberalisation of  the  telecoms

market  in  New  Zealand, Australia and Hong Kong,  Singapore

must   speed   up  its  liberalisation  process   to   remain

competitive.  And I support the Ministry's plan on this.   We

have seen how the introduction of competition in the form  of

M1 has made the entire handphone market more competitive.  It

has  resulted in better quality services and more  affordable

prices  and  also  the introduction of new services  such  as

wireless  applications  (WAP).   Increasingly,  the  Internet

world  will  move from the narrow to broadband  applications.

Although Singapore has Singapore One and 98% of all homes are

already  connected, only 14% are subscribers.   If  Singapore

wants  to become a serious broadband application provider  in

the  region,  we will need to increase broadband  access  and

reduce the cost of broadband access.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1703</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage the industry and Singaporeans to

increasingly  move  into the broadband applications  area,  I

think  it  is  imperative that the cost be reduced.   Current

ADSL  prices  of SingTel Magix are significantly higher  than

that of Hong Kong Telecoms.  Current cable prices of SCV  are

about three times higher than that of Hong Kong.  It is  time

for  the  Ministry  to put pressure on service  providers  to

lower  the  pricing of broadband access.   We  should  reduce

prices  to the level that will be competitive to places  like

Hong Kong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current wholesale prices for broadband access by service

providers such as SingTel to other ISPs are high, and make it

commercially  non-viable for other ISPs.  The  Ministry  must

mandate  open  access  to broadband infrastructure  currently

owned  by  SCV and SingTel and reduce the pricing  for  these

services,  so  that they can be offered to ISPs.   With  more

competition  through lower wholesale prices,  more  ISPs  can

offer these services to the public at more affordable prices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of good policies and excellent

infrastructure  by themselves cannot propel us  to  be  first

movers in the Internet revolution.  We must create the  right

mindsets and an understanding of the fast moving world of the

Internet.   For  senior and middle management  staff  in  the

civil  service and statutory boards, yes, there are many  who

are  already in tune like those in the MinCom, MCIT and  IDA,

but  there  are also many who are not in tune.  The  Ministry

should  take  the  lead to organise Internet  and  e-commerce

seminars  for senior and middle management to help them  keep

up  with the Internet revolution.  Experts and technopreneurs

from  the virtual world of Internet can bring virtual reality

to  the real world management.  One of the key areas that one

must  look  at  is administrative procedures and legislation.

They  must  be able to keep up with the pace of the Internet.

As  these span across different Ministries, there will  still

be  a need for a coordinating body.  Perhaps MCIT may be  the

best body to coordinate this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry must be congratulated for several

initiatives to help Singaporeans



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1704</b></font><br><br>



join  the  Internet revolution.  We must do more  if  we  are

serious  in being a global player, and we must move fast  and

we must move now.  Only then can Singapore be a global player

in the virtual world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been sitting in this Committee looking at

the  Budget  for the year 2000-2001 and it would be  expected

that  we  should  be talking of the "f"  word   -   finances.

Instead,  we  are, not surprisingly, I think, talking  a  lot

about the "e" word, considering the ecstasy that is going now

in  NASDAQ  and the rest of the stock markets of  Hong  Kong,

Singapore, London and so on.  The "e" word, ie, e-commerce, e-business,  is something that is in flavour.  I am  rising  to

speak not just because it is the flavour of the day but I  do

feel  that  we have to consider many things as we  go  helter

skelter  into  these new challenges we face  in  the  new  e-economy.  Firstly, we have to reform some of the ancient  and

obsolete laws we have.  A comprehensive study will need to be

done.   As  an example, I have had occasions to look  at  the

Auctioneers  Act and I find that, in the physical  world,  to

protect  the  consumers you need the  auctioneer  to  have  a

licence  and you need a specific person to pin down,  if  any

offence is created, if there are any offences.  But in an  e-auction scenario, an auctioneer on the Internet, it would  be

difficult  to  find this person even if you were  to  license

him. Perhaps there are some rules that may not be enforceable

or not effective or not necessary in an e-economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second example would be to look at the

Telecommunications   Act  and  the   MAS   regulations.    In

particular, we have had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1705</b></font><br><br>



recent  rules  dealing with stock trading.  The old  Telecoms

regulations  dealt also with this issue of  e-trading,  using

the  networks to trade in stocks and shares.  There were some

rather onerous provisions which I have actually informed  the

former  Director-General of TAS, and now the Deputy Executive

of  IDA.  The rules may actually be onerous such that our  e-stock  traders would have to follow these rules,  but  nobody

else  in  the  world does.  We would effectively be  shooting

ourselves  in the foot because other people do  not  have  to

follow  these  rules,  and  therefore  they  will  get   more

business.   It  might be necessary if we have to  have  these

rules  that perhaps we should sell it as a kind of particular

Singapore brand that we are very trusted and therefore  there

is some value in our being regulated more than other people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point that I want to raise is with regard to

changing  the  laws,  for example, in intellectual  property,

copyright, for example. We have had some changes recently  in

our  Copyright  law,  but we still have  a  very  big  piracy

problem.   It  used to be that Singapore and Hong  Kong  were

known as the piracy capitals of the world.  We have no longer

that  unfortunate image and reputation.  But I think we still

have  massive piracy problems and almost every  day  we  find

newspaper articles about so and so being fined and so and  so

being  raided.   Unfortunately,  we  have  got  a  particular

problem  here,  ie,  many of these guys that  we  arrest  and

fined,  are what we call "fall guys". These are the students,

the  retirees, the housewives, who are earning a little extra

income.   They  are  given incentives and  very  high  profit

margins,  and  their fines would be paid by the  kingpins  or

syndicate who run the shows.  They are quite happy to pay the

fine  because they earn good money.  If we do not crush  this

piracy  problem,  we  will  not be able  to  attract  content

providers to come to Singapore to provide content and to help

in our e-economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dare not suggest, but perhaps we could look at some

more  penalties  that would be felt by these "fall  guys"  so

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1706</b></font><br><br>



they would never do it again.  Imprisonment comes quickly  to

mind.   If  a person has to be in prison, no matter how  much

other people compensate him, the kingpin compensates him,  he

may  not want to do it or perhaps kill him, but it may be too

heavy  a  penalty.  Perhaps the ones who rent out  the  shops

could  be imposed some kind of landlord occupier's liability.

He knows these guys are doing piracy.  He knows this is not a

legitimate  business.  He should not lend them legitimacy  by

allowing  him  to  use  his  legitimate  shop.   Perhaps  the

Ministry might consider this way of closing down the  den  of

thieves, so to speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, Sir, when we talk of tax law reform, we need

to follow the trends in the rest of the world.  We cannot tax

when others do not tax, or we cannot be too liberal about tax

if  everybody  else is taxing.  But the more important  issue

here  is  that  we  should again look at our  Approved  Cyber

Trader  Scheme.   It is meant to be a tax  incentive  for  e-commerce.  But to my knowledge, there are only two that  have

been approved so far and it does not seem to be a very highly

sought  after  status  among  some  of  our  traders.   Maybe

something is not quite right and we should look at how we can

improve tax incentives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ESOPs have been talked about. I know the Minister for

Finance has said that he would be looking into this issue and

I  hope  that  he would consider that.  Taxing a  person  who

exercises  an option is a bit unfair because he has  not  got

the  money  yet.   He has not realised it.  Perhaps  the  tax

should  come  when  he  realises  the  profit.   Perhaps  tax

reliefs,  and  some  of  my colleagues  in  this  House  have

mentioned  about tax reliefs for business angels, individuals

who are throwing in the money to help push the e-economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could also be looking at other rules like electronic

contracting rules.  It is right now a bit difficult to decide

whether the postal rules apply to a contractual situation  on

the  Internet.  We should perhaps abolish the postal rule and

allow  contracts  to  be formed in the normal  way  upon  the

receipt of the offer and acceptance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1707</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could also be looking at the Electronic Transactions

Act  (ETA).  It is a new Act, but we should be reviewing  it.

When  we  introduced  it,  we have this  provision  that  the

Electronic Transactions Act applies to commercial parties and

they  can  opt out of it.  But where Government is concerned,

the  ETA  does not apply to Government unless the  Government

department  opts  in.  This caution is not necessary  because

our  Government  departments are all very  proactive  and  if

there is any particular department that is not yet ready  for

the  e-economy, they should jolly well declare themselves and

they  should say, "We are not in the ETA scenario".   Perhaps

then the pressure will be for them to change.  I think if  we

want  to have e-economy, we must have e-payment and our  laws

on payment could be changed.  We have a Bills of Exchange Act

which  is  based on the English Act of 1832.   It  is  really

ancient.   We  could  perhaps be  looking  at  how  we  could

electronify the bills of exchange, perhaps even to  introduce

laws  of  truncation to permit the truncation of cheques  and

this would make the e-economy a better fluid situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of regulating e-economy, I would feel that the

regulations  on certification authorities, for  example,  are

too onerous and too uncertain.  It is based on a draft of the

X.509 standards and it is so difficult to comply with that  I

believe there is no licensee yet.  I think if we do not  have

any licensee, it might be difficult for us to create trust.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of regulation, it would be important for us too

to think of the protection of the consumer in a different way

now.  It is easier for somebody to con a consumer and to  con

him  faster and to get the results even faster.  For example,

we had the S888dot.com situation where within a month a party

could  actually amass a lot of money from the  public  and  I

believe this is to the tune of $6 million.  This is something

which  we  have to carefully watch.  If it is so possible  to

quickly  amass  so  much money, we must  have  some  kind  of

legislation  in place which would prevent Internet  companies

from promoting and advertising themselves in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1708</b></font><br><br>



unconscionable  and  unethical  ways.   This   situation   is

something  like  the  Fair Trading Act which  would  be  very

useful.   We should also be joining efforts with the rest  of

the  world  to  create  a global situation  of  trust  in  e-commerce.   Perhaps  we  should join  in  efforts  to  pursue

computer criminals and what I would call dot.cons -  the  con

men who  con the consumer and investor of his money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light and easy regulation is what the Ministry goes for

now.   Self-regulation is what it advocates.  These are  fine

but  we  must not reach a stage of laissez faire  -   you  do

anything  you  like,  we  are  not  going  to  bat  an   eye.

Therefore,  if IDA were to spend money to preach the  digital

divide,  they  should  also  be  spending  money  to  promote

awareness  of  the  inherent unreliability  of  perhaps  some

Internet  sites.  Information on the Internet is  not  always

accurate  and true and education of consumers, so  that  they

would  not  fall for dot.cons.  Money has to be used  because

education and awareness programme costs money.  To  expect  a

poor  organisation like the Consumers Association to  do  all

this without help is not quite easy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would quickly close, Sir, by saying that there are

many  other areas which we should be looking into.  The  list

is  endless.  Domain name  registration, perhaps  grants  for

research into e-commerce solutions and ultimately, if we have

an  environment that promotes the e-economy and regulates  e-commerce in a careful way, we should be on to a good thing.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the three

Members who have spoken up.  I will reply only to Dr  Toh  on

his  call for law reform.  Dr Michael Lim has spoken  on  the

promotion of broadband.  There are three other cuts that  are

coming up.  So I will reply to him at that stage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Dr Toh has argued very strongly for the need to

reform our various laws in order to bring them up to date  to

the  Internet age.  He has raised plenty of examples and,  as

he  said,  the list can go on and on.  I am glad he  stopped,

otherwise we would run out of time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1709</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can assure him that I totally agree with him that

as we enter the Internet Age, we will need to actively review

and  update our various legislation. I would like  to  assure

him  also  that the problem that we face is not one  that  is

unique to Singapore.  That is because the Internet revolution

has  resulted  in  such a huge flood of  new  businesses  and

services that many of these businesses and services were  not

even  in the realm of imagination when the existing laws were

first promulgated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to inform Prof. Toh that the Attorney-General has set up a Law Reform Coordinating Committee. He

chairs  it.  This Committee will identify those areas of  law

that  should  be  considered for law  reform.   However,  the

actual  recommendations for legislative changes will continue

to  be  made  by  the  respective Ministries  and  specialist

agencies that are knowledgeable in their own technical areas.

I  have  taken  note  of  Prof. Toh's  suggestions.   I  will

definitely pass them on to the Committee for their review.  I

will  ask  my  Minister  of  State  to  reply  to  the  other

questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Swee Say (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Lim Swee Say):</b> I will not reply to the subject

of  digital divide now because later on there will  be  three

cuts  relating  to  this topic.  So I will  respond  to  that

tomorrow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now respond to Prof. Toh on his comments

regarding  regulating the e-commerce.  Sir, e-commerce  is  a

relatively new concept, a fast growing one.  As a result, the

regulation of e-commerce is still evolving.  Basically,  when

we   talk   about   e-commerce,  we  talk  about   electronic

transactions   between  businesses,   B2B,   businesses   and

consumers, B2C, as well as those between consumers, so it  is

C2C.   In  the case of Singapore, our interest is to position

ourselves as a leading hub in e-commerce in the Asia-Pacific.

In  this  regard,  I  want  to  assure  Prof.  Toh  that  the

Government will not adopt a laissez faire attitude because we

recognise that to succeed in this fast moving world



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1710</b></font><br><br>



of e-commerce, businesses will need to come out with creative

ideas  and be able to implement them very quickly.  In  other

words, dot.com companies will need to be innovative and  move

with fast speed if they want to succeed.  So our challenge as

a  Government  will be to create an environment in  Singapore

which   is  conducive  for  e-commerce  companies,    dot.com

companies,  to succeed. This means, on the one hand, we  want

to  create an environment that has sufficient safeguards,  to

create  trust among businesses and consumers and yet  at  the

same  time provide sufficient space for companies to innovate

with new ideas, to compete with new ideas.  In fact, this  is

the  reason  why we have decided to become one of  the  first

countries  in  the  world  to put  in  place  the  Electronic

Transactions  Act  (ETA) way back in 1998 so  as  to  provide

enough  safeguards  in the business world  for  companies  to

conduct e-commerce.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the ETA, public certification authorities can

apply  for  licence to issue and  to verify digital signature

under the Act.  Prof. Toh commented that the application  for

CA licence is too onerous and uncertain.  I wish to point out

that  for Singapore to become an e-commerce hub, we  need  to

ensure that these licensees are trustworthy.  We also need to

ensure  that  the  digital  certifications  issued  by  these

Certification Authorities are recognised in other  countries,

otherwise we cannot be an e-commerce hub.  For these reasons,

we  want to make sure that our Certification Authorities  are

evaluated  based on a well-recognised set of criteria.   This

would  include their financial standing,  operating  policies

and procedures.  So even though the two CAs today have yet to

apply  to  IDA  for licence, my understanding  is  that  they

intend  to  do  so  when  they are  ready  to  satisfy  these

criteria, and it is likely to be in a few months' time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of consumer protection, there are already

existing laws, such as the multi-level marketing and  pyramid

selling  prohibition Act and so on.  We recognise  that  with

the  emergence  of  e-commerce  and  the  new  Internet-based

retailing, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1711</b></font><br><br>



need  to  review the existing consumer protection legislation

to  ensure  that  they continue to be effective  in  the  new

operating  environment.  And yet at the  same  time,  we  are

mindful  that  we  should  not  over-regulate  the  industry,

because  it  may stifle innovation in the market  place.   We

will   therefore  adopt  a  combination  of  industry   self-regulation,  Government regulation and consumer education  in

the protection of consumer interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of international pursuit of computer

criminals,  my  understanding is that the  Ministry  of  Home

Affairs and Police have already been using Interpol and other

inter-agency arrangement to pursue these cyber criminals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh also asked whether we can spend money to help

to  promote awareness of the inherent unreliability  of  some

Internet  sites.  We feel that this is best  done  through  a

consumer interest group, like CASE and so on.  What IDA would

do would be to cooperate with such agency and see what we can

do to make sure that the message gets across.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh also mentioned about the need to review our

ground  rules on the domain naming registration.   I  believe

procedures  are  already  in place.   So  if  there  are  any

specific  suggestions from Prof. Toh, we would be  more  than

happy to receive them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Toh asked whether we would consider giving grants

for  research into e-commerce, such as e-payment, etc.  Prof.

Toh  may  be  happy  to  hear that,  in  fact,  the  research

institutions  and  research centres  have  come  together  to

discuss and they have jointly identified some areas of  joint

research, and e-commerce will be one of them.  In fact, their

research efforts will be supported by grants through the NSTB

and eventually if need be, through the Innovation Development

Scheme managed by EDB and IDA.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Prof. Toh mentioned about allowing professionals

to  accept payment in kind in the form of shares and options.

I believe various professions in Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1712</b></font><br><br>



do  have their code of conduct, code of practice.  I think we

will leave it to the respective authorities to decide whether

this  is  appropriate to do so, because conflict of  interest

may come into play.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I believe I have answered the questions

raised by Prof. Toh.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen:</b> Sir, the GPC made its report on COE

review last year.  One of the recommendations was to smoothen

out  the  peaks  in  COE replacement over the  next  two-year

period.   Can the Minister  give us some feedback on  whether

this  step has given some stability to the COE bidding?   And

will the Minister also give us the new quota for COE for this

quota  year, bearing in mind the time is quite near  for  the

May quota to be revealed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the ERP system has been fully introduced and

extended, will the Minister tell us whether in the main,  the

Government has collected more or less in revenue as  compared

to  the previous system of CBD ticket system?  I wish to urge

the  Minister to always provide more alternatives for  public

transport facilities, be they bus routes or by-passes, beyond

just  monitoring  the traffic flow rate, before  deciding  on

raising ERP charges to price congestion.  A lot of members of

the  public are keen to know about this, because many of them

are  quite prepared to switch to alternative transport  modes

if they are available.



<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> The ERP has been in existence

for some time and it has been used to optimise road usage and

control traffic usage.  Since its initial success in the CBD,

it  has been extended to various other areas in Phase  2.   I

remember, of course, that when Phase 2A was actually  imposed

in  CTE,  it  took  a  bit of adjustment before  the  traffic

improved.   Initially, even though you paid the charges,  you

had  long jams.  But after they tweaked the charges,  traffic

flow is very much better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is no doubt that the ERP has served its

purpose.   However, Phase 2B is on the horizon  and  I  think

what we want to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1713</b></font><br><br>



be  assured is that, firstly, like what my colleague has just

said, there are viable alternatives and that MCIT will not be

too  ready to place up the new gantries even though they have

already  placed  the  footings,  and  that  there  should  be

adequate  buses  and  other alternative  modes  of  transport

before we do that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems is that if you start putting

gantries up in the new cordons in Phase 2B, one needs  to  be

reassured  that  you are not just shifting traffic  to  other

possible  gantry areas where you have not put  the  gantries.

Because  if you do that, and if you keep on shifting  traffic

from  one place to another place, eventually you will be able

to  justify that Phase 2B should be fully implemented.   I am

not  affected  in Phase 2B; it is not within my constituency.

But I am sure many other MPs are also concerned that Phase 2B

will  not be implemented in a hurry.  So perhaps the Minister

would like to enlighten us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, in answering my

question  on  25th  February  this  year,  the  Parliamentary

Secretary  MCIT said that LTA would study the possibility  of

adjusting ERP charges for different seasons of the  year.   I

fully support such a move.  I would like to know when we  can

expect the study to be completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ERP is to optimise the use of public roads, through

regulating   traffic  flow  by  way  of  pricing   mechanism.

Therefore,  it has to be made more responsive to varied  road

situations.   It is not difficult to notice that  during  the

June and December long school holidays, vehicles on the roads

are  significantly  less than usual.  This  is  because  many

Singapore  families  go overseas for  holiday.   During  such

seasons,  ERP  charges  for certain roads  can  certainly  be

adjusted downwards, especially during off-peak hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, for the CBD, currently the off-peak hours

charge  is $1 per entry for cars.  I notice that many of  the

roads leading to CBD are not well utilised, even



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1714</b></font><br><br>



during  lunch  time.  So this means there is  also  room  for

adjustment or fine-tuning of the charges, instead of just the

current two-tier charges.  Can the Minister comment?



<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Sir, my basic question is this. How does

the LTA internalise the social costs of the projects that  it

plans   and   implements  in  the  planning  process   before

execution?   The LTA is a large organisation.  It  undertakes

major  projects.  These are not just large projects in  terms

of  the  scale, cost or size, but also in terms of the impact

it  has on the general public.  We have large amenities  that

arise  from them in facilities for road users, commuters  and

the  like.   But  these  amenities are  also  caused  by  LTA

projects   -  noise  pollution.   We  have  instances   where

inconvenience has caused to some residents because they  have

to  divert the mode of travel and in the extreme, it leads to

acquisition of property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the question then is: How does LTA consult or get

feedback  or  input  from residents who  are  potentially  or

actually  affected  by such projects?  I  know  the  LTA  has

extensive  consultation with many agencies of  Government  in

planning  its  projects.  But what about the  public  or  the

sentiments and interests of the general public?  How is  that

internalised?   It  seems to me that typically,  consultation

occurs at a rather late stage when designs have already  been

drawn, specifications have been made and tenders are about to

be called.  That is obviously too advance a stage at which to

incorporate  feedback meaningfully.  Is  there  not  a  stage

between the strategic planning level and the detailed  design

planning   level  where  some  views  can   be   sought   and

incorporated?  The idea here, Sir, is not to fuel  not-in-my-backyard kind of sentiments, and accommodate that.   I  think

we  recognise that in public policy, we must give priority to

the  national interests.  Neither is it to shackle legitimate

pursuit  of national interests through large public projects.

But the purpose of my raising this question is really to ask:

Can  we  not  accommodate some of the public  concerns  in  a

visible and tangible way in the process of LTA's activities?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1715</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, on 27th February this

year, the LTA made an announcement which I think passed  with

too  little  fanfare.  And I believe that it deserves  praise

because   it  is  one  of  the  most  progressive   transport

administrations in the whole world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new measures for road safety include making road

dividers brighter and expressway exits clearly, and so on.  I

think these measures are all very good.  The promise of  this

programme,  however, is that these changes will  be  made  to

major roads eventually and not just to expressways.  The  LTA

staff  have  reassured the community that they are constantly

looking  at  changes that need to be made, and they  have  in

fact  engaged a New Zealand consultant as a "fresh"  pair  of

expert eyes to see what can be improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I know that this is not the first time that the LTA

has  introduced good changes without fanfare and I think they

deserve  much  more praise.  For example, I  know  that  they

introduced road surfacing material, new material, in the  KJE

which  I  have travelled on, and I find it very good  because

the water is absorbed and drained out by the sides.  It gives

cars better road holding and it allows for the markings to be

seen  better  because  there  is  no  sheen  from  the  road,

especially at night and when the roads are wet.  And  I  just

hope  that  the Ministry would look at this and  see  whether

they  could be expanded to other roads in Singapore.  If they

cannot  be  expanded to other roads, perhaps  highways  where

speeds  are  very high, should have cats' eyes  so  that  the

markings  on  the roads are particularly clear when  we  have

night driving or driving in adverse weather conditions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1716</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to congratulate the LTA for its

proactivity, but I would like to also suggest that the review

that  it does should not just be on the expressways and major

roads.   Some minor roads too have got potential  problems  - the  dangerous spots.  I could give the Ministry  a  list  of

some  of  these.  I hope that these situations  can  also  be

addressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, for better feedback, perhaps LTA could

institute some kind of easily used system so that the million

of  eyes  on  the road could be your eyes too, they  may  not

necessarily  be the experts, but everybody who drives  thinks

he  is  an  expert anyway.  Perhaps they could  just  call  a

hotline to report their observations.
