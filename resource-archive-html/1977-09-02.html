   <b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND</b>

  <div align="center">
   <b>(Use of contributions for purchase of privately-built fists)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Labour (a) what is the rationale of raising the Central Provident Fund contribution rate from 15 per cent to 15 1/2 per cent; (b) whether there will be any further increase in CPF contribution; (c) what is the reason for not allowing CPF members to use the additional 1 per cent CPF contribution to buy publicly-built flats; and (d) whether the Government will consider revising the present policy by allowing CPF members to use their savings to buy flats and houses built by the private sector for their own occupation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Minister of State for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Labour):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the basic objective of the Central Provident Fund is to provide workers with savings for their old age or in the event of their being permanently disabled. Although the amount withdrawn by members of the Fund on reaching the age of 55 has on the average been increasing steadily over the years, the position is still unsatisfactory.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 31st December, 1976, 481,788 persons or 70.8% of the members of the Fund who were actively contributing at that time have balances less than $5,000. These members have a total balance of $873.85 million giving an average of only $1,814 per member. The low balance is attributed mainly to the use of such savings for the purchase of publicly-built flats. Under the existing legislation, members are permitted to use the whole amount standing to their credit for the purchase of publicly-built flats and also the whole of their monthly contributions for the payment of instalments towards the purchase of the flats.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that members have sufficient savings left after providing for housing, the rate of contribution has to be increased and the amount of such savings that can be allowed to be used for the purchase of publicly-built flats has therefore to be restricted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second question, the hon. Member for Thomson would recall that at the Parliament sitting on 27th May, 1977, [col. 38] the Minister for Finance had indicated that the appropriate rate of contribution at any given time must depend on all circumstances, including the state of the economy, at that time. If any variation in the rate is deemed justifiable, Government will give consideration to the arguments for such variation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the last question, I have to report that the policy of not allowing CPF members to use their savings to buy flats and houses built by the private sector will stand. Privately-built properties are profit-oriented and subject to market forces and speculation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> CPF savings of workers should not be used to buy flats and houses sold at prices which are considerably higher than their real value. The use of CPF savings for the purchase of publicly-built flats for the middle and lower income groups already go a long way to assist the great majority in purchasing a flat. There are therefore no good reasons at this point of time why CPF savings should be used to purchase privately-built properties.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang (Senior Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Minister of State for National Development (Dr Tan Eng Liang) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no immediate plan to provide an overhead pedestrian bridge at New Upper Changi Road opposite Block 27, Bedok New Town. However, traffic lights will be installed at the junction of New Changi Road and Bedok South Road. This will create a traffic gap along New Upper Changi Road for safe crossing of pedestrians in-the area.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, footpaths will be provided along Keppel Road as it is widened.

Widening of Keppel Road between PSA Gate 3 and Lower Delta Road Extension is scheduled for implementation in 1980.

The islands to the south of Pulau Bukom will also be developed for industrial projects except for Pulau Hantu Besar and Pulau Jong which are planned for public recreational development. With the exception of Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong, the islands situated to the north will be used mainly for recreation. Coney Island is in an advanced stage of development for recreational use.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong, their long term use is under study. In the interim, the rural/agricultural activities on these islands will continue.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the junction of Pier Road and Netheravon Road is presently served by two feeder services, Nos. 210 and 213. These services operate with a combined frequency of 15 to 20 minutes during peak periods.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the roads within the Changi Complex are narrow and are not suitable for the 39-foot long buses deployed on Service No. 1. If this service is re-routed, one more bus with an annual recurrent cost of $90,000 will have to be added to maintain the existing frequency. The additional capacity provided will be greatly in excess of peak demand.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore not feasible to re-route Service No. 1. However, if the demand justifies it, additional buses will be put on Service Nos. 210 and 213.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earthworks on the first runway started about two years ago. Presently, work on the extension of the first runway is ahead of schedule and the whole runway should be completed by December 1979. Reclamation of the land for the second runway with fill dredged from the sea-bed, started in early May 1976. By working continuously throughout the period, the five dredges deployed in the reclamation work have nearly completed the reclamation of the land for the second runway. Part of the site meant for the first passenger terminal building has already been reclaimed from the sea. Piling work for the passenger terminal has progressed steadily since early June this year.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the present progress, we anticipate that the airport could begin operation in late 1980.

  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment (Mr Chor Yeok Eng) (for the Minister for Law and the Environment)</b>(
  <i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of licensed hawkers has declined from approximately 31,000 in June 1973 to 27,400 in June this year. This decline in the population of licensed hawkers is due to the phasing out of the pasar malam hawkers, hawkers surrendering their licences voluntarily to go into other occupations/vocations and, to a small extent, due to the death of old licensees.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drop in the population of licensed hawkers has been offset by the mushrooming of new supermarkets, shopping complexes, restaurants/coffee houses, eating establishments and canteens in the recent years. More Singaporeans are patronising these new establishments and there is no over-crowding at markets and food centres.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still 10,500 licensed hawkers on the streets and in temporary premises who need to be resited into proper premises with facilities that will satisfy standards of public health. Apart from the escalating cost of constructing markets and food centres, difficulties are also encountered in obtaining suitable sites for these projects.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing policy has already been modified to allow issue of hawker licences to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> hardship cases such as shopkeepers, farmers and fishermen who have been affected by redevelopment. It is considered that even with the marginal decline in the number of licensed hawkers, the hawker population will be sufficient to serve the population in view of the provision of alternative facilities. In addition, there is no intention to liberalise the issue of hawker licences as there is an urgent problem of resiting 10,500 licensed street hawkers into proper premises and the economy demands channelling of young and able-bodied persons into more productive sectors of the economy.

  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, G. Raman is presently detained under an Order of Detention for two years. The Government's policy is to release political detainees who have renounced their communist involvement and denounced the use of violence as advocated by the Communist Party of Malaya to topple the elected Government. Many including those involved with G. Raman who have satisfied these conditions have been released.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in the case of G. Raman, detention for further interrogation is necessary. After his arrest he gave a handwritten statement of his pro-communist activities. In one part of his statement he described how he accompanied Dr Poh Soo Kai to Masai, Johore, in December 1974 to treat an urban guerilla who was injured in the bomb explosion at Still Road, Singapore, on 20th December, 1974. Members will recall that after that bomb incident the Police had issued a statement requesting doctors and hospitals to report any person seeking treatment for injuries from the incident. This
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> was reported in the Straits Times on 21st December, 1974. For a doctor to have clandestinely gone to the aid and treat the injured terrorist was a very serious matter.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 28th February, 1977, G. Raman was brought before a District Judge before whom he made a voluntary statement re-affirming his allegation that Dr Poh Soo Kai had gone to Masai to treat the injured terrorist.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As both statement and confession by G. Raman reflected upon the propriety of Dr Poh's professional conduct, G. Raman was brought before the Senior State Counsel to enable the Attorney-General's Chambers to lodge a complaint with the Medical Council against Dr Poh Soo Kai.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture Raman retracted that portion of his statement relating to Dr Poh Soo Kai and the Masai trip. He must have known that the Attorney-General wanted to use his evidence for legal action against Dr Poh Soo Kai.

   <b>(Policy on permanent stay)</b>

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22.
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Education the number of persons living in Singapore who are on special passes and whether he will consider granting permanent stay status to those who have resided in Singapore for 10 years or more.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a total of 1,106 persons are in Singapore on Special Passes. Of these, 472 are males and 634 females.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Pass holders are normally persons who are unable to prove their lawful presence in Singapore. They would in the first place have been in Singapore for at least 10 years. They are issued Special Passes purely on compassionate grounds. Bearing in mind these two factors, Special Pass holders should not be granted permanent stay merely because they have been living in Singapore for 10 years or more.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government has dealt with sympathetically and given special consideration to applications for permanent residence from Special Pass holders who have special skills, contributed to the well-being of the country or who otherwise merit special consideration.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last 4 1/2 years, 378 persons who were previously on Special Passes were granted permanent residence, primarily on grounds that they have acquired technical skills or because of special compassionate considerations.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the Government is not going to give these Special Pass holders permanent stay status, is the Government going to repatriate them to their country of origin?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have already answered that question. It is not that the Government does not want to give them permanent residence. I have said that each case will be considered on its merit, Some of them will be given consideration for permanent residence if they merit it, while those who do not merit consideration will not be given permanent residence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards repatriation, if we had wanted to repatriate them, we would have repatriated them and would not have given them the Special Passes.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if these people are not to be repatriated, who is going to be responsible for their livelihood? I ask this question because no employer will
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> employ these people since they do not have identity cards. Under the circumstances who is going to be responsible for their livelihood in Singapore?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I say that they are responsible for their own livelihood. If they are children, of course, their parents will be responsible for them. I do not agree that these Special Pass holders cannot get employment. In fact, many of them are employed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Minister aware that some Special Pass holders are former permanent residents? They have lost their permanent status because they have contravened certain Immigration rules and regulations, for example, returning from Malaysia without re-entry visas. Will the Minister therefore consider restoring their status as permanent residents, taking into consideration that they had contravened out of ignorance and that they have been here for ten or more years?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already answered that question. As I have said, each case will be considered on its own merit. If some of them have factors which merit special consideration, they will be given special consideration in the granting of permanent residence. The fact that they were former permanent residents will be a factor to be taken into consideration.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.
  <b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs and Education when a police station will be constructed at the reserved site in Ang Mo Kio New Town and whether it will be completed within the next two years; if not, whether a police post can be temporarily established there as soon as possible for the security of the residents in the area.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in October/November 1976, the Housing and Development Board allocated a 2-acre site at the Ang Mo Kio New Town to the Police for the building of a new Police Divisional
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Headquarter Station. However, in April/May 1977 the Master Plan Committee disapproved the use of this site as a Police Divisional Headquarter Station because it was near to a proposed Mass Rapid Transit Station.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 1977 the Housing and Development Board offered another 2-acre site at the Ang Mo Kio New Town and the approval of the Master Plan Committee is being sought for the use of this site as a Police Divisional Headquarter Station. It is expected that the Station will be built and completed in 1980/1981.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police recognise the need to provide quick and efficient service to the growing population in the New Town and have already approached the Housing and Development Board to convert one of the existing HDB units or void decks for a Police Post until such time as the new Police Divisional Headquarter Station is completed. Details are now being worked out with the Housing and Development Board.

   <b>PAYMENT OF INCOME TAX</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Request for Legislation)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether he will consider introducing legislation to amend the Income Tax Act with a view to (a) directing all employers to pay to the Comptroller of Income Tax the necessary annual income tax deductions in respect of their employees who are liable to pay such tax, on a fixed periodic basis instead of the present system of individual submissions and settlement in one lump sum or by instalments; (b) directing all financial institutions, namely, banks and financial companies to deduct a certain percentage of the interests earned by depositors from time deposits placed with them; and (c) allowing all those who are liable to pay income tax but have not done so to declare their income and pay whatever taxes are due without fear of harsh penalties or prosecution.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Acting Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer to the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> first question posed by the hon. Member, I would say that there is no necessity to make legislative amendments in the Income Tax Act for this purpose because there is already in force, for many years now, a system whereby employees can pay their income tax through their employers by monthly deductions from their salaries. This achieves the objectives which the hon. Member has in mind.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second suggestion by the hon. Member, I must say that from available records, most taxpayers and their wives declare the interest they receive from time deposits placed with financial institutions. It would, therefore, be inappropriate to create extra work for all financial institutions and penalise all taxpayers by withholding tax from interest, on account of a few errant taxpayers or their wives who fail to declare such interest.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, regarding the Member's suggestion of an amnesty for defaulting taxpayers, I would like to point out that income tax has been in operation for about 30 years and people are all aware of their responsibility to declare their income annually and pay their taxes accordingly. There is, therefore, no valid reason for anyone to plead ignorance. Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore prides itself on the fact that its taxes are levied fairly and applied firmly. Granting one amnesty may lead to expectations of more amnesties in the future, and taxpayers would then prefer to wait and pay their taxes during such amnesties. I would rather keep faith with our honest taxpayers who have complied with the tax laws. However, I will say this to those who now wish to come forward and declare their income, that they will be subject to lesser penalties than would be imposed if they are subsequently found to have avoided tax.

   <b>OWNERSHIP OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES</b>

  <div align="center">
   <b>(Relaxation of restrictions)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25.
  <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether he will consider relaxing
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the restrictions imposed on ownership of residential properties under the Residential Property Act with a view to activating the sluggish market in the private housing development sector and encouraging the development of this sector of the economy.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Acting Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the sluggish market in private housing development at present is largely due to over-building in the early 1970's. This is the result of the euphoria created by the boom conditions prevailing then. With the world economy still growing at a slow pace, boom conditions in residential property are unlikely to come for many years. As far as the construction industry is concerned, the public sector is taking up the present slack. While the building programme of the Housing and Development Board continues unabated, the Urban Redevelopment Authority will continue to tender out cleared sites for suitable commercial development. There is therefore no lack of jobs for Singaporeans who are prepared to work in the construction industry.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restrictions imposed on ownership of residential properties have already been relaxed. Under the Residential Property Act, non-citizens can now freely purchase flats in buildings of 6-storeys or more, or purchase units in approved condominiums. In addition, non-citizens, permanent residents and foreign companies making an economic contribution to Singapore, are normally granted permission under the Residential Property Act to purchase residential property within a land area of not more than 15,000 sq. ft. for their own occupation. These relaxations are more than adequate for a non-citizen who wishes to own residential property in Singapore.

   <b>1977 NATIONAL WAGES COUNCIL RECOMMENDATIONS</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Clarification)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26.
  <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he will (a) give some
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> facts and figures on how he arrived at the quantum of 2% and 6% wage increase for civil servants of different grades in respect of the 1977 National Wages Council's recommendations; and (b) explain why a flat rate of 6% has not been awarded to civil servants who are on fixed salaries or are on the maximum of their salary scales.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Acting Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Acting Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the National Wages Council after much thought and deliberation recommended a 6% wage increase for 1977 with full offsetting against all forms of increases in remuneration on a group basis. The Government accepted the wage increase recommended by the NWC and the principle of group offsetting for employees in the Civil Service. The percentage wage increase for offsetting purpose for the Civil Service was computed in the manner recommended by the National Wages Council and it worked out to be about 4.05%. This is derived from available figures on substantive salaries of $16.712 million and $17.389 million for the months of December 1976 and June 1977 respectively. A 4% wage increase is therefore used for purpose of group offsetting for the Civil Service. The full offsetting was implemented on a group basis and does not distinguish between civil servants earning increments on a salary scale and others who are on fixed salaries or who are on the maximum of their salary scales.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Superscale Officers, there were different considerations in the determination of their wage increase. The concern here is to retain these senior officers in the service. As in 1976, it has therefore been decided that for 1977 these Superscale Officers be given the full wage increase recommended by the National Wages Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not objecting to the Superscale Officers getting more. If the Minister wants to increase their salary, he can do so. But why the discrimination? Divisions III and IV employees are getting only 2%. Why does he not give 6% to those who are on the maximum of their salary
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> scales? Their salaries are already fixed. Why are they not given 6%? How did the Minister arrive at the quantum of 6% for Superscale Officers? I am putting these supplementary questions to the Minister for National Development and Communications because he knows something about the Ministry of Finance.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, as to why we are not giving 6% to all, it is because we are following the NWC recommendations. The 2% is arrived at by offsetting the 6% recommended against the 4% increase in remuneration on a group basis.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> The NWC's recommendation is only a guideline. The Government should take action according to the wishes of the people. This is an elected government, not a colonial government. He must realise that all civil servants are working for the Government, but the lower Divisions of civil servants are getting only 2%. The Minister gets 6% but I, as an MP, get only 2%. Actually this is discriminating the civil servants.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this matter has been thoroughly studied by the National Wages Council. I have already given the explanation. The hon. Member for Anson will find all the explanation in my answer.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I want the Hon. Minister to clarify whether he will consider giving 6% for those civil servants who got 2%?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, is not here but what I can say is this. This matter has been thoroughly deliberated, and we are following the recommendations of the people who have sat down, thought over and fully considered this question. The implications of all this have been explained in my answer.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Hon. Minister was not involved in the deliberations. The civil servants have made the recommendation. For their own benefit, they have made the recommendation according to the NWC guidelines. The Hon.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Health and Acting Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Health and Acting Minister for Social Affairs (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Red Cross Society (Incorporation) Act, 1973, provides that the President of Singapore shall be the Patron as well as the President of the Red Cross Society. The President has indicated that he wishes to relinquish his appointment as President of the Society. I am accordingly proposing an amendment to Section 6 of the Act to enable the President to appoint another person to be the Society's President.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also seeks to amend sections 7 and 9 of the Act to empower the Society's Council to make rules to regulate the management of the affairs of the Society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 5(a) of the principal Act defines the objects of the Society as follows:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"5(a) the improvement of health, the prevention of disease and the mitigation of suffering throughout the world without any distinction on the grounds of race, nationality, religion or political opinions."
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> It is felt that this clause is too embracing as it is unlikely that a Singapore Society can mitigate diseases and suffering throughout the world. Moreover, it impinges on the functions of certain Government Ministries. For example, "the improvement of health" and "the prevention of disease" are the responsibilities of the Ministries of Health and the Environment. It is therefore proposed to amend section 5(a) of the Act as set out in the Notice of Amendments which has been circulated. The Red Cross Society is performing a commendable public service in running a Home for Crippled Children. The amendment will permit the Society to continue this excellent work.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Council of the Singapore Red Cross Society has expressed its desire to make certain amendments, I shall be committing this Bill to a Select Committee where they can present their views.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

   <b>SINGAPORE LABOUR FOUNDATION BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>3.26 p.m.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to establish a body corporate to be called the Singapore Labour Foundation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the trade union movement in Singapore has expanded from the traditional role of bargaining for improved terms and conditions of service and fringe benefits to cover a wide range of activities in the social, economic and educational fields. These include the operation of co-operatives
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in areas like supermarkets, books, life insurance, dental care and home furnishings. The establishment of the Singapore Labour Foundation will further the development of these activities of the trade union movement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the Foundation is the promotion of the welfare of members of trade unions and their families. The Foundation will also participate, aid and assist in social, economic or educational programmes and undertakings relating to the development of the trade union movement in the Republic. It will establish and maintain industrial rehabilitation centres as well as construct and run suitable premises for the use of trade unions and co-operative societies managed by the trade unions. The Foundation will also assist by way of grants, donations or otherwise any charitable, educational or other work, object or endeavour which will further the interest of the trade union or co-operative movement, not only in Singapore, but elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the educational front, the Foundation will provide bursaries, scholarships and fellowships to children of members of trade unions which are affiliates or associate affiliates of the National Trades Union Congress. These awards will also be given to workers from the Republic and elsewhere who study or undergo training in Singapore in fields relevant to trade unions. It will grant fellowships and awards in institutions of higher learning for research into matters relating to the trade union movement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the salient features of the Foundation are already summarised in the Explanatory Statement to this Bill. Let me touch on some of the important provisions relating to the Foundation. Clause 5 of the Bill sets out the powers of the Board of Directors for the purpose of carrying out the objects of the Foundation. These include the acceptance of gifts, the obtaining of funds through contributions, subscriptions and fund raising, the borrowing of money and the investment of the Foundation's monies. The Board is also empowered to sell or purchase, take on lease or hire and lease out or mort age property.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 6 of the Bill, the Foundation is to consist of such number of members as the Board may from time to time admit to membership of the Foundation. Membership of the Foundation will be open to affiliate trade unions and co-operatives of the National Trades Union Congress. Individual donors, companies or associations who or which are benefactors of the Foundation will also be eligible for membership. The Board of Directors has the power to terminate the membership of any member for such reason as it deems just or proper. NTUC affiliates and associate affiliates will lose their membership in the Foundation if they cease to be affiliated to NTUC.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill provides that the affairs of the Foundation will be managed by a seven-man Board of Directors. The directors are to hold office for a term of three years and be eligible for re-appointment. Three of the directors will be appointed by the Minister on the advice of the National Trades Union Congress, two others will be appointed by the Minister and the remaining two will be elected at the Foundation's annual general meeting. The Chairman and Deputy Chairman are elected inter se. Provision exists for one of the directors to exercise general administrative control over the Foundation's activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 of the Bill provides that the Foundation shall hold an annual general meeting once a year. Under clause 13, an extraordinary general meeting may be requisitioned by at least 100 members or one-quarter of the total membership, whichever is less. Such a meeting may also be called at any time that the Board of Directors deems necessary.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the income of the Foundation will be derived from entrance fees, annual subscriptions, contributions and donations. Under clause 19 of the Bill, the income and property of the Foundation shall be applied solely towards the promotion of the objects of the Foundation as set out in clause 4 of the Bill and no portion thereof shall be paid or transferred directly or indirectly by way of dividend, bonus, profit or otherwise to members or directors.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, under clause 22, the Board is required, as soon as practicable after the close of the financial year, to submit to the Minister an annual report on the activities of the Foundation during that year and the Minister shall present that copy to Parliament.

  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Phey Yew Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Phey Yew Kok (Boon Teck):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise most enthusiastically in support of the Bill to establish the Singapore Labour Foundation. It is without exaggeration to say that this Bill embodies a dream which the Labour movement in Singapore has nursed for nearly a decade.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1969, as Members of this House may recall, the trade union movement in Singapore led by the NTUC made a historic decision to modernise itself. The process of modernisation, however, was not viewed as an end in itself but as a means of achieving the objectives of the trade union movement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be the impression of some employers that the objectives of the trade union movement are primarily to squeeze as much as possible out of the employers for the benefit of its members. If such impression is still harboured by these employers, it is erroneous. The action of the trade union movement speaks for itself. Co-operative enterprises, for instance, have been set up to benefit the members of trade unions without having recourse to the pockets of their employers, directly or indirectly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequent upon the success of the process of modernisation begun in 1969, the trade union movement in Singapore has become financially more viable. The source of the modest increase in revenues of the trade union movement is the increase in subscription tom a growing membership strength, which now totals more than 200,000 or about 45 percent of the total bargainable and organisable workers in

  <br>
  <br> Singapore. Thus the NTUC and many of its affiliated unions have had for some years past sufficient funds to give effect to their objectives, among other things, of promoting educational and welfare projects for the benefit of union members and other workers and their dependants. But it is also realised that the absence of a central co-ordinating body to channel funds from diverse sources to specific projects is a stumbling block to the successful realisation of the aspirations of the trade union movement.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The establishment of a single corporate body, as that envisaged in the Singapore Labour Foundation, makes it that much more practicable to devise and implement a comprehensive and nation-wide programme of various development projects for the benefit of union members and other workers and their dependants. In the absence of such a Foundation, the various trade unions, even with the best of will, can only initiate and operate strictly limited projects for the benefit of their own members and their dependants. Such an approach, on the basis of the individual trade unions themselves, tends to be haphazard and cannot command sufficient resources that are required for comprehensive and meaningful development projects.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade union movement has repeatedly made representations to the Government for the setting up of a Foundation for such purpose. As a result of such representations, the trade union movement is glad that the Government has sponsored this Bill before the House. Among the various objectives of the proposed Singapore Labour Foundation, it is to be noted that educational projects and a scheme for industrial rehabilitation are among the principal objectives of the Foundation. In the Bill, it is clearly stated that not only the trade union members are to benefit from the establishment of the proposed Foundation, but other workers and other Singaporeans can and will also benefit from the activities of the proposed Foundation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scheme for industrial rehabilitation, for instance, when implemented by the proposed Foundation, would serve a very real need
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> among the workers in Singapore. It has been realised for many years, in the highly industrialised countries of the West, that workmen's compensation, in the form of monetary payment, is not satisfactory from the point of view of the incapacitated workers and their dependants. No amount of monetary compensation can make up for the feeling of desperate anguish by incapacitated workers at the prospect of not being able to earn their own living. On the other hand, a scheme of industrial rehabilitation, would enable an incapacitated worker to train for an alternative employment most suitable to his altered circumstances. By so doing, it would thus help him to derive personal satisfaction from gainful employment and from being able to support his own family. With the proposed Foundation, it becomes feasible to provide the costly infrastructure and the facilities that are required for the scheme.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the proposed Foundation under the Bill should eventually prove to be beneficial to workers and their employers. It is for this reason that the Bill makes provisions for donors to include persons and organisations other than workers and trade unions respectively. It is to be hoped that the employers will respond generously to the proposed Foundation which will eventually benefit them through benefitting their workers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, all potential donors and benefactors can rest assured that the funds of the proposed Foundation will be used only for the stated objectives as enumerated in the Bill. Apart tom the provision for yearly auditing, a report of the Foundation has to be tabled annually before Parliament.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My trade union colleagues and I strongly support this Bill, and we hope the rest of the Members of this House will also give their support to this Bill.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate the Minister for Labour for introducing this Bill for the creation of the Labour Foundation, which is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> designed to aid our trade union movement and assist the families of union members.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel sure that this Bill would not have been considered if the persons concerned in promoting the Bill had not been closely associated with the trade union movement and if the Minister for Labour had not had links with the trade union movement. We are fortunate in having a Minister for Labour who is familiar with the history of the trade union movement in Singapore and with the objectives and aspirations of labour - he is a member of the old guard, the small group of persons who, in the early 5O's took up the fight for our independence against seemingly overwhelming odds.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passage of this Bill and the establishment of the Labour Foundation will not only benefit the-workers of Singapore but also enhance the dignity of labour. It will also dispel the allegations of certain politicians, who have been unsuccessful at recent elections, that workers are being exploited under the rule of the People's Action Party. These politicians, who inevitably appear on the public stage once every four or five years at election time, are prone to make wild and unsubstantiated statements so as to make headlines to attract public attention, even though they know that their claims are untrue.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The philosophy behind the Labour Foundation and the fact that it is being set up by our Government clearly nails the lies of the opposition as misrepresentation of the fact.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am extremely happy that this Bill is being introduced by the Government; it also demonstrates that the contributions and sacrifices made by labour in their development and progress of Singapore have been taken into account. Therefore, as a former trade unionist, I support the Bill in principle.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to enquire whether this Foundation will also cater for the families of the trade unionists who belonged to the small band which pioneered the trade union movement in Singapore in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the early fifties - in an era when trade unionism was an ugly word and trade unionists were regarded as trouble-makers. Some of these trade unionists, at great personal sacrifice, made solid and invaluable contributions in the struggle against the colonial government for economic and political freedom. Some of them are here today and some of them are no longer active because of their age and other reasons, but we should not forget the roles they played and the sacrifices they made, which in many cases resulted in their having to neglect their families. As a result, some of the families concerned are badly off and are suffering today. I feel that we should not disregard our responsibilities to these members of the old guard in the trade union field in our concern for the welfare of the trade unionists of today and tomorrow.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to refer to the statement in the Bill which states that the establishment of this Foundation will not involve the Government in any financial commitment. It is the general practice when a foundation is set up for the promoters of the foundation to make a large financial contribution to the foundation. This substantial financial contribution is not only to get the foundation going but also to demonstrate the goodwill and sincerity of the promoters to the cause for which the foundation was set up. In this case, since it is the Government which is setting up the Labour Foundation, one would expect that the Government would manifest its support for the Labour Foundation by giving it a substantial contribution to start it off.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are several foundations in Singapore, the Lee Foundation, and the Shaw Foundation, to name two. Both these Foundations were created by philanthropists for worthy causes and they contributed substantial sums of money to start off the foundations, so that they could become viable concerns. I am therefore astonished by the statement that the Labour Foundation will not involve the Government in any financial commitment.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prompts me to question the degree of support the Government proposes to give to the Labour Foundation. Do the objectives and rationale for the setting up of the Labour Foundation enjoy the full support and cooperation of the Government or is the Government merely establishing an edifice as a cosmetic, to provide lip service to a worthy cause?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am pleased by the support for the Bill expressed by the Members for Boon Teck and Khe Bong.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has always believed that labour and management must work together with the Government for the social and economic development of our country. A necessary element in this tripartite policy is a vigorous modern trade union movement. The modernisation programme of the trade union movement started in 1969 was therefore supported by the Government.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year the National Trades Union Congress proposed the establishment of a Labour Foundation. This was endorsed by the Government since it would facilitate the social, economic and educational activities of the trade union movement. As the Member for Boon Teck pointed out, the Foundation will in effect be a central coordinating body to channel funds from the NTUC and its affiliated unions as well as other sources to finance various projects for the interest of unions and workers and their families. Members might like to know that the financial position of trade unions has improved considerably since the Government implemented the check-off scheme in 1970. The Member for Boon Teck has said rightly that our unions have for some years sufficient funds to give effect to their objectives. The question of Government contributions therefore does not arise.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Khe Bong has asked whether the Foundation would extend its welfare programmes to families of trade union members active in the fifties. Sir, this is a matter that will have to be decided by the Board of Directors of the Foundation. However, I have no doubt that the Board will
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> take into consideration the contribution made by the old guards of the trade union movement when considering this question.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill - [Mr Ong Pang Boon].
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee, reported without amendment, read a Third time and passed.

  <!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for Finance, in view of the administrative problems encountered in the past in the payment of Non-Pensionable Annual Allowance to both monthly-paid and daily-rated employees, if he will inform the House whether there will be policy changes in the payment of Non-Pensionable Annual Allowance for 1977.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I am not too sure what administrative problems the Honourable Member for Anson has in mind. There have been some minor difficulties but I am not aware of any compelling reason that necessitates a policy change in the payment of the Non-Pensionable Annual Allowance.
