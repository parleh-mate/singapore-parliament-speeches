<div align="center"><b>(Admission in public hospitals)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Encik Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Encik Harun bin A. Ghani</b> asked the Minister for Health

(a)  how  many  retirees above 55 years of age were hospitalised

from 1994 to 1996; (b) how many of them could not afford to  pay

their  bills; and (c) how many of them received assistance  from

Medifund.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Senior Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline K. Wong) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, between 1994 and

1996,  there  were about 240,000 admissions in public  hospitals

for  people  above the age of 55.  Of that group,  about  15,000

indicated that they could not afford to pay the bills  and  were

referred  to Medifund for assistance.  About 15,300 of them  (or

98.7%) received assistance from Medifund.

<br><br><!-- Encik Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Encik Harun bin A. Ghani</b> asked the Minister for

application of 1,518.  For 1991, 379 cases were approved out  of

972 applications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount disbursed to successful applicants, Sir,

amounted  to  $4,548,500 in 1991 benefiting 2,332 households  in

<div align="center"><b>MAJLIS UGAMA ISLAM SINGAPURA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Collection of administrative fee from Muslims performing haj)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Encik Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Encik Harun bin A. Ghani</b> asked the Minister-in-charge

of  Muslim Affairs (a) why Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura collects

$200 each from Muslims who are going to perform haj and (b)  how

much  was  collected from 1994 to 1996 and  how  the  money  was

spent.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b> Sir, may I be allowed to reply in

Malay?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the

administrative fee of $200 for each haj pilgrim  helps  pay  the

costs   of  the  various  administrative,  medical  and  welfare

services provided by MUIS to our pilgrims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS helps to ensure that all the haj arrangements for

Singapore  pilgrims  are  smooth  and  incident-free.   A   team

comprising  Assistant Pilgrim Officers and a  Religious  Officer

accompany the pilgrims during the pilgrimage to advise  pilgrims

on haj rituals, religious matters and welfare services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sufficient medical supplies and equipment will be brought

into  Saudi Arabia during the haj.  Several premises are  rented

in  Makkah, Medinah and Mina  to be used as clinics and offices.

These clinics are managed and served by a team

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>

of  doctors  and nurses from Singapore who are paid  allowances.

Two  ambulances have been purchased to serve our pilgrims.  From

1994 to 1996, the amount collected are as follows:

<pre>

     Year           Amount collected

                         $

     1994                740,421

     1995               823,156

     1996               970,900

</pre>

The  amounts collected, Mr Speaker, Sir, have to be supplemented

by donations from MSE Angullia Wakaf for the purchase of medical

supplies.

<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Can I ask the

Minister  what is MUIS' stand on the group of pilgrims who  went

to  the haj not through MUIS and whether MUIS intends to collect

the same administrative fee of $200 from them?  If not, what  is

MUIS'  stand  on  these pilgrims if they were to  seek  help  or

services  from  the various doctors and welfare  officers  while

they are in Makkah?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the stand of

MUIS  in respect of such pilgrims is that MUIS would not  accept

nor  encourage them to obtain any visa outside Singapore.   This

matter will be discussed further in the Committee of Supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to whether they are required to pay $200, so

far, MUIS did not collect any such amount from them.  If we  do,

it  means we are providing recognition to them.  This issue will

have to be studied further.  With regard to services rendered at

Makkah, MUIS does not take into consideration whether or not the

pilgrim  pays  the  $200 administrative fee  because  MUIS  will

provide the necessary assistance when needed.

<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): How can we make this

matter more equitable for those who have paid the $200 and those

who  have  not  paid  the $200 administrative  fee?   Will  they

receive the same treatment?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, if possible, I

will  discuss  this  matter further during  the  debate  in  the

Committee of Supply.

<br><br><!-- Encik Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun bin A. Ghani (Hong Kah)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, why

did MUIS not urge the pilgrim agents to use SIA flights?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, this is a

matter which has been decided upon by the Saudi government  with

regard  to  pilgrims.  The pilgrims are encouraged to use  Saudi

Air.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head Q -

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head Q - Ministry of Home Affairs.

Amendment No. (1), Mr Chng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast) :</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head Q of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister for Home Affairs has recently announced

that  32 new Neighbourhood Police Centres (NPCs) will be set  up

when the current Neighbourhood Police Posts (NPPs) are revamped.

These  NPCs  will  serve  as  one-stop  centres  to  provide   a

comprehensive  range  of  services.   The  Minister   has   also

disclosed that currently, our NPPs are understaffed.   The  NPCs

can solve this problem because 120 officers can man each NPC  at

any  one time, compared with the current 15 officers per NPP  in

the 92 NPPs nationwide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I applaud the efforts of the Singapore Police Force to

be  constantly on the look-out to improve the manner  we  handle

internal  security  of  our country making  Singapore  safe  for

Singaporeans.   My  concern is that this very restructuring  may

compromise the security and safety of Singaporeans.  In my view,

the  introduction  of  the NPCs is in  actual  fact  a  move  to

downsize the Police Force.  I do

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>

not  believe  for  one  moment that this is  done  to  cut  down

employment  of  police  officers,  but  rather,  I  believe  the

Ministry  or  the  Police  Force has  got  a  manpower  shortage

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with all employers in Singapore, the Singapore Police

Force  also  faces a similar problem, ie, shortage of  manpower.

More so in the uniformed services as generally Singaporeans shun

such  jobs.  I understand also the staff turnover is high  which

means that we have difficulty in keeping those already recruited

into  the  Force.   This problem, Sir, could perhaps  be  solved

through several ways.  One is of course the recruitment of  non-Singaporeans  which  the  Police Force is  already  doing.  More

should  be  done as there are well-trained police personnel  who

are more than happy to make Singapore their home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other measure is the freeing of manpower from non-essential areas and deploying well-trained officers to jobs

which  are crucial to the effectiveness of the Police Force.   I

shall  speak  more  on  this subject  when  I  move  a  separate

amendment on the privatisation of services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third and perhaps most important measure is to review the

salaries  and  terms of service of the organisation.   I  am  in

support  of  this  measure as we must not  take  our  low  crime

situation  for granted.  This low crime situation is due  mainly

to  the  effectiveness  of the police in  deterrence  and  crime

solving.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This effectiveness must be maintained if we are going to

give Singaporeans the Best Home.  Peace time security is no less

important than preparing for external defence.  Hence, I am most

concerned that the restructuring may mean that we see less  foot

patrols,  less bicycle patrols and less policemen on the  roads.

Such presence may seem to be unproductive and wasteful.  But  it

is  these  very efforts which deter crime.  It is these  efforts

which give our citizens a sense of security and confidence.  How

can this be measured or valued?  Just like how do we measure  or

value  National Service.  Our police, aptly named the Home Team,

is constantly in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>

direct  contact with Singaporeans and tourists alike  and  their

morale and pride must be maintained at the highest level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this House would like to be assured by the Minister

that the reorganisation will enable Singaporeans to continue  to

enjoy the safety and security which we currently have, and  that

his  Ministry will do its utmost to make our Home  Team  into  a

world class Police Force, if there is such a measure.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, before

I  speak,  I  suppose  I should say that  I  have  no  pecuniary

interest when I refer to instances but, of course, I am  drawing

from my knowledge and experience at the Criminal Bar.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I propose to speak on the accountability of the uniformed

organisations  in  this country to the public.   We  have  heard

often enough from the Ministers and from the PAP leaders of  how

the Government is transparent and accountable to the people.   I

think  the time has now come for us to translate some  of  these

utterances  into  positive steps to show  that  the  Police  are

accountable,  not only the Police but also the  other  uniformed

organisations, are accountable to the people.   I  think  it  is

time  we gave some measure of control over what happens in  this

country  to  our people.  And my party has been advocating  this

for some time now in its slogan "Power to the People".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to speak on the role of the Police Force. Sir, the

Police, first and foremost, serve the public.  They are here  to

look after the interest of the public and to protect them.  They

must not be seen, and it would be dangerous if they are seen, to

be serving their political masters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some years ago when we had a prosecution against the party,

one police officer, who was in the witness stand, quite candidly

said, "Anything that comes from a political party, I can't  deal

with  it.  I have to refer it to the Minister for instructions,"

although   he  had  the  power  to  deal  with  that  particular

application  from the party.  But that is not the  point  of  my

amendment today.  My amendment is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>

about  the  complaints  that are made, from  time  to  time,  by

members of the public about violence used by the police officers

whilst  they  are  under questioning or in the  custody  of  the

police.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, any such complaint is referred to the

Internal   Investigation  Section  of   the   police.    It   is

investigated by police officers, although we are told it forms a

separate  branch of the police.  But nothing is said  about  how

the  investigations are carried out and if there is any  report,

that report is not made known to the public or to the victim who

made  the complaint.  He is merely told in a very curt note that

there is no evidence of his complaint.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some four years ago, there was a boy of 14 who was taken in

by  the  police and he was detained for about seven hours.   And

when  he  was  finally  released, he was found  to  have  severe

injuries  on  him.   The  father reported  it  to  the  Internal

Investigation  Section  and later on consulted  the  solicitors.

When  the solicitors wrote to the Division for the names of  the

police  officers  who  had interrogated the  boy  and  in  whose

custody he had been for seven hours, the Divisional head refused

to  disclose the names of the officers, and this dragged on  for

some period of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think in the cause of transparency and accountability, it

is  time  that the Ministry considered setting up a body outside

the  Police Force to consider complaints against the  police  by

members of the public.  In Britain, they have had for some  time

now  what  is  known  as a police watch committee.   Is  it  not

possible  for  us  in  Singapore, in  this  age,  to  have  such

committees   in  every  police  area,  composed  of  respectable

citizens living in that area and who would be responsible enough

to act responsibly, to inquire into the complaints and to direct

or  to request any action to be taken, if action is to be taken?

That would give our citizens and the public a greater measure of

confidence  in  the Police Force, that there is  an  independent

neutral  body which will investigate any complaints made against

the police by them.  That would enhance

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>

the  role of the police in the eyes of the people, and they will

no  longer  be  looked  upon as merely serving  their  political

masters.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, I do not know why

the  NCMP  always refers to Britain.  Why do we always  have  to

follow  Britain?  I think the British have their  own  problems.

Thank you very much, we can manage ourselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the latest announcement by the Ministry on the pay

review of the Police Force is anxiously awaited.  I hope it will

be  positive.  It will no doubt help to boost the morale of  the

Force but, more importantly, it will attract more aspiring young

Singaporeans to make law enforcement as their career.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police Force has always placed human resource as its

top  priority.  It constantly upgrades the skill of the officers

and reorganises the Force, in order to be more effective and  to

keep up with the ever changing situation in crime fighting.  The

recent move to form Neighbourhood Police Centres, by integrating

the NPPs would go a long way to enhance the effectiveness of our

men  in  uniform.   On  this,  I  am  more  optimistic  than  my

colleague, Mr Chng.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no matter how one reorganises, the Force will

always  require more able and dedicated recruits  and  with  the

scarce  human  resource in Singapore and with  so  many  sectors

competing  for so few,  it will always be difficult  to  attract

young, dedicated people to the Force.  I would therefore like to

suggest that since not all posts in the Police Force have to  be

trained  so vigorously to serve as law enforcement officers,  it

would  seem a waste to deploy all those who have undergone  such

training to serve in duties which do not require such discipline

and  skill.  I am referring to those officers being deployed  to

tasks   such  as  issuing  parking  summons  for  minor  traffic

offences, clerical or administrative duties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some countries, I understand, issuing summons for

illegal  parking or minor traffic offences is being  privatised,

or they engage retirees to carry out this task.  As for clerical

and administrative duties,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>

those  who are engaged in the Police Force need not be from  the

uniformed  group.   They  can be drawn from  the  civilian  work

force.    This  would mean that those who join the Police  Force

and  have undergone vigorous training will be deployed only  for

active police duty, so as to maximise their effectiveness in the

uniformed group.

<br><br><!-- Encik Harun bin A. Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Harun bin A. Ghani:</b> Sir, may I seek a clarification

from  Mr  Jeyaretnam?   I thought Mr Jeyaretnam  said  that  the

Singapore  Police  and other personnel are  not  accountable  to

Singapore.   Is he saying that police  and  uniformed  personnel

are  not accountable to the people of Singapore?  He said it  in

his introduction just now.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I thought I made it quite clear when I spoke

that  when  the public have complaints against the Police,  they

are  not  told  how  the  investigation was  carried  out,  what

statements were taken and the final report is not made known  to

the  person who made the complaint.  That is exactly what I mean

when  I  say accountable.  The Police have to be accountable  to

the  people, and if the people have a grievance, then the Police

should answer the people and account to them for their actions.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I just like to

make  a  point about Mr Jeyaretnam's comments just  now  on  the

complaint  against the Police.  He, of course,  will  know  that

there  are always checks against the misuse or improper  use  of

methods  of  interrogation by police officers, not  only  it  is

provided  for  in  the  Penal Code in respect  of  offences  for

oppressive  questioning,  the courts have  also  taken  it  upon

themselves to monitor and to look at statements made by  accused

persons  to  police officers to see whether they are voluntarily

obtained.   And there have been some cases where such statements

have been rejected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do believe that a well-trained professional Police

Force would want their statements taken by them to be admissible

as  evidence.   I think checks and balances are  in  the  system

concerning  the  control  of  the  Police  and  that  they   are

accountable.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I come to crime control in neighbourhoods. Sir,

Singapore  is fortunate to have a comparatively low crime  rate.

We must be one of the very few countries in the world that needs

to  advertise that low crime rate does not mean no  crime.   The

Neighbourhood  Police  Post (NPP) is a key  institution  in  the

fight  against  crime in Singapore.  There are now  91  NPPs  in

Singapore.  The NPP is the most visible link between the  Police

and  the  people.  It forges ties between officers and residents

and  provides  the  latter with a real sense of  security.   The

officers  also  get to know the neighbourhood  well,  adding  to

their ability to cope with local crime quickly.  Since the start

of  the  scheme  in 1983, the NPP has gained a solid  reputation

among  residents.   It  is  usually  the  first  recourse   when

residents  want  to report a crime or dispute.   The  fact  that

crime  is generally low  in the estates testifies to the success

of the police in general and the NPP scheme in particular.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this month, the Minister announced the setting up

of  three Neighbourhood Police Centres (NPCs) to provide  better

service to the residents; the first to be set up in October, the

others  in  the  first  part of next  year.   Sir,  the  reasons

reported for the redesign of the NPP scheme are said to be  two-fold:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, expanding the duties of NPP officers will encourage

better  qualified persons to join the Police.   Second, the  new

scheme  will  be  more  efficient in  terms  of  using  manpower

resources.   Whether the redesign will achieve  these  ends,  of

course, remains to be seen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, there are several concerns that I hope the

Minister can address.  First, will the reorganisation mean  that

no  new  Neighbourhood Police Posts will be built?  This  is  of

particular  concern  to  those who  have  just  moved  into  new

neighbourhoods. For example, Woodlands is still  served  by  the

Bukit  Panjang NPP.  It is natural for residents who  have  just

moved  to a new area, such as Neighbourhood 5 or 6 in Woodlands,

to  feel  more insecure as they need time to adjust to  the  new

environment.   They, more than anyone else,  in  my  experience,

have requested for more police patrols.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, does the redesigned structure mean more or less

visibility  in terms of foot or bicycle patrols in the  estates?

It  has  to  be  recognised  that  one  of  the  most  effective

deterrents  against  crime  has  been  the  presence  of  police

officers in vulnerable areas.  Fast response cars or car patrols

may  be  more efficient, but not as effective in terms of police

presence as men on foot patrols.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, will the redesigning of the NPPs also take into

account  the fact that it is now possible to keep watch  through

the use of surveillance cameras?  Surveillance equipment may  be

expensive but never as good as officers on the ground.  However,

they  can  be  on  24  hours  a day providing  round  the  clock

security.   These  cameras are already a common  sight  in  some

private  properties  here.  Although they  are  used  in  public

streets  and  facilities, it is much more  widespread  in  other

countries  such as England.  In the long run, such  devices  may

help   to  alleviate  the  shortage  of  manpower  in  uniformed

services, which was referred to by other MPs, while providing  a

high  degree of security in areas monitored by such  means.   Of

course, I do not mean to advocate that these devices are  placed

in such a manner as to intrude on the privacy of residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is worth emphasising in closing that the prevention

of  crime is not only the sole task of the police.  It  is  even

more  important for all residents to be aware of  the  need  for

security.   All  too  often, one finds that  residents  complain

about  petty  thefts  of their belongings  left  out  in  public

corridors,  claiming that the police have not done  enough.  The

public needs to be aware that the control of crime is not just a

matter  for  the  police  but it is the responsibility  that  is

shared by all.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> May I ask the speaker, by way of

clarification, when he talks about interrogation methods of  the

police and the admissibility of statements, is he aware that  in

1989 three men were alleged to have confessed to murder after

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>

28  hours  of interrogation when they were totally innocent  and

finally were acquitted by the court?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> Sir, I believe that the courts

and  the  law  reports,  which of course  Mr  Jeyaretnam,  as  a

practising  lawyer would be aware of, do document  a  number  of

cases where, because of persistent questioning and long hours of

questioning, the statements have not been received in  evidence.

It is not just one case where the statements have been rejected.

There  have  been  rejections  of  statements  on  a  number  of

occasions which, of course, Mr Jeyaretnam should know about.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> The statements were admitted in this case.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung:</b> But you do know many of the

statements were not admitted.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, the upshot in juvenile delinquency,

rioting and teen violence is a cause for concern.  There is also

a rise in the number of female delinquents.  Contrary to popular

belief  that delinquency is a problem of broken homes,  some  of

these  delinquents seem to come from affluent families as  well.

They are at an age not to realise that if caught and charged for

misdeamours  it  may result in an uncertain future.   Hence,  we

must  implement measures to prevent such young Singaporeans from

having their careless behaviour criminalised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore welcome the implementation of the ban on under-16s from tea dances and discos. This is but one measure.

Another    measure   which   should   be   considered   is   the

implementation  of  a  curfew on teenagers in  selected  popular

locations.   Young Singaporeans are drawn to the  bright  lights

and  reading  media  reports.  There seems  to  be  a  trend  in

believing that it is fashionable for young people to be  members

of a gang.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When enforcement measures are implemented, unfortunately, a

breach will bring the young offender face to face with the  law.

A  tough  decision will then have to be made by the  enforcement

agency, which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>

is  to  prosecute or not to prosecute.  Prosecution of  a  young

offender is often viewed negatively, especially when a custodial

sentence  is  imposed after conviction.  Parents are  inevitably

the first persons to declare that their children are not bad  or

guilty, even when the evidence before them is overwhelming.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delinquents often cite parents' behaviour, such as neglect,

abuse, indifference to over-indulgence or over-protectiveness or

being  too strict, as a cause for their behaviour.  Such parents

even  blame  the  schools for their children's  poor  behaviour.

What  all  this  means is that delinquency and a host  of  other

related problems are very much a multi-faceted one.  By the time

the  police is involved, much harm has already taken place.  The

lucky  ones may get away with a stern warning.  But the  not  so

fortunate  ones will have their criminal records with  them  for

the  rest of their lives.  Therefore, this issue is not strictly

a police problem as many have mistakenly believed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that an Inter-Ministry Committee has been put in

place  to look into this problem and the imposition of a ban  on

under-16s  from  discos and tea dances is only  one  measure  to

prevent the problem from escalating.  It will be useful for  the

Minister  to enlighten us on the workings of this Committee  and

elaborate  on  some  of  the  possible  measures  that  will  be

implemented to arrest this problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, the ban on teenagers below

the  age  of 16 entering premises that sell liquor has  received

very  positive response from parents, especially in view of  the

increasing incidence of reports where youngsters got  beaten  up

by  gangs  and the increase in cases of teenagers being arrested

for rioting.  However, I wonder how effective this measure would

be  to  prevent  our  youths  from joining  gangs  and  creating

trouble, as they can always find other places to engage in  such

illegal   activities.   In  fact,  the  source  for   recruiting

generally  innocent youths into gangs often  happens  in  places

such  as  void  decks, shopping malls, schools  and  other  such

public

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>

places.  By the time they caused problems in these places,  such

as pubs and discos, the damage has already been done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, very often both parents are working and are

not  able  to spend sufficient time to monitor their  children's

activities.   Once  I  was  asked  to  give  assistance  to   my

constituents.   Both  husband and wife are  professionals.  They

were shocked to discover that their son was arrested for rioting

and  being a member of a teenage gang.  They have absolutely  no

prior  knowledge  of  their son's activities.   The  son,  being

extremely  timid,  was  intimidated into  joining  the  gang  by

friends while hanging out in one of these areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, secret societies have effectively been wiped

out.  I am sure our Criminal Investigations Department (CID)  is

more  than  capable  to do the same by tracking  down  the  ring

leaders  of  such  youth  gangs.  Once these  ring  leaders  are

immobilised,  all  the so-called followers,  most  of  whom  are

misguided youths and not hardcore criminals, would not  be  able

to  cause  trouble  on  their  own.   Action  has  to  be  taken

immediately  before  these gangs can take  root  and  become  as

notorious as the secret societies of the past.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, over

the   past   five  years,  I  have  been  speaking  on  juvenile

delinquency and every year I heard that new measures were  taken

to prevent juvenile delinquency.  This is very encouraging.  But

I  still  feel that the Ministry of Home Affairs and the  Police

should   not   be  the  only  agencies  dealing  with   juvenile

delinquency.  I think this is a matter that involves  the  whole

society - parents, schools and other social components.   It  is

the common responsibility of all the people.  So it is not right

that the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Police should be asked

to take the whole responsibility.  It is not right for people to

perceive this as such.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with my colleagues that prevention of juvenile

delinquency  should  be handled by an Inter-Ministry  Committee.

It can be better solved

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>

through such a Committee.  Every year we have new measures.   It

does  not  mean  that  the question of juvenile  delinquency  is

getting  worse. It also means that our juvenile delinquents  are

becoming  more sophisticated.  The moment you have new  measures

they   know  how  to  circumvent  them.   When  the  number   of

delinquents  arrested  is declining, could  it  be  because  our

juvenile  delinquents have learned how to avoid being  arrested?

In  any  case, I appreciate Prof. Ho Peng Kee's announcement  of

the four measures earlier to curb juvenile delinquency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, I would like to ask the Minister a few questions.

The Minister announced that from 1st October, young people below

the age of 16 will be banned from attending tea dances?  Why 16?

Why  cannot you include those below 18?  Those below  18  should

also be banned from going to discos and tea dances.  In December

last year, we imposed a ban on youngsters below 16 from going to

the billiard saloons. We can increase the age restriction to 18.

We  should  reconsider the definition for juvenile  delinquents.

Is it young people below 16 or below 18?  I think we should have

a consensus on the definition of juvenile delinquents so that it

would  be  easier for us to enforce the ban more effectively  on

young people going into such undesirable places.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dancing by itself is not a problem. It is the lighting,

the sound system, the whole atmosphere of the dance hall that is

exciting  the young people.  Our community centres  should  also

have  similar activities to provide places for young  people  to

expend their energy, in the right environment

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point here is the appointment of discipline

masters  in  the schools.  Some teachers have asked  me  whether

their  safety  may be endangered.  How could they  be  protected

when they are threatened?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is to strengthen crime prevention education

in schools.  The Minister said that we could have more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>

talks  and  seminars to teach our young people  how  to  prevent

crimes.  They can also be shown some educational video tapes.  I

think  these  are very good things.  I would even  suggest  that

they should have pamphlets and posters printed on prevention  of

juvenile  crimes,  and even handbooks or small little  pamphlets

for  the parents, social organisations and other members of  the

public  for them to read and understand the problem.  This  will

help to prevent our young people from falling into crime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I feel that the street wise programme, on the face of

it,  is  good for the young people.  We want them to voluntarily

join such programmes.  To a certain extent it is a bit difficult

to implement because these young people are not mature enough in

many  cases.   If  it is possible, I feel that we  may  make  it

compulsory for certain young people to join this programme.   We

should not leave it to them to join on their own free will.

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, cases of

juvenile delinquency in Singapore are on the increase and it has

come  to a stage that gives us cause for concern.  According  to

Police  statistics,  among  the juvenile  delinquents  who  were

arrested  last year, 84% of them were students and 70%  of  them

were  youngsters between the age of 14 and 15.  Very often, they

realise the seriousness of the offences only after they have got

into  big  trouble  and it is too late.  Among  those  who  were

arrested, some were charged with drug addiction, consumption  of

alcohol and disorderly behaviour.  Recently, Chief Justice  Yong

Pung  How pointed out that in the last few months, among the  18

cases  of  rioting, 16 of them involved juveniles.  Very  often,

these  young people will go around in gangs and they will loiter

in  public  places  and amusement parks at night,  fighting  and

causing trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Ministry of Home Affairs' Addendum to the

Presidential Address this year, the Police announced  that  they

would   be  working  closely  with  the  Ministry  of  Community

Development, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>

schools  and  voluntary  welfare  organisations  to  deal   with

juvenile  delinquency.  At present, discipline  masters  of  the

schools  have  been appointed as officers of  the  Police  Cadet

Corps  to  enhance their authority in disciplining  the  problem

students.   Following  that, the Government  has  also  formally

announced  on 16th July, four measures to ban youths  under  the

age  of  16 from attending tea dances.  This is also to  prevent

the  young  people  from  getting into trouble.   Although  some

people  feel that this will not resolve the matter and may  even

cause  the young people to go underground, I personally  do  not

agree  with  them.   I  feel that when  parents  are  unable  to

discipline their children, as a responsible Government, for  the

future  of  the children and for law and order in  society,  the

Government's intervention and adoption of preventive measures is

absolutely necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the four measures adopted and

announced by the Government.  However, there is no mention as to

what  penalties  these  young people  will  face  if  they  have

violated  any of these regulations.  Are they given just  verbal

warning or will they be sent to the schools to be dealt with?  I

hope that the Minister will give us a reply on that.  Six months

after  the implementation of these measures, if the effects  are

not  significant,  we  should have more  stringent  measures  to

enhance the effects.  Maybe we should have curfew or measures of

that sort to prevent juvenile delinquency from rising.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These young teenagers are still in school. Their intellect

is  not  fully  developed.   Their  physiological  reaction  and

conduct  are  easily  influenced by  external  factors.   It  is

necessary  for us to help them to prevent them from  going  into

wrong ways, and to maintain peace and order in our society.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir, I

thank  the  MPs  who  have  spoken  about  the  efficiency   and

professionalism of our Police Force and praised them  that  they

have done a good job.  I am sure this will spur them further and

motivate  them  to do better.  And I also welcome any  justified

criticism of their deficiency because I am sure they know

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>

that they are deficient in some areas, and if there are ways for

them  to  do  better, they will welcome suggestions  to  perform

better.   But criticism about their performance, whether  it  is

about  brutality or the way they go about their  job,  which  is

unjustified and unwarranted or there is no evidence  to  support

it,  I am sure, would not help them in their work.  It may  just

de-motivate  them.   But, of course, I  know  my  officers  will

always work hard, they try hard, and they will do their best  in

whatever that is given to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are concerned also, like Mr Chng and some of my

colleagues,  about  the competitiveness  of  the  Police  Force,

whether  or not we are able to recruit the right kind of people,

and enough people into the Force.  As we know, Singapore faces a

manpower  shortage and we have hundreds of thousands of  foreign

workers.  The private and public sectors are competing  for  the

same  pool  of school leavers.  So we have to always continually

look for ways and means of making our scheme more attractive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have recently set up with the Prime Minister's Office an

MHA  Joint  Committee  to  review the terms  and  conditions  of

service  for  all the uniformed services under the  Ministry  of

Home  Affairs,  not  just for the Police  Officers.   This  will

ensure  that  the  officers  are fairly  compensated  for  their

sacrifices  and their responsibilities and it will  help  us  to

maintain the competitiveness of the uniformed services in MHA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preliminary findings show that the low entry, ranks and

salaries,  as well as the lower progression rates,  have  indeed

worked  against  us in attracting and retaining  especially  the

junior officers.  We need better progression prospects and  more

competitive pay structures to attract people, and I  think  that

would  be  the  outcome of the review.  We are also  looking  at

managing  our  uniformed  groups'  salaries  autonomously,  that

means, within the Ministry, so that we can react to changes more

effectively  and  promptly.  The study should  be  completed  by

September.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pay and benefits are not the only things that the MHA would

be  improving.  In parallel, we are also introducing schemes  to

provide officers with ample opportunities to upgrade themselves.

We   would  also  restructure  their  jobs  to  make  them  more

interesting  and  challenging and thus make  their  career  more

fulfilling and meaningful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Kenneth Chen that non-core Police functions

- the functions are crime prevention, investigation, maintenance

of  law and order - should not be done by a fully trained Police

Officer.   I  agree  with  him that the  job,  say,  of  issuing

summonses for parking offences actually does not need  a  Police

Officer to do.  We need somebody to do the job.  As you  see  in

the  HDB, the parking wardens are not Police Officers, yet  they

are  able,  when  they  are empowered, to  issue  summonses  for

parking offences.  So we will do more of that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng also asked us to consider recruiting foreigners

into  the Police Force.  We do not have a special programme just

to  target  foreigners but if there are suitable foreigners  who

understand  our  culture  and society,  who  are  interested  in

serving  here  and have the same commitment and  willingness  to

settle down in Singapore, we will certainly consider them.   But

they   must   meet   the  same  recruitment  criteria   as   for

Singaporeans.   We do not have one set of rules  for  foreigners

and another set for locals.  So far, we have recruited a few and

we will continue to recruit them if they apply to us and if they

meet the job requirements.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerns were expressed about the redesigning or

restructuring of the Neighbourhood Police Posts.  Mr Chng put it

as if we are downsizing the Police Force.  We are not downsizing

the  Police  Force.   Let me assure him that  the  Police  Force

manpower  strength  will remain the same, if  not  increase,  if

there  are  new  job  requirements that will  need  more  Police

Officers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin also wants assurances that our redesigning or

restructuring of the NPP will continue to provide the same level

of  service  to the public.  Again, let me, at the outset,  say,

yes, that will continue to be so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has asked for the details of this new NPC (Neighbourhood

Police Centre) system.  Let me try to give a bit more details on

that.   Our  current  NPP system was implemented  in  1983.   No

system  can  remain  cast in concrete or in iron,  and  last  us

forever  even  when circumstances change.  Indeed, circumstances

have  changed.   That is why I have asked the  Police  to  do  a

review  of  the NPP system, bearing in mind that the profile  of

new  entrants into the labour force has changed and also bearing

in mind that the public expectations of the service level of the

Police  have also changed, and that we are competing  with  many

other organisations for the same scarce pool of manpower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The review was driven by three key considerations.

Firstly,  it was a growing difficulty that the Police  faces  in

recruiting  junior Police Officers, especially given  the  tight

labour  market and the improving educational profile.  So  there

is  a need for Police to make better use of the limited manpower

resources available.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason that drives us to do this review is that

as  we have increasingly better qualified officers, then the job

scope and challenges must also expand.  In other words, you just

cannot  have  a  polytechnic diploma holder  becoming  a  Police

Officer  and sitting at the counter doing the same mundane  work

of changing identity card addresses.  We have to widen his job's

scope to make it more challenging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we also need to involve the community more in the

area  of crime prevention, so that they have a greater ownership

over  the  security of their own neighbourhood.  I believe  that

the security of our neighbourhood should not just be the job  of

the  Police Officers.  I think it is also in the interest of the

residents  living in the neighbourhood to ensure that the  place

is safe.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the NPP system has been redesigned. This

redesign of the NPP system will see the creation of six regional

headquarters,   instead   of   the   current   seven    division

headquarters.  Together with the six regional HQs, we will  have

<br><br>32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neighbourhood Police Centres (NPCs), and the  NPCs  will  be

spread  island-wide  in  accordance with the  Development  Guide

Plan.   Each NPC will manage between one and four NPPs and  they

will  work as an integrated unit.  With the redesign,  the  NPPs

will continue to serve as a contact point for the public and  if

they  need assistance from the Police, they can still go to  the

NPPs.   If  you add up the new arrangement and compare with  the

current   arrangement,  you  will  find  that  indeed  the   new

arrangement  regional HQs, NPCs and NPPs  will have more service

points  for the public.  Under the present arrangement, we  have

seven  division HQs plus 91 NPPs.  There are 98 service  points.

Whereas  when we have six regional HQs, 32 NPCs and 66 NPPs,  we

will  have  104 service points.  In other words,  we  have  more

centres available for the public to access Police services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current system of the NPPs, the officers actually

perform quite routine tasks.  For example, when somebody makes a

police  report,  that report will be filed and referred  to  the

division  HQ  for investigation.  The NPP officer  does  not  do

investigation.  As a result, it does take some time for  matters

to  be  investigated.  But with the redesign, the cases will  be

dealt  more quickly because the NPCs will have enough  officers,

about 110 or 120 officers, to actually do the investigation.  In

other words, they need not refer the report to the HQ.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NPC patrol officers will also do the investigation and

if there are serious cases, for example, serial crime, they will

refer to the CID where CID will have specialist officers to deal

with  them. So let me assure Members that the NPCs and the  NPPs

will provide adequate services for our public and they will work

as an integrated and an integral whole.  It is not another layer

of bureaucracy in the Police organisation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The redesign will benefit the community in many ways.

Firstly, the NPCs will be able to serve the crime victims better

and faster.  Instead of having to be passed from one NPP officer

to the investigator and the scene of crime officer, from the HQ,

the  crime  victims  will now be served by front  line  officers

handling  the entire process.  They will be able to process  the

case faster as they would have greater autonomy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, with the resources that the NPCs have, it will be

able  to better mobilise the community to work out the solutions

to  common  and  community problems.  The closer involvement  of

community  organisations will ensure that the  Police  resources

will be best tailored to meet the local needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the NPP system will begin with the

one-year pilot programme beginning in October with the first NPC

being  set  up  in the present Queentstown Driving Test  Centre.

After  the  pilot phase, the Police will extend this concept  to

the whole of Singapore by the year 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Chin is concerned about reduced police presence in

the  neighbourhood and asked whether there will  be  fewer  foot

patrols.   I  think it is understandable that such concerns  are

expressed,  but  let  me  assure him that  they  are  unfounded.

Firstly, the traditional roles of NPPs in providing the  counter

services,  proactive  patrolling and door-to-door  visits,  will

continue.   Secondly, the additional task of fast  response  and

investigation undertaken by the officers at the NPCs will not be

at  the  expense of community policing.  NPC officers  would  be

specially tasked also to go on patrols or house visits during  a

shift  or  part of a shift.  In fact, with the greater  autonomy

that  they  enjoy, the NPCs will be better able  to  deploy  the

resources according to the crime situation and demand for police

services  in  their  area of jurisdiction.  This  will  in  fact

enhance  overall  police presence and create a  safer  and  more

secure neighbourhood.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that Singapore is one of the safest countries

in  the  world  to  live  in.  We did not  say  this  ourselves.

Singaporeans  feel it.  Recently, the World Economic  Forum  and

the  International  Institute  for Management  Development  rank

Singapore first in the area of security.  Respondents to the two

surveys  are  confident  that persons and  properties  would  be

protected  in  Singapore.  Another survey  commissioned  by  the

Police  last year and covered 1,300 persons showed that  98%  of

the  respondents thought that security of Singapore  was  either

good,  very good or excellent, while 86% of them felt that  they

are safer now than they were five years ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are measures other than the NPPs that would help to

fight  crime  and  these include the formation of  Neighbourhood

Watch  Zones  in  public and private housing  estates,  and  the

organisation  of  crime  prevention exhibitions  and  talks  for

residents in the neighbourhood.  The local community should take

greater  responsibility  for their own safety  and  security  of

their precincts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of the NPP system depends as much on the Police

as  on  the  willingness of the grassroots leaders to  lead  the

level  of community involvement, bonding spirit as well  as  the

involvement  of the residents in crime prevention in  their  own

neighbourhood.  Police must also find, and be open to,  new  and

better  ways of fighting crimes.  I agree with Prof.  Chin  that

technology is one thing we can use to help to keep a place safe.

As  reported  in yesterday's papers and also in other  articles,

Britain, for example, has installed surveillance cameras to help

reduce crimes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand Prof. Chin's concern too that in new housing

estates, the residents request for NPPs.  As part of this review

and  redesign  of the NPC system, the Police will  look  at  the

redeployment  of some of these NPPs.  But let me  say  that  the

Police cannot set up an NPP in every new housing estate.  It  is

just  not  possible.  We only have that many people,  that  much

resources and these are all we can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>

spare.  We will have to maximise the use of these resources.  We

cannot afford to have an NPP in every housing estate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents themselves really have to help out in this. They

can form Neighbourhood Watch Groups.  But I assure him that,  in

the  review of the redeployment, we will see how we can take out

NPPs  from  some  of the older estates where the  population  is

declining  and shift some of them to the newer housing  estates.

But again, let me caution that they should not expect one NPP in

every  new  housing estate.  I give an example.  In  Bishan,  we

have  Bishan  East  and  Bishan North and  the  current  NPP  is

situated  in  Block 196.  There is a new Bishan  North  and  the

residents also want to have an NPP.  I say that this is just not

possible.   We  could  have officers from the  Bishan  East  NPP

patrolling  the areas in Bishan North.  So the same will  happen

to Woodlands, Sembawang, and other areas too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will leave it to my Minister of State to answer the other

questions raised by Members.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> First, let me take the point that Mr Jeyaretnam has

raised.  Sir, I think his main point is that there is a need for

an  independent  body to look into Police wrongdoing.   Like  Mr

Kenneth  Chen,  first,  may I question the  need  to  cite,  for

example, developments in the UK.  As we know, developments in UK

are quite different, both in terms of the state of the Police as

well as the state of law and order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think we should take the situation as we find it in

Singapore and look at the track record of what has happened  all

these years.  Let me assure this House that the Police Force has

a  strict  code  of conduct and clear guidelines and  procedures

which  ensure  that  Police officers operate in  a  professional

manner.  These guidelines also ensure that officers do not abuse

the   trust  and  authority  placed  on  them.   Procedures  and

supervision   systems  are  also  in  place   to   ensure   that

investigations and all contacts with suspects or members of  the

public are carried out in a reasonable and fair

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>

manner.   As  the  Minister for Home Affairs  has  said,  citing

surveys,  the  Police  Force in Singapore is  well  regarded  by

Singaporeans and indeed even by outsiders, ie, people  who  have

come to Singapore as tourists or even as professionals coming to

study  our  system, and they realise that here is a system  that

works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say also, Sir, that both MHA and the Police take a

very serious view of any complaint or allegation of assault or

violence made against any police officer.  If he is found to

have abused his powers in any way, this police officer faces

disciplinary action and indeed even criminal prosecution.  Sir,

it has taken many years for us to have achieved the high level

of public confidence in the Police Force, especially in terms of

its integrity and professionalism.  MHA will never allow any

black sheep to tarnish the image and integrity of the Police.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in fact, over the past two years, before Mr Jeyaretnam

re-entered this Chamber, I have taken several questions on  this

topic, ie, instances of alleged police assault or brutality  and

even  a  suggestion has been raised before for the need  for  an

independent   IID.   I  had  very  carefully   explained   these

situations  why Police did what it did and I also explained  why

there  was no need for an IID.  This of course includes  Mohamad

Ali's case that Mr Jeyaretnam talked about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, like I said, there are checks and safeguards to

investigate   any  complaint  or  allegation.   Therefore,   the

bottomline  is, and I have said this before, inside  this  House

and  outside,  there  will be no cover-up for  errant  officers.

Errant  officers  who  are  found to  be  errant  after  careful

investigations will be appropriately dealt with.  Investigations

by  the  IID will be impartial, fair and thorough.  And  indeed,

the  IID was previously called the IIS, and Mr Jeyaretnam  still

uses  the  old  term of Internal Investigation Section.   Before

1995, it was a section but Police beefed it up.   Police saw the

need  to  beef it up both in terms of improving its workings  as

well  as  assuring  the  public  that  Police  takes  all  these

complaints seriously.  Therefore, now it has become a separate

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>

division  which  comes under the Inspectorate Department  rather

than the Manpower Department in the past, signaling therefore to

the police officers themselves as well as to the public at large

that Police takes this business of ensuring the integrity of its

members very seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should IID be an independent commission? As I have said

before  in this House, there is no need for such a step.   After

all, will lay people fully understand the workings of the Police

Force  in  terms of its investigation techniques or in terms  of

its  alleged  wrongdoings?  Would it not  be  better,  like  the

present situation, for very seasoned investigators who have done

the  work  on the ground to understand how the system works  and

how  it  should  not work?  And these are the officers  who  are

posted  to  the IID, experienced officers who will be  impartial

and fair in the investigation of cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also said this before. Ultimately, what is

important  in the uniformed force is that the commander-in-chief

must  take  command of his men and all its operations  and  that

includes discipline and allegations of wrongdoing.  Therefore, I

think  it is important to put the right man in the right  place.

Here, he is the Commissioner of Police.  And if indeed he is the

right  man for the job, then I say let him do the work.  And  if

you  do not trust him to do a good work, either in terms of  his

integrity  or  competence, then we should change him.   I  think

this  is  an important point, Sir.  In other words,  we  have  a

system  in place where the right men are carefully selected  for

the  right  jobs  and especially in the Police  Force  where  Mr

Jeyaretnam  rightly points out there is much  contact  with  the

public.  The Police Commissioner, working a system where honesty

and  integrity are the hallmarks, must ensure that there  is  no

cover-up.  In fact, he will be the first person to want to  weed

out any errant officer because he would want his organisation to

be  tip-top  so  that  any allegation by the  public  of  police

wrongdoing,  he  in fact has a vested interest  to  ensure  that

investigations are transparent and fair.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 845</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the bottomline therefore is that the system we have

works.   It  is  shown by the fact that Singaporeans  trust  the

Police  Force.   It  is  shown by the fact  that  errant  police

officers  have in fact been punished in many ways, some  through

disciplinary action, others were prosecuted in court openly.   I

think  there is no cover-up.  And also by the fact that for  the

most  serious  cases,  the Attorney-General's  inputs  are  also

sought  in  cases where IID says, "no further action  required".

AG  will  come  in  and see whether that should  indeed  be  the

course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, I take this opportunity to once again,

which  I have done in the past, reassure this House that  Police

takes  this business of reports by the public of errant officers

very  seriously.  We have a system in place that works.  We have

worked  this  system.  We put the right man in  the  right  job,

right  down  to  the  Police  Commissioner.   And  I  think  the

indicators  will  be  looked  at all  the  time  whether  public

confidence remains high, whether world polls rate us highly  and

indeed  even  in the face of foreign criticisms, as happened  in

the  Michael  Fay's case when the West criticised  our  criminal

justice  system,  including  the  Police  Force.   We  had,  for

example,  a visiting professor, a former Police Chief, who  came

to Singapore and looked at our system for a week and at the end,

concluded  thus,  and  this is a letter he  wrote  to  President

Clinton, "After a long dose of police reality here and  the  US,

and after visiting numerous police agencies in Latin America and

Europe,  I would rather be investigated by the Singapore  Police

Force (SPF) than any other agency."

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me sum up. The SPF guards its reputation jealously.

It  will  not  allow  a  few bad hats to  ruin  its  name.   Any

complaint   on  police  wrongdoing  will  be  taken   seriously.

Investigations will be carried out fairly and impartially.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, may I ask by way of clarification from

the Minister of State?   I am, however, indebted to him for the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 846</b></font><br><br>

long explanation he has given.  I appreciate that.  The Minister

of  State  says there are guidelines.  May I ask him, are  there

guidelines  indeed  about  how  the  Police  should  interrogate

accused  persons?  Because when police officers are  questioned,

they  say  there is no guideline, not even as to the  length  of

time  that  they  can  continue  with  their  interrogation   of

suspects.  So the answer we get is that there are no guidelines.

It  is left to them.  I would like to know from the Minister  of

State what guidelines is he talking about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may ask my second question, would the Ministry

consider  issuing, or at least making available, to the  persons

who complain a full report of the investigations carried out  by

the  Internal Investigation Section, so that the aggrieved party

may  feel that his complaint has been properly looked into,  and

that nothing has been overlooked?  The Minister says there is no

cover-up.   But in the end, the bottom line is - I  am  sure  he

will  appreciate  - the person who has made the  complaint  must

feel that there has been no cover-up.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, on his first point - I think

this point was also covered by Prof. Chin -  any allegations  of

police  assault during the investigation is subject to  scrutiny

by  the courts.  Police takes very seriously instances when  the

courts say that in this case there was police wrongdoing so that

the  statements  are  not admissible.  They  will  look  at  the

judgments.  They will look at what the courts have said what not

to  be done.  In this sense, over the years, police will take  a

reading  from what is admissible in law and they are  guided  by

what is admissible in law and admissible by the courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is an important point because we always talk

about possible police wrongdoing and investigations.   But  this

is  the  ultimate  barometer and test.  Any police  officer  who

conducts  an  investigation  will know  that   if  a  confession

statement is extracted, there is a possibility that it could  be

challenged  in  court.  And when he comes to court,  he  has  to

explain,  he  has to produce his diary, he has to  convince  the

court that there was no wrongdoing.  Over the years, certainly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 847</b></font><br><br>

in terms of what ought to be done and what ought not to be done,

police knows the limits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that Mr Jeyaretnam mentions is: should we

furnish  the full report to the complainant?  Should the schools

furnish the fully marked paper to the students?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> That is different.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I am drawing an analogy.

Firstly,  the complainant may not fully understand,  as  I  said

just  know,  what  has  transpired  in  terms  of  investigative

techniques, in terms of the professional matters that pertain to

the  workings  of  any  police  force.   And  in  his  lack   of

understanding, he may not fully appreciate the fact that  indeed

much  careful work has been done.  I think Mr Jeyaretnam,  as  a

lawyer,  probably  also suffers from this sometimes.   When  you

feel  that you have done all your best for your client, you have

put  in your best work, you have done this, you have done  that,

and  when you furnish the accounts your client says, "What  work

have you done?"  And in spite of the fact that you furnished him

a  whole  list  of what you have done, he or she will  still  be

unhappy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, like I said, ultimately, it must be the question

whether the system works.  And I think Mr Jeyaretnam must  agree

that the system works.  It is his prerogative not to agree,  but

like  I have said, if a large percentage of Singaporeans say  so

and  if  Singaporeans feel very safe on the road,  if  outsiders

praise  us  for our system, then it cannot be that it does  not.

So  the  IID,  and  not the IIS which he spoke  about,  must  be

allowed to do its job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first thank all the Members for speaking on

this  very  relevant topic of juvenile delinquency. I  have  the

figures.  The good news is that the number of juveniles arrested

for  crime has, in fact, fallen from 2,574 in 1995 to 2,101 last

year.   The  overall number of arrests has, in fact, come  down.

And  close  to 70% of the arrests last year were for  theft  and

related crimes, not very serious crimes.  Of course,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>

the  bad  news  all of us know is that fightings have  gone  up,

instances when teens and young people are involved in fighting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok, GPC Chairman, and Mr Choo urged the

Government  to  take a comprehensive approach  towards  juvenile

delinquency.  This is, in fact, a good suggestion  and  this  is

the  approach the Government has taken.  Last year, I  told  the

House  that the Government would take an inter-Ministry approach

towards  tackling  juvenile delinquency.   This  is  because  we

realise  that juvenile delinquency is not just about crimes, but

a  host  of  complex  issues such as effective  parenting,  peer

influence, media influence, use of free time and whatever  else.

This Inter-Ministry Committee on Juvenile Delinquency (IMJD) was

formed in April 1996, which I chair, and members are drawn  from

many  sectors  -  MHA, MCD, MOE, AG's Chambers, Juvenile  Court,

National  Youth  Council, National Council of  Social  Services,

social work professionals and MPs are also on board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is good if I spend a few minutes to outline what

the  Committee has done.  Otherwise people may think that we are

taking    short-term   solutions  to  the  measures   that   are

introduced.  This is not the case.  The latest host of measures,

in fact, come as a package after a long series of other measures

that  have  been put in place.  The IMJD adopted a comprehensive

three-pronged    approach   -   prevention,   enforcement    and

rehabilitation.   This  philosophy is, first  and  foremost,  to

prevent  youths  from drifting into delinquency.   Next,  strict

enforcement  action  against those  who  create  law  and  order

problems  and,  finally, to provide rehabilitation opportunities

for  those who are amenable to change.  And we have  coordinated

the  introduction  of many programmes in the past  year;  court-driven  ones such as boot camp and family conferencing;  school-based  ones  such  as  expansion of  pastoral  care  and  career

guidance programmes, and peer support schemes.  And also pulling

in VWOs, VP mentoring schemes and also enhancing greater network

amongst all parties -

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 849</b></font><br><br>

schools, police, MOE, approved homes, through seminars,  guides,

and networking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list can go on, but I think the first point I want to

make  is  that we have taken this approach of making  sure  that

everybody pulls together.  And this is partly why the number  of

juveniles  arrested has come down.  But in view of  this  recent

phenomenon of teen fighting, I have asked the IMJD now to  focus

in  this area.  And whilst they focus in this area, it will  not

be  at  the  expense  of  all the other measures  that  we  have

introduced.  All the other measures are still in place.  We will

continue to monitor them and fine-tune them, if necessary.   But

now  the  targeted approach is how to cut down on teen fighting.

As  Members have mentioned, many initiatives have been launched,

whether  it is in prevention, the ordinary VSC scheme or  better

liaison  or  indeed some of the police programmes  that  we  are

introducing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to speak a bit about teen gangs. I think this

is the other area that has captured Singaporeans' attention over

the  past 2-3 weeks, particularly since the announcement of  the

under-16 ban.  Let me first say that I want to thank all Members

who  have  spoken up here in support of the ban on 16-year  olds

going  to  tea  dances and other outlets where there  is  public

entertainment and dancing.  Let me assure all Members that we do

not  take  this  measure in an unthinking fashion  or  desperate

fashion.   In fact, it is an extension of what has already  been

done  with  regard to billiard saloons.  On the same basis,  the

police  identified  billiard  saloons  as  places  where   gangs

dominate.   They  go  there,  they  influence  others  who   are

unwitting,  who  are  innocent,  and  then  they  recruit  these

members.   It is the same with tea dances and other such  places

where  teens  may gather, which is a closed setting.   In  other

words,  they go there unwittingly because they are young.   That

is  why  Mr Choo asked this point.  Why 16?  Because the  police

assessment is that 13-15 is a very vulnerable age group, Sec. 1,

Sec. 2, Sec. 3.  Those of us with teens

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>

will  know  that.   They  are  very  impressionable.   They  are

suddenly exposed into the secondary school setting.  So  we  are

targetting this group.  These people come along unwittingly  and

then they are influenced by gangs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chen says they can be recruited anywhere. That is true.

We  can ban them from going to void decks and other places.  But

since tea dance as a setting is identified with the purveying of

negative influences, I think we must act.  The question  is,  as

Mr  Choo and Mr Peh have asked, whether we want to extend it  to

under-18  or to more places.  My response will be, let  us  wait

and see.  I think we want to be incremental.  Our approach is to

be  incremental, to see the efficacy of the programme before  we

even consider whether we should extend it.  And the same goes to

the other suggestions like night curfew and other places.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Choo has made this point about street wise programme,

whether  the  curfew should be voluntary.  We  have  taken  this

approach  because these youths who are given the opportunity  to

come  on  board for this curfew programme are already a targeted

group.   They are youths who are already found by police  to  be

associating   with   secret  society  types.    Therefore,   the

alternative  to them coming on board in this programme  will  be

that  they  are registered under the Registrar of  Societies  as

being  members of teen gangs.  So we feel that to motivate them,

it is better to say, "We give you an option."  Most will come on

board  because here is a programme which helps them and  parents

are  involved.   And   because it is  packaged  as  a  voluntary

programme, they will be more motivated and the success rate will

be higher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think time is running on. We still have many topics

to  go.   I just want to say that all the suggestions that  have

been  made in this House will be considered, including Mr  David

Lim's.    He  actually  questioned  whether  the  ban  will   be

effective,  quoting a youngster.  He said that  they  can  dance

anywhere.   Indeed, they can dance anywhere.  I would  encourage

it.   In  fact, I have asked Mr David Lim to organise tea dances

or

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>

discos in his community centres.  Because there is nothing wrong

in  dancing and, in fact, in these settings, the youngsters will

come  and vent their excess energies.  But what is important  is

that  I do not think the secret society types will want to  come

to  our  CCs.  So that is the approach we have taken.   We  know

that this is not the solution, but I hope that this latest spate

of measures will encourage everybody in Singapore, first of all,

to  say  yes,  this  is the situation that we need  to  address;

secondly,  everybody  can  play a  role  where  they  are;  and,

thirdly,   specifically, how to organise activities  which  will

attract our youths.  I think this is the key challenge,  how  to

organise  activities that will attract the whole  range  of  our

youths,  not  just  those who believe in these  activities,  but

those  who may be averse to being organised.  I think there  are

still ways where we can creatively help them feel that they  can

belong  to  a gang, but do not belong to a gang that fights  and

does wrong things but belong to a gang that will do good things.

Young  people  like  to belong to gangs.    They  can  be  in  a

football  gang or whatever gang.  But let us have more gangs  in

Singapore  where  there is voluntarism.  Several  speakers  have

spoken  about the need for more voluntarism and let  this  be  a

call  to  all Singaporeans that if they want to find a cause  to

champion, champion the cause of our youths in Singapore.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David T. E. Lim (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, may I be allowed

a  point  of  clarification.  First of all,  let  me  thank  the

Minister of State for his very thoughtful answer and I certainly

agree  with  him that we should try to promote good gangs.   The

question  I  have for the Minister of State is  whether  we  are

dealing by imposing a ban with the symptom of a problem or  with

the  root of the problem.  If I may illustrate this.  A man buys

a  pair  of  shoes two sizes smaller than what he needs  and  he

finds very quickly that his feet hurt a lot.  He can go and  see

a doctor.  He can put ointment on the feet.  He can soak them in

the hot tub every night.  But the problem will not go away.  His

feet will continue to hurt.  And his alternative, if

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>

nothing  else works, is to stop walking.  But that  is  not  the

solution.  The solution is that he needs a bigger pair of shoes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point that I was making in my speech the day before was

that  what we need to do is to deal with the root cause  of  why

there are more street fights and street gangs.  Teenagers are at

an  age where they are impressionable.  They are at an age where

they  need  a  lot of love and guidance and understanding.   The

point is that the manifestation of these street gangs means that

there is something that has gone awry and askew in the homes and

in  the  family.  That perhaps is where we ought  to  focus  the

attention.   But, in the meantime, to introduce bans  and  curbs

does not solve the problem because beyond the tea dances, and if

they were to congregate now in the neighbourhood coffeeshops  or

in  hotel lobbies, will we ban them also from those places?   So

the  fundamental issue is, where will it stop?   How  much  more

ointment  and, worse still, we are now going to put ointment  on

18-year olds as well.  Does that solve the problem?

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I think Mr Lim's analogy

is  very  interesting.  However, gangsterism and shoes  are  two

different  things.  While you can change your shoes if  they  do

not  fit you, when children turn bad, you cannot change  to  new

children.  That is a different issue.  Although the new measures

may  not  go to the root of the matter, they are, to  a  certain

degree   quite   effective   in  the  prevention   of   juvenile

delinquents.  So I think Mr Lim should allow our police and  the

Ministry of Home Affairs to try out these measures and  see  how

effective  they are.  As suggested by Mr Peh, let them  try  out

for  six  months and see how these fare.  I think that  is  more

reasonable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point is that I read from the newspapers that

many  young  people  are spotting tattoos  on  their  body.   On

tattoos,  what  kind of attitude should we  adopt?   How  do  we

control  tattoos?  Do we need to legislate?  If  those  children

with tattoos regret later and want to remove them, what can they

do?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Scrape them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Opposition Member

says  he  can  scrape them out.  How do we help  these  tattooed

youths  to  restore  their original  skin  colour?   It  is  not

possible to restore to the original skin.  Maybe bring  them  to

the  Skin Centre to remove the tattoo or do something else.   Or

should we go through legislation to control tattoos?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to inform hon. Members that we

are running behind schedule on this amendment.  Mr Chng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I just cannot help but make a short

comment  in reply to Mr David Lim.  That is the purpose  of  the

law   in   a   country.   Just  because  certain   people   have

psychological problems, for example, prone to stealing, it  does

not mean that we should not have laws against theft.  At the end

of  the day, we have to find deterrents to certain problems.  If

a  person  breaches a certain law, that person must be punished.

When I support the curfew on teenagers and the ban on under-16s,

it  is  precisely for that purpose.  We try to limit  the  areas

which  they  can go wrong.  We do not want them to step  out  of

bounds and become criminals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I move to my next amendment, unless the Minister

of State wants to reply?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You can carry on.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> On staged accidents, this question was

raised by me in an Oral Question and the Minister of State a few

days  ago had given a measured reply indicating that police  has

investigated such complaints.  The short answer is that there is

really  very little the police can do.  The legislation  is  not

adequate at the moment.  At best, the victims and their families

have their lives threatened or endangered on the road.  This  is

very  cold  comfort.  Worse, they would then be fleeced  by  the

workshop operators who actually charge them exorbitant rates for

the service.  What the answer has conveyed is that since the law

is  inadequate  and the police is not able to do very  much,  it

sends a very bad signal to those

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>

perpetrators  and culprits.  It will simply tell them  that  the

police have been trying to do a lot but actually they cannot  do

very much.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a follow up to my Oral Question, I would like the

Minister  to consider this as a serious issue.  We do  not  need

someone  to  be killed on the road before we take tough  action.

If  the law on touting is not sufficient to arrest this problem,

and as one of my Parliamentary colleagues has just suggested  to

me,  maybe we should charge that person for attempted murder  if

there is evidence because he endangers life on the road and that

is a very serious problem.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, recently there was a

spate  of fatal traffic accidents occurring in Singapore and  we

are  all  very  concerned about it.  Because these serious  road

accidents  normally  involve buses,  heavy  vehicles  and  motor

cycles, I would like to ask the Minister what the traffic police

proposes  to  do to ensure that there is greater safety  on  our

roads. I have four recommendations for the Minister to consider.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we must restrict motor cycles, heavy vehicles and

buses.   A  speed limit should be imposed and enforced strictly.

There  should be a special device on their vehicles to  indicate

their  travelling  speed.   Secondly, require  buses  and  heavy

vehicles  to  turn  on the head lights at all  times.   Thirdly,

appoint  voluntary  traffic  wardens  to  help  enhance   safety

awareness and road safety.  Fourthly, require motor cyclists  to

go  on  the  slow  lane and ban them from  the  fast  lane  when

travelling along the expressways.  These measures would  perhaps

help to ensure road safety.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, nowadays child

abduction  cases  are  happening very frequently  in  developing

countries.   There was a report carried in the  Shin  Min  Daily

News  on  2nd  April  1997 about missing children  in  Malaysia.

Although this report mentioned about Malaysia, it also mentioned

about a neighbouring country, and Singapore is the country which

is  nearest  to Malaysia.  According to this report, the  public

affairs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 855</b></font><br><br>

department  of the Bukit Ampang Police Headquarters in  Malaysia

made a shocking revelation that in Malaysia there was an average

of  12  children  reported  missing  every  day.   According  to

statistics, in 1993 there were 4,443 children missing.  In 1994,

there were 3,955. In 1995, there were 3,786 and in the first ten

months of 1996 there were 3,621 children reported missing.  Most

of  these  missing  children were girls and  children  from  the

neighbouring countries.  The most infuriating part is that  some

of  these  children were adopted by the criminal syndicates  who

disfigured  them so that they would not be recognised  by  their

parents  and  they amputated part of their limbs  to  make  them

beggars to  beg for money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among these serious cases of child abduction in Malaysia,

the  most seriously affected state is Johor.  According  to  the

police statistics, among the 400 missing children found,  30  of

them are from neighbouring countries. Of these 30 children, I am

not  aware  how many are from Singapore as it was not specified.

Therefore,  I  feel that we should look into this  problem  very

seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember there were two children from Singapore who were

reported missing since six to seven years and they could not  be

traced.    I have a few suggestions to make with regard to  this

matter.  First, we should have more stringent laws against child

abduction.   Punishments should be the same  as  for  kidnapping

cases,  ie, they could be sentenced to death or to be imprisoned

for  life.   Secondly, when there is a report of missing  child,

the  police should immediately alert the immigration checkpoints

so  that  these  children would not be taken out of   Singapore.

Thirdly,  for children below the age of 12, I suggest  that  the

photograph  in  the passport should be changed every  two  years

because the physical appearance of children varies all the time.

Fourthly,  we should have some self-protection lessons conducted

in  kindergartens and primary schools so that our young children

know how to protect themselves from possible abductors.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, can I ask you to make your

points briefly, as we are running short of time?

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Yes, Sir, you have said that we are running

short of time and I will try and be very brief.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Thank you.

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> I am again in pursuit of people's power and

people's  rights.  This time I ask the Ministry  whether  it  is

time  that  we  had  a  Prisons  Board  set  up  of  responsible

individuals  outside  in  the  community  who  will  listen   to

complaints  from the prisoners.  I know we have visitors  but  I

want  a  body  that will take decisions and see  that  they  are

implemented.   At the moment, Sir, when it comes to disciplinary

control  of  prisoners, everything is left in the hands  of  the

Superintendent.   And  offences are classified  into  minor  and

major offences or misconduct, as they may be termed in the  Act,

and  some  of  these  sentences  that  are  handed  out  by  the

Superintendent are quite severe.  I think it is time we set up a

Prisons   Board,  as  has  often  been  claimed  that   we   are

transparent,  transparency in the way that we treat  people  who

are  charged  with  offences, even though if  they  are  in  the

prisons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Ministry to consider whether it will think

of  setting up a Prisons Board to investigate complaints against

prison authorities or prison officials.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I will ask the Frontbench to give its

response at 2.20 pm.  Discussion on this amendment will  end  at

<br>2.30 pm.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap:</b> Sir, it is good to know that the

trend of drug abuse cases is going down.  But it is still a very

serious problem and we have to eradicate it at all costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent enhancement of punishment meted out to repeated

drug abusers is a move in the right direction.  Can the Minister

let  us  know  the result of this move?  And would the  Minister

enlighten  us  on whether there is plan to further enhance  this

punishment should this be found to be effective?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also concerned about the high number of hardcore

addicts  who have no apparent chance of being rehabilitated.   I

would  like to know what is in store for them and how  they  are

being dealt with.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Chay is not here. Mr Chng.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I have spoken before in this House

about  why  Government has to be competitive  and  why  we  must

privatise  services,  wherever  possible.   On  this  particular

subject, on the MHA, my stand is no different, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned in my speech earlier about the manpower

shortage  and  suggested that officers  should  be  deployed  to

undertake  essential  policing jobs  rather  than  non-essential

ones.  The Minister has already made mention of the fact that we

should  not  have  Police  officers, especially  Traffic  Police

officers, just going around patrolling the streets and enforcing

compliance with rules and regulations.  If the HDB and  URA  can

have  car park wardens just to issue summonses, I do not  see  a

need for skilled, well-trained Police officers doing such a job.

On a broader basis, in the Ministry of Home Affairs itself there

are other such services, and in some countries, even the prisons

service  has been privatised, MHA also runs the Driving  Testing

Centre and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I urge that, in view of the labour shortage which the

Ministry  is  facing, we like to see more Police  on  the  road,

keeping  it  safe for Singaporeans, that it tries  its  best  to

privatise as much of these non-essential services as possible.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, let me first reply to Mr

Chng.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed, I gave a full reply in the House to Mr Chng

that  day  saying that more can be done.  It is not a  situation

where  we  throw up our hands and say nothing can  be  done  and

therefore the perpetrators can carry on what they are doing.  We

said  that  there is difficulty in getting evidence but  how  to

tackle  the problem, what is the root of the problem, work  with

the motor insurance industry,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 858</b></font><br><br>

and  work  with the workshops.  And indeed this is what  Traffic

Police  is  doing - talking to the motor insurance industry,  in

particular  to see, for example, whether we can set  up  centres

where  accident vehicles can go for verification, so that  there

is no question later on as to whether or not a particular damage

was  due  to  the  accident and also  setting  up  a  system  of

authorised workshops so that those who really send in fraudulent

claims, or conduct staged accidents, can be blacklisted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the point I want to make. Let us not throw up in

despair.   We are doing what we can.  But certainly if  we  find

proof  of  a  staged  accident, like I said in  the  House,  the

penalties can be very severe.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On road safety, Mr Choo Wee Khiang has highlighted the fact

that there have been several accidents on our roads recently and

the  need for us to continue to be very diligent in our efforts,

both  in  terms  of  Traffic Police and more  so,  in  terms  of

Singaporeans,  to  take care on the roads,  whether  you  are  a

motorist, a cyclist or a pedestrian.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just, because of time, highlight some of the recent

improvements   made  by  Police.   For  example,  Police,   will

intensify public education efforts on road safety.  In addition,

Traffic  Police  and LTA are reviewing road safety  measures  in

accident-prone areas.  Possible measures include  improving  the

lighting conditions of the road, adjusting the timing of traffic

lights,  because some of these accidents took place near traffic

junctions,  and relocating pedestrian crossings.  So  these  are

the  focused  moves that Traffic Police will do  in  conjunction

with LTA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made a few suggestions: why not install sounders for

motorcycles?   I think it is quite difficult to monitor.   There

are so many motorcycles on the road, unlike the vans where there

are  these  beepers with a light.  I think that  is  very  clear

because the light is on top of the vehicle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another suggestion that he mentioned was for buses to light

up.   I think that can be considered.  I will ask Traffic Police

to  look  at it to see whether making buses light up  will  help

road safety.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 859</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His third suggestion was how to encourage more volunteers

to help man road safety.  We have got very good VSC officers who

are  Traffic  Police officers.  Also there  is  a  scheme  where

Traffic Police, together with AA, have got people who are on the

roads looking out for good drivers. So we want to encourage good

behaviour, besides penalising bad ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On abducted children, Mr Peh has made a string of

suggestions.   First,  whether  we  should  treat  abduction  of

children  as  kidnapping  to  deter  potential  abductors.    In

practice,  whether a case is considered kidnapping or  abduction

hinges on whether ransom is demanded.  If ransom is demanded, it

will  be considered kidnapping.  So it is up to AG to frame  the

appropriate charge, depending on whether ransom is demanded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, he suggests that Police immediately alert the

Immigration  Department  on receiving information  on  kidnapped

children.  I would like to inform him that this is already being

done.   Once  it  is confirmed that a child has been  kidnapped,

Police officers handling the case will immediately telephone the

Immigration Duty Officer at the various checkpoints  to  prevent

the child from being spirited out of the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, he says, why not require a change of photographs

for  children in their passports every two years.   I  think  we

leave  it  to  the parents.  Because after all it is  for  their

convenience  that  they  do it themselves diligently,  otherwise

they  may  have  difficulties  getting  in  and  out  either  in

Singapore or at other countries.  To make it mandatory, I think,

will  inconvenience too many people.  Right now they can  easily

do  it  by  bringing  a  photograph  and  the  passport  to  the

Immigration Department.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, he talks about conducting programmes in

kindergartens  and primary schools to teach our  young  children

how to protect themselves against potential abductors.  This  is

not  really MHA's matter but something is being done along those

lines.   Police have published some books, Mr Policeman  Series,

Constable Ah Chai column and Young Generation magazine.859

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 860</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also crime prevention proficiency badges and regular

talks and visits by Police.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Jeyaretnam takes the same tack, asking for some lay

people,  outside people, to be involved to hear complaints.   As

he  himself has said, visiting Justices of the Peace  visit  our

institutions at least once a month, and these are all  respected

members of the community.  They come sometimes unannounced,  and

they  go anywhere they want.  There is free access.  Very often,

they  will  take complaints and they will inspect the conditions

of  the  prisons  and look into the welfare  of  the  prisoners.

Those  are the two areas.  And whatever complaint is registered.

It  is  sent to the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of  Home

Affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is already a system of lay involvement. I

do not think there is a need for more.  It ultimately depends on

the people who run the system and the system itself.  Similar to

the  answer I gave earlier, the system works - appoint the right

person  to  the right job.  The Director of Prisons oversees  17

institutions.   The Superintendent runs his own institution  and

he  is  statute-bound to make sure that it is well  run.   So  I

think there is no need to institute such a separate body.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Just to supplement what my Minister of

State  has said in reply to Mr Jeyaretnam.  He does not seem  to

be interested in the answers we want to give him.  After raising

the  question, he disappears.  That means either  he  raises  it

perfunctorily, or he does not believe in what he is  asking,  or

he is simply not interested in the answer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is an independent group of people who visit the

prisons,  whether  it  is  an independent  election  commission,

whether  it  is  an independent Police investigation  unit,  the

question does not lie in an independent commission or board,  or

whatever it is.  The question lies in whether the people who run

the system are honest and have integrity.  I think Singapore has

a  good  reputation,  and  that  reputation  must  be  jealously

guarded,  and  that  reputation is that we  have  an  efficient,

honest and transparent system.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>

Nobody can get away with murder.  If Mr Jeyaretnam has any  case

that  he thinks that we ought to investigate, I think he  should

surface it.  Raise it, and we will look into it, but do not cast

a  smear  on  our system.  That would do Singapore an injustice.

That  would  do  all  Singaporeans  an  injustice,  because  our

investors  will  then  say,  "What  sort  of  place  is  this?".

Fortunately,  investors  do not have that  kind  of  impression.

They  come, they see, they know what is going on and they always

give  Singapore high marks for the system that we have.  So stop

talking  nonsense - that is my advice to him.  Be  today's  man!

Be  relevant, not be like an old gramophone record, playing  the

same  old  tune with a hole in the groove, which keeps repeating

itself.   Be the compact disc!  Be a digital audio tape  player!

This is a new technology.  So be relevant!  I urge him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the two questions of drug enforcement raised by Mr

Kenneth  Chen,  let  me assure him that we  will  do  everything

possible to try to keep the drug situation under control, which,

in fact, it is.  Over the last two years since the comprehensive

measures  that  we  have  undertaken,  the  drug  situation  has

improved  somewhat.  But we know that there are  certain  people

who  cannot get away from drugs.  They will go into DRC time and

again, despite the help, rehabilitation and the counselling that

we  have given them.  So for these people, we have decided  that

they will be in for a long haul.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next time we amend the law, we are going to make it

mandatory,  caning plus jail sentence, and not in a DRC.   DRC's

life  is  too  good for them.  It is like home-coming,  back  to

meeting their own community.  They will be in prison if they are

caught the third time for an opiate drug offence.  Five to seven

years,  three to six strokes of the cane, or seven to 13  years,

six  to 12 strokes of the cane if they re-offend, ie, after they

had  been  charged  the  first time for  committing  a  hardcore

offence and re-offend after serving the sentence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the drug situation has improved a bit, we are

concerned about

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>

the increase in the number of Ecstasy abuses.  You have seen the

CNB  has gone all out to deal with this problem.  We have  urged

managements of nightclub operations, lounges, etc, to be careful

-  do not allow the clients to rave around after taking Ecstasy;

do  not  sell them plain water.  They know there is  a  problem,

they better fix it! Help us to fix it.  And if they do not, then

their  licence will be taken away.  And for Ecstasy traffickers,

we  are going to make it as part of the presumption law, that if

they  carry a certain amount, we will determine what it  is,  we

will  presume that they are trafficking in Ecstasy, and we  also

do that for Ice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So be warned! Please do not trifle with the law. CNB is

very  serious in making sure that our place is safe  and  crime-free and drug-free for our children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of privatisation of services, let me again

assure  Mr  Chng  that with the review of our Police  functions,

some  of the non-essential, actually non-Police functions,  will

not  be carried out by the Police.  So catching snakes, clearing

dead animals, for example, that would not be done by the Police.

I  think  there  are  proper agencies to  do  that.   They  will

concentrate  on  the  core Police functions:  crime  prevention,

crime  control, investigation and generally helping to  maintain

law and order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For functions that we are now doing which can be

privatised,  we  will continue to do so.  For  example,  Traffic

Police  has already done away with towing of vehicles,  that  is

being  left to the private sector.  Similarly, driving  centres,

test centres, that is now also being done by the private sector.

The  last  centre  that we have, Kampong Ubi,  we  have  already

privatised it.  Now somebody else is running it, not the Police.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2). Mr Chew.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head Q of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code QC 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has been said and debated in this House about

juvenile delinquency, gang fights and youth violence.  The trend

can be worrying and many of my constituents have expressed their

concern to me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the problem is more deep-seated, more deep-rooted than before. We must identify the root of the problem

early and nip it in the bud.  Sir, I believe that to tackle this

problem, we should not leave it to the police alone.  I think  a

large  part of the Government has to be involved.  Besides,  the

Ministry  of  Home  Affairs, other Government Ministries  should

also  play  a role in identifying and solving this  problem.   I

have identified the following Ministries.  Ministry of Community

Development,  whose  responsibility is the promotion  of  family

values and community support system; Ministry of Education,  the

influence   of  the  school  environment  on  youth   behaviour,

slackness  in school discipline, all these have implications  on

youth  violence  today; MITA, mass media  may  have  undesirable

influence  on  youth  if censorship is not well  under  control;

MINDEF,  I  believe  that the two and the  two-and-a-half  years

spent  in  National  Service  would  have  a  bearing  on  youth

behaviour, particularly depending on the company he mixes  with;

and  the  Ministry  of  Labour, I believe  the  omnipresence  of

foreign  labourers in Singapore, to some extent, has undesirable

social influence on our youth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am therefore proposing that the Government seriously

look  into  forming  a  special  multi-Ministry  task  force  to

identify  the  root  causes of this problem  and  come  up  with

solutions.   Sir,  the problem is a serious  one  and  has  wide

ranging  implications.  I am therefore proposing that this  task

force be chaired

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>

by  at  least a Permanent Secretary and the best person  is  the

Permanent  Secretary,  Ministry of  Home  Affairs,  with  senior

representatives from Ministry of Community Development, Ministry

of  Education, MITA, MINDEF and Ministry of Labour.  I urge  the

Minister to consider this proposal seriously.

<br><br><!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davinder Singh (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, much of what I

intended to say has already been said in this House about  youth

violence.   There is only one other point which I do  not  think

has been raised yet and this is another dimension to the problem

which may have potentially far graver consequences arising  from

youth  violence  and teen gangs.  And it is  this.   Some  youth

gangs  may  wittingly  or  otherwise organise  themselves  along

racial  lines  and  we  know where the  problem  lies,  if  that

happens.   Because  if  you  have fight  between  two  gangs  of

different  races  that  will turn up its own  set  of  problems,

particularly in Singapore.  The difficulty with that is not only

the  fight  between the two gangs but the whole issue  of  youth

violence  will  be lost sight of in the larger  context  of  the

racial  dimension.  All sorts of anxiety will arise and  parents

who  ought  to  be  focusing on their wayward children  will  be

distracted by the racial element in the fight.  And therein lies

a major difficulty which, I think, we ought to address.  Because

the moment there is a racial element, the neighbourhoods that we

are  so accustomed to will no longer be safe because there  will

be distrust and suspicions will set in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we really need to do is to look towards the long term.

Today, it is a youth violence problem.  But the moment you  have

gangs of two different races taking each other on, there will be

complexities which we will have great difficulty handling.   The

way  the  Police will investigate the particular  incident  will

also  give rise to difficulties because there will be all  sorts

of  rumours about preference towards one particular gang because

of the affiliation to one race, etc.  This is a difficulty which

transcends  but  arises  from youth violence  and  I  think  the

Ministry ought to pay some attention to it.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, violence among

youths  is not a new thing.  In fact, in America, in the  1950s,

they  had  this  problem.  This problem is highlighted  in  such

films as "Rebel Without a Cause", starring the famous James Dean

and  another film called "Black Board Jungle", highlighted  this

problem  in that country.  Now, we are experiencing this problem

here in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been pointed out, the disturbing thing about this is

that  these boys and girls who are involved in these fights  are

not  true  gangster  elements and  are  not  members  of  secret

societies.   But many of them in fact come from good  homes.   I

know  of two teenagers, one a boy of 12 and the other a girl  of

16,  both come from good homes.  Yet they were arrested  by  the

Police  for  rioting.  The problem is with the  parents.   These

parents  are  both  working.  This is  perhaps  the  genesis  of

teenage delinquency.  Both parents are out of their home most of

the  time  and  they do not have time for their  children.   The

children are unsupervised and they get into bad company and also

into trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government can assist to alleviate this problem by

giving  assistance.   I can think of three areas  in  which  the

Government can assist.  Firstly, there must be more policing  in

the  likely  trouble  spots, such as  shopping  areas,  McDonald

restaurants,  entertainment places and  places  where  teenagers

also  tend to hang out.  I believe the police presence  is  very

important.  They represent the authority.  This will  deter  the

kids  from getting into fights.  These days, the Police  do  not

seem  to  be  around when they are most needed.   I  heard  this

mentioned at least more than once.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Police can deploy more of its uniformed

personnel  in places where youths congregate.  This will  surely

have  a  deterrent effect on the youngsters.   As  long  as  the

youths  are  made aware of the police presence,  they  shall  be

afraid  to  get  into  fights because they  know  they  will  be

arrested.  Police presence is definitely an important factor  in

helping to solve this problem.  The importance of Police

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>

presence  to  deter crimes among youths has been highlighted  by

Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung earlier on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area in which the Government can help is to

provide more amenities in housing estates.  The CCs have  to  be

spruced  up and made relevant to today's youngsters in order  to

attract them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Police should revive their Boys' Clubs. In

the  past, the Police did organise Boys' Clubs.  I do  not  know

what  has  happened  to them now.  They all seem  to  have  been

scrapped.  This idea of Boys' Club should be revived.  At  least

if  the boys go to these clubs, we know that they are supervised

and  not  get into bad company.  These are perhaps some  of  the

measures  that  Government  can  do  to  help  eradicate   youth

violence.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I thank the Members for

speaking.   First, Mr Chew Heng Ching's point about  whether  or

not  there  is  a  need for a task force.  He makes  this  as  a

suggestion.  I do not know whether he was in the House just  now

when  I  talked about the Inter-Ministry Committee  on  Juvenile

Delinquency,  which  I  chair, which draws  together  a  lot  of

agencies.  But I think the point he made is whether or not there

is  a need for a task force at the working level, chaired by the

PS,  and  drawing  in more Ministries focusing  specifically  on

youth  violence or youth fighting.  I think it is a matter  that

not  only  the Home Affairs can consider.  In fact,  IMJD  is  a

spring-off  from  the  IMC  Committee  under  the  Ministry   of

Community Development.  Many Members have brought up this  point

about the need to look deeper into the problem.  I am sure  when

Mr  Tarmugi takes the floor for his Ministry's cut, this  matter

will arise again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is Mr Davinder Singh's point which is a good

point.   Mr Davinder Singh's questions whether or not there  are

racial  overtones  to  teen  gangs and  whether  teen  gangs  of

different  races are fighting each other.  The total  number  of

rioting  cases  involving youths from different races  increased

from 11 in 1993 to 27 in 1996.  Despite this, it remains a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>

small  proportion of the total number of rioting cases involving

youths.   For example, the 27 cases in 1996 accounted  for  only

12%  of  all  cases last year.  But, nevertheless, I  think  the

point Mr Davinder has made is a point worth taking which I  will

ask  the Police to continue monitoring.  Also of course,  it  is

not  only a case of gangs of one race fighting gangs of  another

race.   Very  often, they are mixed and very often fights  arise

not  so  much  because  of  racial animosity  but  either  petty

quarrels or territorial disputes.  Those that sparked off fights

are  not racial in overtones.  That I think is heartening.   But

we must be vigilant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam talks about whether or not youth engaging in the

teen violence is a passing phase.  He talks about "Rebel Without

A  Cause" in America.  But the point is whether or not it  is  a

passing  phase.  Perhaps, it is with some youths.   But  if  the

numbers are large enough, I think we should take care.  But  his

other point is more interesting where he says we should saturate

the  ground, put more policemen all over the place, particularly

where  teens gather, like McDonalds.  Sir, if we did that,  then

what  he  claims is the situation where if you need  the  police

they are never around will indeed come true.  Because then,  you

are deploying all your forces all over the place.  It is like in

defence  of  a  locality.  You do not spread them all  over  the

place.   You target them in places of vulnerability and that  is

the  current approach.  I think the approach is right.   Because

like  Boat Quay, for example, if we identify it as a place where

increased police presence can meet a particular need, we will do

it.  But certainly not by putting them all over the place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the last point he made is why not have more Police

Boys'  Clubs  or revive them.  The Police Boys' Clubs  have  not

been  disbanded.  What has happened is that they are  now  under

the  People's  Association.  They have taken a larger  role  and

they  are called the Boys' Clubs.  So they have not disappeared.

But  under  this structure, where the CCs are involved,  through

the  PA, they will reach out to a larger group.  And indeed,  if

your suggestion is that the Boys' Clubs should

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>

also  play a role in creating more good gangs, then I think this

is a suggestion worth considering.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Cheng San):</b> Sir, can I seek a

quick  clarification from the Minister of State about teen gangs

and  racial  undertones?  Has he a breakdown for  the  different

racial groups and different teen gangs?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> I do not have the details with

me  right  now.   If  you want the details, you  can  put  in  a

Question for Oral Answer.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, I agree with the Minister of

State  he alone cannot form the task force.  But I hope that  he

will  influence  his  colleagues  in  the  other  Ministries  to

consider this.  With that, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

(1), Mr Chen.

<br>2.45 pm



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen (West Coast):</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head P of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the rising expectations of our people, the

medical  health expectations have also gone up.   And  with  the

medical  facilities now being upgraded, we are having  very  new

hospitals not only in the public sector but also in the  private

sector.   These  hospitals are equipped with more  sophisticated

diagnostic  equipment and other facilities.  The private  sector

has    also    followed   suit   with   new   medical   centres.

Generally,  patients  now demand a higher standard   of  medical

care.   I have heard of examples of children who suffer  from  a

mild  cold, for example, have been asked to be confined  to  the

hospital for two days for observation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has announced that it will increase the

intake of medical students to NUS, from 150 to 200 per year.  My

question  is:  with this demand of better medical care,  whether

this  is in fact sufficient to meet the needs of both the public

and private sectors?  One of the factors that will go for better

health  care  could  be more quality time spent  by  doctors  in

treating   the  patients.   It  is  not  just  the   number   of

consultations, but the duration of consultations.  And depending

on  the  complexity,  this duration can  vary  from  patient  to

patient,  and the lack of attention by consultants,  specialists

or   doctors  to  these  patients  will  be  interpreted  as   a

deterioration of medical service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of medical personnel in terms of better

health care is even more important.  I refer to the nurses.  The

nurses  are  the front line for both care during hospitalisation

and  the  post-illness recovery.  Although the number of  nurses

has  increased in the last 10 years, there is consistent  demand

for  more nurses.  And what we have seen in Singapore now is  an

increasing  number  of   nurses from foreign  countries.   These

nurses  come from different cultural backgrounds and  they  have

different  habits and different values.  The way they treat  our

patients is very different from those of Singaporean nurses, and

there  have  been  an  increasing number of complaints  in  both

Government  and private hospitals that these foreign nurses  are

not  well  equipped to handle some of our Singaporean  patients.

The  argument  is that because Singaporeans do not  want  to  be

nurses, therefore we have to resort to importing them from other

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this cannot be completely true because we find a lot of

Singaporean nurses working overseas.  In fact, quite a number of

them  work  in the Middle East and in other countries.   So  the

question arises as to whether, in fact, we are paying our nurses

competitive rates to entice them to stay and work in  Singapore.

We   cannot  equate  these  nurses'  remuneration  to  those  of

equivalent   qualification in other parts of the civil  service.

Because

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>

nursing is actually a vocation.  If you want tender loving care,

not  everybody has that, and money cannot buy that.  The  person

has  to feel that she can provide this kind of care.  And if she

can  get  a good reward in providing the care, I think she  will

stay in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister what are we doing for

these  very important categories of people, doctors and  nurses,

in  particular,  nurses.  I think many of our  troubles  in  the

medical service start with  nursing care.  The way that  we  can

improve  the nursing care will also go towards improving medical

health care.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on professional standards of doctors and nurses, this

again  relates to the same rising expectations of medical health

care  because the patients are now better off.  They are  paying

more  for  medical  service  and they  want  higher  quality  of

service,  especially  the quality time spent  on  each  patient.

This demand will continue to increase with better facilities and

higher medical charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a bit disturbed by recent cases of negligence in both

the  private and public sectors.  I understand, of course,  that

the  majority of doctors and nurses are providing good  service,

but  there  will  always be some who do not.  And  the  question

arises:  how do we police this and to make sure that  these  so-called black sheep are removed?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a profession like the doctors, we have the Singapore

Medical   Council   who  would  entertain  complaints,   address

complaints  to boards of inquiries, but invariably the  majority

of  these members are also doctors themselves.  This is not  new

in  the profession.  If you talk about the legal profession, the

same  thing applies.  Indeed, in any other profession, the peers

appear to have to judge their own members.  I think in order for

justice to be seen to be done visibly, we should allow for  more

open  inquiries, drawing more lay people in.  I understand  that

in the proposed Medical Registration (Amendment) Bill coming up,

this  will  be addressed.  But this is also part of the  way  of

improving  our medical and health care services, because  if  we

can minimize the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>

incidents  of  malpractice and negligence, then our Singaporeans

will  have  better  confidence in the  quality  of  the  medical

service provided by both our public and private sectors.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Goh, you can take your three topics

together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Choon Kang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Choon Kang (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, with your

permission,  I will speak on the first two topics, and  then  on

the third cut.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on fees and charges, I understand that the hospitals

are  required  to  recover replacement  cost  of  equipment  and

furniture.   I  do  not know whether they are also  required  to

recover part of the building cost as well.  I would like to  ask

the  Minister how does this requirement impact on the  fees  and

charges that the hospitals are collecting from the patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second topic, this year the total operating

subvention  to  restructured  hospitals  and  voluntary  welfare

organisations  (VWOs) is $586.87 million.  Out of  this  amount,

only   a  fraction  goes  to  aid  the  many  voluntary  welfare

organisations and the amount is $31.61 million.  The  Government

is  encouraging  more  VWOs to shoulder the responsibilities  of

looking  after the aged, the aged sick, the disabled,  even  the

dying,  through  the  setting  up of  nursing  homes,  community

hospitals, hospices and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the Government helps the VWOs to set up such an

institution  by supporting them 90% of their capital  cost,  but

only  50%  of  their  running cost.   As  such,  many  of  these

volunteers  in the VWOs, as some of my colleagues in this  House

have  already pointed out, have to run about raising  funds  all

the  time.  The running cost of a medium-sized nursing home, for

example, I was told with 150-200 beds, is more than $1 million a

year.   So with 50% Government grant, the volunteers will  still

have to raise more than half a million dollars a year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with the greying of our population and with more VWOs

expected  to  get involved in such voluntary work, fund  raising

will  become more and more taxing on the part of the volunteers.

So I would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>

think  that  the Government should seriously raise  the  funding

level, especially for the operating cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now speak on the third topic in Mandarin, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): Mr Chairman, in the past few years, the

Government  has  taken  a  series  of  measures  to   help   the

development  of  traditional Chinese medicine  in  Singapore.  I

think this is a move in the right direction.   We must gradually

help    Chinese   medicine   to  go  for   professionalism   and

standardisation,  thereby enhancing   the  standard  of  Chinese

medicine, and eventually eradicate the existence of bad  Chinese

physicians in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, Chinese medicine and Chinese physicians

provide  a very important service to the people.  Many  ordinary

people   are   using  such  services.   A   lot   of   voluntary

organisations   are  providing  free  medical   services   using

traditional  Chinese  medicine and methods  of  treatment.    So

standardisation  and  professionalism  in  this  area  is   very

important,  because it will eventually provide for  the  healthy

development of Chinese medicine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are endeavouring to develop Singapore into a

regional  medical  centre, we should not  confine  ourselves  to

Western medicine.  I believe that Chinese medicine can also play

a  role in this aspect.  I hope the Minister can enlighten us on

the  various  measures that have been taken over  the  past  few

years, and what is the  progress we have made so far.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I agree with Mr Goh

Choon  Kang  that many people who are concerned with traditional

Chinese  medicine are interested to know what  action  has  been

taken by the Ministry of Health to implement the recommendations

put  up by the special committee on traditional Chinese medicine

led  by Dr Aline Wong.   I am very interested to know what  kind

of  efforts  has  been  put in to promote  the  use  of  Chinese

Medicine.  We know that the Ang Mo Kio Acupuncture Centre at the

Ang Mo Kio Community Hospital has received overwhelming response

from the public.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>

Some  patients  have to be put on the waiting  list  for  months

before they could receive treatment there.  Will the Ministry of

Health  look into the possibility of working together  with  the

bodies  of  Chinese  physicians  to  set  up  a  second  Chinese

Traditional Medicine and Acupuncture Centre to meet the needs of

these patients?

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Previously, the Ministry of Health was planning to set up

a cancer research centre which was supposed to include the study

of  the  curative effects of traditional Chinese medicine.   Has

this  plan  been materialised?  I believe the implementation  of

this  plan  will  definitely help to promote the development  of

traditional Chinese medicine in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, with the birth of "Dolly" which was cloned from an

adult cell, this biotechnological breakthrough can be said to be

a  great  success  in the science of biological reproduction  of

lives.   It  is a real breakthrough.  Some people are  overjoyed

and  regarded   this as a new discovery in the  study  of  human

biology.   Yet  others  are worried.  The  parliaments  of  many

countries are now discussing this matter.  According to reports,

the UK Parliament has passed legislation to prohibit experiments

in  human  cloning. The USA Government has stopped  the  use  of

Commonwealth  Foundation  funds  to  assist  the  human  cloning

scientific   research   plans.   The  parliaments   of   various

countries,  including  Germany,  Italy,  Brazil  and  Argentina,

have  also  urged their governments to prohibit  experiments  on

human cloning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From public opinions and reactions from different quarters,

it is apparent that many people have much to worry over this new

scientific discovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, personally I am positive towards this particular

scientific research.  I feel that our Ministry of Health  should

not  prohibit  the experiments on human cloning.  We  could  set

some rules and regulations to provide for this type of research.

I am not a medical expert nor a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>

biologist.  But I would like to bring out an example to look  at

this   scientific  research  from  another  angle.   I   believe

Singaporeans  who  are at their 40s or 50s  should  be  able  to

recall  that  during the 60s and 70s,  the USA  and  the  former

Soviet  Union   were  competing  to  be  the  leader  in   space

technology. During that time the Soviet Union was the  first  to

land  an  unmanned spacecraft on the surface of the moon,  while

the  American astronaut Neil Armstrong was the first man to  set

foot on the moon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can remember that, at that time, people from all over the

world  were  praising them for their achievements.  But  at  the

same  time, some other people were worried that this might  lead

to  the  explosion of space war. At that time,  almost  all  the

newspapers  carried  comments  that  the  advancement  of  space

technology might bring disasters to mankind and the world  would

be  destroyed.  Some even thought that the world was ending very

soon.   At  that  time,  I  was still young.   I  harboured  the

impression  that  the development of space technology  was  very

frightening.  I thought that we were done for.   Yet  today,  it

is quite evident  that   the development of space technology not

only  does  not  bring  the world to an end,  but  has  actually

benefited  mankind.   It  has  provided  us  with   a   lot   of

convenience.   Our  mobile  handphone, fax  machines,  Internet,

satellite  television, unmanned spacecraft,  etc.  are  benefits

brought to us from space technology.  Recently, a USA spacecraft

has  successfully  landed  on Mars.  It  will  help  mankind  to

further  explore the mystery of life in outer space and  provide

very valuable information to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just imagine, years ago, advancement in space technology

had  brought about great fear to mankind.  This illustrates  the

point  that whenever there is a new invention we should view  it

in  a  positive manner and accept it rather than  reject or  ban

it.   Yes, unlike other kinds of technology, human cloning  will

no  doubt create complications in human ethics, moral and  legal

issues, family and social problems. This could be solved with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>

sensible  humane regulations, based not on court-room  decisions

but through  broad enlightened public debates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as in the prehistoric times human beings did not have

any  family,  moral  or  legal  concepts.   If  anthropologists,

sociologists,  philosophers and lawyers today  can  apply  their

intelligence  and  creativity like the  biologists  and  medical

experts  to  set up a standard for human ethics and moral  legal

issues, this will serve as a new challenge for them in finding a

solution to create a model or formula to accommodate a new  kind

of  family  and society formation.  Then like space  technology,

human  cloning  should  be  viewed positively.   I  think  human

cloning may be beneficial to mankind in future.  Of course,  any

kind of changes will meet with resistance.  This will require us

to  change our mindset. We have to be farsighted, courageous and

on top of it, we must have the scientific power of persuasion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the Ministry of Health has not stated its

stand on human cloning.  I hope that our Ministry of Health will

not  follow the countries in the world in forbidding the cloning

of  human  cells.  I think we should go for a set of  sound  and

rational rules and regulations to allow this research to go  on.

Researchers  and  experts  in  the  medical  field  from   other

countries  can be invited to come to Singapore to further  their

research in this field.  Of course, in regulating, we must  have

some  sound basis to provide for which categories of  people  to

participate  in  the  experiment,  for  example,  they  must  be

married,  above  a  certain age, or have  good  reasons   to  be

cloned,  etc.    I think these are points which we  can  further

discuss and study.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head P (cont.) -

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Sir, as Singapore

develops, the health services also develop.  As a result,  there

is   increasing  specialisation  within  the  medical  services.

Increasing  medical  specialisation  results  in  an   increased

availability  of treatment choices.  This will not only  improve

the quality of health care services that the average Singaporean

can get access to but it will also help Singapore develop into a

regional centre of medical excellence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, increasing medical specialisation, especially

within  our  restructured hospitals, has also resulted  in  some

undesirable trends.  In SGH alone, it seems as though  there  is

almost a separate department for every specialty available.  One

unintended  effect  of  this is the fragmentation  of  care,  as

patients   often   have  more  than  one  medical   pre-existing

condition.  For example, if a patient who has diabetes  mellitus

and  has  multiple  complications of diabetes  mellitus  and  is

admitted  to  SGH for chest infection, he will  pose  a  dilemma

because   he  not  only  has  chest  infection  but  has   other

complications of diabetes such as disease of the heart arteries,

eye  problems, kidney damage, nerve complications and  poor  leg

circulation.   If the patient is admitted to the department  for

respiratory diseases, it will not be unlikely that there will be

referrals  to  other  doctors  to  manage  his  problems.   Each

referral   to  another  department  will  result  in  additional

consultation costs.  Even though there may be a doctor,  who  is

overall  in  charge of the patient, more often, because  of  the

differentiation into specialised departments, it is likely  that

the  other  areas will be left to other specialists.  When  this

patient is discharged from the hospital, he will have to see the

eye  specialist at the National Eye Centre for his  eye  problem

and see the kidney specialist and the chest

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>

specialist  at  SGH.  He will also have to go  to  the  National

Heart  Centre to see the heart specialist.  If he is not already

on  follow-up in the SGH by the neurological department for  his

nerve  problems,  he  may  also have  to  make  a  trip  to  the

Neuroscience Centre at Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  As a  result  of

these multiple visits, the financial cost and time spent will be

substantial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not deny that there will be a need to have patients

to  be seen by medical specialists of different specialties, but

some  of  these problems are simple enough to be  managed  by  a

generalist.  Also, medical officers and house officers who  work

in  these  departments will also have a narrow exposure  to  the

disciplines  of  medicine  and have less  grounding  in  general

medicine.  This will also give them less working experience  and

exposure to the wide spectrum of medical problems.  It will also

increase  the  tendency to cross-refer as  doctors  become  very

focused within their own disciplines even at a very early stage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excessive referrals also put an increased strain on doctors

who already work extremely hard in the hospitals.  Precious time

is  taken out for tending to minor medical problems which can be

managed  by any other doctor.  Costs will also increase  because

by  having  more  departments, there will be more administrative

staff  required  and there will be more office  space  required.

The  Ministry  will have to balance the need for  specialisation

and  the need to optimise our resources.  The unintended  result

of   increase   in   health  care  cost   resulting   from   the

differentiation of the specialist departments must be studied.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no simple solutions but one suggestion that I

have  for the Ministry, which they may wish to consider, is that

they  may  want  to have a hospital handbook on "Common  Medical

Problems  in  the Hospital" for doctors in the hospitals,  which

will  lay down the investigations and the treatments for  common

medical problems seen in hospitals.  This will minimise the need

for unnecessary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>

referrals  for  simple  problems in the restructured  hospitals.

Such  a  medical  handbook on common medical conditions  in  the

hospital will also allow optimal cost-effective choices  in  the

investigations and treatments.  Addressing these  concerns  will

not  only  contain  the costs of health care but  it  will  also

increase  the  efficiency of our health service, both  from  the

provider's and the recipient's viewpoint.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Choo is not here. Dr Lim, would you like

to continue with your next topic?

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, health care services is an

important  area of concern for all Singaporeans.  As demand  for

health  care  services  increases in the  next  millennium,  the

Ministry  will  have  to  formulate  policies  to  maximise  the

potential  of our limited resources.  I would like to  know  how

the Ministry will meet some of these challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the national centres. The establishment of

national  centres for various medical specialties  will  improve

the  standards of care within these specialties.  Many of  these

national  centres  will  also  have  expensive  diagnostic   and

therapeutic  equipment.   How  does  the  Ministry   prevent   a

Government  or restructured hospital from duplicating  resources

and  equipment already available in the national centres  or  in

other  hospitals?  I am not only referring to MRI  machines  but

also  to  CT  scanners, ultra-sound machines, lasers  and  other

expensive  equipment.   Is  the mechanism  an  ad  hoc  informal

mechanism?   Or  is  there a structured formal  mechanism?   The

Ministry   must  define  the  role  of  national   centres   and

corresponding  disciplines  in the hospitals  clearly  to  avoid

straining  our  limited  medical resources,  especially  medical

manpower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my second point - medical manpower. It

was  not too long ago that the Ministry had said that the number

of  medical  students  would be restricted  and  the  number  of

overseas  universities, with recognisable basic medical degrees,

would  also  be  restricted.  Within the short space  of  a  few

years,  the  Ministry has now reversed its stand and  said  that

manpower needs are insufficient.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>

Certainly, it is not easy to make manpower projections  but  the

Ministry  has a long record of managing the manpower  needs  and

one  would expect their projections will not be too far off  the

mark.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern now is whether the current response to increase

the  medical student intake and to take in more foreign  doctors

will  result  in  excessive manpower in the  near  future.   The

Ministry  should explain to Members of the House and give  us  a

better  picture  of the rationale for such changes  in  manpower

projections.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, service conditions in hospitals. The terms of

service  and  remuneration  in the restructured  hospitals  keep

changing.   The  remuneration system has been modified  numerous

times  in  the last 10 years.  I am certain that the  Ministry's

intentions  for  these changes are good.  But  when  the  system

keeps changing very often, it affects the morale of doctors  and

they leave the service.  The severe shortage in medical manpower

is  felt  mainly  in the Government and restructured  hospitals.

Unless service conditions improve, this will continue to be  so,

no matter how many new doctors and foreign doctors are employed.

Service  conditions must be improved.  It goes beyond  financial

recognition.  Doctors want their work to be recognised,  whether

it is medical treatment administered or research papers.  Junior

doctors get demoralised when credits go to others for work  they

perform.   It is not pay alone but also the need to  be  treated

fairly,  to be heard and for efforts to be recognised.  Then  he

will  feel  that  his  contribution to the  health  services  is

appreciated.   A happy doctor is also likely to  remain  in  the

restructured hospital service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, leadership role of Ministry of Health. The

Minister  has said that SGH is a private entity and  it  is  not

part  of  the  civil service and in fact all the  administrative

decisions are taken by the management and board of directors  of

SGH.   If  this  similarly applies to all the other restructured

hospitals,  how does the Ministry maintain its supervisory  role

either  directly or through HCS?  If the Government is providing

significant development

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>

and   operating  expenditure  and  subventions  to  the  various

restructured  hospitals,  it would  be  inconceivable  that  the

Ministry  cannot  have a significant say in  the  management  of

these  hospitals.  If we want to prevent unnecessary competition

between  our  restructured hospitals, if we want to improve  the

morale  of  our  medical staff, if we want to pool  our  medical

resources together, if we want to contain costs, if we  want  to

provide  a  high quality health service, then the Ministry  must

take a strong leadership role.  The Ministry has to look for new

solutions  for these problems and help our health  service  meet

the needs of the next millennium.

<br>3.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Two days ago,

we  heard many stories about wool and sheep and how the shepherd

sheared  the wool from the fat sheep and gave them to  the  thin

sheep.  Now we go to another aspect of the story, to look at old

feeble  and  sick sheep which are unable to grow wool  and  they

need  covered pens to shelter them and shepherds to  look  after

them.   Sir, with the problem of the aging population  receiving

more and more attention, people are increasingly concerned about

the health care services for the aged, especially services which

are community-based.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April this year, the Ministry of Health announced the

setting  up of a department specialising in health care services

for the aged.  An inter-Ministry department will also be set  up

to  assist in formulating relevant policies and measures.   This

is  good  news.   It  shows that this issue has  been  receiving

priority  attention.  In less than 30 years' time, out of  every

four  people, one will be above the age of 65.  We will have  to

prepare  early for the situation.  I would like to suggest  that

we  should  strengthen health care services for  the  aged,  and

provide  them with other facilities on a community basis.   More

and  more  old people are staying alone at home.  More and  more

day-care  centres  are  set  up in  the  neighbourhoods  of  HDB

estates.   We  need to expand the role of Government polyclinics

so that they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>

will  be  able  to  provide services to the old  people  in  the

neighbourhood.   For example, the entrances  and  waiting  rooms

should be improved to give more convenience to the old people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Ministry of Health to also consider

introducing  mobile  clinics  which  could  visit  the   various

neighbourhoods  to provide medical services to the  old  people.

Home nursing service should also be improved and enhanced.  This

should  be  able to deal with the needs of the aging population.

In   addition,  we  should  also  ensure  that  we  have  enough

recreational  and  rehabilitation centres for  the  old  people.

Right  now, such centres are all run by voluntary organisations.

In  our  past,  we depended on social, community  and  religious

groups  to form aided schools to provide more school places  for

our  students,  and ensure that everybody gets a  place  in  the

school.   This  worked  very  well for  the  interim  until  the

Government was in a position to take over the administration  of

all  the schools in Singapore.  In the same way, I hope that the

Ministry  of Health can also work along the same line and  build

on the foundation of the existing private rehabilitation centres

to gradually develop more facilities for the old and poor people

among us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, what kind of assistance is the Government giving

to  the  voluntary organisations in running such centres?   Will

the  Government consider giving them more aid to  lighten  their

financial   burden,  for  example,  give  them  more   technical

assistance,  medical  supplies and other  materials  to  improve

their efficiency and effectiveness?

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Sir, regionalisation is the

latest  buzzword.  Singapore wants to be a regional medical  hub

and,  at  the  same time, we want to expand into the  region  as

industrial  parks and Singapore companies are set  up  overseas.

There  will  be  a need for Singapore health care facilities  to

expand overseas.  I want to ask the Minister what measures  have

been  taken by the Ministry in conjunction with other Ministries

to promote Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>

as a major regional hub and to attract supporting health related

industries into Singapore.  What is the role of the Ministry  or

the  Health  Corporation  of  Singapore  in  promoting  regional

medical  expansion?  What joint ventures have HCS  embarked  on?

And  what  support  or  incentive  measures  are  available   to

encourage  Singapore companies to set up health care  facilities

overseas?

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> Sir, the Addenda to the Ministry of

Health  in  the  President's  Speech  has  mentioned  about  the

development of Singapore into a medical hub.  I am not too  sure

whether  Dr  Michael Lim's idea of expanding medical service  in

the  region  comes within this definition.  I  will  only  speak

about developing Singapore as a medical hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of this development depends again, as I

mentioned earlier, on the kind of doctors we have available  and

the standard of care that we can provide.  Both are not easy  to

come  by.   But  as  distinct from other services,  the  medical

services aimed at developing our medical centre do not  seem  to

be  given much, if at all, any incentives.  For example, in  the

manufacturing and financial services, we have, according to  the

Minister  for Trade and Industry, a host of incentives that  are

too numerous to mention.  But I can think of none for the heatlh

services.   It  is understandable perhaps that in  the  case  of

health,  it  is  difficult to separate local as against  foreign

treatment.  But the same goes for manufacturing industries,  not

all  the products are consumed as exports, but some are consumed

locally.  So I would like to just ask the Ministry whether  they

are  working with the Ministry of Finance on possible incentives

to  help  our  doctors  to develop medical services  that  cater

mainly  for foreign patients.  Because these are brain services.

And  if  we are supposed to be good in brains, I think we should

also develop brains for our medical doctors and nurses.  And  if

we  can provide the incentives in various forms, which I am  not

quite  aware  of  at the moment, perhaps, we  can  realise  this

objective soon.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr David T. E. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David T. E. Lim:</b> Sir, I would just like to add on to

what  Dr  Michael Lim and Mr Bernard Chen had said  and  perhaps

also  raise  one  of  the concerns that  the  development  of  a

regional medical hub in Singapore may have.  Certainly, it  will

put  a  strain on our resources in terms of doctors, nurses  and

this  then  leads  to concern about whether there  will  be  any

adverse  impact  on  the  health care  for  Singapore  citizens,

whether  this  will  drive down standards or whether  this  will

drive  up  costs.  But having said that, there are a  number  of

reasons  why we should pursue this.  Certainly, it will help  us

take advantage of an area that we are very strong in, which  is,

as Mr Bernard Chen has said, in terms of the brain services.  We

are  already a regional leader in this area and if we do not  go

into this industry, then others in the region will.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, having a regional hub in Singapore will also help

to  raise the standard of medical care in Singapore and, in  the

long  term,  this will help to drive down costs rather  than  to

drive  them  up.   In so far as the costs for the  lower  income

people are concerned, this can be dealt with as we do so now, in

terms  of  administrative processes and in terms of making  sure

that subsidies are given to those who need them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, we have got to ask ourselves whether

or  not  we  want  to develop this industry and whether  we  are

driven  by  the vision of creating a new industry,  a  new  area

where  we  can  create for ourselves better jobs  and  earn  for

ourselves a better living.  And if so, then we should start  off

with the vision as the basis and work around the problems.   And

I  hope  the  Minister will then state what our policy  is  with

regard to the development of the idea of a regional medical  hub

in Singapore and also tell us about the latest plans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, there is still a group of poor

Singaporeans  who  despite  our health  subsidies  still  cannot

afford  their  hospital  bills.   Yet  others  worry  that   the

increasing health care costs will make basic medical care out of

their  reach.  The concern is specially true among  the  elderly

people.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Medifund is said to be the help of last resort so that

no  Singaporean  will  be denied access  to  basic  health  care

because  of  inability to pay.  As Medifund is still  relatively

new to Singaporeans, I would like to ask the Minister for Health

to  enlighten us on how Medifund is helping needy patients,  how

much we have spent and how many Singaporeans have benefited from

the  scheme.  How do we ensure that genuine hardship  cases  are

not  denied help and that the fund will not be abused  by  those

families who could actually afford to pay the hospital bills.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lew Syn Pau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lew Syn Pau (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, not too long

ago,  we  had  a  big debate in this House about  the  need  for

Government  to  control  the number of doctors.   This  is  done

through  both  the control and intake of medical  students  into

NUS, and a drastic cut in the number of overseas medical schools

which  are  recognised by the Singapore Medical Council.   About

two  months ago, I read in the Sunday Times that there is now  a

shortage  of doctors.  My question to the Minister is:  have  we

been  unnecessarily  stringent  in  controlling  the  number  of

doctors previously?  Should we not let market forces decide  the

number  of  doctors to be allowed into Singapore or to  have  in

Singapore instead of letting the Government control the numbers?

Would  the Singapore Medical Council now recognise more overseas

medical  schools than the current 28 for purposes  of  admitting

graduates  for registration as doctors?  For example,  why  does

the  Singapore Medical Council recognise more UK and  Australian

medical  schools than those from US and Canada?  I am told  that

out  of  125  accredited US medical schools, only about  10  are

recognised.  Would the Minister consider reviewing the  list  of

recognised overseas medical schools?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Sir, I am a medical

doctor.   It  has  been quite some time since the  restructuring

programme  of our Government hospitals.  Perhaps, it  is  timely

that this House be given an update of the hospitals.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim just now highlighted some problems faced by

patients with multi-disease illness.  Have services improved  in

terms   of  waiting  time  for  patients  to  see  doctors   for

consultation  and treatment modalities?  Have adequate  C  Class

beds  been set aside for those Singaporeans in the lower  income

bracket?    Is   affordability  to  stay  in  such  restructured

hospitals  a  serious issue?  And how does the establishment  of

these hospitals affect the Medisave accounts of Singaporeans  as

medical costs have gone up?  Do they have to contribute more  to

Medisave  in  future?  What control has the Ministry  of  Health

over such hospitals?  Again, Dr Michael Lim has highlighted some

of  these  issues in this particular field.  Is there a  careful

monitoring of the type of services being provided so that  there

is  no wastage of manpower and no duplication of equipment?   Is

there  evidence  that hospitals are over-servicing  patients  to

justify  the  purchase  of  expensive equipment  by  encouraging

patients  to use the equipment when the indications are  not  so

obvious,  like having a CT scan for any complaint  of  headache?

There  must  be  some performance indicators  to  monitor  these

hospitals.  What are these and how have these hospitals measured

up to these indicators?

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the teaching of medical students is not a money making

proposition.  In fact, it could be a chore for these  hospitals.

In   the   past,   where  bottom  line  is  not  the   important

consideration,  all Government hospitals took to  teaching  very

readily  and  eagerly,  but  now things  have  changed,  as  the

hospital culture has changed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are our restructured hospitals willing therefore to train

our  medical  students?   If  so,  do  they  have  a  structured

programme with NUH for such training?  Or are they doing  it  as

required  by  the  Ministry of Health,  as  they  are  receiving

subvention grants?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the future of the restructured hospitals? There

are now centres for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>

treatment  like  cardiac  centre for  treating  heart  patients,

paediatric centre at the Kandang Kerbau Hospital, skin  centres,

urology  centres,  etc.  When such centres are established,  the

restructured  hospitals must feel a little bit  uneasy  or  even

threatened, as these centres would draw patients away from those

restructured  hospitals with less than adequate  facilities  for

the particular modality of treatment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then restructured hospitals have to meet the bottom

line.  They must find ways and means to break even or even  make

a  profit.   This  being so, there is a likely possibility  that

these hospitals may set up subsidiary companies to start special

facilities  like  the gamma knife project, and  charge  patients

accordingly,  as  a  subsidiary company may not  be  obliged  to

follow the fee structure of the hospitals concerned.  This would

mean  that subsidised patients, C and B2 patients, may  need  to

pay  the  full fare for a service of this kind.  And  pensioners

may  not be allowed access to such facilities because it is  not

part of the hospital entitlement scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, as medical health care has become a lucrative

industry - a word which I really hate, we are not an industry  - is  the Ministry watching very carefully that such hospitals may

want  to  raise  funds by way of listing on our stock  exchange?

Precedent  has been set with the listing of a group  clinic  and

the control of practically all the private hospitals by a public

listed  company.  The major shareholders of these public  listed

companies are Malaysians.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This monopoly of control of our private hospitals is not

good for Singapore.  This means that they set the pricing of our

medical services for hospital care in the private sector, as the

monopoly rules out practically all competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must remember that 80% of our primary health care

is  in  the  hands  of  the private sector.   If  listed  public

companies run these set-ups, what will happen to the health care

delivery  system?   A  listed  company  has  to  answer  to  the

shareholders  first, and it is rubbish to say that  patients  do

come  first in such hospitals and clinics.  A listed company  is

not a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>

charitable  institution.   Medicine,  like  others,  is  not   a

commercial enterprise.  At the core of the practice of  medicine

is  humanity.   It  should  never be  viewed  in  the  strictest

commercial sense.  I am therefore pre-empting any possible  move

by  the Government to allow any restructured hospital to seek  a

listing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not a far-fetched idea. When you and I first

came  to this House, we  could not imagine that sacred cows like

PUB,  Telecom,  MRT  and  PSA could one day  be  privatised  and

eventually get listed, or already listed like Telecom.   As  the

Ministry  of  Health  gives  more  and  more  autonomy  to  such

hospitals,  as highlighted again by Dr Michael Lim,  they  could

eventually  decide to let such hospitals become  privatised  and

become  part  of  the  Government's stable of  Government-linked

companies.   This then would pave the way for seeking listing on

the  stock exchange, if not direct, indirectly by way  of  being

part of Government GLCs like Keppel, DBS Land, Sembawang and the

ST  group of companies.  Or the present GLC companies could  buy

up the privatised restructured hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Government, we must not abdicate our role of providing

health care to our people  We must not abdicate our role to  the

private   companies  or  even  to  our  own  GLCs.   It   is   a

responsibility  we should shoulder honourably.   Thus,  we  must

continue  to  pay  more  attention to the  remaining  Government

hospitals  like Alexandra Hospital and Woodbridge Hospital.   We

must  provide  more  funds  to  these  hospitals  to  help  such

hospitals   upgrade,  to  meet  the  needs  of  a  sophisticated

population.  We must prevent these hospitals from restructuring.

And  I  would  go  further and say that any new  hospital  built

should remain purely Government controlled and, in this way,  we

would give our people more choices of hospital care.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, many people are unhappy about our

A&E  service.  Some people came to me and complained  about  the

A&E service in Singapore, and many thought that it is in a state

of deterioration.  Many people told me that they had to wait for

many,  many  hours, as long as four hours, as  reported  in  the

press.  And there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>

are  problems  of  overcrowding, and it appears  to  be  getting

worse.   I  wonder whether these problems arise as a  result  of

shortage  of  doctors,  shortage of  nurses  and,  worse  still,

shortage  of senior doctors or consultants.  Because  I  do  not

think we should treat A&E departments as half-way houses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there have been newspaper reports indicating that

our A&E departments are not providing appropriate, efficient and

correct service.  I hope this is just an anomaly and not typical

of  our  A&E service.  There were also reports of the misuse  of

the A&E service by people who should really go to the Government

polyclinics or to the GPs for treatment for their minor or  non-emergency illnesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I was also told that the ambulances, when

responding  to calls and when they realise or they thought  that

it was not an acute case, they would rather return empty handed.

I  would  like to ask the Minister to respond to my queries,  my

concerns,   what  is  being  done  to  address  the   issue   of

overcrowding,  complaints  about the  inefficiency  of  our  A&E

service, about the ambulance service and the long waiting  time,

and how can we really ensure that A&E departments will be run in

the most appropriate manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to my next topic on tobacco licensing.

Despite  the  law  prohibiting the sale of  tobacco  to  minors,

cigarettes  are  still readily available  to  our  people.   The

continued  rise in smoking amongst Singaporeans, especially  the

Singapore youths, has caused much concern among parents,  school

principals, teachers and members of the public too.  Many people

have   called  for  stringent  policing  of  the  retailers   of

cigarettes.  They call for shopkeepers who flout the ban on  the

sale of cigarettes to minors to be identified and penalised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more effective control of smoking among youths, the

Ministry of Health should really license tobacco retailers.  The

Ministry should also consider restricting the number of licences

issued.   There  should be strict monitoring  of  compliance  by

retailers to ensure that they do not sell

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>

cigarettes  to minors.  If tobacco retailers are caught  selling

cigarettes to minors, their licence should be revoked.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, I would

like to thank the 19 speakers who have spoken so far.  I think I

have about 50 minutes to reply to them.  I will try to be brief.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, on medical manpower. This has been touched upon by

three  speakers, Mr Bernard Chen, Mr Lew Syn Pau and Dr  Michael

Lim.   They  have  asked  whether we are going  to  have  enough

medical  manpower to maintain the high standard of medical  care

in  Singapore,  and  asked what we are doing  to  alleviate  the

shortage in manpower that appears to be existing today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the issue of medical manpower is, of course, of great

interest  to many Singaporeans, because it impacts significantly

on  how  well we are going to deliver our medical services.   In

particular,  the  decision to increase  the  intake  of  medical

students  into  NUS, starting from this year, has also  enhanced

interest in this topic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first explain what is the doctor manpower situation

in  Singapore.  At the national level, 10 years ago, in 1987, we

had  a  total  of  2,940 doctors in Singapore.  Today,  we  have

4,660.   This is an increase of 59% over 10 years.   The  public

sector has benefited, because the medical manpower in the public

sector has increased from 1,420 in 1987 to 2,180 today.  This is

an increase of 53%.  It is significant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor to bed ratio in the public sector has also

improved very significantly.  We had one doctor to 5.7  beds  in

1987.   Today, we have 3.7 beds to one doctor.  So doctors  have

more time to look after patients as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the numbers have gone up, if the bed to doctor ratio has

improved,  why  then  is there a shortage  today?   Is  there  a

shortage  and,  if  so,  where?  Let  me  explain  the  manpower

situation  in  terms of both the short term and the  long  term.

The short term, ie, today, there is a shortage in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>

the  public  sector.  But the shortage is in two  very  specific

areas.   The  first  is  in the area of medical  officers.   The

second is in certain specialties.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of medical officers, maybe it is useful for me to

explain  what medical officers are, because other than  the  few

doctors here, most of the Members are not members of the medical

fraternity.  All doctors are required to serve a five-year  bond

with the Government after completing their housemanship and they

serve  these  five  years as medical officers.   The  number  of

medical officers required in the public sector is determined  by

the requests submitted by the hospitals, ie, the Ministry relies

on  hospitals to tell us what they require, then we will recruit

and make available the number that they want.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have about 880 medical officers today. Up to 1994, the

public  sector actually had a surplus of medical officers.    In

fact,  from  1992  to  1994, the hospitals had  to  offer  early

release from the bonds to some of the medical officers who  were

serving  then  because they had too many.  But since  1995,  the

hospitals have started to encounter shortage and today we have a

shortage  of  about  90  medical  officers.   With  880  medical

officers and a shortage of 90 medical officers it means we  have

a shortfall of about 10%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did the shortage appear and what are we doing to

alleviate the shortage?  Firstly, the number of resignations has

gone  up.  Secondly, the hospitals have steadily increased their

demand  for medical officers for two reasons. Firstly,  improved

working conditions, as what Dr Michael Lim has been asking  for.

Secondly,   expansion   of  some  services.    Thirdly,   higher

expectations of patients.  Dr Tan Cheng Bock mentioned that just

now.   Yes,  patients  now are more educated and  knowledgeable.

They  want  to  be  told what is their medical condition.   They

require  doctors  to  spend more time  explaining  to  them  and

communicating   with  them.  That, of  course,  translates  into

demand  for more doctors.  This applies to both medical officers

and especially specialists.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are some of the measures that we have taken to relieve

the medical officer shortage?  The Ministry of Health relied  on

a  survey  taken by the Singapore Medical Association  (SMA)  in

1996  among  medical officers who had joined the private  sector

between May 1995 and May 1996.  The SMA's findings were,  first,

the  key  reason  is that the differential in  income  from  the

private  sector  is significant. The medical  officers  can  get

between  40-50% more in the private sector.  Secondly,  lack  of

career  opportunities.  Thirdly, frequent night duties.  Medical

officers  have to work at night. What happens is that they  will

work  the  normal day.  If they are on night duty, they continue

throughout  the whole night till the next morning, and  they  go

back  to  the  normal day shift.  This means that they  actually

work about 33 to 36 hours.  This practice, I understand, is very

common.   Dr   Tan Cheng Bock, I am sure, went through  many  of

that.   The  same  with Dr Michael Lim.  We  have  adopted  this

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, in the past medical officers were required to work

anything  from eight to more than ten sessions a  month.   Quite

often,  I  was  told  by the older doctors,  they  worked  every

alternate  day,  ie,  finish the work today,  work  through  the

night,  do a full-day's work the next day, finish work  at  5.00

pm,  go home, come back the next day and repeat this cycle.   It

is  very tiring.  I feel it is not very fair to the patients  as

well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arising from the review in October 1996, the Ministry

revised  the scheme of service for medical officers.  First,  we

provided for better and faster career progression.  In the past,

for  the full five years, the medical officers were not eligible

for  any promotion.  They came in on one grade, stayed there for

the  full  five years, and it is no wonder that they  complained

about lack of career opportunities.  We have now introduced  two

promotional  steps into the system.  All medical officers  would

be  entitled  to  one  promotion and the better  ones  would  be

eligible  for a second promotion during these five  years  .  We

also increased the allowance for night calls.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.20 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the doctors received $40 per night call for

the  first four duties and then $100 per night duty after  that.

We  increased the allowance very significantly to between  $110-$130 per night call.  This is quite a significant increase.   As

a  result, a medical officer today, with five years of  service,

will be able to earn at least $75,000 a year compared to $60,000

a year previously.  This is a 25% increase in salaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also reduced the number of night calls to a maximum

of  six to seven a month.  So the change is for the better,  but

this  also  translates  into  a  significant  increase  in   our

requirement  for  medical officers.  Overall, the  changes  have

been  for  the better. The scheme of service is now a  lot  more

attractive and we are optimistic that it should help reduce  the

resignation rate in the next couple of years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also taken an additional approach of going abroad

to  recruit.   As  Members know, we have many  medical  students

studying abroad.  Our estimate is that over the next five  years

we  will have about 240 students graduating abroad and we  would

like  them  to come back.  Late last year, the Ministry  sent  a

career counselling and recruitment team to Australia and UK  and

they  managed  to recruit 46 housemen and medical  officers  for

this  year.   So  this will help boost up our medical  officers'

strength.  What was also encouraging is that the students, after

attending the talks, felt encouraged and many of them said  that

they  would definitely be coming back to  Singapore to  practise

after their graduation.  For the coming years, we should be able

to rectify the situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the second area, the specialists? The

perception  has been that  the resignation rate of  specialists,

which  means  Registrars and above, is extremely high  from  the

restructured hospitals.  This perception is true for  1995.   We

had a total of 78 specialists who resigned from the restructured

hospitals.   This  represents about 8%  of  the  total  pool  of

specialists

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>

that  we have.  I asked whether there was any significant factor

that  led to this resignation.  My staff tells me that  in  1995

Gleneagles Hospital made available new clinic space and that led

to  the departure of many of the specialists.  In 1994 and 1996,

the  resignation rates were more manageable, about 5%,  compared

to the training rate of 7-8% of each cohort.  I think there is a

balance.   For  this year up to July, the resignation  rate  has

been  2�%,  which is again lower than the comparable  period  in

1996.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a good match between the resignations and the

supply in most specialties in the public sector. This is because

we   have   a  fairly  well-managed  and  well-planned  training

pipeline.   But  shortages do occur from time  to  time  when  a

particular  specialist area experiences more resignations.   The

areas  now  that  are  facing a shortage  would  be  anesthesia,

radiology and medical oncology.  Because it takes more than  six

years  to  train  a specialist, the solution to  these  periodic

shortages  in specific areas is really to go abroad and  recruit

qualified  specialists. This is an option that the  restructured

hospitals are now actively exploring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we need to improve our internal system too. As Dr

Michael  Lim  has  said, we have to look at  the  conditions  of

service  and  make  them more attractive.  My  Ministry  is  now

working  with HCS and the hospitals to do this.  We are  looking

at  a  few things.  Dr Michael Lim mentioned about teaching  and

medical research.  Yes, we recognise it.  Together with clinical

practice,  these  are  the  three key pillars  of  institutional

practice.  We  must recognise the efforts of  doctors  put  into

teaching  and research, and recognise them in both monetary  and

non-monetary  ways.  So overall, we must make the public  sector

more  attractive. But while we recognise that the public  sector

pay  can  never  match  the income in the  private  sector,  our

salaries should nonetheless be competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the long term manpower situation? Mr Lew Syn

Pau has asked about that. So have Dr Michael Lim and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>

Mr   Bernard   Chen.   Let  me  give  Members  some   background

information.  In 1991, the Health Review Committee  on  National

Health Policies recommended that, first, Singapore should attain

a  doctor  population ratio of 1:650 by the  year  2000.   As  a

comparison, the doctor to population ratio of the United Kingdom

in 1993 was 1:650.  So that places us fairly close to the United

Kingdom  with  a  few years' time lag, which is  not  bad.   The

Committee also realised that we need to control doctor  manpower

because the experience of all the developed countries has  shown

that an excessive supply of doctors only leads to escalation  of

health  care  expenditures.  So it is a lesson  that  we  should

learn well and adopt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Projecting from the 1980 census, based on the Health Review

Committee's recommendation, we would have about 6,400 doctors in

the year 2010, compared to about 4,700 this year.   That will be

an  increase of about 1,700 over the next 13 years.  In order to

meet  this projected manpower, the NUS intake was maintained  at

150  and  the  Singapore Medical Council reviewed  the  list  of

recognised  foreign  universities and reduced  the  list  to  28

schools in the expectation that they would take in a total of no

more  than  40 Singapore students. So 150 Singapore students  in

NUS  plus  40  from abroad would then leave us  with  more  than

enough  to achieve the desired doctor strength of 6,400  by  the

year 2010.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this year my Ministry reviewed the doctor

projections again, because several factors have changed.  Unlike

what  Dr  Michael Lim has said that it was just  a  short  three

years  ago, those projections were actually done about 7-8 years

ago.   First,  the 1990 census revealed that our population  was

larger than projected from the 1980 census.  That means the base

we  are  using to calculate the doctor population based on  that

ratio  was  out by a bit.  Secondly, the Government's effort  to

attract overseas talents will speed up population growth and the

revised higher projected population in the year 2010 would  mean

that  the  projected number of elderly sick in the future  years

would  also  increase.   The third factor was  regional  demand.

Because regional economic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>

growth is expected to remain strong in the coming years, we have

also  revised upwards the projected regional demand for  medical

services.  This is in line with what Mr Bernard Chen, David  Lim

and  the rest have talked about in terms of the regional medical

centre and medical hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Factoring all these changes, MOH revised the desired doctor

population in the year 2010 from 6,400 to 7,100, ie,  all  these

have  led  to an increase in the projected demand of  about  700

doctors. To achieve this figure, we therefore work with  NUS  to

increase the intake this year to 180 and to increase the  intake

to 200 for next year.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about the list of recognised medical schools? Our

study  shows  that in 1996, just from 11 medical schools,  there

are two Australian and nine medical schools under the University

of  London.   These  11  schools  alone  took  in  42  Singapore

students, compared to our projected figure of 40 for the  entire

28 schools.  We understand that a few Singapore students applied

for  the  remaining  17  medical  schools  in  the  US,  UK  and

Australia.   But  this  may change in the coming  years  as  the

parents in Singapore realise that there are other schools  where

the  intake has been very low that they will get a better chance

to be admitted to those schools.  I think more Singapore parents

would then encourage their children to enrol there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will therefore continue to monitor and review

the situation over the next few years before deciding on whether

or not to increase the list.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will say that overall, our medical manpower in the

public  sector is manageable, although tight in some areas.   We

have  steadily increased the staff strength over the  years  and

will  continue to do so, especially now that the medical student

intake has been increased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about nursing manpower, which Mr Bernard Chen asked

about?   Here the situation is more acute.  We have a  shortage,

and  the  shortage is more significant.  There are  today  about

9,000 nurses in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>

both the public and private sectors.  And the estimated shortage

is  about  2,200  nurses,  ie,  a 20%  shortfall  from  what  is

required.   The demand for nurses will definitely increase  with

an  aging  population and the expansion of the medical services.

We  must  therefore find more creative and innovative approaches

to solve this problem in the next few years.  The problem is how

to  attract  young school leavers to go into nursing, especially

when  there  are  so  many  other  competing  careers  that  are

available, and that is only for the intake level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, how do we retain the trained nurses in the public

sector?   I know Mr Bernard Chen mentioned about nurses  working

in  the  Middle East.  Yes, we know there are some.  But in  the

context  of  the  9,000 nurses that we have, the  proportion  of

nurses  working abroad is actually quite small.  It does add  to

the shortage.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of recruitment, we reached a peak of about 751

student  nurses  in  1989 and we were able to  reach  that  peak

because of the recession in the mid-eighties.  Suddenly,  a  lot

of  school  leavers felt that it was worth the while going  into

nursing.   But  immediately after the recessionary effects  wore

off,  the following year 1990/1991, the intake dropped  by  more

than half, an average of 330.  751 in one year, next year it was

330.   Our  target  was  900  -  a tremendous  shortfall.   But,

fortunately, we have already recognised that it was going to  be

more  difficult  attracting students and we had to  increasingly

make the nursing profession more attractive and competitive.  As

a  result, we were able to persuade the Ministry of Education to

start  a  Nursing  Diploma course in one  of  the  polytechnics.

Prior  to  that, nursing was only a certificate  course  in  the

School of Nursing.  So this represents tremendous enhancement of

the  professional  status.  The Nanyang  Polytechnic  started  a

course  in 1992 and I am happy to report that this has  resulted

in  the  increase in the number of applicants.  Last  year,  the

Diploma  course managed to attract 590 applicants,  Singaporeans

and  non-Singaporeans, compared to about 250  when  we  had  the

School of Nursing course.  So it has proven to be attractive.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are strengthening our efforts to also recruit foreign

nursing  students,  which is a better approach  than  trying  to

recruit  trained nurses.  Because if the students come here  and

study  in the polytechnic, after three years, I think they  will

have   become  more  acclimatised  to  the  local  demands   and

practices.   But, nonetheless, I think we should  not  rule  out

recruitment  of  trained  nurses  from  abroad.   With  such   a

significant shortage, even if they are not fully acquainted with

our  system,  I  think  they can still contribute.   So  let  us

appreciate  them for their contributions that they  are  making.

At  the same time, my Ministry will be looking into how to  make

the  nursing  career even more attractive and  challenging.   We

will  be  carrying out a comprehensive review of the service  in

the next few months and we hope that arising from this study, we

will be able to once again further improve on the attractiveness

of the profession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the next cut which is from Mr

Bernard  Chen  on the professional standard of doctors.   He  is

worried that the recent publicity of complaints to the SMC  (the

Singapore Medical Council) may indicate that things are not  all

that  well in the medical profession, even though generally  the

standard of the medical profession in Singapore is very high.  I

think  the  point is correct that the standard of the profession

in Singapore is high.  Every year, the Singapore Medical Council

receives  between 40 and 60 complaints.  I think  the  range  is

reasonable and the numbers are not too bad, considering that  we

have  about  4,700  doctors in Singapore.  In every  profession,

there will be a few black sheep.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have been focusing on ensuring that our doctors are

competent  and  capable.  However, it is equally  important  for

doctors  to maintain and uphold professional conduct  to  ensure

that  patients  are  given the appropriate care  and  treatment.

Consequently, the teaching of medical ethics forms an  important

part  of  the medical curriculum.  In recent years, the SMC  has

also  introduced a physician's pledge to increase the  awareness

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>

commitment  of  doctors  to  the  vocation.   We  will  also  be

introducing   lay   representation  in  the   disciplinary   and

complaints  committees, as mentioned by Mr Chen.  He  has  asked

what else can we do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MOH also carries out medical audits on various

procedures  and treatments to identify areas which  need  to  be

improved  or  to  deter  poor  medical  practice.   This  is  an

important element and we are in the process of strengthening our

audit  capabilities.  With all these, I think we should be  able

to  maintain the professionalism in the profession, despite  the

many competing demands on the time of the doctors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me move on to the next cut which is by Mr Goh

Choon  Kang on the impact of the cost of furniture and equipment

on  patients.  It is prudent and sound to take into account  all

operating  costs of providing a service.  This way we will  know

what  the true costs are, which are the areas which are  out  of

line,  which  are major cost elements and how do we bring  about

productivity improvements and cost savings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The costs of furniture and equipment (F&E) are part of the

hospital's  operating cost, just are the salaries of nurses  and

doctors.  In the case of furniture and equipment, they  make  up

5%  of total recurrent cost.  But while we account fully for the

F&E  cost,  most  patients do not bear the full  amount  of  the

cost.   This  is  because patients in B1 get a subsidy  of  20%.

Those  in  B2  get  65% subsidy and those in  class  C  get  80%

subsidy.   That means the Government bears 80% of the  costs  of

the  furniture and equipment for the class C patients.  So  much

of  what  Mr  Goh  is  asking for, I  think,  is  already  being

provided by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim talked about medical specialisation, that

increasing  specialisation may actually lead to  increased  cost

and  he  also commented about the practice conventions  in  SGH.

Sir,  as  medical  science and technology  continue  to  develop

rapidly, I think it is inevitable for doctors to specialise  and

sub-specialise  even more.  I think Dr Michael  Lim  will  fully

appreciate that, being a specialist himself.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: how do we ensure that patients get the

best   care  possible  at  the  best  value?   He  is   correct.

Specialist services, if used indiscriminately, will lead  to  an

increase  in health care cost.  So how do you balance  the  two?

Sir,  rather than just focus on SGH, I think the problem is  not

just  SGH's  alone,  the problem exists in  all  the  hospitals,

whether they are private or public.  In fact, I have heard  many

horror stories of patients going to the private sector who  were

given   a  go-around  and  ended  up,  instead  of  seeing   one

specialist, seeing four or five specialists.  So the problem  is

equally  prevalent in the private sector.  And it  is  not  just

restricted  to  the  specialist area.  It also  applies  to  the

whole medical service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is well recognised that a person with a medical

condition should first consult a generalist doctor, rather  than

self-referring to a specialist.  Especially if he  has  multiple

medical conditions, the generalist doctor would then be  in  the

best  position  to decide whether that patient needs  to  see  a

specialist  and,  if so, which specialist.   In  some  developed

countries,  their  health insurance systems and  their  national

health   plans  require  patients  to  first  consult  a  family

practitioner or GP.  In Singapore we do not do this, we  do  not

regulate  this,  and  many patients self-refer  to  specialists.

This,  of  course,  then  makes  it  more  expensive  for   him,

especially  when the GP could have looked after him  and  solved

his medical problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the hospital level similarly, the general physician

should   be   in  charge  of  patients  with  multiple   medical

conditions.   And this would mean that even if the  patient  had

self-referred  or had been referred to a specialist  or  a  sub-specialist,  and the sub-specialist found that he  had  multiple

problems, the sub-specialist should actually make it a point  to

refer  him  to a general physician in the hospital, rather  than

to send him to a whole series of specialists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng</b> rose ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Because of the time element, please let

me  finish the reply first.  If there is more time, he can  then

take up his points.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise the weakness in the system and we are now

working with the University, the various medical bodies and  the

hospitals  to  encourage this practice to be followed.   We  are

also  looking  into  training more general  physicians  so  that

there   will  be  adequate  general  physicians  to  look  after

patients with multiple medical conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the challenge is therefore a real one and we will need

the  cooperation and understanding of both patients and doctors,

and doctors in both the private and public sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the regional medical hub which three

Members  have  spoken on.  I will go through very quickly,  Sir.

Yes,  our  medical standards in Singapore are  very  high.   And

over  the years, because of this high standard, we have  evolved

into  a  regional  medical centre.  Doctors in the  region  feel

comfortable referring their patients here and even patients  are

self-referring  themselves  to specialists  here  by  consulting

specialists  whom  they hear about through word  of  mouth  from

friends  and relatives.  So the question is: what are  we  doing

to further strengthen our position?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst we are today a regional centre, we cannot

afford  to  be  complacent,  as  Mr  David  Lim  has  mentioned.

Countries  in  the  region  are also  developing  their  medical

expertise.  In the Ministry's view, to maintain our position  as

a  regional  medical centre, we have to ensure that our  medical

software  remains  a few steps ahead of others.   Why  software?

This is because with adequate finances, anyone can build a model

hospital, and the technology and equipment can also be  just  as

easily  purchased.  But to be a medical centre of high standards

and  standing, the skills, the expertise of the doctors, nurses,

scientists,  technologists, therapists, managers  must  be  top-notch.   And  not  only  that, they must be  able  to  tie  them

altogether into an efficient system.  This we have.  We are also

taking  steps  to position ourselves for the next phase  of  our

medical  development.   This involves the  development  of  five

national medical centres.  The National Skin and Eye Centres are

ready.  We are now in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>

process  of building the National Heart and Cancer Centres,  and

the  Neuroscience Institute.  These centres will  spearhead  the

development  of  clinical service, teaching and  research.   The

concept  is  that the more complex or rarer cases requiring  the

expensive  equipment or highly specialised expertise  or  multi-disciplinary  treatment will be centralised  at  these  national

centres.   The national centres will also be open to specialists

in  other  Government hospitals as well as those in the  private

sector.   So  there  is  no  need for any  of  the  restructured

hospitals to be worried because they will all be part and parcel

of this development programme.

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are also looking into the development of a medical

services  park in the grounds of the Singapore General Hospital.

The  aim  is  to  attract entities in a comprehensive  range  of

health   care  and  other  supporting  activities  to  co-locate

themselves in this park.  This way there will be synergy derived

from   the   resultant  wide  spectrum  of  medical  facilities,

expertise  and  activities.  This will,  as  Mr  David  Lim  has

mentioned,  definitely help to raise our standards  and  improve

our  competitiveness in the health sector.   The  benefits  will

accrue to Singapore patients and of course regional patients can

also  take  advantage  of  the  services  there,  if  they   are

interested.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Michael Lim also asked what is the role of MOH in

helping  the  private sector expand overseas.  Sir, MOH  focuses

mainly on looking after the health care needs of Singaporeans in

Singapore.   The  Economic Development Board is  the  Government

agency  that helps to facilitate the regionalisation efforts  of

our private sector, including the health care sector.  This will

include investments in regional health care projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Bernard Chen asked what incentives we are giving to help

the  private  medical sector further develop.  Sir, the  private

sector has grown very very strongly throughout the years without

any Govern

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>

ment  assistance or incentives.  I think they have been  growing

fast enough and we should not over accelerate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan Cheng Bock asked for an update on the restructured

programme.  Sir, he raised so many questions that I lost  count.

I  stopped  at  20, and to reply to him, I think I need  another

hour.   I  do not have that time.  So I would just very  quickly

summarise  our experience.  Basically, when we restructured  the

hospitals,  we have four key objectives, ie, to enable  them  to

improve    efficiency   and   standard   of   service,   improve

productivity, control hospital costs and allow them  to  develop

and respond quickly to changes in the marketplace and to patient

needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to say that in all these four areas, the

restructured hospitals have done well.  They have been  able  to

increase   the   throughput  significantly  without   having   a

proportionate increase in their manpower. Let me give  you  some

figures.  For specialist outpatient attendances between 1988 and

1996,  the  workload increased by 65%.  In terms of day  surgery

procedures,  during those eight years, they increased  by  145%.

The  survey  of  patients' responses  showed  that  85%  of  the

patients rated the services provided by the hospitals as  either

good  or  excellent.  This is an improvement from  the  previous

figures.  Another area which is very evident is the missing case

notes.   I  think  Dr Tan and Dr Michael Lim would  be  familiar

that,  in the past, at the Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOCs),

it  was  not  unusual for patients who turned up and found  that

their case notes were missing.  In fact, in 1986, between 3% and

17%  of  patients ended up with missing case notes.   It  was  a

terrible  position.  Today, the numbers in each of the hospitals

total  less than 10 cases a month. Compared to the huge patient-load,  this  works  out to about 0.01%.  So it  shows  that  the

hospitals  have managed to get their act together,  improve  the

system and make sure that patients' needs are well looked after.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about coordinating the purchase of expensive

equipment  in public hospitals.  At MOH level, we do monitor  to

make sure that the equipment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>

purchased are not unnecessarily duplicated, leading to  wastage.

But  basically,  the decision to purchase a piece  of  equipment

lies  with  the Board of each hospital and they will  make  sure

that  there  is a real need for the equipment because  it  costs

money.  Secondly, they cannot get a replacement service from any

other  hospital.   I  think the situation  is  very  much  under

control.   On  the development of sub-specialties,  yes,  we  do

coordinate that from the HQ level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Tan spoke for a long time on the listing of hospitals on

the  stock market. Government has no plans at the moment  to  do

any   of   that.    The  restructured  hospitals   will   remain

restructured.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now go quickly to the question of A&E which Mr

Choo  Wee Khiang also spoke quite extensively on.  Sir, I  share

his sentiments.  I too am not very happy with the problems being

encountered in A&E.  And if you look at the situation,  it  will

explain  why.  Between 1992 and 1994, A&E attendances went  down

slightly.  This is because, in 1992, we embarked on an intensive

education  programme on the proper use of A&E.  So  Singaporeans

were  more aware.  They realised what is the true role  of  A&E.

In  1993, we also did something which I think contributed to the

decline.   We  increased the fees quite significantly  and  made

sure  that A&E fees were much higher than the GP fees.  So there

was a cost of going to A&E instead of going to the GP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last two years, 1995-1996, A&E attendances went

up very significantly.  They went up by over 10% a year and this

has led to a tremendous strain on the facilities.  The hospitals

have added more staff.  In fact, the hospitals have, in the last

two  years,  added 22 more doctors, which is equivalent  to  25%

increase in the doctor staffing and they added 15% more  nurses.

But,  unfortunately, each time, they improved  the  service,  it

only led to an increase in demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review showed that a significant number of A&E patients

actually  had relatively minor illness, such as fever, low-grade

fever, cough and cold, diarrhoea and superficial cuts.  What  is

also telling

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>

is that 60% of all A&E attendances are between the hours of 9.00

am and 9.00 pm when GPs are available and, during the day hours,

polyclinics  are  available too, and many of these  cases  could

actually be seen by GPs and polyclinics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to discourage this tendency of many

Singaporeans using the A&E because we have finite A&E  resources

and  A&E  clinics are meant to take care of serious  conditions.

By  clogging up A&E clinics with non-emergency cases, those non-emergency  patients are actually endangering the  lives  of  the

true emergency cases because doctors, being over-worked, may not

be  able  to give enough time and care to those who are  genuine

emergency cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have asked the hospitals to review how A&E services can

be  more  appropriately managed.  We need  to  discourage  those

patients who can be seen by GPs and polyclinics from making  use

of  our  A&E facilities.  The review will include reviewing  how

the  existing A&E fees could be revised in such a way as not  to

unduly  penalise the genuine cases.  I expect the  hospitals  to

come out with a package within the next two months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On tobacco licensing, Mr Choo Wee Khiang is absolutely

correct.   The smoking rate among our youths is bad.  They  have

gone up very significantly in the last 10-odd years.  We have  a

ban  on smoking and the sale of cigarettes to our youths.   But,

unfortunately, it is difficult to detect shops that are selling.

The  Committee on Smoking Control has also recommended that  MOH

license  tobacco retailers and we have decided to do  that.   We

expect  to  implement this in June 1998 and are now working  out

the details.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will ask my Senior Minister of State to reply to the

other questions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wong, you have got four minutes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline K. Wong (Senior Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Health (Dr Aline K. Wong):</b> Sir, since I do not have much time, I would just concentrate on

several things that I would like to clarify for Members  of  the

House who spoke on the remaining subjects.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Yeo Guat Kwang and Mr Goh Choon Kang expressed

concern  about  the level of funding that we give  to  the  VWOs

which are doing very important work in providing community-based

health  services, especially to our elderly.  I like to  clarify

that  the  50:50  funding formula for the recurrent  expenditure

actually  applies  to  all  VWOs, whether  they  provide  social

services under the Ministry of Community Development or  health-related services under the Ministry of Health.  Both Mr Goh  and

Mr Yeo are correct in saying that Government provides 90% of the

capital expenditure.  But I would like to point out that,  apart

from  these two levels of funding, the Government helps the VWOs

in  many  other ways.  For example, we facilitate the allocation

of State land and premises and we fund up to 90% of the cyclical

maintenance cost for existing buildings.  We also provide up  to

100%  of  rental subsidy for the use of Government buildings  or

State land and we provide 100% rebate, for input GST.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On top of that, we second doctors and nurses to work in

some VWO facilities, and we facilitate the allocation of foreign

workers'  permits.  The foreign workers levy is actually  waived

for  the  VWOs.   Even the COEs for vehicles used  in  providing

services by these VWOs are exempted.  So these are various  ways

in  which we help them.  For the financial year 1997, our budget

for  the VWOs has actually doubled, twice what we provided  last

year.   We projected for the next two years that there would  be

an  increase  of  $4  million every year in terms  of  recurrent

expenditure subsidies alone.  I do understand that the VWOs  are

finding  it  quite  strenuous  to raise  funds  while  providing

services.  The funding formula is one of the areas that will  be

very carefully looked into by the Inter-Ministerial Committee on

Health  Care  for  the Elderly which would  be  chaired  by  the

Minister for Health himself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have time to update both Mr Peh Chin Hua and Mr

Goh Choon Kang

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>

on  the state of TCM and what we have done so far.  I hope  they

will understand.  We will find another occasion to inform them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I cannot let pass Mr Peh Chin Hua's very interesting

speech  on human cloning, so allow me two minutes to respond  to

that.   I must say that I am a little bit surprised at the range

of  interest  that Mr Peh has, and the recurrent  image  of  the

sheep  in  this year's debate.  Cloning means the production  of

genetically  identical  replicas which, in  the  broader  sense,

includes  the replication of DNA, cells, embryos and  the  whole

organism.  I would like to inform Mr Peh from the very beginning

that  there are different levels of cloning.  I understand  that

scientific  breakthroughs occur from time to time and  this  may

represent spurts of human creativity.  Some of these discoveries

can  do  good. But some of them could be harmful and,  in  fact,

involve  very difficult ethical dilemmas.  We agree  that  there

should  not  be a total ban on cloning research,  as  there  are

certain areas which could have beneficial results.  In fact,  we

have  supported research involving the replication  of  DNA  and

cells  of  both animal and human origin, which are  now  routine

research  techniques  in  molecular  and  cell  biology.    Such

research,  as  I said, could have potential beneficial  results,

such as in the treatment of certain diseases like cancer or  the

generation of organs for transplantation.

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my Ministry is of the view that the production of

identical copies of existing human beings is unacceptable.   The

reasons  for  this stand are many, and these reasons  have  been

debated  by  the international community as well as by  our  own

national  Medical Ethics Committee.  The reasons include:  there

would  be  an imposition of biological characteristics on  human

individuals  by  third parties.  Human beings  may  one  day  be

valued  and  reproduced  for certain desirable  characteristics,

rather  than  as persons.  You can also stretch your imagination

that  one day there could be commercialisation of human cloning,

embryos    being   sold   to   potential   so-called    parents.

Intrinsically,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>

there are concerns about the health of the child which would  be

cloned,  as  well  as the loss of genetic diversity  and  hybrid

vigour  in the population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Peh came up with a very interesting theory about how

human  society is organised.  He said that our moral values  and

social relationships are man made.  To a certain extent,  it  is

true.   However,  when  you  look at human  civilisation,  human

reproduction is a very basic fact and a driving force of life on

this  earth.  The relationships between man and woman and  their

offspring from the act of reproduction, ie, the family, actually

forms  the basis for the organisation of society.  Besides that,

there is the question of generations.  Generational hierarchy is

also  a universal principle of organising human society.  Unless

you  want to have a brave new world imagined by science  fiction

writers  such as Aldous Huxley, which makes me shudder, I  think

we  better  not  tangle with this.  There  are  certain  ethical

limits that we must abide by.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, my Ministry has adopted the position that there

should be a total prohibition on the creation of human babies by

cloning technology.  This is also in line with the stand adopted

by  the  World  Health Organisation in its  recent  Assembly  in

Geneva  in May this year.  The Assembly has adopted a resolution

affirming that the use of cloning for the replication  of  human

individuals  is  ethically unacceptable, and contrary  to  human

integrity  and morality.  This is our stand and  if  Mr  Peh  is

interested  in  reading the WHO document, I will be  pleased  to

send it to him.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Point of clarification, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is no time to clarify. Maybe later on

before we reach the guillotine time.  Mr Chen.

<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Chen:</b> Sir, at least we do not have too many

wolves  in  sheep's  clothing!  I  beg  leave  to  withdraw  the

amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment No. (2), Encik Ibrahim.

<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P of the Main

Estimates be reduced by $10 in respect of Code PD 1500.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to seek clarification with regard to voluntary

welfare organisations (VWOs).  The Senior Minister of State  has

given  an  answer to Mr Goh and Mr Yeo.  The Senior Minister  of

State  has not given a definite answer as to what percentage  of

funding  as  regards the operating or recurrent expenditures  of

VWOs.   Presently,  it  is  50%.   Could  the  Ministry  perhaps

consider  giving  a  higher grant,  say,  up  to  90%  of  their

recurrent  or operating expenditure?  I think many of  the  VWOs

are facing problems in raising funds and most of their free time

is being spent on raising funds, which I think is at the expense

of caring for the elderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also need to ask the Senior Minister of State when will

the  Inter-Ministry Committee on Health Care for the Elderly  be

formed,  how long will it take, and what is the time frame?   If

the  Ministry cannot give a 90% grant for recurrent expenditure,

would they have a graduated scale?  That means if there is a VWO-run  hospital, it could be given 90%.  If they take  care  of  a

nursing  home,  maybe 80%.  And, of course,  for  ordinary  VWOs

running  a  day-care centre, 60%.  I think this will  help  them

tremendously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I also ask what other measures the Government is taking

to  assist  VWOs  to provide health care for the elderly,  apart

from financial assistance?  What about manpower, expertise, etc?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, may I take all my

three amendments together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, the most effective way to the care of our

elderly follows the dictum "prevention is better than cure".  In

view  of  the increasing numbers of our elderly to about 850,000

over  the  next  30  years, preventive care should  be  promoted

island-wide  on a big scale and soon.  Let it be made  available

to our elderly while they are still well.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are quite a number of preventive care concepts or

models.  I have started a model in Kim Seng which is based on  a

"total  care" concept of looking after the physical, mental  and

social  well-being of the elderly.  By paying a  reasonable  and

affordable  fee,  the  participants sign up  at  this  precinct-located  Centre of Activity for Retired and Elderly  (CARE)  for

their   daily  exercises,  wholesome  daily  meals  and   social

activities  such as singing, dancing and picnic  outings.   They

get to interact and befriend each other and, hopefully, they can

be  concerned  for  and be helpful to each other  as  "buddies".

They   will  attend  health  education  talks  and  have  health

screening tests which are to be conducted yearly for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am convinced that the way to go is to have more of

such   CARE.    They  can  be  run  by  grassroots  groups   and

organisations from the community.  They do not cost much to run,

but  they do need support.  Sir, by spending time and effort and

money  on preventive care now could save us dollars up the  road

in a big way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would really like to see the involvement of MOH, MCD and

CDCs in supporting such centres.  At the moment, several private

volunteer doctors are providing some of the services.  But MOH's

involvement  would  enhance  and maintain  the  fast  increasing

demands.   Could MOH support these types of centres,  especially

in  terms of back-up medical screening tests and regular  health

talks?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next topic is on the setting up of more geriatric

hospitals.   The sick elderly are best catered for in  geriatric

departments  or  geriatric  hospitals  where  a  more   holistic

approach towards better care becomes possible.  The elderly  are

often  afflicted with multiple illnesses, and when they go  from

one  specialty to another, they are often subjected to  multiple

diagnostic tests.  They may be over investigated or over treated

for  conditions that are in fact due to the normal processes  of

ageing, which in isolation and in an acute hospital or emergency

situations can complicate diagnosis and treatment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>

Well-run  geriatric  departments can  prevent  such  unnecessary

inconvenience and waste of resources.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Neo, you are using the words "elderly" and

"geriatrics" interchangeably.  Please carry on.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Yes. My question is that I would like to ask

the Ministry whether, apart from those geriatric departments  in

Alexandra  Hospital,  Tan  Tock Seng  Hospital  and  New  Changi

Hospital,  will  new  ones be established  in  the  other  acute

general hospitals in the near future?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my last topic is on geriatric training and services.

There is a shortage of geriatric care providers even as of  now.

By  the  year  2030, it is likely that almost one-third  of  our

population  will  be  considered  elderly.   In  view   of   the

increasing  trend  in the population of our aged,  we  certainly

have  an  urgent  need to increase our pool of  people  who  are

interested  in  gerontology and trained in geriatric  care.   We

will  need  more  geriatric specialists, trained  geriatric-care

nurses, physiotherapists, speech therapists and so on.  This has

to  be  looked into now if we are to aim at providing  the  most

effective and best care for the elderly in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Ministry whether there are already

plans  in  place  for  the  training of  people  to  solve  this

shortage.  Time is needed for training people, just as  time  is

also  needed  for comprehensive planning of the services.   This

has to be an on-going process started from now to have the basic

resources in steady-state.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unless we have these core service-providers, we cannot

make  any  substantial  progress in the  care  of  our  elderly,

especially when it comes to looking after the dependent elderly,

the lack of core service providers will be our stumbling block.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geriatrics, as a specialty, is not a popular career

pursuit among doctors.  This trend needs to be addressed.   Will

the  Ministry  be seeking ways to entice more young  doctors  to

train in this particular specialty?

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Sir, Mr Ibrahim Othman asked for some

clarification on what other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>

forms  of help the Ministry of Health can give to the  VWOs.   I

have indicated that where there is a need and request within our

resources, we could second some medical officers and so  on,  as

we have done to community hospitals.  We could help in training,

say,  the nursing aides.  In fact, I understand that the College

of  Family  Physicians is thinking of organising such a  course.

There are many other ways that we could come in and help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for financial support, the 50:50 recurrent expenditure

subsidy,  as  I explained, is now a formula used  for  all  VWOs

whether they are under the Ministry of Community Development  or

under the Ministry of Health.  But I think the Inter-Ministerial

Committee  will  look into suggestions such as his,  whether  we

could  graduate the subsidy to VWOs offering different kinds  of

services. In fact, we are already in the process of costing  the

services, each particular type of service, so that we  can  help

to fund the VWOs better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee has just been formed. We will start meeting

in  August.  Most probably, we will finish our deliberations  by

the end of this year or early next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lily Neo talked about preventive health care for the

elderly, especially in the community setting.  I agree with  her

that  the  ideal place where the elderly can be cared for  after

discharge from hospital, or to help them stay in good health  so

that they do not fall sick and become hospitalised, would be the

community.   Therefore, I think we should welcome projects  such

as  hers  in Kim Seng where she would gather a group of  elderly

people,   provide   them   with  healthy   social   recreational

opportunities, exercise, give them meals and so on.   This  type

of  groups  can play a very important role in preventive  health

care for the elderly.  If in future Dr Neo thinks that there  is

something that the Ministry of Health can do together with  her,

or  together with the Community Development Council under  which

her  constituency falls, by all means please approach us and  we

will talk about the details.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to explain to her that the Ministry of Health

has been doing quite

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>

a  lot  of  health  promotion and disease prevention  among  the

elderly.   First  of all, we have been promoting healthy  living

for everybody, including the elderly.  We have been carrying out

extensive health education promotions within community  centres,

in  schools  and  so  on.  We also provide a  very  good  health

screening service at our polyclinics and at our senior citizens'

health care centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventive care for the elderly would be one other area

that the Inter-Ministerial Committee will look at and see how we

can strengthen it.  We would most certainly increase our efforts

in  health  education  and  health promotion.   One  preliminary

thinking we have is that we could develop a protocol for  health

screening  for  the  elderly to be given  to  the  GPs  and  the

polyclinics.  Health screening for the elderly is  a  very  time

consuming  exercise. We want to simplify  it,  but  to  make  it

adequate  so  that  even  general  practitioners  will  find  it

possible to do health screening for the elderly.  That would  be

one  approach  to  improving  preventive  health  care  for  the

elderly.

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for geriatric services and training, and also geriatric

hospitals, we have already got three geriatric departments,  one

each at the so-called regional hospitals.  They are at Alexandra

Hospital,  Tan  Tock Seng Hospital and also at  the  new  Changi

Hospital.   These geriatric departments will form  the  node  in

each  region  for the networking of the community  based  health

care services so that the care of the elderly could pass through

a  seamless  web.  But we must not just think of increasing  the

number  of  geriatricians or increasing the number of  geriatric

departments  in  hospitals as the specialised services  for  the

elderly.   These departments are for the management of  multiple

complicated problems of the elderly.  For other conditions,  the

general medicine department, orthopaedic  department, cardiology

department, and the general wards can take care of the  elderly.

Indeed,  the  majority of the elderly can be taken  care  of  in

these   general  departments.   So  geriatric  departments   and

geriatric care are a very specialised branch

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>

that  is not meant to cater to everybody.  It is meant to  cater

only  to  complicated multiple problems.  I would also  like  to

stress  that  the care for the elderly is the responsibility  of

all the doctors, including the general practitioners, as well as

the  family and the community.  In fact, our emphasis should  be

on  community based services rather than developing too fast  or

too many of these geriatric centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geriatrics is a relatively new field in Singapore. So far,

we  have  trained  13  geriatricians and  another  five  are  in

training.   It is estimated that ideally we require  24  by  the

year  2000.  We will work towards it and encourage more  doctors

to  take  it up.  But it is a very challenging task to  interest

young  doctors  to  do  geriatrics.  For one  thing  it  is  not

considered to be glamorous enough but we will try to reverse the

image.   We  are  also  providing  a  post-graduate  diploma  in

geriatric  medicine as well as training nurses  in  gerontology.

As  I said, we should not just look at geriatrics as a field for

the elderly and this is the only way forward.  No, I think it is

a  broad based strategy and every general practitioner and every

community  would have to share the responsibility of giving  the

best health care to the elderly.

<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman:</b> I thank the Senior Minister for

State for her explanation and beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim bin Othman:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head P of the Main

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to ask the Minister a question in regard to the

increase   in  the  number  of  attendance  at  the   outpatient

polyclinics  and whether there will be a corresponding  increase

in  the number of doctors treating them.  May I also ask what is

the  average  number of patients seen by each doctor  daily  and

what  is the average time for consultation for each case.   What

is the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>

waiting  time for each patient before he gets to see the  doctor

at the outpatient polyclinics?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Dr Wong, you have 1 1/2 minutes to reply.

<br><br><!-- Dr Aline Wong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Aline Wong:</b> Yes, we have increased the number of

doctors.   You have just heard the Minister who said  that  over

the   last   10  years  the  number  of  doctors  has  increased

significantly.  This has made it possible for the  patient  load

at  our  polyclinics  to  have  declined.   The  doctor  in  the

polyclinic is now seeing an average of 71 patients per day.  Ten

years  ago, it was 95.  The patient load of 70 patients per  day

is  quite the same as the average 60-80 patients per day seen by

the  busy  general  practitioners.  So if  you  talk  about  the

quality  of  care,  I  think  the polyclinics  are  offering  an

equivalent kind.  But I must stress that the time spent  by  the

doctor on a particular patient depends on his medical condition.

We have some statistics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head R of the Main

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government has been more visible in recent years

in  its support of the arts.  Its grant to the promotion of arts

nearly  doubled  in  the last three years.   This  supports  the

Government's overall aim to develop a more gracious and  vibrant

society.  The  Government  has  recently,  in  the  Presidential

Address debate, announced its financial support for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>

LaSalle-SIA College of Arts and the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts

(NAFA).   May  I suggest that with this support, we  consciously

develop  LaSalle-SIA  College of the Arts  to  be  a  well-known

academy  for performing arts and NAFA to be a well-known  centre

for fine arts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, notwithstanding this positive move by the Government,

my  GPC  would like to see more being done to promote the  arts.

We  propose a three-pronged action plan.  Firstly, to give  more

support  to  the  local  arts groups.  Secondly,  to  start  our

children  early on an arts appreciation programme.  Thirdly,  to

bring the arts to the HDB heartland.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe there are about 50 to 100 local arts groups

which deserve support from the Government.  We would like to see

more  funds being made available to help these arts groups  take

off.   On arts education, we suggest that schools organise  more

field  trips to enhance students' understanding and appreciation

of  the different forms of arts and sculptures.  Performing arts

should  also  be  included  as part  of  this  art  appreciation

programme for the children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must also correct the image that the arts belong to

the  elite.  We must try to bring the arts to our HDB heartland.

Therefore, we suggest that community centres and community clubs

which are scheduled for renovation or rebuilding in the next few

years  designate rooms to be offered as homes for some of  these

local  arts  groups.  We further suggest that  arts  corners  be

established in every constituency where residents could  display

their  talents  and art works on a pre-determined  Sunday  of  a

month at the void deck of a certain block, for example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on the question of funding for the arts, we

urge  MITA  to revive the idea of establishing an arts endowment

fund  to help promote arts and arts education in support of  our

goal  of  building a gracious society.  We further propose  that

this  fund  comes  from part of the budgetary  surplus  that  we

generate every year.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Yaacob Ibrahim (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, I echo the sentiments

of  my GPC Chairman, Mr Chew Heng Ching.  I am glad to note that

the efforts by the Government and private groups to promote arts

in  Singapore  are bearing some success.  We can  see  from  the

recently  concluded arts festival.  We drew a much larger  crowd

than before.  Most of the performances, I am made to understand,

were  oversubscribed.   There is  also  a  trend  of  a  growing

appreciation of theatre, film, painting and other art forms.  So

I  must  congratulate MITA for bringing the arts to the  people,

especially those also living in HDB flats.  Through schemes such

as  arts  housing, art groups now can operate out  of  community

centres  and  thereby  contribute to art appreciation  across  a

wider audience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for the arts to continue to develop and flourish

in  Singapore, we certainly need both the practitioners and  the

audience.  As again mentioned by my Chairman, the recent move by

the Government to promote art education through LaSalle-SIA Arts

College  and  the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts would  definitely

contribute  to  the  pool  of  practitioners.   We   know   that

appreciation of the arts, if introduced at an early  age,  would

have  a  lasting effect.  Art appreciation must also be fostered

among adults.  Children who have an inclination towards the arts

will  pursue an active career if they have the support of  their

parents  and  peers.  Thus, there is a relationship between  art

appreciation  and  education.  As more  people  appreciate  art,

there  will be a tendency for more people to pursue a career  in

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My concern here, Sir, is the policy and the promotion of

art  appreciation  and  education  in  Singapore.   We  need  to

encourage art appreciation from the very young, but we must also

ensure that those who are interested in the arts, their interest

is  sustained  while  in school.  Can we  perhaps  consider  art

education as part of our core curriculum in school?  While  this

may be the responsibility of MOE, I believe it is the domain  of

MITA as the Ministry responsible for the development of the arts

in  Singapore  to set the agenda and to work with  MOE.   Hence,

this policy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>

must  be  an  integrated one between MITA and  MOE.   With  this

integrated  policy,  students in the arts  could  be  given  the

opportunity to perform publicly and interact with arts groups in

Singapore.  Attachment programmes could be developed  for  these

students.  This policy would ensure that arts education  is  not

only  the  purview  of the trainers but also the  practitioners.

The  net  result is a policy which would ensure that arts  would

continue to flourish in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, the Government, in order to

promote our heritage, established the National Heritage Board in

the  year 1993.  The Board now incorporates the National History

Museum,  the  Singapore Arts Museum, Asian Civilisation  Museum,

National  Archives of Singapore and the Oral History Centre.   I

understand that soon the Preservation of Monuments Board will be

transferred from the Ministry of National Development  to  MITA.

Does  it  mean  that  the Preservation of  Monuments  Board  has

shifted  its  emphasis  from the preservation  of  buildings  to

heritage  and  history?  May I therefore  ask  the  Minister  to

clarify to Members of the House the reason for the transfer  and

whether the Preservation of Monuments Board will be merged  into

the National Heritage Board (NHP) and what he sees as the future

directions of this Preservation of Monuments Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, still on the subject of heritage. In understanding

Singapore's  root  and history, one must always  understand  our

National  Anthem "Majullah Singapura".  I remember that  when  I

was  a  school  boy  in  the 60s, we were  taught  to  read  and

understand  the wordings in the Anthem and to sing  whenever  it

was  played.  The situation is quite different today.  Not  many

Singaporeans  really  understand  the  wordings  in  the  Anthem

because  they are in Malay, our national language, and not  many

Singaporeans sing whenever the Anthem is played.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I therefore propose that the Government, through MITA,

organise  a  national campaign to get Singaporeans to understand

our National Anthem, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>

history and objective behind the wordings of the Anthem, and  to

encourage  Singaporeans to sing whenever the Anthem  is  played.

Sir,  if Singaporeans were to fully understand the wordings  and

the  meanings behind the Anthem, I am confident that  they  will

sing  the Anthem loud and clear and with great passion and pride

showing their love for the country.

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am proposing that MITA take on this task because I

consider organising this campaign as part of our national effort

to educate Singaporeans on our history and heritage.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in his Addendum to the

Presidential Address, BG George Yeo stated that the Ministry  of

Information and the Arts will continue to help make Singapore  a

renaissance  city for information, culture and the arts  in  the

21st  century.  I strongly support this intention.  I personally

feel that in order to succeed in this effort to make Singapore a

gracious  city, we must, first of all, consider how to encourage

Singaporeans to appreciate and enjoy our culture and arts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my Chairman of the GPC, Mr Chew Heng Ching, has said,

many  of our cultural events and exhibitions have received  full

support from the Government but the mass media of Singapore such

as television, radio and newspapers give very little coverage or

report  on  cultural events and exhibitions, unlike China,  Hong

Kong  and  Taiwan.  Even when there are reports, they  are  very

unenthusiastic  and  very brief.  They  can  hardly  arouse  the

interest  of  the  public.  I think this  is  very  regrettable.

Perhaps  the  mass  media  may  be  looking  at  them  from  the

commercial and business point of view and find that they are  of

no  commercial value.  In fact, if we want to promote  arts  and

culture   and   to  make  Singapore  a  renaissance   city   for

information,  culture and the arts in the next  millennium,  the

mass  media  plays a very, very important role.   On  the  other

hand,  the  success of making Singapore a renaissance city  will

also contribute to the growth and development of our mass media.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have a lot of people who love the arts and

culture  and  there is no difficulty in organising any  cultural

events  and exhibitions.  But it is very difficult for  them  to

get the support from the mass media.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Vice-Chairman of the GPC for MITA, very often I was

invited to officiate at these events, and I saw that there  were

hardly  any  news  reporters  present  at  these  events.   Some

elaborately  organised  and  meaningful  cultural   events   and

exhibitions did not receive good response from the public due to

lack of publicity.  This is very disappointing.  To achieve  our

objective   of   making   Singapore  a  renaissance   city   for

information, culture and the arts, we need not only the  support

from the Government but also the support from the mass media and

the keen participation of every Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope MITA will look into ways to encourage the media to

give our cultural events more coverage.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, I understand the Singapore

Kindness  Movement was registered as a society at the  beginning

of  this  year.   It  is a civic body with Institute  of  Public

Character  (IPC) status which means that donation  to  the  body

will be tax exempt.  I understand its aim is to get Singaporeans

to  perform acts of kindness in their daily lives in  line  with

our national efforts to promote gracious living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Singaporeans I spoke to about the Kindness

Movement were a little confused.  They thought, since we already

have  the Courtesy Campaign, why the need for a movement  called

the  Kindness Movement.  Does it mean that the Courtesy Campaign

has  failed?  Many thought if it is really necessary to have the

movement,  why  not  combine  or merge  the  movement  with  the

Courtesy  Campaign.   And  just as  many  ask  if  the  Courtesy

Campaign  will  be  stopped  with the  launch  of  the  Kindness

Movement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps it is opportune for the Minister to explain to this House the objective and rationale behind the Singapore Kindness Movement, its plan for the future and what will happen to the Courtesy Campaign when the Movement is launched.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I move on to the next cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister

to  give  the  House an update on the Cable  TV  project.   What

percentage of the households in Singapore has been wired up  to-date  and  when will all the households be eventually wired  up?

And how does the cable TV project fit into the Singapore IT 2000

Plan?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand the subscriptions among households which

are  already wired up remain very low.  Why is that so?   Is  it

because the TCS programmes are too attractive offering a  better

alternative?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the SCV has many channels providing info-educational,

current  affairs, cultural, sports, children's and entertainment

programmes meeting the needs of Singaporeans from all  walks  of

life.   It  is a pity that Singaporeans are not fully  aware  of

this.  I think the SCV must do more marketing and perhaps review

its  subscription fees to make them sufficiently attractive  for

households to subscribe.  May I therefore ask the Minister  what

plans  are  in  place to get more Singaporeans to  subscribe  to

Cable  TV?   And in the event that SCV proves to be  non-viable,

will the Government come to their rescue?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I move on to the next cut.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, please.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching:</b> Sir, following feedback and

suggestions  from Members of this House some four years  ago  (I

remember  there  was  a heated debate on TCS  programmes),  MITA

subsequently  formed two Advisory Committees, ie,  the  Advisory

Committee on Chinese Dramas and Variety Shows, or ACCESS as they

call  it,  and the Programme Advisory Committee (PAC) to  advise

and  provide  feedback to TCS and RCS on their programmes.   The

Committees  are well represented.  They include some Members  of

this   House   and  also  Singaporeans  holding   positions   of

responsibilities in society and from all walks of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Committees are into their third or fourth year of

operations and have put up useful observations and recommen

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>

dations  to TCS and RCS to improve their programmes.  Indeed,  I

think the Committees have done well.  The programmes of TCS  and

RCS  today are a marked improvement from four to five years ago.

And I think there is further room for improvement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both TCS and RCS remain receptive to suggestions for

improvement and that are good signs.  Sir, I propose  that  MITA

regularly review the composition of ACCESS and PAC, and at  each

renewal  time, when the two-year term expires, replace half  the

Committee and at the next renewal, replace the other  half.   In

this way, we would continuously be able to inject new ideas  and

talents  into the two Committees, and yet ensure continuity  and

consistency in their opinion and feedback.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even if the PAC and ACCESS have good representations,

in   terms  of  having  Singaporeans  from  all  walks  of  life

represented   in   the   two  Committees,   relying   on   their

observations, feedback and suggestions alone is not enough.  TCS

should  reach out to a wider network of audience and viewers  to

get   feedback.   And  one  useful  network  is  certainly   our

grassroots  organisations  and our  grassroots  leaders  in  the

constituency.  These people have direct access and  interactions

with  the  constituents.  Indeed, they  get  feedback  from  the

horse's mouth.  May I therefore ask the Minister if TCS has such

a  feedback  mechanism, besides the PAC and ACCESS and,  if  so,

what are they?  How effective have all these feedback mechanisms

been in helping TCS and RCS to improve their programmes?

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to speak

on  the  recommendations of the Programme Advisory Committee  on

TCS  Chinese Dramas and Variety Shows.  I would generally accept

the  recommendations of the PAC.  But there are two observations

I like to make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its mid-year report, the PAC pointed out that the

Channel 8 programmes seem to be confined only to the Chinese and

excluding all the other races.  In this way,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>

the   production  direction  will  be  narrow  in  future.   The

Committee also pointed out that the news programmes in Channel 8

have  less  international news as compared  to  Channel  5,  and

people  who speak only English are hardly invited to give  their

views  and  opinions in current affairs and financial programmes

on  Channel 8.  In view of that, the Committee recommended  that

Channel  8  should widen its vision by having more international

news  and  distinctive  features of a  multi-racial  society  of

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above recommendation of the Committee is aimed at

integrating  the  characteristic features  of  our  multi-racial

society.    So  the  programmes  should  feature  the  different

cultural  backgrounds to meet the needs of  each  ethnic  group.

The  Committee  recommended that Channel 8 be more  creative  to

improve the quality of its programmes.  I think the objective is

good  and  I  can understand that.  However, we must  understand

that  Channel 8 and Channel 5 have their own groups of  viewers.

Just  like  the Lianhe Zaobao and the Straits Times,  they  have

their  own  groups of readers.  So the difference between  these

newspapers  is  that  they  have their own  characteristics  and

different focuses.  They have different values, different  views

and  different perceptions to meet the needs of their respective

readers.  Therefore, we cannot expect Lianhe Zaobao to go  along

the lines of the Straits Times or the Straits Times to cater  to

the tastes of the readers of Lianhe Zaobao.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same logic applies to TCS' Channels 8 and 5. The

Chinese   programmes   on   Channel  8   should   maintain   its

characteristics.  At the same time, it should  seek  to  improve

its  quality  of  programming.  When the Chinese  programmes  on

Channel 8 are more interesting and rich in substance, the  needs

of the viewers will be better satisfied.  Please do not make the

news  and programmes of Channel 8 to look exactly like those  on

Channel 5 and we do not want the programmes on Channel 5 to look

exactly  like those on Channel 8.  Otherwise, we will disappoint

both the Chinese-speaking and the English-speaking viewers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its report of 8th July, the Programme Advisory Committee

recommended  that  TCS institute a dress code for  its  artistes

attending  prestigious events so as to ensure that their  attire

befits   the   occasion.   I  consider  myself  a   conservative

Singaporean.  However, I feel that the dressing of TCS  artistes

at  public  events, whether in the past or present, is perfectly

fine  and  there was no occasion of over-exposure.  I  only  say

that they are more daring and fashionable.  TV artistes are  not

Ministers or Members of Parliament.  They are also not  teachers

or  lecturers who need to set an example for their students.  So

as  artistes,  their dressing is usually trendy and avant-garde,

they  may  even be leaders in the fashion world.  Personally,  I

feel  that TCS artistes' dressing is fine so long as it  is  not

too  exposed  and  does  not reflect bad  motives.   So  modern,

trendy, special and even sexy dressing is not a problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just two years ago I mentioned in Parliament that there was

a  film  called  "Nell" which featured very  clearly  some  nude

scenes  of the female body.  If we could allow this film  to  be

screened  in  Singapore, classified as "PG" and not "R(A)",  why

are  we  setting a double standard for setting a dress code  for

our TCS artistes?  Singapore is an open society.  It is also  an

international  city.   Our  Government  has  plans  to   develop

Singapore  into a movie and television hub of Asia in  the  next

few years.  We should not draw up clauses to dictate the ways on

how  our  TV artistes should dress themselves.  If we  do  that,

then  we would not be able to attract some famous artistes, like

Andy Lau, to come to Singapore.  I think we may provide artistes

with  some advice on their image presentation and cultivate  and

enhance  their cultural and artistic qualities.   This  will  be

helpful  to our effort to realise our goal of becoming  a  movie

and TV hub in Asia.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, there are some

attempts  by TCS to inject more info-educational programmes  for

children in the mornings.  But, as a whole, there are still  too

many cartoons in the schedule.  There should be a better balance

in the mix of children's programmes.  Too

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>

many  cartoons in the morning will distract children's attention

from  their homework.  Besides, some of the cartoon series  such

as  Street Sharks, Ninja Turtles, and so forth are too  violent.

TCS  should  instead produce children's programmes that  reflect

local  culture  and  values.  They could  consider  highlighting

school   concerts,  school  drama  festivals,  arts  and   craft

achievements,  school sports competition  finals  in  the  local

children  series.   If TCS is unable to get  suitable  cartoons,

then  they  should  shorten the cartoon broadcast  schedule  and

instead  use the time slot available for something more  useful,

for  example,  showing  some dialect series  of  movies  in  the

morning for the entertainment of senior citizens.

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still many senior citizens who can only speak

dialect.   In the morning, there could be news, for example,  in

dialect  which  gives  a  summary of the  important  local  news

broadcast  the  previous  day.   After  all,  news  is   already

broadcast  over radio in dialect in the evenings.  In this  way,

Sir,  senior  citizens  who  could  not  understand  English  or

Mandarin   could  also  be  kept  informed  of   the   important

developments   in   our  country.   This  would   prevent   many

misinterpretations  of  important  Government  policies  through

wrong translation or hearing from a third party.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, local Mandarin dramas, particularly on Channel 8,

still  tend  to  be  very melodramatic.   For  example,  I  have

received  feedback from my constituents that the  story  usually

revolves  round two men and a woman, or two women with one  man,

or  rejected females will commit suicide, or turn to alcohol, or

pick  up  some  other  man  in the  bar.   These  are  not  true

reflections of life in Singapore.  [Interruption]. Or maybe I am

out of date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, TCS could also produce socially worthy programmes

which  highlight youth involvement in community work, promote  a

gracious   society,  show  retirees  how  to  stay  active   and

contribute to society.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on public holidays, TCS should schedule more first-run

movies.  Repeats should be done selectively outside prime  slots

which  should be reserved for news and good programmes.  Sir,  I

hope the Minister could consider this feedback.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Sinnakarupan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Sinnakarupan (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, the second

season  of the S-League has just ended.  The soccer experts  are

writing  up  their analyses to rate the success of  the  season.

Every  sportsman in Singapore or even a primary school kid,  who

has only got some cursory interest in soccer, knows what was the

biggest shortcoming of this season.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the biggest shortcoming is undoubtedly the lack of TV

coverage  of  the League.  In last year's season,  a  number  of

matches  were  shown  live  on TV but  many  of  these  matches,

unfortunately, turned out to be uninteresting encounters.  These

uninteresting  over exposures did not help the S-League  either.

It  was  because,  in  addition to showing  these  uninteresting

matches, the lack of professionalism in placing and operating TV

equipment and the lack of informed and positive commentary added

to  the problem.  To show the game in full alongside the English

Premier League certainly invites negative comments and the  lack

of  TV  professionalism  compounds the error  for  a  relatively

intelligent football audience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is really needed is for the local TV stations to

design  and  develop a programme which focuses on  the  positive

elements of Singaporean football and encourages fans to identify

with  the teams.  This can be achieved by a regular weekly half-hour  show in a peak hour slot.  The content of the show  should

be  made entertaining, interesting, informative and challenging.

The  positive  aspects of the S-League should be  stressed,  the

skills,  the  atmosphere, the competition,  not  forgetting  the

sponsors,  and the progress.  In other words, actions should  be

kept to the highlights of the games, just the best moments,  but

of all the week's games.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alongside the action should be segments designed to build the

personalities  and  news  of  activities  designed  to   develop

football in Singapore.  The focus of the show should not just be

on looking back at the weekend's action but also looking forward

in promoting the games coming up and publicising locations, kick-off times, ticket availability, etc, to encourage supporters  to

go to the games.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand that our local TV stations expect the S-League to pay a hefty sum of money to produce such a show or to

have  delayed  telecast  of  the games.   This  is  a  very  odd

situation  because,  in  many  other  countries,  especially  in

Europe,  and  other parts of Asia and Australia, it  is  the  TV

stations who have to pay the sports associations hefty  sums  of

money, in the order of millions of dollars, to get the rights to

telecast  the League games.  True that our S-League is  not  yet

well-established as, say, the English League or the J-League  in

Japan, but our local TV stations can do more to invest in  local

soccer which will pay off in later years, especially when soccer

betting  is  introduced.  They should also invest in  satisfying

the  appetites of thousands of soccer fans.  After all, watching

soccer,  besides shopping and eating, is a favourite pastime  of

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think the Minister himself is a soccer fan and I

hope that he will take up this matter personally.

<br><br><!-- Mr Choo Wee Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Choo Wee Khiang:</b> Sir, I used to be quite critical of

TCS programmes and I must confess that I share the sentiments of

Mr  Chew  Heng Ching that over the last few years, we have  seen

improvements.   However,  I  think  there  is  still  room   for

improvement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to quote you one example. Like many

others  in  Singapore,  I watch the TCS  live  coverage  of  the

handover of Hong Kong from the British to China on the night  of

30th  June  this year.  I must say that I was quite disappointed

with the way TCS treated the event.  In my opinion, and also the

opinion  of  many whom I have spoken to, TCS' coverage  did  not

really reflect the solemnity and historic importance of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>

event in a way that one would have expected.  Just to quote  one

example, Sir.  In one instance, we were brought over to  Chijmes

where we saw TCS stars and all the actors and actresses having a

good time there.  And the commentator was describing and showing

us what food they were eating that night.  Some of those came to

me  and commented that they did not really care what a bunch  of

TCS actors and actresses were eating on a night like that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the significance really of showing them partying

away when the real event was happening in Hong Kong and Beijing?

Where  is  TCS' sense of occasion?  There were also  people  who

were unhappy with the commentary and I share their opinion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at times, if you really cannot beat them, you join

them.   In this instance, I think TCS would have done better  by

simply  hooking  on with one of the Hong Kong's stations  rather

than making our own presentation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, every

year  when  we  debate the budget for MITA, TV  programmes  have

always  been  the  focus  of our debate because  television  has

become  part  and parcel of the lives of our people,  especially

the  HDB  flat dwellers.  In the evening, whenever  I  visit  my

constituency, I cannot help noticing this point.   Almost  every

family  watches TV.  Some parents may be reading  the  Shin  Min

Daily  News  or the  Lianhe Wanbao and their children  would  be

watching TV.  Whenever the Comedy Night is on the air,  we  hear

laughter  everywhere. Even the old folks would  put  down  their

newspapers and join in the fun.    On the other hand, when there

is  a  live  telecast of an important football match,   we  hear

shouts  resembling  the  Kallang  Roar  everywhere  in  the  HDB

estates. Our TV programmes have gone deep into the people.   But

there  may be  a great change very soon.  Why?  Because  we  are

speedily   wiring  up  the  whole of Singapore  with  television

cables. .

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, I think quite a lot of households are already

having access to cable TV.  So all these entertainment, news,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>

movie  and  sports  programmes  sent to the  households  through

underground  cables  with  super-high  definitions  can  pose  a

challenge to TCS.  For the time being,  not many have signed  up

for  subsrciptions with Cable TV. Perhaps it is because the fees

are  on  the  high  side.   I understand that  when  we  have  a

critical mass of subscribers when the whole country is wired up,

then  the  fees will be lowered, just as in the case  of  mobile

handphones.   Then,  it  will be  a greater  challenge  to  TCS.

However,  we should not be afraid of challenge.  We should  open

up.   But we should be fully prepared to face the new situation.

In regional and world events, I think we should let Singaporeans

view  the  events from the point of view of Singapore  and   our

national interest.  Mr Choo Wee Khiang referred to the programme

on  the  Reunification of Hong Kong with China.  I  watched  the

programme  too.   I must say  TCS has made a good  presentation.

It  is a great world event.   Through this programe, we have  an

understanding of the mindset of the Hong Kong people before  the

reunification.  We  saw  the  People's  Liberation  Army   (PLA)

marching  across the border into Hong Kong.  What is the  impact

of  the reunification of Hong Kong with China on this region and

on Singapore?  I think the programme does not cover this aspect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that TCS should attach more importance to the

analysis  and  comments  on current affairs.  When  Singaporeans

watch  TV programmes, they like to switch channels from time  to

time. When they are watching news on our local channel, they may

switch  over  to  CNN or BBC News.  Then there will  be  serious

problems  because  they will be looking  at  problems  from  the

foreigner's  point of view.  This is certainly not conducive  to

our  efforts of attaining a consensus between the people and the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After corporatisation, TCS programmes have improved by

leaps  and  bounds,  especially in  news   reports  and  current

affairs.  I think TCS should give more weightage to this kind of

programme, give them greater emphasis and go one step further to

extend  its coverage to the other aspects of life.  Interviewees

should not be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>

confined  to  the  authorities,  celebrities,  specialists   and

experts in the respective fields.  We could include also the man-in-the-street, students, housewives and other ordinary citizens.

Let  us listen to the ordinary people's views.  I feel that,  at

the  moment, TV programming is targetted too much on the youths,

the  educated and the families and, to an extent, neglecting the

middle-aged  and  older  people.  I think the  programme  should

also  reflect the problems of the middle-aged people, especially

the  various problems  on the changing wage structure and  other

problems  generally   faced  by all the  middle-aged  and  older

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our population is aging rapidly, and the programming

of  TV  should  reflect  this fact.  If you  are  talking  about

purchasing  power,  I  can say that the  middle-aged  and  older

people  are  equally strong in their purchasing power.   So  the

sponsors can be rest assured that the programmes and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>

the commercials that go with them will appeal to them too!

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion by the Member is in fact being practised.

Before  construction work begins, the contractor is required  by

the  Ministry  of  the Environment to engage  a  qualified  pest

control firm.  The list of qualified firms is reviewed regularly

and  those  that have provided unsatisfactory services  will  be

dropped from it.

<div align="center"><b>PRIVATE BUSES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for Communications

whether  his  Ministry  will consider  allowing  private  buses

(especially Adult Workers Contract registered buses)  to  enter

bus  lanes outside the Central Business District areas  between

<br>4.30 pm and 7.00 pm so as to facilitate the alighting of

passengers taking private buses.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bus lanes were introduced in 1974 to enhance the

reliability  and attractiveness of scheduled bus services.  They

are  drawn  along roads with high volume of scheduled  buses  to

give  priority to these buses, which are efficient  carriers  of

large number of passengers.  This is in line with our policy  to

promote greater use of mass public transport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has received similar requests to allow private

and  school  buses to enter the bus lanes during the  restricted

hours. If these buses were allowed to enter bus lanes to pick up

and  set  down  passengers during restricted hours,  they  would

impede  the flow of scheduled buses using these lanes and affect

their   reliability  and  level of service  to  the  public  bus

commuters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After careful consideration, my Ministry has decided that

bus  lanes  should  continue to be restricted to  scheduled  bus

services  during the restricted hours. Private hire  and  school

buses  can  stop  to  pick up and set down  passengers  at  gaps

demarcated with broken yellow lines along the bus lanes or along

non-bus lane roads.
