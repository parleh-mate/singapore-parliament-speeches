<div align="center"><h4><br><br><div align="center"><i>MERGER DOMINATES THIS THIRD SESSION OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY</i></div></h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Third Session of this Legislative Assembly

opens,  merger between Singapore and the Federation

of  Malaya dominates every other issue. Soon before

June 1963, she will be united with the mainland  of

the Federation of Malaya. This is a decisive moment

in  the history of the people of Malaya, indeed  in

the  history of the people of Malaysia, for  it  is

proposed  that  the  three territories  of  Brunei,

Sarawak and North Borneo should join us. This  will

help  us  strengthen each other. This will  enlarge

our economic base for development, for progress and

prosperity  within Malaysia, and for  our  standing

internationally in the comity of nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first Session of this Legislative

Assembly  opened on 1st July, 1959, the  people  of

Singapore were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>



aware that although the present constitution was  a

big step forward in their struggle for freedom,  it

was  not  the  ultimate step in the  struggle  from

colonial  domination to freedom in unity  with  the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Second Session opened on 20th July,

1960, we  were  all reminded of  the  problems  of

Singapore's  economic  development  by   the   slow

progress  that was being made in the  talks  for  a

common market between Singapore and the Federation.

Without  economic cooperation and a  common  market

between Singapore and the Federation, there can  be

little  hope  of  a  rapid economic  expansion  and

industrialisation  that will bring  more  factories

and more jobs for the thousands of our young people

leaving our schools and seeking employment. We must

have  political  stability and  economic  expansion

before  the  talent and the skills of  our  younger

people  can  find  scope  and  expression   in   an

expanding economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Third Session begins with a promise that by

June  1963  we  shall  have established  the  basic

conditions  necessary not just for  our  peace  and

prosperity, but literally for our survival. We  are

at  the  crossroads. The main highway  leads  to  a

united,  peaceful and prosperous Malaya, and  with

the  Borneo territories joining us, to an even more

prosperous Malaysia. The other is a side-path  that

leads   to   a  dead-end,  to  chaos  and  economic

ruination. But this dead-end is favoured  by  some,

because  they are afraid to leave security  in  the

hands of a strong Central Government of the new and

larger Federation.

<br><br><i>Dramatic Developments of Last Five Months</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very few people could have anticipated the

tremendous  drama  with which the progress  towards

merger   and  independence  in  a  new  and  larger

Federation took place in the last five months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday, 27th of May, the Prime Minister of

the  Federation of Malaya opened this new phase  in

our political struggle in a speech in Singapore  in

which  he  stated, for the first time,  that  there

should be closer economic and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



political  association between  the  Federation  of

Malaya  and  Singapore, and Brunei and  the  Borneo

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A week later on National Day, 3rd of June, the

Prime  Minister  of Singapore responded  by  saying

that  if merger and independence would come  sooner

and  easier  through the Borneo sister  territories

coming   in   together  with  us   into   political

intergration with the Federation of Malaya, then we

supported it, for it would also mean that we  would

have  a larger and more powerful economic base  for

our new nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 9th June, Dr Toh Chin Chye declared that the

P.A.P.   Government  would   in   the   June   1963

constitutional  talks  seek  independence   through

merger  under conditions which would give Singapore

autonomy in education and labour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23rd August, the first meeting between the

Prime Ministers of the Federation and Singapore  on

merger  was held. A joint statement was issued.  It

was  announced that agreement had been  reached  in

principle on proposals for merger between Singapore

and  the Federation under which responsibility  for

external affairs, defence and security would be  in

the   Central  Federation  Government,  while   the

Singapore State Government would retain autonomy on

education  and labour. It was also agreed  that  "a

Working  Party  should be set up  to  go  into  the

overall  financial  and other implications  arising

out  of  arrangements whereby  local  autonomy  was

retained  by  Singapore on agreed matters,  and  to

consider the financial contribution Singapore would

be required to make to the National Government".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 14th September, after talks over three days in

Kuala  Lumpur  between the Prime Minister  and  the

Deputy  Prime Minister of the Federation of  Malaya

and the Prime Minister and the Minister for Culture

of  Singapore, a  joint statement  announced  that

agreement  had  been reached that a  Working  Party

should  "work out details of merger with a view  to

bringing   about  the  integration   of   the   two

territories and its people in or before June 1963".

It was also announced that "the two Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



Ministers were satisfied that all legitimate  local

and  special  interests of the people  in  the  two

territories could and would be safeguarded with the

merger   of   Singapore  as  a  State  within   the

Federation". Now a time-table has been set for  the

details  of  the merger to be worked out,  and  the

joint statement announced that "it was decided that

the two Prime Ministers will meet from time to time

to    review   the   work   and   decide   on   the

recommendations of the Working Party".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 30th September, after meetings lasting over

two  days, a joint statement by the Prime Ministers

of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore announced

the   official   members  of  the  Federation   and

Singapore  Working  Party.  Work  has  begun.   The

officials  have got down to the many administrative

and  financial problems that have to  be  resolved.

According  to  the words of the joint statement  of

the  Prime  Ministers,  "all legitimate  local  and

special   interests  of  the  people  in  the   two

territories can and will be safeguarded". This work

is still proceeding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 23rd October, the Working Party met in Kuala

Lumpur  to discuss many administrative problems  on

the  judicial, legal and financial implications  of

merger.   There  are  many  complex   problems   of

integration.  For  example,  after  merger  it   is

obviously desirable that there should be a  uniform

judiciary system and a uniform judiciary.  But  the

separation  of  the last 16 years  since  1945  has

created special problems and interests which may be

better  resolved if there is no outright absorption

of  the  Singapore side of the judiciary  into  the

judiciary of the new Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly with the legal service. It will take

time,  patience  and  goodwill  on  both  sides  to

resolve    all    these   judicial,    legal    and

administrative difficulties. But a firm application

of  the  basic principle of a strong and  efficient

Central  Government, with the  largest  measure  of

domestic latitude possible, will provide a solution

which is fair and just.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Civil Service in Singapore will be

happy to know that these problems of administrative

integration are to be resolved wherever possible on

the  principle  that all serving  officers  in  the

Civil  Service can remain under their present terms

and conditions of service in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, in several spheres of the Central

Government   service,  there   would   be   greater

opportunities   for  more  varied   work,   greater

responsibilities  and  more  avenues   for   higher

promotion. All officers who are prepared  to  serve

in  all  territories of the new Federation can  opt

for  Central Government service in those Ministries

which  come  under the jurisdiction of the  Central

Government. In the case of Ministries which do  not

come  under the Central Government, there  will  be

opportunities   for  secondment   for   outstanding

officers  who are needed by the Central  Government

and  who  are  prepared  to serve  in  the  Central

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, on 16th October, the Prime Minister of

the   Federation  of  Malaya  moved  a  motion   in

Parliament which sought the agreement in  principle

on  a  Federation  of Malaysia  comprising  the  11

States  of  the Federation, the States of Singapore

and Brunei, and the territories of North Borneo and

Sarawak.  En  his speech in support of the  motion,

the  Prime  Minister  of the Federation  of  Malaya

summed   up   the  proposals  for  merger   between

Singapore and the Federation of Malaya by reference

t'  Northern  Ireland  as a working  example  of  a

Federation  in  which  "Singapore  is   joined   in

partnership on a footing something like that  which

exists  between  the  United Kingdom  and  Northern

Ireland". He said, "An association of such a nature

would  recognise  the Federation of  Malaysia  with

Singapore   as   partners  in  one  identity."   He

explained  that  like Northern  Ireland,  Singapore

will  enjoy a measure of local self-government  and

will  have a legislature of its own with powers  to

deal  with  local  affairs. He  stressed  that  the

essential  feature of a constitution like  that  of

Northern  Ireland is that Singapore  will  form  an

integral part of the new



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



Federation. He went on to say that in the case  of

Northern  Ireland,  12  members  are  elected   by

Northern  Ireland direct to the Central Parliament

of  the  United Kingdom, whilst a large  range  of

legislative   and  administrative   functions   is

delegated to the Government of Northern Ireland.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, Singapore will be voting for

members  direct to the Central Parliament  of  the

new  Federation, and a large range of  legislative

and administrative functions will be delegated  to

the Singapore State Government. The Prime Minister

of  the Federation of Malaya also stated that  the

terms  of  reference of the Working Party  include

the   examination  of  the  question  of  separate

citizenship  for  the  Federation  of  Malaya  and

Singapore with a single nationality with a view to

"ensuring that such an arrangement does not render

one citizenship inferior to the other".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the debate on 18th October,

the  Prime Minister received the support  that  he

had asked for from an overwhelming majority of the

House. No one challenged the motion to a division.

According  to  news reports, the only  dissentient

voices were those of the Pan-Malayan Islamic Party

and  the  People's  Progressive  Party.  Even  the

Socialist  Front  leaders on the  Opposition  side

said  that  they supported in principle this  plan

put forward by the Federation Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the passing of this resolution, a new phase

has  opened. The representatives of the people  of

the  Federation of Malaya have now stated  clearly

they  are  prepared  to  accept  Singapore  as  an

integral part of the new Federation with Singapore

joined in partnership as partners in one identity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who do not want merger because merger means

that  security will be in the hands  of  a  strong

Central  Government will try to confuse the  issue

by  making  loud  demands for complete  merger  in

which  education and labour will be controlled  by

the  Central  Federation Government. It  is  clear

that the majority of the people in Singapore do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



not want this because of the misunderstandings and

unhappiness  that have arisen over the  conditions

for grants-in-aid to Chinese secondary schools  in

the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various other sectional interests to be

protected  on  merger. The civil servants  want  a

merger under conditions that do not mean that  the

4 : 1 ratio between the Malays and non-Malays will

apply in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese parents who want their children to go to

Chinese schools want a merger under conditions  in

which  the  present policy of equal treatment  for

all  streams  of  education and  after  graduation

equal  opportunities for employment will go on  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers want a merger under conditions that will

ensure  that the pro-labour policy and legislation

they have enjoyed will continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Businessmen, contractors and bus companies want a

merger  under  conditions in  which  priority  for

tenders  and licences will be as before,  with  no

priorities or special rights for anybody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merchants want a merger under conditions under

which our free port status and our free trade with

all  countries will continue, and under which  our

trading links with the whole world will remain  as

they have been free and easy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 350,000 Singapore citizens who were not born

in  Singapore want a merger under conditions which

will  allow  them  to keep the citizenship  rights

they   have   without   any   need   for   further

registration as citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important interest that will be

protected  in  a merger based on the principle  of

partnership  is  that Singapore citizens,  whether

born  here or born elsewhere, will keep all their

present   citizenship  rights  and,  in  addition,

acquire  national rights as nationals of  the  new

Federation.  Nobody will lose any rights.  On  the

other  hand, every citizen will gain new  national

status  as  a member of an independent and  larger

political unit.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merger will also provide new economic advantages

and  employment  opportunities for  the  people  of

Singapore.  As part of the Federation,  Singapore's

prospects for industrial expansion are immeasurably

enhanced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these interests can be protected in a merger

based  on  the  principle of partnership  like  the

Northern Ireland working model.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people will see how these interests can be

fairly and justly safeguarded in the constitutional

arrangements of the new and larger Federation. When

the  terms  and  conditions for  merger  have  been

determined, they will be presented to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people must know that these interests cannot

be  protected in a complete merger as a 12th  State

like  one  of  the other 11 States of  the  present

Federation,  for  then  automatically   all   these

matters   will   be  controlled  by   the   Central

Government  and  must follow the  pattern  of  what

happened in the 11 States of the present Federation

of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not recommend complete merger because one

of  the  most  important consequences  of  complete

merger  is  the  application of the more  stringent

citizenship laws of the Federation under which over

350,000  Singapore citizens who were not born  here

will  be  disenfranchised and will have to re-apply

for registration as citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government would also welcome all

constructive  proposals from all political  Parties

in  the  Legislative Assembly. All other interested

organisations who wish to put forward  their  views

to   ensure  that  all  legitimate  interests   are

safeguarded   are  also  invited  to  put   forward

constructive   proposals   for   fair   and    just

arrangements. These proposals can be considered  by

the Working Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst it is inevitable that public attention is

on  the major issue of merger, the other issues  of

sound  finance  and  economic progress,  of  roads,

standpipes, street-lamps, housing, clinics and  the

other day-to-day needs of the people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



must  continue  to  receive  proper  attention  for planning and fulfilment.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>FINANCE</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic and financial policies of the

Government   as  outlined  in  the   previous   two

Addresses were based on certain assumptions  as  to

the  political future of Singapore. Et was not then

foreseen that merger with the Federation of  Malaya

was  an  imminent  possibility.  The  prospect   in

1959/60  was that Singapore had, perhaps  for  some

considerable time, to manage her own affairs  as  a

unit separate from the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems facing us were immense, the

resources  at hand few. In order to accumulate  the

resources  needed for economic expansion to  absorb

our   growing  population,  it  was  necessary   to

introduce stringent measures to enable us  to  meet

the  challenge  alone.  There  were  increases   in

various  spheres of taxation. An economy  drive  to

accumulate   revenue  surpluses  necessitated   the

reduction of pay for civil servants, Ministers  and

Parliamentary Secretaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With merger now in prospect, the assumptions on

which   the  original  economic  policies  of   the

Government were based must he reviewed. As part  of

a  greater entity, Singapore can stand up better to

its economic difficulties than by tackling them  in

isolation. Hence it was possible to relax  many  of

the measures adopted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the immediate future, the task of the

Government  is  to  proceed with the  work  already

initiated. The Economic Development Board has  been

established and has been paid a contribution of $40

million.  An  industrial Research Unit  is  in  the

course   of   establishment   with   the   generous

assistance of the New Zealand Government.  It  will

provide   technical  advisory  services  to   local

industries.   Discussions   with   the   Federation

Government  on  the setting up of a  common  market

made  a  significant advance with an  agreement  to

seek  the assistance of the United Nations  in  the

appointment  of experts to examine the problem  and

recommend to both Governments measures for economic

co-operation between



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



the two territories for their mutual advantage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before, however, any significant improvement in

the  economic  and  industrial expansion  can  take

place,  there must be brought about a situation  of

political certainty and stability, within which  it

will  be  possible  for  long-term  investment   of

capital to be planned with confidence. Merger  with

the   Federation  will  provide  the   element   of

certainty.  Meanwhile, work must proceed  afoot  to

carry  out  "The Four-year Development Plan"  which

was published in the middle of this year.





<br><br><div align="center"><i>COMMUNICATIONS</i></div>



<br><br><i>Civil Aviation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To maintain the growth of Singapore as a premier

communications centre in South-East Asia,  work  is

in  progress  to extend the runway  at  Paya  Lebar

Airport from 8,000 to 9,000 feet. This project will

he completed by the end of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detailed design work is now proceeding on a New

Passenger  Terminal  Building.  Construction   will

begin   next   year, and   when   completed    in

approximately  18  months' time  will  furnish  our

Airport with a building of a high standard suitable

as one of the main gateways into South-East Asia.



<br><br><i>Marine</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore continues to maintain its position as

the  fifth  largest  port in  the  world,  and  the

largest seaport in Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the shipping figures continue to increase at

the  present rate, it is predicted that  1962  will

show   an  all-time  record  with  something   like

70,000,000  tons  of shipping entered  and  cleared

during  the  year.  This averages  over  100  ships

entering and clearing the port every day. Estimated

revenue from shipping in the form of port dues  for

the  year is $2¼ million. Administration of  the

harbour will be improved with the formation of  the

Port   Authority.  Legislation  for  the  new  Port

Authority will be introduced in this Session.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>





<i>Telecommunications</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April last year, the Government decided to

merge  the external telecommunications services  of

the  Singapore  Telecommunications Department  with

Cable  and  Wireless Limited to  form  a  statutory

board.  Discussions  on  the proposed  amalgamation

which    started    almost   immediately    between

representatives of Government and the  Company  are

now  in  an  advanced  stage.  During  the  present

Session,  a Bill will be introduced to provide  for

the   establishment   of  the  Singapore   Overseas

Telecommunications  Board which  will  acquire  the

assets of the present Telecommunications Department

and  of  the  Cable and Wireless Limited  Singapore

Branch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulatory and control functions at present

exercised by the Telecommunications Department will

be  retained  by Government and will  be  exercised

through a small regulatory bureau.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special attention will he paid to the provision

of  more public telephone call offices in the rural

and kampong areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction of the Nee Soon Exchange is well

advanced  and  when this exchange is  completed  in

1962,  it  will  serve Nee Soon Village,  Sembawang

Village,  Chong  Pang Village and  Sembawang  Hills

Estate. Plans are also afoot to provide an exchange

in the proposed industrial area at Jurong and it is

hoped that this exchange will be in service by

1963.





<br><br><div align="center"><i>PUBLIC UTILITIES</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is going ahead with plans for

increasing  electricity, gas and water supplies  to

meet our present and future needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A consultant firm of engineers has already been

appointed to study plans for the construction of  a

new  power  station. The first stage of  the  power

station will have a capacity of 60 mega watts. This

expansion scheme will not only cater for the  needs

of  our  increasing population, but will also  take

care of the needs of industrial expansion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning water supplies, the Tebrau Waterworks

in Johore has been recently



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



extended to give an increased supply of 15  million

gallons  per  day.  Furthermore, an  agreement  to

extract  water from the Scudai River in Johore  was

recently signed and the construction of the  Scudai

Waterworks  will commence at the end of this  year.

The  project is expected to take approximately  two

years  to  complete. The first phase of the  Scudai

Scheme  will  produce a further 15 million  gallons

per  day.  The  Tebrau extension  should  meet  our

ordinary   needs   until  the  Scudai   Scheme   is

completed.  At  the moment, we are experiencing  an

unprecedented drought both in Singapore and  Johore

resulting  in  the need to impose water  rationing.

Water  rationing  will  be lifted  when  the  rainy

season breaks and the reservoirs are filled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gas supplies are also being extended to new areas

and  to  public and private housing estates and  to

other  consumers.  This policy follows  from  pilot

schemes which have proved successful and which will

appreciably  bring down the cost of supply  to  the

consumer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans for the integration of water, gas and

electricity  departments into  a  Public  Utilities

Board   are  virtually  completed  and   a   Public

Utilities  Bill together with the Local  Government

Integration  Bill  will  be  introduced   in   this

Session.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>LANDS AND PLANNING</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agricultural Leases Bill and the Control of

Rent  (Amendment) Bill which were considered  by  a

Select  Committee  at  the  last  Session  of   the

Legislative  Assembly, and lapsed with prorogation.

are  being amended and will be re-introduced during

this Session.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proposals for the interim revision of the Master

Plan  are in hand. These proposals are intended  to

deal  with  the  present problems of maintaining  a

high  building  rate  to  accommodate  the  rapidly

increasing    population,   and   of   facilitating

industrial   development  which  is  essential   to

provide  employment for the population. Details  of

these   proposals   will  be   made   public.   Due

consideration will be given to representations from

interested persons whose lands are affected  before

the Master Plan is formally amended.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planning of the Jurong Industrial Estate has

been  given top priority by the Government  in  its

industrialisation programme. This industrial estate

will  be  largely self-contained and may eventually

have   a  population  in  the  region  of  300,000.

Acquisition  of land in respect of the first  phase

has been completed, and a total area of 1,380 acres

is  being  purchased by Government at an  estimated

cost of approximately $2.4 million. Construction of

the  approach  road  from the east  has  begun  and

preliminary  earthworks and surveys  in  connection

with  the  resettlement of families  affected  have

commenced.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>ROADS AND FLOOD PREVENTION</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five important link roads are now under

construction, and are expected to be completed next

year.  They  are  Commonwealth Avenue,  Outer  Ring

Road,  West  Coast to Jurong Road. Jurong  Road  to

Chua Chu Kang Road, and the Serangoon Garden Estate

to  Braddell  Road. Another important road  project

which will be started soon is the construction of a

new  West Coast Trunk Road to provide a direct link

between the Jurong Industrial Area and the City.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damage by floods is being constantly kept under

control.  Several  minor flood alleviation  schemes

are being carried out in the rural areas to prevent

damage  to  crops  and loss of livestock.  A  pilot

project is in progress at Sungei Poyan on the  West

Coast to reclaim swamp land for agricultural use or

as  fish  and  prawn  ponds.  If  this  project  is

successful, a big programme to reclaim about  4,000

acres of swamp land will be planned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ulu Pandan Drainage Scheme has been designed

to  relieve  flooding in Queenstown, Alexandra  and

Tiong  Bahru  areas;  work  on  it  is  progressing

satisfactorily.  To assist the development  of  the

Tanglin   Industrial  Area,  it  is   proposed   to

accelerate  the  completion of  this  scheme.  Next

year,  the  final  phase of the Geylang/Paya  Lebar

Scheme  involving  the construction  of  two  major

canals in the low-lying area of Geylang Serai  will

be  put in hand, and when completed, drainage  will

be  provided  for  this heavily populated  area  to

alleviate further flooding.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><div align="center"><i>HOUSING</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing and Development Board has made rapid

progress in the provision of public housing for the

lower  income  groups.  In the  20  months  of  its

existence, the Board has completed 5,594 homes.  In

the  first 9 months of this year, 3,912 homes  have

been  put up. This exceeds the highest annual total

of  3,841 homes achieved by the S.I.T. in  1958.  A

further  10,750  homes are under  construction,  of

which  3,070 will be completed before the  year  is

out,  bringing the total figure of completed  homes

for 1961 to around 7,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress towards the successful achievement of

the   Four-Year  Plan  for  housing  is   extremely

satisfactory. Most of these houses will be  in  the

Queenstown,  MacPherson Road, Kampong Tiong  Bahru,

Alexandra  Road,  St. Michael's Road,  Kallang  and

Bukit Ho Swee areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the provision of low-cost public

housing,  the  Board has been responsible  for  the

preparation of industrial sites and allocations  of

suitable  factory sites to industrialists.  Schemes

at   Redhill,   Tanglin  Halt  and  Bendemeer   are

progressing  satisfactorily,  and  new   Industrial

Estates  are  being planned to meet the  increasing

demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mention should also be made of the vital role

that the Board played in rehousing fire victims  of

the  Bukit  Ho  Swee Fire in low-cost  houses  soon

after  the outbreak of the fire on 25th May,  1961.

Quite apart from participating in relief work,  the

Board has undertaken to switch part of its Building

Programme  for this year to Bukit Ho Swee  and  has

planned  the  redevelopment of the fire  site  with

such speed that new blocks of impressive flats  are

already  rising out of the ruins. The  first  flats

will be ready for occupation early in 1962.





<br><br><div align="center"><i>HOUSING SUBSIDY</i></div>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of subsidy to the Housing and

Development  Board is under review. Subsidy  either

in an open or concealed form is practised by nearly

all  public housing authorities the world over. The

former S.I.T. received concealed subsidy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



in  the  form  of lands made by the  Government  at

terms much more favourable than what the Government

itself had to pay to borrow money. It also enjoyed

the  improvement  rate  plus  a  direct  Government

subsidy equivalent to this rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing Board has a case for subsidy because

it   performs  an  important  social   service   in

providing   housing  for  working  class  families.

Furthermore, should development take place in inner

city  areas,  the high cost of land may  well  make

rents prohibitive in the absence of a subsidy  from

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsidy to the Housing Board is necessary if

rents are to be kept within what poor families  can

pay.  It  is important that this subsidy should  be

entered  as a separate item of the Budget  so  that

the  taxpayers will know what they are contributing

to  the public housing programme. At the same time,

tenants of the Board's houses will understand  that

what  they pay to the Board is less than what  they

would  have  to  pay if economic considerations  of

profit  and  loss were to be the sole criterion  in

determining rents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction of development charges for water,

gas and electricity services has created a building

boom  in  the private sector as well. The extensive

building programme undertaken by the Board  and  by

private housing estates has rejuvenated the  entire

building  industry, raised the levels of employment

with   steady  wages  among  building  construction

workers and those connected with the supply of  all

types of building materials.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>RURAL WELFARE AND

<br>SOUTHERN ISLANDS</i></div>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work on the improvement of rural kampongs

continues.  Many standpipes are being installed  in

areas  where  pipe  water is still  not  available.

Larger  mains  are  being extended  throughout  the

rural  areas  to improve water pressure  and  water

supply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The policy of providing electricity under a

Government  aided scheme to kampongs such  as  Chai

Chee, Changi Road 6¼ m.s., and the Chua Chu Kang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



area  is  being  implemented  satisfactorily.  More

kampong  street  lights  are  being  installed   in

various   crowded  villages  in  the  Bukit   Timah,

Sembawang,  Geylang  Serai  and  Kampong  Kembangan

areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The network of agricultural roads is being

extended and maintained and some 21 new roads  have

been  added  this year. Many roads in  the  Geylang

Serai and Malay farm areas have been improved while

others  in  the Serangoon, Ponggol, Bukit  Panjang,

Changi and Chua Chu Kang areas had been made up  to

agricultural  road  standards. Many  small  bridges

serving  kampongs  have also been constructed.  The

self-help  idea  whereby  the  residents  from  the

kampongs voluntarily worked on Sundays to  make  up

their  roads with materials and equipment  supplied

by  the Government, is being encouraged. This is  a

good example of cooperation between the people  and

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assistance in various forms is being provided to

farmers  and  residents in the rural areas.  A  few

films will be made and shown to farmers in order to

teach   them  the  scientific  method   of   Animal

Husbandry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The veterinary services now rendered to the

fanning  community  in the rural  areas  are  being

extended,  and the Government will build four  more

veterinary  extension centres in the  rural  areas.

Two of them, one in Changi and the other in Yio Chu

Kang, are scheduled to be completed before the  end

of the year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An intensified programme of kampong sanitation is

being  carried out in the neighbouring  islands  by

the Health Section. Wells are being sunk and drains

constructed.  Cleansing labourers  will  assist  in

keeping the islands clean.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sembawang Settlement, which is developed by

the  Work  Brigade, is progressing  satisfactorily.

The  Work Brigade has also helped in the Government

scheme  to  assist  farmers and  fishermen  in  the

Southern Islands. In order to help to diversify and

stabilise  the  economy of  the  fishermen  in  the

Southern  Islands,  a Goat Distribution  Scheme  is

being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



implemented  after  it has been  found  that  grass

could  be  grown successfully in the  Islands.  The

Work  Brigade is continuing to clear land and plant

grass  to  assist  in  the implementation  of  this

scheme. A Work Brigade camp will be set up  in  the

Southern Islands in order to further assist in  the

development of these Islands.





<br><br><div align="center"><i>HEALTH</i></div>



<br><br><i>Tuberculosis</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vigorous action is continuing as part of

Government's  policy to eradicate  tuberculosis  in

the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mass X-Ray Case Finding Programme will be

intensified  to ensure that as large a  segment  of

the  population as possible will be X-Rayed  within

the  next  five years. To this end, a static  X-Ray

Unit  will  be established in the City and  a  full

mobile  X-Ray Unit will operate in the rural areas.

B.C.G. vaccination of new-born infants and primary

school children will be continued. Legislation  for

compulsory  B.C.G. vaccination  for  all  new-born

infants  and  all primary school children  will  be

introduced  to  ensure  total  immunisation  among

these age-groups.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bed capacity of the Tan Tock Seng Hospital

will  be  increased to absorb tuberculosis patients

newly discovered by the Mass X-Ray surveys.



<br><br><i>Hospital Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An 80-bed maternity hospital at Maxwell Road will

be  completed  next year and will provide  hospital

facilities, further increasing those now  available

in  the Kandang Kerbau Hospital, reckoned to be the

largest  in  the world. A Chronic Hospital  of  160

beds  will  be  opened  in the Woodbridge  Hospital

early  in  the new year. At the General Hospital  a

Third Medical Unit will he established to provide a

further  150 beds for medical cases. At the Thomson

Road  Hospital  a new two-storeyed  surgical  block

will be completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five polyclinics at Still Road. Queenstown. Pasir

Panjang, Chia Keng and Jurong providing general out-patient services and Maternal and Child Health



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



Services  will be built in 1962. In addition,  four

standard Out-patient Clinics at Sembawang.  Siglap,

Bukit  Timah  and Thomson Road will be built.  Four

Main  Maternal and Child Health Clinics at Kallang,

Paya   Lebar,  Tiong  Bahru  and  Kranji  will   be

completed during the next year. Four rural  midwife

centres  at  Chai  Chee, Tampines,  Thong  Hoe  and

Jurong 15 m.s. will also be completed.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>EDUCATION</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion in school building continues. By

the  end  of this year a total of 6 primary  and  2

secondary new schools will be functioning.  The  4-year Development Plan envisages the annual building

of  19  schools  of  which 7 would  be  primary,  7

secondary vocational, 2 Secondary technical  and  3

Secondary academic schools. In view of the shortage

of  suitable  sites, the majority of future  school

buildings  will  be  on  a  much  larger  scale  to

accommodate  a  bigger school population,  and  the

number of schools reduced somewhat. The integrating

of  two  language streams under the same  roof  and

under  one Principal has proved so successful  that

by the end of this year there will be no fewer than

8 primary and 2 secondary integrated schools. It is

expected that many of the new schools to be  opened

in the future will also be integrated schools.



<br><br><i>Malay Education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considerable progress has been made in the

hitherto  neglected Malay stream of  education.  In

January  this year there were no fewer  than  1,550

pupils  temporarily accommodated in various English

secondary schools. With the opening of the  Sekolah

Menengah Sang Nila Utama in Aljunied Road  on  14th

October, 1961, the first Malay secondary school has

come into existence.



<br><br><i>National Language</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government is forging ahead with plans to

intensify  the  study  of  the  National  Language.

Classes  in the National Language will continue  to

be conducted by the Teachers' Training



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



College  for  teachers and by the  Lembaga  Gerakan

Pelajaran Dewasa for members of the public.  Up  to

August this year, 7,000 candidates have sat for the

National  Language  Public Examinations  and  4,500

have obtained Standard I, II and III Certificates.



<br><br><i>Technical Education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report of the Commission of Inquiry into

Vocational   and   Technical   Education    already

presented to the Legislative Assembly will form the

basis  for  plans to modify the educational  system

from  the  present  academic to  a  vocational  and

technical  bias, so as to provide  the  State  with

trained  personnel  for  industry.  A  White  Paper

setting out Government's views will be presented to

the Legislative Assembly.



<br><br><i>University of Singapore</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequent upon the attainment of independent

status  of  the two divisions of the University  of

Malaya,  a  new  Bill  will be introduced  at  this

session   of  the  Legislative  Assembly  for   the

University of Singapore to come into existence by

1962.



<br><br><i>Nanyang University</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is as anxious as the founders of

Nanyang  University that the University  should  be

reorganised. Towards this end, a liaison  committee

comprising  representatives of the  Government  and

the  University held several meetings last year  to

discuss   ways   and  means  of  implementing   the

recommendations  made  by  the  Nanyang  University

Review  Committee. Although no agreement  has  been

reached  by the liaison committee, nonetheless  the

Government is always ready to negotiate and discuss

this matter. There are hopes that this problem will

be solved in the coming year.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>LABOUR</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Relations Ordinance, which came

into  operation on 15th September, 1960, and  under

which the Industrial Arbitration Court was set  up.

has introduced some measure of law and order in the

sphere of industrial relations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



in   Singapore.  In  the  twelve  months  of   its

existence,  the  Industrial Arbitration  Court  not

only   arbitrated  in  seven  cases  and  certified

seventy-five   agreements  between  employers   and

employees, but also successfully encouraged parties

to a dispute to return to collective bargaining. Of

the   seven   cases   arbitrated  and   seventy-two

agreements  certified  only  one  award   and   six

agreements have not as yet been implemented.  As  a

result of the awards and agreements which have been

implemented,  over  10,534  workers  have  received

increases in wages and salaries amounting to nearly

$3  million per annum, besides fringe benefits such

as  extra  leave, maternal benefits, overtime  pay.

etc. The single arbitration award together with the

six   certified  agreements  which  have  not  been

implemented  as yet cover some 10,327 workers.  The

implementation of the award and the agreements  has

been  delayed  pending certain clarifications  from

the  Industrial  Arbitration Court,  and  in  three

cases because the employers have closed down.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Arbitration Court will continue to

play  an important part in fulfilling its role that

there should be industrial peace with justice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new Employment Ordinance which will

consolidate    the   three   existing    Ordinances

pertaining to labourers, clerks and shop assistants

will   be  introduced  in  the  coming  year.   The

Ordinance  will  also  cover  other  categories  of

workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem that is always uppermost in the

deliberations  of  the  Government   is   that   of

unemployment.  This  problem  has  been   partially

alleviated  by  the present boom  in  the  building

industry  and the gradual materialisation of  plans

for industrialisation. The Government will continue

to  take  positive steps to seek  new  outlets  for

employment. Shipping lines have been encouraged  to

recruit   seamen  from  Singapore.   The   Seamen's

Registry  Board had during the one  year  from  1st

October, 1960 to 30th September, 1961, been able to

find  1,006 new jobs for our seamen. Of  these  new

jobs, some 566 new entrants without any sea service

had  been  found  employment  during  this  period.

Furthermore, training



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



courses  for  ship stewards have  been  conducted.

The  courses which started on 4th May,  1961, have

been responsible iii training 141 ship stewards  to

date,  of  whom 99 have been found employment.  The

training  of officer cadets, marine engineers,  and

wireless operators at the Polytechnic will  further

encourage  our  youths  to  look  to  the  sea  for

employment. In addition, the Government  Employment

Exchange  found jobs for over 1,400 persons  during

the last twelve months.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>CRIME</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of continued pressure against secret

society  gangsters, the incidence  arising  out  of

secret  society  activities  had  been  kept  at  a

reasonably   low   level.  Only  three   cases   of

kidnapping  for ransom were reported  so  far  this

year compared with thirteen last year. One of these

cases  occurred after the Punishment of  Kidnapping

Ordinance  was  brought  into  operation  and   the

perpetrators  have  been arrested  and  charged  in

court.  It  remains to be seen what  the  long-term

deterrent effect of this Ordinance will be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Efforts in bringing greater co-operation between

the  Police  and the people are being sustained.  A

number  of vigilante corps has already been  formed

or  is  in  the  course of formation in  the  rural

areas.  A  start  has  also  been  made  with   the

establishment of Police Cadet Corps in schools  and

this  will  be another new step in bringing  better

understanding  between and in  improving  relations

between the police and the public.



<br><br><i>Prisons</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the Prisons Inquiry Commission on

Prisons  Reforms has already been published  and  a

White Paper setting forth the Government's views on

the recommendations of the commission has also been

presented to the Legislative Assembly.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>TELEVISION</i></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major enterprise undertaken this year is

television. This medium will prove to be a valuable

ally  not  only for popular education but also  for

hastening the development of a Malayan culture  and

consciousness.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



<i>National Theatre</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Theatre is expected to be completed

by the end of 1962. When completed, it will give a

positive  and  creative impulse to Malayan  drama,

music and dancing. The public contribution towards

the  theatre  is  nearly  $750,000.  The  National

Theatre  Trust,  under whose care the  Theatre  is

placed,  is  planning a South-East Asian  Cultural

Festival to mark the opening of the theatre  early

in 1963.



<br><br><div align="center"><i>CONCLUSION</i></div>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of Federation-Singapore merger and

the question of forming a united Malaysia no doubt

are problems which are now uppermost in our minds.

They are major questions which will determine  the

destiny  of  10 million people spread over  nearly

130,000 square miles of territory. It may be  that

the   scope  and  importance  of  these  political

questions  overshadow  mundane  matters  like  the

development  plans  projected for  next  year  and

which  I  have just outlined. But in the  end,  to

what  purpose are great political decisions  taken

if  it  is not ultimately for the welfare  of  the

Therefore,  while these great political  questions

are  of current interest, we must at the same time

maintain  our sense of balance and not lose  sight

of   the   day-to-day  problems   concerning   the

livelihood  of the people. Our city  will  shrivel

without water; our industries will come to a  halt

without electrical power; the wheels of trade  and

industry  that  turn to make our  island  State  a

flourishing  economic centre must be  continuously

looked after so that they will not be slowed  down

by political friction and administrative neglect.
