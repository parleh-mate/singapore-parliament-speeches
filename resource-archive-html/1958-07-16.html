he  has  received  representations  regarding  the

unemployment problems in Singapore from the  Singapore  Trade Union Congress, and if he will make  a

statement on the policy of the Government on those representations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Dr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer to the first part is yes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second part, I have already

had   discussions  with  representatives  of   the

<div align="center"><b>DIRECTORY OF COLONY OF SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Printing of past personages)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> asked the Chief Secretary what

is  the purpose of spending money printing in  the

25th  issue  (1st June, 1958) of the Directory  of

the  Colony  of  Singapore  a  list  of  all  past

Governors,  Colonial Secretaries,  Chief  Justices

and  Attorneys-General of the Straits  Settlements

and  Singapore, and Certificates of Honours (Rules and Awards).



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. B. David:</b> Sir, the current issue of the

Directory  includes the contents of a  publication

previously  issued separately under the  title  of

"Miscellaneous  lists  and  public  bodies".   The

object  of  combining  the  two  publications  was

economy. The information to which the hon.  Member

refers    formerly   appeared   in   the    latter publication.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Does it not appear to the Hon. the Chief Secretary to be highly inappropriate?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a matter of opinion.

under  what  other  conditions, apart  from  those

specified  in  section  4  (2)  of  the   Theatres

Ordinance (Cap. 229), would permission be  granted

to  organisations  to hold roadside  "wayangs"  to

celebrate  the  forthcoming  traditional   Chinese

"Seventh Moon" Festival.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, such roadside "Wayangs" would be

<div align="center"><b>TRAVELLERS' GUIDE TO SINGAPORE, 1958</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Late Publication)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether  he  is  aware that the  booklet  entitled

Travellers'  Guide to Singapore,  1958,  published

and  distributed by the Department of  Information

Services,  was not published until  June  of  this

year;  what  are  the reasons for the  delay;  and

whether  he will take steps to see that  the  1959

Edition  is published at the beginning of January, 1959.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, advance copies of the Guide were

distributed in May. The Guide is produced for  the

Department of Information Services by an  advertising  firm free of charge. The decision to  publish

was not made until December last year and the text

was   not  ready  until  January  this  year.  The

interval  between  them and  the  distribution  of

copies  was,  I understand, due to  the  need  for

obtaining  support from advertisers  to  meet  the

cost  of  production  and with  proof-reading  and printing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions about the 1959 Edition are already

being  held  with the publishers and I  hope  that

earlier publication will be possible next year.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the Hon. the Chief

Secretary  aware  that this 1958  Edition  of  the

booklet  published  in May contained  a  diary  of

outstanding  events in Singapore from January  and

will he state what the purpose of that was?



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, I have already explained that

the  text of this volume was ready in January this

year  and  it  was  not  in  the  control  of  the

Department  as  to the actual date of  publication

because that was in the hands of the producers.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Is the Hon. the Chief Secretary aware

that  the  reply  does not convince  us  that  the

Government is encouraging the tourist industry  in

earnest  in so far as the Information Services  is concerned?



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> This publication, Sir, was produced, as I have mentioned, without cost to the Government and it was in advance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



of the arrangements that have now been  made

for  promoting tourism and that is the reason  why there was this delay.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>PROSECUTION OF STRAITS STEAMSHIP CO. LTD SEAMEN</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Attorney-General-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) whether he has authorised the prosecution

of  persons  employed by the Straits  Steamship  Co.,  Ltd., on board their ships  for

refusing to proceed to sea in pursuance  of

a strike note by their Union;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the number of such persons whose

prosecution he has authorised:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) whether a member of the Singapore Bar has

been  authorised by him to prosecute  these

seamen; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) who is paying for this prosecution.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. P. Shanks:</b> Sir, the answer to the first

part  of  this question is none. The  second  part

therefore does not arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the third and fourth parts, the position

is   that  a  member  of  the  Bar  does  hold  an

authorisation  from me to conduct certain  private

prosecutions    which   are,   I   believe,    the

prosecutions to which the question relates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no authoritative information as to who is paying for these.

<div align="center"><b>ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POSITION IN COLONY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Request for statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr John Ede</b> asked the Financial Secretary

whether  he  will make a statement on the  present

economic and financial position in the Colony.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> Sir, I have been asked to make a

statement  on the economic and financial  position

of Singapore at the present time and I welcome the

opportunity of being able to do so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, Sir, little doubt that Singapore is at

present  experiencing a recession in  trade.  There

are  on  all  sides complaints of  difficulties  in

moving  stocks, of restrictions in normal  entrepot

outlets,   of  tightness  of  money  and  difficult

trading  conditions generally. There  is,  however,

more  concrete evidence in other directions.  There

has  been  a certain contraction in the circulation

of currency and over the past two months banks have

purchased  some  $30  million  worth  of  sterling.

Customs   duty  receipts  have  fallen  below   the

estimates in some directions and are barely holding

their  own  in  others. There  has  been  a  marked

falling  off  in  the  consumption  of  liquor  and

receipts have fallen some $2,300,000 below the estimate  for the first six months of the year.  Petrol

duty  receipts have also fallen below the  estimate

by  about  half  a  million  dollars  and  although

consumption  still increases, the rate of  increase

is  considerably  below  that  of  pravious  years.

Receipts from entertainment duty are slightly ahead

of the estimate but here again the rate of increase

in  the  purchase of cinema seats is lower than  in

previous  years.  The  number  of  new  motor  cars

registered has also fallen considerably  below  the

level  for the same period last year. On the  other

hand,  the consumption of tobacco appears  to  have

gone  up but this may be due more to the successful

efforts  of  the Customs Department in  suppressing

smuggling than to any real increase in consumption.

Again,  there is an even more marked reluctance  to

pay  income tax and company tax this year than last

year  when  tardiness  also  gave  some  cause  for

concern.  All  these  facts point  clearly  to  the

existence of a recession in trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impossible to say with any certainty what

course  the  recession is likely  to  take  in  the

future. Too many imponderables are involved.  There

are indications of an improvement in conditions  in

the  United  States  of America and  elsewhere  and

there is perhaps reason to hope that the corner has

been  turned  in  these countries. There  are  also

encouraging signs in the local economy.  The  price

of the higher grades of rubber



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



has  been  maintained  and  rubber  interests  seem

confident  that  the  price of  other  grades  will

improve  as the year progresses. Statistics suggest

that   the  trade  with  Indonesia  has  been  well

maintained. There are therefore perhaps grounds for

reasonable optimism about the future. At  the  same

time,  just as the effects of the world trade reces

sion are delayed in reaching Singapore, so recovery

is  also  delayed,  although to  a  lesser  extent.

Therefore,  even if the corner has been  turned  in

the United States and elsewhere, we must expect the

present recession to be with us for some time  yet.

It  might be well into next year before the effects

are  finally thrown off. On the other hand,  events

could  quite  easily take place which might  deepen

and prolong the present recession. In the unsettled

state  of  the world today, it is difficult  to  be

certain of anything.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, Sir, it became clear that Singapore was

going  to  be affected by the general recession  in

world  trade, the Government decided to take  stock

of  its  position.  As hon. Members  are  aware,  a

considerable  proportion of the Government  revenue

is  derived  from  sources which  are  affected  to

varying  degrees by fluctuations in  trade.  Forty-five  per cent of the revenue comes from duties  on

liquor,   tobacco,  petroleum,  entertainment   and

betting.  The  yield  from  all  these  sources  is

affected  to  a  certain extent by  contraction  of

spending power which is often due to a recession in

trade.  Twenty-five per cent of the  revenue  comes

from  income  tax and company tax. The  yield  from

this  source is directly related to earnings  which

in turn are directly related to the state of trade.

In  the circumstances, it will be appreciated  that

even  a  mild  recession in trade  must  have  some

effect   on   revenue.  A  serious  and   prolonged

recession could have a corresponding effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members will recall that when presenting  the

Budget for 1958, I said that provided there was  no

marked  recession  in trade and provided  that  Government    expenditure   and    applications    for

supplementary    vote    were    kept     to     an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



absolute  minimum, revenue and expenditure  should

balance  at the end of the year. It will therefore

be  appreciated that even a slight contraction  of

revenue  could  upset  this  balance  and  that  a

serious contraction could have a serious effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.   Members  are  also  aware  that  the  very

ambitious  development plans which Government  has

in hand are financed to a considerable extent each

year by a contribution from revenue in addition to

the development fund and surplus funds. Any marked

contraction of revenue would limit the capacity of

Government to make these contributions  and  might

have serious effects on the implementation of  the

development  plans. Again in this connection,  the

implementation of these plans gathered momentum in

the  latter part of 1957. More work was  done  and

more  money was spent than was expected.  This  in

turn  meant  that  the balance of the  development

fund  carried  forward into 1958 was smaller  than

estimated  and meant that a greater proportion  of

the  surplus funds available will have to be  used

to finance development in 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, Sir, then was the background against which

the  Government took stock of its position in  the

light  of  the uncertain economic situation.  Now,

Sir,  perhaps  I  may be allowed to  explain  what

action  Government took as a result of its  stock-taking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the recurrent expenditure

position,  it seemed clear that there must  be  at

least a slight contraction of revenue in 1958.  On

the  other hand, the possibility was that it might

not be very large, and the returns for expenditure

for  the  early months of the year suggested  that

the  estimates for expenditure which were made  in

December  of last year would not be very far  out.

The  most  obvious  way  to offset  this  possible

slight   contraction  of  revenue   was   to   cut

expenditure and it was therefore decided to make a

determined  drive  to reduce  expenditure  in  the

various  departments within their portfolios.  All

vacant  posts  in  the Establishment  were  frozen until



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



Ministers had an opportunity to re-examine the need

for  them in the light of a change in the economic

position.  Proposals for special expenditure  were

treated in the same way. The recurrent expenditure

in  departments  of Government was  examined  with

great  care to see what economies could be  effected.  This examination has proved to be a long  and

laborious business and has not yet been completed.

On  the other hand, sufficient information is  now

available  to suggest that considerable  economies

can   be  effected  and  that  these  may   go   a

considerable way towards offsetting the effects of

any contraction of revenue which may take place in

1958.  In short, therefore, when the accounts  are

made  up,  it  may well be found that the  deficit

between actual revenue and expenditure in 1958  is

comparatively small.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position with regard to 1959 perhaps gives

cause  for  a  little  more  concern.  As  I  have

explained, the effect of any recession in trade on

income and company tax returns is delayed and  any

marked decrease in individual earnings and company

profit in 1958 could have a considerable effect on

revenue  from income and company tax in  1959.  It

has  not  so  far  been  possible  to  obtain  any

reliable information on these points or to  obtain

any idea of the position in the Colony as a whole.

I  can  however  assure  hon.  Members  that  this

particular  question  is engaging  the  close  and

constant  attention  of the  Government  and  that

whatever  steps  may  be  necessary  to  meet  any

situation which may develop will be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to development, as hon. Members are

aware, the Government is already heavily committed

in  respect of development plans which all Parties

are agreed are essential for the well-being of the

people  of Singapore. The implementation of  these

plans  will stretch the resources of Singapore  to

the  limit. Any shortfall of funds from any source

which  has  been  taken into account  in  planning

might   have  an  embarrassing  effect.   It   was

therefore  essential  to  consider  the   possible

consequences        of        any        shortfall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



of  contributions from revenue and contraction  of

reserves and to make sure that the Government  was

not over-committed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work in hand, Sir, at the present time will

involve  the expenditure of well over $70  million

in  1958.  This is more than has ever before  been

spent  in  one year on development and  represents

the  fulfilment  of all the Government's  planning

for  the  development  of education,  medical  and

health   facilities,  communications  and   public

housing  over  the  past three  years.  About  $24

million  will be spent by the Public Works  Depart

ment  on  capital works including the Polytechnic.

About  $22  million will be spent by the Singapore

Improvement  Trust on public housing.  $5  million

will be spent by the Singapore Telephone Board  on

telephone   development;  $4  million   on   rural

development; $7 million on the purchase  of  sites

for  schools,  etc, and on  the  resettlement  of

squatters,   and  the  balance  on   miscellaneous

special  development expenditure.  Expenditure  of

this  order by Government will go a very long  way

to  offset  the  effects of  a  recession  in  the

building  and  allied trades  and  in  many  other

directions in 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to next year, work and services now

in  hand  but uncompleted at the end of this  year

will  necessitate expenditure of about $24 million

in  1959.  Of  this  total sum, $16  million  will

represent   capital  work  by  the  Public   Works

Department.  There will also be other  unavoidable

commitments of which account must be taken.  These

commitments  will  total  a  sum  of  $30  million

including some $15 million for public housing,  $4

million  for  rural development,  $2  million  for

telecommunications  development,  and  so  on.  In

brief,  work  in  hand  at the  end  of  1958  and

additional  commitments of a general nature  which

must be added in 1959 will involve expenditure  in

that  year of the order of $55 million. This is  a

very  sizeable  sum  and  represents  a  level  of

development  expenditure  well  up  to   that   of

previous years. It will go



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



a  long  way to offset any effects of the  present

recession which may still persist in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All things considered, no serious difficulty is

anticipated in financing these programmes. At  the

same  time, until such time as the probable course

of  the recession and its possible effects on  the

revenues of the Colony are quite clear, care  will

obviously have to be taken not to enter  into  any

fresh  commitments  which  might  subsequently  be

found  to  be  embarrassing. With  this  in  mind,

Ministers  are at present examining  the  list  of

additional  items  of  public  works  which  could

possibly  be  started this year  with  a  view  to

determining  those which should be proceeded  with

forthwith  and those which are of less  importance

and  which can safely be kept back until  a  later

date.  It is hoped that this examination  will  be

completed at an early date.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while we are grateful

to  the  Hon. the  Financial  Secretary  for  his

lengthy  reply,  is he aware that there  is  grave

dissatisfaction  in  industrial  circles  at   the

failure of the Government to lay down a clear  and

unequivocal  policy of support to  local  industry

and  that  this  is  one reason for  the  economic setback?

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government, Lands and Housing if he is aware of the

representations  made by the tenants  of  Singapore

Improvement Trust houses on Jalan Teck Whye  Estate

to  the  Assistant  Minister for Local  Government,

Lands  and  Housing on 17th May, 1958,  complaining of:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) excessive heat;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) lack of secure protection of the windows;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) clogging of drains by sand and mud; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) roof leakages;



<br><br>and  if he will state what action he will take,  or has taken, in this matter.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Yes, Sir, I am aware of these

complaints.  In fact, the site was visited  by  the

Acting  Minister,  the Assistant Minister  and  the

Chairman  of  the Singapore Improvement  Trust  who

inspected  the  area and discussed  the  complaints

with  the  residents on 17th May, 1958. Action  has

been  taken by the Singapore Improvement  Trust  to

deal with (ii), (iii) and (iv). With regard to (i),

it  must  be  pointed out that the type  of  single

storey units in this estate belongs to the low cost

category.  The  Singapore  Improvement  Trust  have

omitted  ceilings from such houses as a  matter  of

policy  in  order  to keep the  rents  low  but  if

tenants  wish to install them at their own expense,

the Trust would be prepared to grant permission. In

fact,  Sir, permission has already been granted  to

all such applicants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been ascertained from scientific

experiments however that ceilings would not  reduce

the  temperature by more than two degrees. A number of shady



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



trees have already been planted in this estate  and

when they mature there will be a great improvement

in  the matter of temperature. Planting of further

trees  is  being carried out in an  effort  to  in

crease  protection from the sun  but  tenants  can

also  help  themselves  by  growing  shady  plants

outside their houses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As a matter of interest, could

the   Minister  tell  us  who  carried  out  these

scientific experiments which determine that with a

ceiling the temperature goes down by two degrees?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Naturally, not by laymen like me, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Was it in any way connected with his Ministry?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> No, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, can the Minister tell us whether it is not possible for the Singapore Improvement Trust to raise the height of the roofs

so  that there will be more ventilation for  those

houses, thus reducing the heat?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Raising the height of the roof would probably cost more than installing ceilings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have discussed this matter with several people

carefully.  I  have  been advised  that  it  seems

rather  invidious that Members of the  Legislative

Assembly  including Opposition Members  should  be

appointed  to  the  University Court  as  when  an

occasion  arises  and  an  Assemblyman  wishes  to

criticise  or query the Court, it would mean  that

the  Opposition  would in fact be  criticising  or

querying itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the other question of the future

of   the   University  and  its  division  between

Singapore  and  the  Federation  of  Malaya  which

requires looking into. In the circumstances, I propose  to deal with this question of the Assembly's

representation on the University Court at the same

time  as I will be dealing with the future of  the

University  and  its new constitution  which  will

arise  because  of the proposed  division  of  the University.

consequently  it  is  not  possible   to   prepare

comprehensive  accounts which would give  reliable

information  about the financial position  of  the

Board.  The hon. Member will appreciate  that  the

actual  cost  of the undertaking is  an  essential

basic   factor  in  the  light  of   which   other

accounting figures must be interpreted. I  do  not

think                   that                   the  Board  should  publish

accounts   from   which this  basic  factor  is omitted  as they  might be  extremely misleading.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. Member will indicate to me

what      non-financial information he  desires

about the operations of the  Board in  1956,  I

will see whether I  can get it for him from the

Board.    Under     the Ordinance however it is

not within my power  to send  back to the Board

its     Report     with instructions  that   it

should be amplified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member will note that the Report in

think    are   suitable directions to the Board

with regard to its 1957 Report. I hope  in  any

case  that  it  may  be possible  for the  1957

Report   to   give   an indication of  some  of

the  financial  aspects of  the  Board's  operations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Does the Minister for

as any shareholder of a private company  is  entitled   to,   on   the

operations of a private limited company?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I would in general agree to that

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The average length of time taken to gazette such

delay  in gazetting is due to the fact that  there

has had to be correspondence between the Registrar

smallness of the Registry staff and the  delay  in

the  printing and publishing. The post  of  Deputy

Registrar  has now been vacant for some  time  and

<div align="center"><b>DRAFT CONSTITUTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Presentation)</b></div>



<br><div align="center"><b>Statement by the Chief Minister</b></div>



<br><br>10.37 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Dr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Speaker, Sir, as stated in my reply

to  Question No. 2, I now rise to make a statement

on  the discussions that took place in London last

May  between  the  All-Party  Delegation  and  the

Colonial  Office  on the terms  of  the  Order-in-Council to give effect to the agreement reached in London  during  the Constitutional  Conference  in 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first draft was received in Singapore at

the   end  of  April.  The  All-Party  Delegation,

including  representatives  of  political  parties

represented   in  this  Assembly,   held   several

meetings  in  my  office to  discuss  this  draft.

Unanimous agreement was reached as to the line  of

action to pursue in London.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have in this House said that the success

of  the 1957 Constitutional Conference was due  to

the  unity of the All-Party Delegation. This unity

was  again displayed during the recent discussions

and  it was again due to this unity that the  All-Party  Delegation was successful in ensuring  that

the  terms of the Order-in-Council directly reflect

the agreement reached last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the discussions in London on 27th May, an agreed press communique was issued.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



This  was a lengthy one and it set out in  detail

the main points which were discussed and settled.

I  believe this communique was published in  full

in the local newspapers and this has made my task

this morning easier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The All-Party Delegation has adopted only one

principle:   to   see  that  the   Constitutional

Instruments  directly  interpret  the   agreement

reached in 1957. We asked for nothing more and we

accepted nothing less. The substance of  the  pro

visions  of  the  Constitutional Instruments  has

been  agreed  and the legal draughtsmen  of  the

Singapore  Government  and  the  United   Kingdom

Government  are now finalising and  refining  the

draft so as to state accurately the points of substance agreed upon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the subversive clause, the stand of the

All-Party Delegation was made abundantly clear in

press   reports.  For  the  purpose  of   record,

however, I quote from the press communique:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Singapore Delegation emphasised the

objection to the inclusion of a condition barring

persons  detained  in  Singapore  for  subversive

activities  from  participating  in   the   first

Assembly. The Secretary of State took note of the

Singapore  Delegation's objections but could  not

agree  that  such  a restriction  should  not  be

imposed.  He  stated that his  intention  was  to

recommend  the incorporation of this  restriction

in  a separate instrument which would in any case

be  necessary  to  provide for elections  to  the first Assembly."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a Bill creating the State of Singapore and

enabling   the   Queen  to  make  the   Singapore

(Constitution)   Order-in-Council   has   already

passed its Second Reading and it is expected that

this  Bill  will become law by the  end  of  this month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pointed out, Sir, to the All-Party

Delegation by the Colonial Office that it was not

legally and constitutionally proper for the draft

Order-in-Council to be made public until  it  has

been submitted to the Queen and this draft Order-in-Council  cannot constitutionally be  submitted

to the Queen until the Bill creating the State of

Singapore  has  become law. The All-Party  Delegation  was therefore prevented from making  public

the  draft Order-in-Council. Moreover, this draft

Order-in-Council  is  still  in  the  process  of refining. It is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



therefore most malicious on the part of irresponsible politicians in Singapore  to  accuse

the  All-Party  Delegation  of  hiding  from  the

public the terms of the Order-in-Council. The All-Party  Delegation has nothing to hide. We believe

that  we have done a good job and this fact  will

be established at the proper time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been agreed in London, Sir, that the

draft   Order-in-Council  will  be  made   public

simultaneously  in Singapore and in  London  when

the  time  comes:  this may  be  September.  Hon.

Members   in  this  House  will  then   have   an

opportunity  to  criticise  the  draft  Order-in-Council  agreed upon by the All-Party  Delegation

with the Colonial Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now that we are on the threshold of

complete  internal self-government, let  everyone

who has made Singapore his home and the object of

his   loyalty  wake  up  to  his  duty  and   his

responsibility. Do not be misguided by the  enemy

in  our  midst. Subversive forces will definitely

make  every effort to capture the prize which  we

brought  back  from London. If they  succeed,  it

will indeed be a day of sorrow for all of us  but

subversive forces can never succeed if the  loyal

citizens of Singapore unite and fight the  enemy.

Give   the  State  of  Singapore  a  strong   and

responsible  Government and these vermin  can  be

and will be exterminated.

we can have a debate or can we only ask questions

on this statement of the Chief Minister?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Hon. Members are at liberty to ask

questions but, of course, the questions must  not

develop into a debate. Questions are in order.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> May I ask the Hon. the Chief

Minister, if this State of Singapore becomes  law

by the end of July, why does he say that a debate

will  take place in September and not in  August?

What  is the reason for the delay of a debate  on

such  an important matter as the Constitution  of Singapore?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

indeed  not  surprised that the Member  for  Telok

Ayer  should  seek your guidance because,  by  the

very question he asks, he displays his ignorance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said in my statement that before any

Order-in-Council can be submitted  to  the  Queen,

the  Bill creating the State of Singapore  has  to

become  law. That Bill will get its Third Reading,

as I said, by the end of this month. The draft constitution  has  not been finally polished.  It  is

still  in  the process of polishing by  the  legal

draughtsmen  in  Singapore and in London.  Surely,

the Member for Tanjong Pagar, I mean Telok Ayer-

<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> - must have read the Report of the Constitutional Conference

held  in  London in 1957. He must have  read  this

Report many, many times. He keeps on repeating and

asking almost the same question, "When is the  new

State  of Singapore to come into being?" And  each

time  he  is referred to the agreement reached  in

London  and  told  that the new constitution  will

come   into  force  on  the  day  of  the  General

Elections   and  that  the  day  of  the   General

Elections is in the hands of this Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency

the  Governor's  permission to proceed  with  this

Bill  and  I  move, "That the Bill be now  read  a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the Quarantine and Prevention

of   Disease  Ordinance  are  explained   in   the

explanatory note and I do not propose to  deal  at

length with this. I will however observe that  the

amendments do not bring in any radical  change  to

the  Ordinance  and are largely in the  nature  of

extending  the  provisions of the Ordinance  to  a

more   effective  control  of  tuberculosis.  Hon.

Members are aware that in the Ministry, there  now

exists  a  Tuberculosis  Control  Unit  under  the

direction  of  the Assistant Director  of  Medical

Services (Tuberculosis) and the main functions  of

the  unit  are  first  to create  and  maintain  a

confidential central case register of all  persons

as  far  as  is known affected by the disease  and

next  to organise and carry out a systematic case-finding programme and to arrange for the treatment of  those needing it. The Bill gives power to  the

A.D.M.S. (TB) in respect of tuberculosis  only  in

the  same  manner  as the Ordinance  does  to  the

Health  Officer  in  respect of  other  infectious

diseases. It lays down the procedure by which medical practitioners are required to notify cases  of

tuberculosis and Schedule Al attached to the  Bill

describes  the  manner in which such  notification

should be submitted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 empowers the Minister to vary and remit

fees and to vary the Schedules to the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The systematic case-finding programme which is

now  being carried out in certain specified  areas

commenced  on  1st July under the direction  of  a

team  of  Australian  experts provided  under  the

Australian Colombo Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to state that the response by the

public has been more than heartening and I am glad

to  report  to  this House that if the  degree  of

response  now  being  experienced  continues,  the

success  of  the initial programme  is  more  than

assured.  From the information collected  by  this

project,  we  should  be able  to  take  effective

measures  to  prevent and control the disease  and

possibly in time eradicate it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. [Mr A. J. Braga].

<div align="center"><b>LIGHT DUES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.57 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fifteen months of operation of the Light

Dues  Ordinance, 1957, has disclosed the necessity

for  a number of amendments to the Ordinance which

are  contained in this Bill. All the amendments

have  been  agreed to by the Singapore Shipowners'

Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition "waters of the Colony" in section 2 of the Ordinance is deleted by

clause  2 of the Bill. This definition refers  to

territorial waters excluding the port limits. This

deletion is effected because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



the intention now, as reflected in clause  3

of the Bill, is that the light dues are to be paid

by  ships  which call at the port or place  within

the  Colony and not by ships which are in  transit

in  the waters of the Colony and which do not call

here.  The  deletion of the definition would  also

enable the Light Dues Board to expend monies  from

the  Light Dues Fund on the maintenance of  lights

and  navigational aids within the port limits  and

on  the  maintenance of the light at Pulau  Pisang

which is not within territorial waters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill, Sir, repeals and re-enacts

section 3 of the Ordinance. Subsection (1) of  the

proposed  new section 3 provides that  except  for

ships  exempted  by subsection  (2)  of  the  same

section,  light dues shall be made, as I mentioned

earlier,  by  ships calling at  the  port  in  the

course  of a voyage, for example, for bunkers  and

victuals, for the loading and unloading  of  cargo

and  for  the  embarkation and  disembarkation  of

passengers. By necessary implication, ships, which

are  in  transit in the waters of the  Colony  but

which do not call at the port, that is, do not put

in  for any of the reasons I have just enumerated,

will not be liable to pay light dues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (2) of the proposed new section 3

grants  a general exemption from payment of  light

dues to the following classes of vessels:

<pre>

  ships which put in from stress of

    weather or for the purpose of repairs

    or because of damage,

  ships belonging to Her Majesty's

    Government in the United Kingdom

    or to the Singapore Government

    or to a Commonwealth or

    foreign government if such ships

    do not carry cargo or passengers

    for freight or fares,

  ships under fifteen tons,

  fishing craft, and

  native sailing ships.

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill gives effect to the

intention  I  referred to earlier of enabling  the

Light  Dues  Board  to provide  navigational  aids

within  the port limits and at Pulau Pisang  which

is     outside     our     territorial     waters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 amends the Schedule to the Ordinance so

as  to make it possible for ships calling more than

ten times a year to be charged a comprehensive non-refundable payment of 20 cents per ton per year  at

the option of their owners, agents or masters. This

amendment  removes  an existing  anomaly  in  that,

undei the corresponding item in the Schedule as  it

now  stands, Singapore-registered ships which  make

long  overseas voyages and put in once or  twice  a

year  have  to  pay as much as Singapore-registered

ships  in  the  coastal trade  which  put  in  more

frequently, and pay even more than ships not on our

register which make the same number of calls at the

port. This Bill will not involve the Government  in

any extra expenditure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. [Mr J. M. Jumabhoy.]

"emergency  repairs in respect of damage occasioned

on the high seas".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment, Sir, is necessary to make it

clear that those ships will be exempted from paying

dues  which  come in only for emergency repairs  if

they  had suffered damage due to stress of  weather

on the high seas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill repeals and reenacts section

7 of the Singapore sailors' Institute Incorporation

Ordinance which contains provisions relating to the

constitution of the Committee of Management of  the

Singapore Sailors' Institute. The power to  appoint

members  of the Committee is at present  vested  in

the  Governor, but is now being transferred to  the

Minister  following  the  precedent  set  in  other

statutory bodies dealing with marine and seafarers'

affairs.  The  Chairman remains as  at  present  ex-officio, namely, the officer performing the  duties

of  Master  Attendant. The distinction  at  present

drawn between ex-officio and unofficial members  is

removed,  as  also is the present stipulation  that

one  of the unofficial members shall be a pilot  on

the  Register of the Pilot Board nominated by  that

Board.  Instead the Minister will appoint not  more

than  six members one of whom is to be the  nominee

of the Bishop of Singapore. It would, of course, be

open  to  the Minister to appoint persons to  stand

for  the  interests at present represented  on  the

Committee.   The   abrogation  of   the   ex-officio

appointments  obviously needs an amendment  of  the

Ordinance due to mutations in titles of offices and

changes in the duties of their holders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very simple Bill and Members of this

House  have  previously  discussed  the  principal

object  which  is  at  clause  2.  This  provision

enables  employees of Her Majesty's Government  in

the  United Kingdom to qualify for election to the

City  and District Councils providing, of  course,

that  they are otherwise eligible. In other words,

local  civilian  employees engaged  by  the  armed

services  are  eligible  to  stand  for  election.

Employees   of  the  Government  of  the   Colony,

however, continue to be debarred from standing for

local government elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment at clause 3 re-enacts a provision

in   the   Municipal  Ordinance  and  renders   it

unnecessary for deeds executed by the City Council

and  the District Councils to be attested  in  the

presence  of an advocate and solicitor as required

in   section  12  of  the  Registration  of  Deeds

Ordinance,   provided  that  the   provisions   of

subsection (1) and subsection (2) of section 36 of

the Local Government Ordinance have been followed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.10 am.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must congratulate the

Government  in realising the greatest  blunder  it

has  ever made in interpreting the law before  the

City  Council elections. Late last year, when  the

political  Parties and individuals were  preparing

for  the  City  Council  elections,  the  law  was

interpreted  in such a way that Service  employees

were then not allowed to contest them. I say this

with due respect to the Attorney General who, with

his  legal background, interpreted the law in such

a way as to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



bar   Service   employees  from   contesting   the

elections. There were many public-spirited  people

who  were prepared to come forward to contest  the

City Council elections in December last year,  but

because  of the interpretation of this  law,  they

could not do so. To quote a few, we "lost" a  very

good  public-spirited man in Mr V.  K.  Nair  who

spent 6 years in the City Council, apart from  his

other   public  services.  We  also   "lost"   Mr

Jaganathan  who was also in the City  Council  for

about  seven  years.  Had  it  not  been  for  the

interpretation of this law, I am quite  sure  that

these  two men, together with many more  from  the

three  Services,  would have  contested  the  City

Council elections. The result of their taking part

would  have been an entirely different composition

of  the City Council, and this may not have  given

the P.A.P. the big majority that it has today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an ex-employee of the Army, I welcome this

amendment  and  speak for my old  colleagues.  All

those   Service   employees  are   considered   as

employees  of  the  Crown. They are  not  treated,

exactly as what the Singapore Government employees

are  treated. Where elections are concerned,  they

are  supposed  to be treated the same;  but  where

privileges are concerned, they are not  given  the

same privileges because they do not enjoy many  of

the   benefits  which  the  Singapore'  Government

employees are enjoying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was working in the Army, there was, as

far  as I know, a provision in the civilian  staff

regulations  which provided for the nomination  or

election  of  a  Service  employee  to  the  local

government  councils. There was also  a  provision

which  allowed  the employee concerned  to  attend

meetings of the local government councils - 24 days

leave  in a year, and these 24 days could be taken

in  half-days.  If the employers themselves  allow

the  employees to contest the elections, I  cannot

see  why the Government should bar them from doing

so.   But  better  late  than  never - hence   the

introduction of this amending Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to have District Council elections very soon, and, in view of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



vague reply given by the Minister this morning,  I

hope it will happen very soon, because we have not

been  given a definite date yet. This  Bill  will

give  a chance to local people in the Services  to

come   forward   and  contest  the  elections.   I

congratuate  the Government in introducing  it  in

time  before the District Council elections and  I

support it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. [Inche Abdul Hamid.]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>11.15 a.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Dr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency's consent to proceed with this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As explained in the statement at the end of this

Bill,  this is primarily a measure to wind up  the

Indian  Immigration Fund and,  by  virtue  of  the

Indian  Government's  action terminating  the  emigration of unskilled workers from India to Malaya,

it is unnecessary to continue with the maintenance

of  this Fund. The Government of the Federation of

Malaya  has  recently enacted a similar  Ordinance

and it has been agreed that the assets of the Fund

should be disposed of in the ratio of 13 to 1. The

Singapore share is therefore one-fourteenth of the

assets,  and  this  is  based  on  the  number  of

labourers in each territory on whom assessment had

been paid to the Fund at the last operative date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>11.17 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Sir, since the publication of

this  Bill, quite a considerable number  of  South

Indian  workers  who live in my constituency  have

held  a  meeting to discuss clause 4 of the  Bill.

The meeting recommended that the Government should

set up a Board the members of which should include

representatives    of    South    Indian    labour

organisations. Several suggestions to utilise  the

Fund  in the interests of South Indian labour were

put forward at this meeting. They were:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A contribution to existing South Indian

schools and the establishment of a Tamil secondary school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The Government should offer the necessary

land  to  establish  a  home  for  the  aged   and

destitute Indian labourers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Some of the money to be used for the

repatriation of the aged and destitute who  prefer

to go back to India.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The Board should be empowered to establish a

South  Indian co-operative society, to build homes

for  sale,  the  establishment and maintenance  of

dairy  farms,  etc., and the profits derived  from

this enterprise to be utilised for welfare work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also suggested that the Board should also

be  empowered  to raise more funds  through  other

legitimate means, like concerts and shows, etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do hope that the Minister will give

consideration  to  the  suggestions  made  by   my

constituents  and  that the  South  Indian  labour

organisations  will  be consulted  on  the  future

administration of the Fund.



<br><br>11.19 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this matter has come before the previous Councils.

This money which has been collected and kept as  a

fund  was for the welfare of the labourers.  These

labourers  have  contributed  a  great   deal   in

establishing  the  Malaya - especially  its   rubber

plantations - of today. Since this Fund  belongs  to

the Labourers, the money in it should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



devoted  to  their  welfare  and  spent  on  their

repatriation.  No  assurance  has,  however,  been

given by the Government in this respect. Clause  4

reads in part:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...in such manner as the Governor shall direct."



<br><br>Sir, I wish to stress again that this Fund belongs

to  these  people  and should be  spent  on  their welfare only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question which I would like to ask is: As this Fund is to be divided in the ratio of 13 to 1, what is the amount Singapore is going to get?



<br><br>11.20 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Lim, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Yes, Sir. Mr

Speaker, Sir, in the administration of this  Fund,

my  Ministry  will  take full note  of  the  views

expressed by the hon. Member for Seletar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assets that will come to this Fund will be

disposed  of  for the benefit of Indian  labourers

region of half a million dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>11.22 a.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 3 inclusive ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 4 stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I will read part of clause 4:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...balance of the assets of the Fund remaining after payment..."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said during the Second Reading of the Bill,

Sir,  this  matter has been brought up before  the

previous Councils. An attempt was made to  mix  up this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>





Fund  with  the Silver Jubilee Fund or some  other

Fund. My suggestion is that, whatever our share of

the  money will be, as the money is for a specific

purpose, it should be deposited as a separate fund

for  a special purpose and should not be mixed  up

with any other welfare fund.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I am again indeed

surprised that the hon. Member for Telok Ayer  is

still  so dense in spite of the explanation  that

I  have  given  during  the Second  Reading-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I think I must rule out the word "dense".

<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> I am sorry, Sir. I withdraw the word. Sir, the hon. Member is so

thick-headed  as  to ignore the explanation  that

has  been  given-

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I suppose this

sitting is full of surprises, but I did not  think

the  Chief  Minister  would  be  guilty  of  these

surprises.    "Thick-headed"   is    equally    as

unparliamentary as "dense".



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> I withdraw the word "thick-headed", Sir, I am afraid the hon. Member for

Telok  Ayer  has great difficulty in understanding

simple  English when I said that the Fund will  be

administered  for  the benefit  of  the  labourers concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, English is not my mother

tongue. It may be the Chief Minister's, I  do  not

know,  but  I  cannot  understand  why  the  Chief

Minister this morning is so irritable.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Now we are debating

tempers. We are still on clause 4 of the Bill.  If

the hon. Member wishes to say anything further  on

this  clause,  he may do so, but anything  else  I

think                is                irrelevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> That is what I am coming to, Sir.

I was making a passing reference to his remark. As

I  said,  Sir,  this  money  belongs  to  specific

people.  I  also  said that this matter  has  been

brought up before the previous Councils, and  that

an  attempt was made to mix up this Fund with  the

Silver  Jubilee Fund. What I wish to  say  now  is

this - that this Fund should not be mixed up with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



any other Fund. I cannot understand why the Chief

Minister cannot understand.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill has

never  come before any previous Councils.  I  have

been  a  Member  of the Legislative Council  since

1948, and so has the hon. Member for Telok Ayer. I

think  what he meant to imply was that  this  Bill

was  considered by the Executive Council of  which

he was a Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have already given an assurance that this

Fund will be used for the benefit of the labourers

concerned, and that in the administration of  this

Fund,  in reply to the hon. Member for Seletar,  a

Board of Trustees may be appointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the last sentence in the Explanatory

Statement has been there ever since the  Bill  was

presented  to  this  Assembly.  Perhaps  the  hon.

Member  for  Telok Ayer had not enough  energy  to

read  up  to and including the last sentence.  Perhaps he stopped at the penultimate sentence of the

Explanatory Statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 7-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the sum of $325,000 for Head 7 stand part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we get presented with these

special messages for money so often that one  soon

becomes indifferent, to what appears in them.  But

Head 7 is a curious message indeed, for the sum of

$325,000,  and it appears under Chief Minister - New

Subhead - Rural  Development.  Since  when  has  the

Chief Minister's Ministry undertaken this business

of  rural  development?  We  understood  from  the

working  of  the  Rendel  Constitution  that   his

colleague, the Member for Ulu Bedok, the  Minister

for  Local Government, Lands and Housing,  is  the

man  in  charge  of  local  government  and  rural

development.   At  this  late   hour,   when   the

Government is being hard pressed to answer when we

are  going to have the District Council elections,

we  have  the  vote  of $325,000  for  the  Labour

Front's District Council elections fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not really concerned with the indirect

slight which the Labour Front have administered to

the  Deputy  Chief Minister. They  must  obviously

have   considered  him  inept  and  incapable   of

administering this fund to the full  advantage  of

the Labour Front, and so he has to allow the Chief

Minister to take over rural development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Financial Secretary said that full

explanations have been given and it is interesting

to note what the full explanation for this subhead

is. It says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is proposed to establish a Rural Development

Fund under the control of the Chief Minister"-



<br><br>not  the  Financial Secretary, and not the  Deputy

Chief   Minister  who  is  in  charge   of   local government-



<br><br>"and,  in the first instance, to make the  sum  of

$325,000  available for rural development projects

which  will  enable farmers to take  advantage  of

modern  methods  to  improve  their  standards  of

production, and to make the best possible  use  of their land."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



A highly laudable project which should receive the

tumultuous  support of all Members of this  House.

The explanation goes on to say:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These moneys are intended to be spent on rural

credit  schemes, minor development projects,  such

as  the conversion of waste into animal foods, the

construction of district incubator units, improved

pigsties,  chicken  houses,  etc.,  ploughing  and

fertilization  projects, improvement  of  drainage

methods,  the  processing  and  storage  of   farm

produce, and so forth, publicity, and minor works"



<br><br>and  every  other  conceivable manner  of  getting

votes  in the District Council elections.  Let  us

see  what an English-language newspaper said about

this - this is after an interview with a Government

spokesman.  The  knowledgeable  reporter,  in   an

article published the day before yesterday, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Farmers associations in the Yio Chu Kang,

Changi, Amah Keng and Upper Serangoon areas"--



<br><br>with which the Assistant Minister to the Chief

Secretary is, I think, closely associated - with the

coming of the elections he is taking a great

interest in rural matters and votes-



<br><br>"hope that the Government will also assist them to

stay  away  from moneylenders and middlemen,  who,

they  said, deprived them of the benefits of their

hard work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Association officials, farmers are

deep in debt and a major part of their income goes

towards paying interest to moneylenders."



<br><br>Therefore, with the assistance of this fund,  they

will  not  be paying interest to moneylenders  but

they  will be paying in votes to those people  who

patronise  farmers' associations  with  government funds.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the hon. Member please identify the newspaper?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The paper is the Free Press,

issue  14th  July,  1958. Sir,  it  is  considered

legitimate  business of Government to ensure  that

it  will have the continued support of the people.

But  such a blatant attempt at this late  hour  to

take  $325,000  and  put  it  under  the  personal

supervision and disposal of the Chief Minister who

has personally come out now to conduct the Kallang

by-election  -[Interruption.]  to  retrieve  the

fortunes - No, no, I hope it does



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



not hurt him at the end of it all. But to have the

impertinence  to come here and say  we  should  at

this  juncture give him $325,000 to get  votes  in

the  District Council elections is scandalous,  to

say  the least of it, and I ask the House to  vote

against this subhead.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I allowed the word "impertinence", but I think I must disallow the

word "scandalous".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I will withdraw it, Sir, I

will  say  that  this  must  give  rise  to  great

indignation in all right-thinking men.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Sir, it would appear that

the  Kallang by-election is being fought  in  this

Assembly this morning! However, as the Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar has seen fit to throw his challenge

at  me  on  a matter which is in the interests  of

rural dwellers, I will take it up. He has admitted

that  it is a good thing that there should be this

development  in  the  rural  areas.  What  he  has

criticised is that this fund should be created  at

this  time  and that it should be administered  by

the  Chief  Minister. Sir, rural  development  has

been  in  the minds of my colleagues the  Minister

for  Commerce  and Industry and the  Minister  for

Local  Government, Lands and Housing  for  a  long time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Three and a half years.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It has been rather uphill

work,  in view of the difficulties which were  put

in  the way of the elected Government - difficulties

which prevented us from carrying out the plans  we

have  in  our four-year programme. Before we  left

for  London,  this  House  gave  approval  to  the

appointment  of  a Rural Development  Commissioner

with some field officers and other members of  his

staff.  Surely it is not expected that  we  should

appoint  this  Rural Development Commissioner  and

his staff and tell them to sit in their office and

do  nothing because there is no money for them  to

do what they are intended to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that the fund is to be administered by

the  Chief  Minister  is because  of  difficulties encountered under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



the Rendel Constitution. If this Rural Development

Commission were to be attached to the Ministry  of

Local  Government, Lands and Housing,  or  to  the

Ministry  of  Commerce  and  Industry,  it   would

encounter  difficulties from other departments  in

the  way  of  giving priority to whatever  project

this Rural Development Commission feels should  be

carried  out. If it is entrusted to the Chief  Minister,  he  can issue a directive - and he  will  so

issue  a directive - that any priority work demanded

or  required by this Rural Development  Commission

should be carried out without any hindrance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member is feeling rather worried and

accuses  us  by  saying that this  move  is  vote-catching. The Government does not-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Vote buying, not vote catching.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It is suggested that the

help that the Government is extending to the rural

dwellers is vote buying. What this Government does

is in the hon. Member's mind vote buying; but what

the  P.A.P. does  in the City Council  has - so  he

describes -  appealed to the masses and is wanted  by

the  masses. This  poor  Labour  Front  Coalition

Government does not know what the masses want. Now

when  we  try to show them that we know what  the

masses want and that we want to give to the masses

what  they  want, he has the impertinence  to  say

that this is vote buying.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I do not know if the Chief

Minister  is responsible for his impromptu  speech

as  I know he has not got his set one. But if  he

were in his usual state of composure, he would,  I

think,  think twice before he admits  that  he  is

really in earnest, asking for $325,000 in order to

get the masses over to him in the District Council elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a distinction between the Government and a public authority like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



the  City Council consciously pursuing a programme

at  public expense to win over the support of  the

majority of the population. There is a distinction

between  that and this belated attempt of a  block

vote  of $325,000, taken specially into his  jurisdiction, to spend in some priority which  he  will

decide,  for the now admitted purpose  of  winning

over  the  support of the masses - not in  the  City

Council,  because that is a waste  of  time;  that

will  not come up in another two years - but in  the

District  Council  elections. The  answer  to  the

Member for Queenstown, if he really wants to  know

when the District Council elections are going  to

be  held, is that they will be held as soon as the

Government feels that having spent this money - this

bribe of $325,000 - it can reasonably anticipate a fair proportion of the voters voting for it.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Sir, I am sorry that the Member for

Tanjong Pagar is misinterpreting this move by  the

Government  to assist the rural dwellers.  I  cait

truthfully and honestly tell him that it is  about

two  years  since I have been trying to  help  the

rural   dwellers  because  most  of  the   matters

affecting   them   come  within  my   Ministry - the

Agricultural     Department,    the     Veterinary

Department,  the Co-operatives Department  and  so

on.  I have all along felt that, in order that the

small farmer can stand on his own legs, a fund has

to  be  created - either by the creation of a  rural

bank  or  some  other method  whereby  he  can  be

advanced such money as is necessary for him to get

away  from the influence and clutches of  the  middleman, and if I had my way, this would have  come

up two years ago. However, there are priorities in

the  spending of public funds, and as hon. Members

I  think know full well, when the Budget comes  up

there  is only a limited amount of money available

and  it  is a matter of fixing priorities. I  have

not  been successful in getting priority for  this

project, otherwise I could have-

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Until the District Council elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> No, it is not so, Sir, If

the hon. Member remembers, His Excellency's Speech

at  the  opening of this Session of  the  Assembly

contained  a  statement of Government  policy  for

this  year that a Rural Development Panel will  be

set  up  under  the Chief Minister's Ministry  and

this is an execution of the announcement of policy

made at that time. In fact, it was as a result  of

pressure exerted by me that this has been  set  up

under the Chief Minister's Ministry. The reason is

that    rural   development   concerns   so   many

Ministries - it concerns mostly my Ministry; it also

concerns  the Ministry of Local Government,  Lands

and  Housing;  it  also concerns the  Ministry  of

Communications and Works when rural roads  are  to

be built; it also concerns the Ministry of Finance

because finance is involved to a great extent - and

it   will  not  be  possible,  under  the  present

administrative machinery, for one Minister to  try

and  expedite any project which concerns  so  many

Ministries  because  it  has  to  go  through  the

administrative  channels. If the hon.  Member  has

read  the  newspapers, Sir, I did  in  fact  in  a

speech  made  in the Rotary Club in  January  this

year  point  out  that one of the  dangers  facing

Singapore is that the administrative machinery  of

the Government might not be capable of working  to

a  point  of absorbing the dynamism of an  elected

Government.  I  cannot say it  more  clearly  than

that.  It  means that the administrative machinery

has  its  methods and so on which are  subject  to

delays,  and co-ordination is difficult to achieve

between  one Minister and another especially  when

the matter concerns three other Ministries. It has

to go through these channels. I am saying all this

frankly, Sir, because the hon. Member has sort  of

alleged that the Chief Minister has got this money

as  a  bribe to buy votes from the rural dwellers.

That is not so, I can truthfully and honestly say.

I  said  that the only way to achieve any progress

in  rural development is for the Chief Minister to take



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



it  up  himself and set himself up as  a  dictator

over  the other Ministers and say, "This  must  be

done,  and  that  must be done." It  might  be  an

admission   of  administrative  difficulty - it   is

so - but  I  was  anxious that  the  Chief  Minister

should  take  it  over so that  rural  development

could proceed at a quicker pace. That is the  real

reason  why  this vote of $325,000  is  under  the

Chief  Minister. In fact, it was announced in  His

Excellency's  speech  at  the  opening   of   this Session.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Minister for Commerce and

Industry  enumerated  the  Ministries  which  were

normally   involved  in  or  connected   with   or

consulted on rural development. I think I am right

in  quoting him as saying that they were  his  own

Ministry - the Ministry of Commerce and Industry - the

Ministry  of Local Government, Lands and  Housing,

the  Ministry of Communications and Works, and the

Ministry of Finance - four eminent Ministries,  but

not  including the Ministry of Labour or the Chief

Minister's  Ministry. Am I right - that this  matter

does  not  concern  the  Ministry  of  Labour  and

Welfare,  because it does not come under  it,  nor

does it come under the portfolio of the Chief Minister?   Would  the  Minister  just  confirm  this,

because I may have misheard him?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, I mentioned four

Ministries - they are directly concerned. The  other

Ministries are also indirectly concerned.  Welfare

is somethng which concerns everyone in the island.

Even  education  is concerned  when  it  comes  to

educating  the rural folks in fishing methods  and

so on. We have plans that schools in the rural area

should  teach fishing and other rural pursuits  to

the students there. Therefore other Ministries are

concerned,  but  these  four  Ministries - those  of

Local  Government,  Lands and  Housing,  Communications  and Works, Finance, and my own Ministry - are

directly concerned. But as I said, Sir, the  Chief

Minister  has been brought in because  he  is  the Chief Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Sir, I think the allegations

made  by  the  hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar  are

quite unjustified. He first said that the idea  of

rural   development  projects  which  will  enable

farmers  to  take advantage of modern  methods  to

improve  their standards of production was  indeed

laudable; but when he ended his speech,  he  urged

Members  to vote against the $325,000 provided  in

this  vote. Sir, he might be right if we  on  this

side  have indulged in empty propaganda.  On  this

rural  development authority, we sincerely believe

that  it would be better to go ahead with a  well-planned  machine rather than shout our  heads  off

before the actual event took place. Sir, if we had

said  that this rural development plan had been  a

dream  of the Chief Minister, or that he had vowed

to  see  the  establishment of this authority  two

years ago, then probably it would be said that  it

is a publicity thing - just as what the Mayor of the

City  Council said yesterday morning that when  he

went  to see the floods at Braddell Road two years

ago,  he  promised the people there that he  would

surely  give them a mobile dispensary. We  do  not

for  a moment believe in fantasy or in unnecessary

publicity.  We  do  not even spend  any  money  on

banners, like the anti-spitting campaign which has

been  launched by the City Council. Our  intention

is  not to spend money unnecessarily, but to spend

it on necessary projects which will achieve better

results for the people. It is quite justified  for

allegations  to  be made if we  have  spent  money

unnecessarily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar is probably

quite  worried  now because he has said  that  the

Government  is  undertaking a project  which  will

benefit a large number of rural people. I hope and

believe that if he has the interests of the  rural

people  at  heart, he will give unstinted  support

for  this  project  and for all others  which  the

Government  undertakes in  the  interests  of  the

people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I was waiting for some valuable information which I thought the Assistant Minister would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



provide us. Is he or is he not connected with  the

Yio   Chu   Kang   peasants  or   rural   dwellers

association  which, according to the  Free  Press,

hopes to get interest-free loans?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, it was in 1952 when I took a

direct and keen interest in the establishment of a

rural development authority. I had filed more than

six  questions to the then Colonial  Secretary  to

ascertain from him what the Government policy  was

at  that  time  in regard to rural development.  I

must  tell the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar  that

in  my manifesto as an Independent candidate,  one

of  my promises to the people was that I would try

my  best to see that a rural development authority

was  established  for the proper and  well-planned

development of the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not only concerned with individual

farmers   and   I   am  not  concerned   with   my

constituency alone. This is not a matter affecting

any  part of anybody's constituency. This  project

will  benefit  about 400,000 people  who  are  now

undergoing   considerable  hardships  of   various

types. Hitherto all the departments interested  in

rural welfare have not been co-ordinated and, as a

result,  there have been no well-planned  projects

in the rural areas. Sir, I wish to say this - that I

am   not  taking  this  matter  as  affecting   my

constituency alone.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, the Hon. the Assistant

Minister  to  the Chief Secretary  has  still  not

provided  me  with  the information  which  I  was

trying to elicit from him.



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Sir, the association with which I am

connected   is  the  Singapore  Country   People's

Association.  It has 2,500 members and  they  come

[Copy  handed  to Mr Speaker; with Mr  Speaker's

permission,       copies      distributed       to  Members].



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  will  recall  that,  in  spite  of

strong  opposition from the Nature  Reserve  Board

and  others  interested in preserving  the  nature

reserve, I successfully moved in this House on 4th

December, 1957, a resolution to amend the Schedule

to  the  Nature Reserves Ordinance, the effect  of

which was to reduce the acreage of the area of the

Ulu  Pandan Nature Reserve from 1,374 acres to 371

acres, thereby confirming the release of about 150

acres then covered by prawn ponds and releasing  a

further 853 acres for development as prawn ponds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude, Sir, of those interested in

preserving  the nature reserve at  that  time  was

such that they were not prepared to concede even a

small  portion of the nature reserve for  purposes

of  prawn  ponds. They were not prepared  to  talk

terms  with  me in order to arrive at a reasonable

solution  which  might  be  beneficial   to   both

interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after this House approved my motion in

December  and gave me the authority to  release  a

big  portion of the thu Pandan Nature Reserve, the

more   reasonable  elements  of  those  objecting,

realising that there was no other way, came to see

me with a reasonable proposal which would preserve

the interests of the nature lovers at the cost  of

reducing,  by a small portion, the released  area,

and  by  extending  and regrouping  the  remaining

portions of the nature reserve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new proposals, Sir, in effect mean the

extension  of  two pieces of swamp reserves  which

are  marked  on  this  sketch  as  A  and  B  (the

extensions would be in the direction of D  and  E)

and  thereby  enlarging the nature reserve  as  at

present  defined by approximately 171 acres.  Hon.

Members  will  notice that there  is  an  area  of

reserve marked C on the sketch plan which will  be

deleted now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give you the exact figures, Sir, it is now

proposed to excise, instead of the previous  1,003

acres,  only  832  acres from  the  Pandan  Nature

Reserve,  leaving  a total of  542  acres  in  the

reserve, a net increase to the reserve of from





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



371 to 542 acres, namely, 171 acres. This

extension of the nature reserve by 171 acres would

provide for (a) better administration of the  area

under the control of the Nature Reserve Board; (b)

a   fairly  full  range  of  mangrove  animals  to

maintain  themselves;  (c) self-perpetuation  of

mature  mangrove vegetation; (d) a full  range  of

important  mangrove plants; (e) the  retention  of

type localities of many species first described as

new  to science from specimens obtained there; and

(f)  easier access for those interested in  nature study.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore feel, Sir, that this is a very fair

proposition and commend it to hon. Members. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> I second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.38 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker,. Sir, when the Hon. Minister for Commerce and

Industry  introduced a motion in this  House  last

December  to reduce the Pandan Nature  Reserve  to

three areas, of 236, 90 and 45 acres respectively,

I  pointed out very serious objections to - what  he

was  doing. Not only was he destroying a  valuable

nature reserve for no purpose, but he was in  fact

endangering  the future of the prawn  industry  in

that  area by this destruction, the industry which

we  ourselves wish to see developed. His reply  to

the  House  on  the scientific arguments  which  I

propounded was as follows - and I quote from  column

2880  of Volume 2, No. 40, of the Official  Report

dated 4th December, 1957:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... I must assure this House specifically that

all these arguments which the hon.

Member  for  Tanglin has put up have already  been

put  up  to  the Ministry by the Chairman  of  the

Nature Reserve Board, with supporting evidence  as

put  forward by the Member from the various  other

professors    and   people   of   high    academic

qualifications, and they have been  considered  by

the  Ministry. The Ministry feels that, as far  as

fisheries   is  concerned,  it  is  its  Fisheries

Officer  who  is best qualified to  speak  on  the

subject and who should know his job."



<br><br>Now  I had good reason to believe that neither the

Minister  nor the Fisheries Officer had  in  fact

met            the           experts            on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



the subject round the table, and at the conclusion

of  my speech on the same day I made this point - in

column 2865:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My own belief is this: that if all the experts

on  the subject in the country got round one table

to go into this matter and pool their knowledge - as

should  have been done before - it would  be  found.

firstly, that the area of land alienated for prawn

ponds  could be increased beyond the present area;

secondly, that a sufficient but different area  of

mangrove  could be retained at the  Pandan  Forest

Reserve as a feeding area for prawns and as a self-propagating area for biological study; and thirdly

and finally, the proper balance of nature could be

achieved. That would be the best possible  result,

while  at present the Government may get the worst

of both worlds."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I am not going to flatter myself that

the  Minister  accepted what I  had  to  say,  but

enough  attention was drawn to the matter for  him

to decide to reconsider the position. I believe  a

meeting of experts was arranged - I was not present

but   the  Minister  has  told  us  roughly  what

transpired - but the final outcome has been that the

Minister has been broad-minded enough and flexible

enough  to  come  forward with a  modified  scheme

which  will leave intact two areas of 356 and  186

acres  of  - undisturbed mangrove in precisely  the

right position from everybody's point of view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happy result then is as I had hoped. There

will  now be a sufficient area of mangrove for  it

to  be self-propagating and to yield its botanical

and  biological  riches, and, at  the  same  time,

experiments  can  be  made to increase  the  prawn

catch  without  too  much risk.  Also,  the  Malay

fishermen can continue to earn a living by fishing

down the river with the undisturbed mangrove still there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the Government on thinking again

and    modifying    its   previously    apparently

intractable attitude, and we are glad  now  to  be

able to support this motion.



<br><br>2.42 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, it is true that the

hon.  Member  in  the  debate  in  this  House  in

December  pointed out, as he had  said,  that  the

Government was destroying  valuable areas of nature reserve  and

endangering  prawn production. I did  assure  that all the arguments



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>

put up by the Chairman of the Nature

Reserve   Board  were  considered.  However,   the

arguments  that  were put up to me  at  that  time

were: `All or none'- `We want the whole reserve to

be  preserved'.  None of them was sane  enough  to

come  to me and say, `Look, we realise that  prawn

pond  cultivation  is of vital importance  to  the

economy of Singapore - that  it  is  going  to  expand  the  economy - and

therefore we propose that this and this  and  this

compromise   should   take  place,   whereby   the

interests of the nature reserve could be preserved

and also that a certain area could be released for

prawn ponds'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their attitude was very obstinate and I, as a

Minister  responsible to the people of  Singapore,

governing   for  the  benefit  of   the   majority

interests  of Singapore, would not be  blackmailed

by   small  groups  into  making  decisions  which

benefit only small groups. And therefore when they

were  not  willing to play ball with me,  I  said,

`Right, I go ahead.' If they had come - and  I  must

thank  Professor  Oppenheim  who,  after  this  resolution had been adopted, a few months later  met

me and said, `Look, there can be a compromise';  I

said, "Is that so?" He said, "Of course there  can

be."  I said, "Why didn't the Nature Reserve Board

people  tell  me that there could be a compromise.

If  there  was,  as a reasonable man  I  would  be

willing  to  come  to  a compromise  whereby  both

interests would be preserved."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is no need for obstinacy, Sir. When I

saw  the proposals were reasonable, I said, `I  am

governing in the interests of the country at large

and  if I can bring both interests together I will

certainly  do  so,  and  I  will  not   stand   on

obstinacy.' And that is why I brought this  motion

to the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (1) of

<div align="center"><b>REPORT OF COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO CORRUPT,</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ILLEGAL OR UNDESIRABLE PRACTICES AT ELECTIONS</b></div>



<br><br>2.45 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

speak  on the motion which stands in my  name.   It reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House notes with regret that the

Commission  of Inquiry into Corrupt, Illegal  or

Undesirable Practices at Elections had made  its

report  (Sessional Paper No.  Cmd.  7  of  1958)

without  giving to some of the persons,  against

whom  allegations  were  made  in  secret,   the

opportunity  to  know of such  evidence  and  to

cross-examine  such witnesses  and  to  confront

them with contrary evidence; and that this House

urges the Government to take action against  the

persons  whom  the report says the  Police  have

reliable evidence of their having solicited  and

paid  for  the assistance of gangsters in  their elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the elections which were the

subject of these investigations - the  two  by-elections - took place more  than  a

year  ago. The report has been with Members  for

more than two and a half months. I hope that, as

a   result   of   this   report,   despite   its

shortcomings,  we  will be able  to  benefit  by

making the necessary adjustments to our election

laws,  not  just with the purpose of  trying  to

counter  another Party, but of  trying  to  make

sure  that  the  electoral machinery  will  work

fairly and efficiently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the advantage this morning of scanning

the Bill to amend the Local Government Elections

Ordinance which was tabled for First Reading  by

the  Minister  for Local Government,  Lands  and

Housing, and my impression is that whilst it did

very  wisely  adopt some of the  recommendations

contained in this report



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member is out of order in referring to a Bill which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



will  come  up  eventually to this Assembly  for

consideration; it is anticipating.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> As you please, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  Without referring to that Bill, may  I  be

permitted  to  make this remark? If  it  is  the

purpose  of  the Government not only  to  embody

some  of  the recommendations which this  report

has  made, but at the same time to introduce new

conditions and propositions with the purpose  of

crippling Opposition political Parties,  because

it is believed that the nature of the support of

Opposition  political Parties may be  such  that

certain  conditions  if introduced  would  block

that  support,  then the whole purpose  of  this

Commission would be defeated. We would be thrown

into  the  arena  of party politics  instead  of

trying,  sensibly, to work out  a  system  which

will work for all time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the report, Sir, time has also

flowed  since the Commission was first appointed

and I can only say it is a matter of regret that

one  of the Members of the Commission has  since

got into some prominence and has said, in what I

think must be the classic under-statement of all

time, that he is not an angel. I do recommend to

the  Government, if in the future they  have  to

appoint  more  commissions of this nature,  that

they   should   try   to  appoint   persons   of

unimpeachable character and reputation, and  not

those  who are likely to have to declaim in  the

witness-box that they are no angels.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hate to pull the hon.

Member  up but the hon. Member I think is  aware

of  the section in the Ordinance which prohibits

any  disrespect being paid to any members  of  a

commission whether they are sitting or have  sat

in  the  past.  Of  course the  hon.  Member  is

protected  by privilege but I do urge  that,  in

matters  of this nature, the hon. Member  should

take great care not to say something which might

redound  to  the discredit of a  member  of  the

public who is not here to defend himself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Indeed, Sir, I was extremely

careful  to  make sure that I quoted  the  words

right.   I  think  it  was  blazoned  in  banner

headlines                 that                 a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



Member  of this Commission had said in court  that

he  is  no  angel. What I urge the  Government  in

future to do is to make sure that it does not  get

involved  with  people  who subsequently  have  to

declaim  that  they are not angels; not  that  all

members  of commissions should be angels,  but  at

least  they should not be put in a position  where

they have to deny that they are angels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the report is not all that we would have

expected  and  in fact I shall take  my  criticism

first.  On  two  persons there  has  been,  in  my

opinion, gentle whitewashing. In the first place I

refer to the finding about certain allegations  re

garding  Mr Brash which is reported in  pages  21

and  22  of  the  report. Now, Sir,  this  was  an

article published by "Cynicus". It is referred  to

in  paragraph 48 of the report and on page  22  in

the  finding. Just to refresh the memory  of  hon.

Members  in  this House, I will read  the  excerpt again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At a bye-election campaign luncheon in

Singapore which will not figure on the candidate's

expense  sheet, the talk turned to  the  value  of

public meetings and a candidate's speeches.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Don't bother about meetings and speeches", said

the   candidate's   adviser.  "They'll   get   you nowhere."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know", said the candidate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Get the secret society boys out", said the adviser. "They'll do it."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I know", said the candidate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody at the lunch heard it. Everybody would

deny it if names were mentioned. Or they might say

it  was all a joke. But it wasn't a joke, and  the

secret society boys have been called out."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finding is as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The person who was referred to as `the

candidate's  adviser' was  Mr  M.  B.  Brash,  an

Advocate and Solicitor, who is a member of several

committees of the Liberal-Socialist Party. We  are

satisfied he was not an adviser to either  of  the

candidates or to the Liberal-Socialist Party,  Mr

Brash  who appeared before us, gave us his account

of  the conversation, which was to the effect that

while  discussing with a journalist seated  beside

him,  the  value of public meetings in an election

campaign,  he had expressed the view  that  public

meetings  had proved to be of little value  during

his  own  election campaign in 1955, and that  the

intervention  of  secret  societies  had  been  an

important  factor  in that election;  and  he  had

proceeded to develop this theme with a description

of  what  had  occurred in the 1955 Elections.  We accept his account



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



of  the conversation. The fact that secret society

members   did  intervene  in  the  Bye-   Election

activity   has,  in  our  opinion,  no  connection

whatsoever   with   the   conversation   at   that

luncheon."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this witness went into the witness-box

and  admitted  on  oath that  he  had  spent  over

$35,000 in his own election campaign. Why  was  no

reference made to that in the report? How  was  he

able to spend $35,000 in an election campaign? Why

is there such a glaring ommission in this report?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other item I wish to refer to is contained

in   paragraph  70,  page  26,  relating  to   our

Assistant Minister for Labour and Welfare. It says

here:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Lee Kuan Yew in his speech in thee

Legislative  Assembly  on the  18th  July,  1957,.

referred  to a case in which he alleged  that  tea

and  cigarettes had been provided to  a  group  of

people who had been helping Mr Koh Choon Hong  in

his   election  campaign.  It  appeared  from  the

evidence we heard that coffee to a total value  of

$32.05  had  been served from time to time  in  an

office,  which  purported to be a branch  election

office  of Mr Koh Choon Hong, to about 15  people

who  were  said  to  have been  working  for  that

candidate. None of the witnesses could tell us who

those  person were, or what they were supposed  to

do  for  Mr  Koh  Choon Hong, and  there  was  no

evidence as to whether they were electors  in  the

Tanjong Pagar division. Mr Koh Choon Hong  denied

that  the office was his and said he know  nothing

of  the  people  said to have  frequented  it.  As

regards  the cost of the coffee, it appeared  that

$19.50 had been paid by a witness named Lim  Tiong

Yap  for coffee consumed up to the 10th June,  and

$22.50   was  outstanding  in  respect  of  coffee

consumed between the 11th and 24th June. Mr  Lirn

Tiong  Yap  alleged  that Mr  Mak  Pak  Shee  had

provided  the $19.50 and was responsible  for  the

$22.50;  and  that Mr Mak Pak Shee  had  arranged

with  him  to pay for the refreshments because  he

(Mr  Mak  Pak Shee) was supporting Mr Koh  Choon

Hong.  Mr, Mak Pak Shee denied the allegation.  We

found  that  Mr Lim Tiong Yap was  an  unreliable

witness,  and  we  are  unable  to  come  to   any

conclusion as to whether anyone other than he  had

provided  the  $19.50  and  was  responsible   for

payment   of  the  $22.50  outstanding.  Assuming,

however,  that Mr Lim Tiong Yap's allegation  was

true,  we  do  not consider that any  question  of

treating would arise. There was no evidence of the

identity  of  the  persons who  had  consumed  the

coffee,  and even if they were electors in Tanjong

Pagar  division, it seems to us quite  clear  that

the  coffee  was  provided  for  them  by  way  of

refreshment in the course of their work,  and  not

for  the purpose of inducing them to vote for  Mr Koh Choon Hong."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the witness who came forward with the

notebook gave his evidence in public and was ready

to  be  cross-examined by Mr Mak  Pak  Shee,  the

Assistant  Minister, or anyone on his behalf.  The

person against whom this allegation was made chose

to  meet the Commission in camera, and nothing  is

said  as to what is transpired in camera. But  one

thing  is quite clear - that the Assistant Minister,

using  his  position  as  Assistant  Minister  for

Labour  and  Welfare,  had telephoned  the  Labour

Officer  of the Singapore Harbour Board,  one  Mr

Archer, and told him to release this man Lim Tiong

Yap  as and when this man required, whilst he  was

on duty and being paid for, in order that he might

canvass  for Mr Koh Choon Hong. Now, Sir, nothing

is  said about that. Mr Archer admitted it and  I

must,  for  the record of this House, deplore  the

omission of the evidence which was taken on  these two matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a matter for considerable regret. A

whole  host of this evidence would have  withstood

cross-examination  in an open Commission.  Because

of  this  lapse  which  I  find  difficult  to  understand,  this  almost  forgetfulness,   of   the

Chairman,  who was legally qualified and  trained,

to give an opportunity to the persons against whom

these allegations were made to know of them and to

cross-examine  the witnesses, a  lot  of  unworthy

people will now have worthy excuses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the allegations made were of a very

serious  nature  and I would  list  them  for  the

benefit  of  hon. Members. First, the one  against

Chong   Wee  Ling,  the  Liberal-Socialist   Party

candidate. This appears on page 17, paragraph 34:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Further information from Police sources was to

the  effect that one Aw Sai Soo, a member  of  the

Tai  Chap Wee secret society of 24 Group, had been

engaged  by Mr Chong Wee Ling at a remuneration

of  $400 per month to put up election posters  for

him;  and  that  he  had been promised  a  further

$1,000 on polling day, but there was no indication

as  to  whether the latter sum had  in  fact  been paid."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, then, Mr Chong Wee Ling's by election returns were published and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



no  such  item  was  disclosed.  Even  though  the

evidence might have been insufficient to  mount  a

prosecution, it is a matter for regret  that  this

evidence,  given  presumably by a police  officer.

should not have been revealed to him in order that

he  could  challenge it, and  there  could  be  no excuse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next was one against Mr Koh Choon Hong, contained in page 18, paragraph 36:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to information from a Police source,

Mr  Koh  Choon  Hong engaged the  Headman  and  a

member  of  969 secret society of 24  Group,  four

members  of  other secret societies  of  the  same

Group and a member of a secret society of 18 Group

at  a  daily remuneration of $12 each, to  canvass for votes...".



<br><br>Now, Sir, again it seems to me signal folly not to

have  put  this  evidence to Mr Koh  Choon  Hong,

offer  him  the  privilege of cross-examining  the

witness  and going to the witness-box to deny  it.

The odds are this evidence must have been reliable

and should have been properly put.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, an allegation against the Labour Front candidate. Mr Keng Ban Ee:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to information from two separate

Police   sources   described  as  reliable,   this

candidate  sought and obtained the  assistance  of

one Jiman Bin Simen alias Panjang, the Headman  of

329  secret society of 36 Group, and promised  him

that if he was successful in the election he would

present  him with a motorcar as a reward  for  his help."



<br><br>Unfortunately he was not successful so  I  presume

the  question  of  the  motorcar  did  hot  arise.

Nevertheless I cannot understand why Mr Keng  Ban

Ee  was not given the opportunity to explain  that

he did not buy the motorcar because he did not win the election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as for our Member for Cairnhill - and I think he need have no fear that I shall be

reading  the allegations in reference  to  my  own

candidature - it is said in paragraph 41, page 19:

One   witness   told  us  that  on   polling   day

members  of the Lau Yong Heng secret society  went

from   house   to  house  collecting  voters   and

compelling  them to go to the polling  station  in

cars  bearing Mr Soh Ghee Soon's symbol. Lim  Toh

Heng  admitted to us that in 1953 he had been  one of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



leaders of the Lau Yong Heng secret society, but

said he had resigned his membership in 1953. He"-



<br><br>namely, the leader of the secret society-



<br><br>"said that Mr Soh Ghee Soon had asked him to help

him by driving a car on polling day to transport

voters to the polling station, and that on polling day he did so."



<br><br>He did so but he did not mention the consideration for this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if the Commission had given Mr Soh,

the  Member  for Cairnhill, the opportunity - as  in

fact  they did give him in another instance  about

seven of his helpers being City Council employees

- then  Mr  Soh  would have no just complaint  for

this  allegation made against him. But I think  he

is  entitled  to complain that this  very  serious

charge that he had solicited and obtained the help

of  a  leader of a secret society, was not put  to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman of the Commission, in page 24, paragraph 61, had done this in regard to another allegation against Mr Soh:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mr Soh Ghee Soon told us that 7 of his helpers

were  employees of the City Council. He  said  one

was  employed as a clerk at the rate of $5 a  day,

two  were paid $20 each for their services  during

the   campaign,   and   the  other   four   worked

voluntarily. At the time of the Bye-Elections  Mr

Soh Ghee Soon himself was a City Councillor. Under

the  City Council's Conduct and Discipline  Rules,

their  employees are divided into two  categories,

Restricted  and  Unrestricted. Those  in  the  Restricted  class are all senior officers and holders

of  clerical and technical posts above  the  time-scale,  as  well as all employees who in  any  way

come  in  contact with the public in  an  official

capacity.  One  of  the 7 City  Council  employees

mentioned  by  Mr  Soh  Ghee  Soon  (one  of  the

recipients of $20 for his services) was  a  junior

officer  in  the Secretariat and in the Restricted

class.  We consider that it was improper  for  Mr

Soh  Ghee  Soon  to  make use  of  that  officer's

services in his election campaign, particularly as

he  himself was a City Councillor and, as such,  a

member  of  the  authority  responsible  for   the

maintenance  of discipline among the City  Council staff."



<br><br>Well,  that  is  the proper way.  There  was  this

evidence against Mr Soh. It was undesirable.  Mr

Soh  was  given  the  opportunity - the  Member  for

Cairnhill  was given the opportunity  to  explain.

The   fact   that   he  failed   to   explain   it

satisfactorily to the Commission was  a  piece  of

misfortune which befell him,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



but  nevertheless he was given the opportunity  in

this instance which he was not in the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, this was the police statement made

against election activities, not against me,  but

against the campaigning on my behalf, and I  would

like  to  record here my regret that  such  allegations  were  made without having been put  to  me

being brought to my notice, or indeed been put  to

the    persons   against   whom   these   specific

allegations  were put. It said  first  of  all  in

paragraph 31, page 15:



<br><br>"Early  in April, 1957, a dispute arose  in  Craig

Road  between  members of the Ji Tok  Kiat  secret

society of 24 Group on the one part, and 206, 309,

and  the Hai Lok San secret societies of 108 Group

on  the other part, and later the same evening  an

open  fight took place in Duxton Road between  the

members  of  the two Groups, in which bottles  and

knives   were  used.  The  two  Groups  of  secret

societies  were  associated with the  two  Chinese

clans  which  were predominant in the Duxton  Road

area,  the 24 Group with the Teo clan and the  108

Group  with the Ho clan. Initial efforts to settle

the   dispute  by  arbitration  failed   and   the

situation  remained in ferment. Mr Lee Kuan  Yew,

who was away in England at the time the dispute occurred,  was  informed  of the  situation  on  his

return by Mr Ho Beh Swee. . ., the leader of  the

Ho  clan  in the Duxton Road area and a  Committee

member of the Tanjong Pagar Branch of the People's

Action Party. Being aware that a Bye-Election  was

to  take place soon in the Tanjong Pagar division,

he  was anxious that the dispute should be settled

because  he feared that an alignment of the  clans

and  the secret societies supporting them with the

candidates in the forthcoming Bye-Elections  might

result in clashes during the election campaign. On

the 18th April, 1957, the situation had become  so

serious  that  Mr  Lee Kuan  Yew  telephoned  the

Superintendent of Police in charge of  the  Secret

Societies  Branch  of  the Criminal  Investigation

Department  to  warn  him of the  tension  and  to

inform  him that members of the Ho clan,  who  had

supported  him  during  the 1955  Elections,  were

hoarding  weapons such as bicycle  chains,  poles,

and  daggers  for protection against  an  expected

attack  by  members  of the  Teo  clan,  who  were

supporters  of  Mr  William  Tan,  the   Liberal-Socialist  member of the Legislative Assembly  for

Tiong  Bahru division, and he suggested  that  the

Police should help to settle the dispute. He  said

that he would get in touch wih Mr William Tan and

that  they and the leaders of the two clans should

meet in the Superintendent's office with a view to

resolving    the   situation,   to    which    the

Superintendent agreed. Mr Lee Kuan Yew then  got

in  touch  with  Mr  William Tan  who  agreed  to

mediate  in  the  dispute, and  in  fact  he  [Mr



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 485</b></font><br><br>



William Tan] was able to effect a settlement  with

the  co-operation of Mr Ho Beh Swee and  Mr  Teo

Choon  Huat,  the leader of the Teo  clan  in  the

Duxton  Road  area.  On the 15th  May,  1957,  Mr

William  Tan, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Mr Ho  Beh  Swee,

and Mr Teo Choon  Huat  called on the Superintendent  of  the

Secret Societies Branch in his office and formally

announced  to  him  that  the  dispute  had   been settled."



<br><br>Now, Sir, if the Commission had put those facts, I

could easily have told the Commission that on  the

day   when  it  was  being  settled,  the   formal

announcement  on 15th May, was in  my  absence.  I

think the Member for Tiong Bahru will recall  that

I  was late because I was held up in court. When I

arrived  at  the  office  of  the  Superintendent,

Secret  Societies Sub-Branch, Mr Ho, Mr  Teo  and

Mr  Tan  were  there together  with  the  Superintendent  and they informed me that the matter  had

beeii  settled.  Now it is this  sort  of  mistake

which  would have been avoided if only  the  facts

had  been put, if only, instead of the officer-in-charge  of the Secret Societies Sub-Branch  giving

evidence  in  camera, he had given  it  either  in

camera  in  my  presence,  or  in  public  to   my knowledge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report goes on, in paragraph 35, to say with regard to the by-election:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to information from Police sources

described  as  reliable,  Mr  Lee  Kuan  Yew  was

supported  by members of secret societies  of  108

Group  and  members of 969 secret  society  of  24

Group  of the Cantonese section of Chinatown,  who

canvassed  for  votes  for  him  and  put  up  his

posters. One Police report was to the effect  that

Mr  Ho  Beh Swee was supplying food, refreshments

and  cigarettes to members of the  Sio  Eng  Hiong

secret  society of 108 Group, who were putting  up

election  posters  for Mr Lee  Kuan  Yew  in  the

Tanjong Pagar area."



<br><br>Now,  Mr  Ho Beh Swee was the same gentlemen  who

had  informed  me  of an impending  clash  in  the

Duxton Road area, who was at that time a member of

the  P.A.P.  Tanjong Pagar Branch Committee.  Now,

Sir,  Mr  Ho  Beh  Swee unfortunately  was  never

called   to   deny  this - that  he   had   supplied

refreshments. In fact, according to my reports, because  of all these clashes with gangs and  secret

societies,  he quietly withdrew from the  election

campaign altogether. Now whatever was the truth of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 486</b></font><br><br>



matter, the thing should have been investigated,  Mr  Ho  should  have  been   called,

because  there was an allegation made against  Mr

Ho.  There is, true, no further allegation that  I

asked  Mr Ho to act on my behalf in this  matter;

nevertheless, Mr Ho should have been asked, and I

can  see no excuse whatsoever for this unfortunate lapse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes on to make this allegation in page 18, same paragraph:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At five public meetings which Mr Lee Kuan Yew

held  in  different  parts of  the  Tanjong  Pagar

division   during  the  month   of   June,   1957,

detectives  observed members of  secret  societies

controlling  the  crowd and  generally  acting  as stewards."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Tanjong Pagar area has probably

the  highest number of secret societies, according

to Sub-Branch officials. I would have welcomed the

opportunity if they had gone into the witness-box,

even in camera, to ask them whether they acted  as

stewards  officially;  did they  wear  arm-bands?;

were  they  under instructions from P.A.P. branch

officials?;  could they identify  some  of  them?;

could they be brought forward to court to find out

why it was - if in fact it was true - they were participating in my campaign?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, there may be a sub-stratum of truth

in  all these allegations, and in fact I am fairly

confident  that in most of these cases there  was.

The  pity  of  it  all is even if there  was  good

reason  to make these allegations, now the persons

against whom these allegations were made can shrug

their shoulders and say, `Ah, well, pity I was not

allowed to rebut it.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all said and done, although I would not

support  the  recommendations  in  tow  because  a

number   of   them   would  be  impracticable   to

implement,   a   good  nutnber   of   others   are

practicable,  and  should be implemented.  If  the

Government - here again I do not want to  anticipate

the  Bill - but  if the Government can  convince  us

that  those  extra items which are not recommended

were  not  intended for the purpose  of  defeating

their   political  opponents,  we  will  give   it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 487</b></font><br><br>



our   unqualified  support,  in  particular,   the

summary of recommendations on page 39:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"(i) That compulsory voting should be introduced."



<br><br>I  think  the Hon. the Chief Minister has  already

committed his Labour Front Government,  I  do  not

know how-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was just wondering

whether   the  motion  itself  touches  on   these

recommendations;  it seems to  be  away  from  the recommendations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Well, Sir, having deplored the

part which I think was not as perfect as it should

have  been, I feel it my duty at the same time  to

point  out  that, despite these criticisms,  there

are considerable credits in the recommendations or

parts  of the recommendations made in this report.

I  do not wish to give the impression that because

people   were   not   allowed   to   cross-examine

witnesses,  because  there has  been  some  white-washing   of  Assistant  Ministers,  I   therefore

disregard  the findings. And with that  intention,

Sir,  I hope you will allow me, Mr Speaker,  just

to  briefly touch on these recommendations to show

that they are in many instances worthy of our  support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the hon.

Member  has  satisfied me that touching  on  these

recommendations  would bring his  comments  within

the  terms of the motion itself. The motion itself

deals  with  allegations which were  made  against

persons in secret and deplores that no opportunity

was   given  to  these  persons  to  cross-examine

witnesses;  and the second part urges  the  Government  to  take  action against persons  whom  the

report  says the Police have reliable evidence  of

their having solicited and paid for the assistance

of  gangsters in their elections. I cannot see how

comment on the recommendations will bring the hon.

Member within the terms of his motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I have not come to the

second  half, the second limb, of my  motion,  the one urging the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 488</b></font><br><br>



Government to take action. I am reserving that for

my  last  parting  shot at the Government,  so  to

speak.  But  in between I hope to avoid  conveying

the  impression  that because I  find  the  report

unsatisfactory  in  parts,  I  therefore  find  it

unsatisfactory in its conclusions as to  how  more

efficient and fair elections could be held in  the

future.  Since you have expressed the  opinion  on

this  matter I would not go into it in detail  but

in  principle I would say that those  parts  which

are   practical  like  the  abolition  of  private

transport,  polling  day  being  made   a   public

holiday,   banning  of  high-pressure   canvassing

outside  polling stations, and so  on,  should  be

implemented, and the sooner they are  the  better.

But  the Minister for Local Government, Lands  and

Housing  will  have  a lot of explanation  at  the

Select  Committee stage as to some  of  the  other

provisions that he may have thought of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would ask the Government to find out

who  were  the police officers who made  these

allegations,  particularly in  regard  to  Mr

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... Koh Choon Hong's direct, specific

allegations - Mr Koh Choon Hong engaged the

Headman and a member of 969 secret society  of  24

Group,  four members of other secret societies  of

the same Group and a member of a secret society of 18 Group at a daily remuneration of $12 each . ..".



<br><br>Now, Sir, Mr Koh Choon Hong's election return has

been published. These expenses were not disclosed,

and  I  am  quite sure that the Attorney-General's

Chambers  do not lack people who can find - provided

that  the  evidence  is solid enough - a  particular

section in some part of the criminal law to  mount a prosecution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly with Mr Chong Wee Ling-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...one Aw Sai Soo, . . . 24 Group, had

been   engaged  by  Mr  Chong  Wee  Ling   at   a

remuneration of $400 per month to put up  election

posters  for him; and that he had been promised  a

further $1,000 on polling day . ..".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mr Keng Ban Ee and the motorcar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now these are allegations made by police

officers,  albeit in camera; I think it  is  worth

looking  into  further to see  whether  or  not  a

prosecution               should                be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 489</b></font><br><br>



mounted, and the matter should not be left just with the publication of this report.

failed  in  being  beyond  reproach,  as   such

reports should be, because of elementary mistakes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 490</b></font><br><br>



It has not found the Assistant Minister for Labour and Welfare guilty. His accusers gave

evidence in public but the Assistant Minister

gave his evidence in private. What did he say? What was his explanation regarding-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I was listening

to   the  hon.  Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar   very

carefully  when he touched on that aspect.  I  did

not pull him up to order, or considered him out of

order - he kept completely in order. But I think the

hon. Member who is now speaking is getting out  of

order because, under Standing Order 31(9),

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The personal conduct of Members of the Assembly

shall not be referred to except upon a substantive

motion moved for that purpose.",



<br><br>and I do not think there is a substantive motion moved for the

purpose of considering the personal conduct of the

Assistant Minister. I think the hon. Member, if he

carries on along the line he has been carrying on,

will be completely out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just

explained  what  the Assistant Minister  had  done

during the by-election at Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think we are

debating the Assistant Minister; we are debating a

motion moved by the hon. Member for Tanjong  Pagar

which is quite clear in its terms.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will just

touch  on the report of the Commission of Inquiry.

The  report  has  made damaging  findings  against

several  candidates, about their hiring  gangsters

to  help  them in their campaigns. Most  probably,

Sir,  these  allegations were made by  the  police

officers. The police officers gave their  evidence

in private. Probably they were true. It is all the

more  regrettable  that the persons  concerned  in

these  allegations were not told of them and given

an  opportunity either to admit or rebut them. But

nevertheless  the Commission has served  a  useful

purpose  in bringing attention to a whole host  of

abuses  that  regularly take place  in  elections.

Sir,  my  Party  is glad that we have  moved  this motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 491</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Sir, if I am not

mistaken, the set-up of this Commission of Inquiry

into Corrupt. Illegal or Undesirable Practices  at

Elections was put through by a motion of the  hon.

Member for Tanjong Pagar. Maybe he thought at that

time,  Sir,  that he could show to the  people  of

Singapore  that he was the only person who  fought

clean and the others were questionable. He is now,

I  believe,  disappointed, and has many criticisms

against  the Commission's findings. To  a  certain

extent,  Sir,  I agree with him. I must  also  say

that  the  findings  of the  Commission  were  not

entirely fair or accurate. If you will give me the

permission, Sir, I will tell you why in my case  I

think it is not fair or accurate. Am I allowed  to do so, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the hon. Member will continue I will soon tell him whether he is in order or not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon:</b> When I told the Commission.

Sir,  that the first occasion on which I  met  Lim

Toh  Heng,  who is alleged to be a  headman  of  a

secret  society, was when I went on house-to-house

canvassing  with  a Chinese staff  member  of  the

Liberal-Socialist  Party  at  Kim  Yam  Road   and

Mohamed  Sultan  Road, the Commission  disbelieved

me;  and  when I further said that I did not  know

that  Lim Toh Heng was actually helping me  during

my  election campaign because he had never brought

me  to  see  anyone or attended any of  my  public

meetings,  it  still disbelieved me.  I  think  it

would also not believe me if I were to say that  I

was not aware that Lim Toh Heng was helping me  on

polling day. The fact is that on polling day I was

concentrating on Cairnhill Road and  Emerald  Hill

Road areas, and I only went to Mohamed Sultan Road

in  the  evening at about 6.30 p.m. with  Mr  Lim

Choo  Sye, the City Councillor, in his car. I  did

not  meet  Lim  Toh  Heng  or  any  one  who  was assisting me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the detectives told the Commission that

they  saw  Lim Toh Heng at my public  meetings  at Tank



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 492</b></font><br><br>

Road on 13th and 24th June, 1957, this

statement   was  accepted.  The  Commission   also

accepted  the detectives' word that on  13th  June

Lim Toh Heng was in the company of two members  of

his  own secret society maintaining order  at  the

meeting, and that on 24th June Lim Toh Heng was in

the  company  of  four members of his  own  secret

society, two members of another secret society and

three members of a secret society of 18 Group. The

Commission further believed police sources that 40

to 50 members of Lau Yong Heng secret society were

assisting me in the Mohamed Sultan Road  area,  by

canvassing  for me, driving cars and  transporting

voters to the polling station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my word of honour, I have not seen anyone of

these members of the Lau Yong Heng Society and  to

this  very day I do not know who they are;  except

that  I learnt later on, from the findings of  the

Commission of Inquiry, that Lim Toh Heng was an ex-member.  But  when I approached him  on  that  day

canvassing from house to house, I had no  idea  at

all that he was even a member of the Lau Yong Heng

secret society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had only five public meetings during my by-election campaign last year and they were at Tank Road on Thursday-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the hon. Member is

probably making a defence, whereas the motion does

not ask him to do so; the motion deplores the fact

that he was not allowed to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon:</b> I am sorry, Sir, I only wanted

to point out that there was no such meeting and if

you  will  not allow me, I will not say any  more,

but  I  do  not  think much about supporting  this motion.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I seek the indulgence of this House to read the

letter  dated 19th April, 1958, addressed  to  His

Excellency  the  Governor  by  the  Commission  of

Inquiry:

"Since   our   Report  on  Corrupt,   Illegal   or

Undesirable Practices at Elections was  published,

three of the candidates in the by-elections namely

Messrs.       Lee       Kuan       Yew,        Soh



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 493</b></font><br><br>



Ghee  Soon  and Keng Ban Ee have in statements  to

the  newspapers  criticised our procedure  in  the

Inquiry  on  the  ground that no  opportunity  was

accorded  to them to refute allegations  affecting

them  made  by  witnesses  who  gave  evidence  in

camera.  In  addition,  Mr  Lee  Kuan  Yew   also

criticised  us for not giving him the  opportunity

of  hearing  the  evidence of such  witnesses  and

cross-examining them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, it may be appropriate to

submit  to  Your  Excellency our  observations  on

those  criticisms.  In regard  to  the  first  criticism,  the  fact was that after  we  have  heard

evidence in camera relating to those candidates,

we called them in camera and particularly examined

them  in  relation to the material points of  such

evidence  so  as to enable them to give  us  their

evidence on those points. The dates when they were

so called and examined were as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Soh Ghee Soon on 20th December, 1957

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lee Kuan Yew on 13th February, 1958

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Keng Ban Ee on 28th February, 1958.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to Mr Lee Kuan Yew's second criticism

in   cases  where  the  fourth  direction  in  the

Commission  appointing  us  applied,  we  had   no

discretion as we interpreted the word "public" to

include   persons  about  whom   a   witness   was

testifying. Moreover, we considered that  whenever

it  was  necessary for a witness to give  evidence

before  us in camera especially on the subject  of

secret  societies, that witness  was  entitled  to

expect that his identity should remain unknown not

only to the public at large but also in particular

to  the person or persons about whom he was  testifying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were conducting an Inquiry and not a trial but

even if proceedings under certain local Ordinances

where the liberty of persons detained is involved,

the   need   for  protecting  witnesses   by   not

disclosing their identity is recognised by law and

the  evidence of such witnessess is not  given  in

the  presence  of nor subject to cross-examination

by  the  person affected. In our opinion,  similar

considerations apply in our Inquiry."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on 8th July, 1957, the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  in  moving  his motion, which  brought  the

Commission of Inquiry into being, spoke  words  of

wisdom  and even foretold the findings of  such  a

Commission  of Inquiry. Official Report  Volume  2

No. 30, column 2171 contains these words:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But if an Inquiry Commission were set up which

is  not  confined  to  the technicalities  of  the

criminal  law of corruption, then some astonishing

disclosures could take place."

<br><br>Words of wisdom, prophetic words, Sir!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 494</b></font><br><br>

He prepared us for some astonishing

disclosures  and we were therefore not  astonished

by paragraph 35 of the Report (Sessional Paper No.

Cmd.  7  of 1958) under the heading "MR LEE  KUAN

YEW"  but  what  astonishes us is  that  the  hon.

Member   was   apparently   astonished   by    the

astonishing  disclosures in  the  said  paragraph.

Well,  well, well, what an astonishing sequel!  He

now wants this House to note



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"with regret that the Commission of Inquiry into

Corrupt,  Illegal  or  Undesirable  Practices   at

Elections had made its report (Sessional Paper No.

Cmd.  7  of  1958) without giving to some  of  the

persons,  against whom allegations  were  made  in

secret,  the opportunity to know of such  evidence

and  to  cross-examine such witnesses and  to  confront them with contrary evidence...".



<br><br>And  yet,  Sir,  there is no record  of  the  hon.

Member  having raised any difficulties  about  the

Commission taking evidence in camera or asked  for

any  elucidation of procedure from the Commission.

In  fact,  the terms of the Commission of  Inquiry

were  clear  to  him  before  the  Commission  was

appointed.  Formal notice setting out  the  Commis

sion  makes  it quite clear that any  witness  who

states  that he desires to give evidence in camera

shall be at liberty to do so and in such case, the

Commission shall direct that any such evidence

shall  be  heard  in camera or otherwise  recorded

without   being  made  available  to  the  public.

Looking  back, this may be loosely worded  but  at

least  criticism  cannot be levelled  at  the  Commission  for procedure which was well  within  the

terms  of reference, and, as I said, the terms  of

reference  were  clear to the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar before the Commission was appointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This point, Sir, was further made by the Chairman

of   the   Commission  in  a  broadcast  on   25th

September, 1957. He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Remember also that if you wish to give evidence

in  private,  the Commission will and indeed  must

comply  with  your request and if  you  mark  your

correspondence `confidential', it will be  treated

as such."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Singapore Standard of 10th October, 1957, there was a story saying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



that  of  the  12  subpoenaed witnesses  who  were

present,  six  offered to give their  evidence  in

public while the other six elected to give  it  in

camera.  No question seems to have been raised  as

to  whether  the  candidates in  the  by-elections

would  have an opportunity of hearing or, if  they

so  wished,  submitting rebuttals to the  evidence

laid by these witnesses before the Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, in the Straits Times of 17th

February,  1958  a  story  said  that  of  the  40

witnesses  heard by the Commission, half  of  them

gave  evidence  in  camera. In  the  story  was  a

paragraph which said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Commission examined several witnesses both

in  open  and private sessions who admitted  their

connections  with  secret societies  and  to  have

helped  election candidates. No private  query  or

public comment was raised."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, column 2170 of the Official Report referred

to  contains  these  words uttered  by  the  hon. Member:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our law, as I have said, is copied from the

English  law  which  is  effective  under  English

social  conditions where people will give evidence

and  denounce  others in open court.  Here  it  is

impossible.  Unless we give witnesses a  guarantee

of  secrecy, it is impossible to get these  people

to come forward in court."



<br><br>"Unless  we give witnesses a guarantee of secrecy,

it  is  impossible  to get these  people  to  come

forward in court." More words of wisdom!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Column 2202 records the hon. Member as saying:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am quite satisfied to have a separate Court

provided that there is sufficient protection given

for  it  to make a complete and thorough  inquiry.

There  must  be  complete privilege,  sympathy  if

necessary, and extra judicial powers in the  sense

that   it  can  hear  evidence  which  would   not

otherwise  be  received, and can hear  second-hand

evidence if necessary."



<br><br>All   these,   Sir,  are  words  of  wisdom!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission did exactly what the

Member  for Tanjong Pagar wished to see  done  and

now  the  hon.  Member  says that  the  Commission

should  have  done otherwise. What an  astonishing

disclosure of a man who has been claiming that he

always means what he says but now apparently  says

that  he  does not mean what he meant to  say  on 18th July, 1957!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government having appointed the

Commission believed that they would be able to assess the credibility of witnesses and

the degree of credence to be given to the evidence

submitted. What the hon. Member is asking is  that

he himself should act as an independent Commission

on  the  witnesses and their evidence  and  decide

therefore  on  what he considers the effectiveness

of  the judgment of the Commission. The Government

caniiot accept any criticism which reflects on the

integrity or efficiency of the Commission.  It  is

not  the  Commission which is  on  trial  but  the

secret  society  penetration of political  Parties

which no one in this House denies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two things, Sir, are quite clear about the

Commission. First, they were clearly impartial  in

their  stringencies  on the  relations  of  secret

societies  to all political Parties and  secondly,

they gave the source of their evidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I now come to the second part of the motion

which reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...and that this House urges the Government to

take  action against the persons whom  the  report

says  the  Police have reliable evidence of  their

having  solicited and paid for the  assistance  of

gangsters in their elections."



<br><br>What did the hon. Member say on 18th July, 1957? I

quote from column 2167 of the Official Report:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The by-elections led to a great number of

charges  and counter-charges of strongarm methods,

illegal  methods, corrupt methods, but no election

candidate  has filed an election petition  against

his  opponents,  nor indeed has  anyone  made  any

serious complaint to the police."



<br><br>And in column 2174, he said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the cloistered atmosphere of a court such as

the  Commission  on  Corruption,  or  a  court  of

enquiry  or  some  tribunal not hamstrung  by  the

strict rules of the law of evidence, a great  deal

of  corrupt and improper practices can be  brought

to light."



<br><br>I  would  like hon. Members to take note of  these

words  "not hamstrung by the strict rules  of  the

law  of  evidence,  a great deal  of  corrupt  and

improper practices can be brought to light."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Commission was dealing with events

which  had occurred months previously and  neither

the  police  nor  the C.P.I.B. had  made  specific investigations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>



into them at that time because in the words of the hon.  Member "no election candidate has  filed  an election  petition  against  his  opponents,   nor

indeed  has  anyone made any serious complaint  to

the police."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My learned friend and colleague the Hon. the

Attorney-General has made enquiries and  is  quite

satisfied   that   though  the   police   obtained

information  from sources that have properly  been

described  as  reliable, there is no  evidence  on

which  to  found a prosecution for an  offence  in

connection with the by-elections in question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government does not need to be urged to

take  action  against  offenders.  The  Hon. the

Attorney-General would have done so if he had been

satisfied  that  there was evidence  on  which  to

found  a  prosecution and in  the  light  of  this

explanation, I am sure that this House will reject this motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some more words of wisdom from the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar, a very learned member  of  the

Bar! Column 2174 reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whole of the law relating to corrupt and

improper practices is completely unsuitable to our

conditions, and we cannot bring the crooks to book

with these laws."



<br><br>He  has  admitted, Sir, that we cannot  bring  the

crooks to book with the present law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is clear from my speech that the

Government opposes the motion.



<br><br>3.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe this motion is aimed

at  the Commission of Inquiry or I would say  that

the  mover of this motion has no confidence in the

Report  of  the  Commission. I thought  that  this

Commission was first asked to be appointed by  the

Member  for  Tanjong Pagar and that  he  expressed

great  faith in Commissions of Inquiry.  In  fact,

one  of the Commissions of Inquiry was praised  by

him  a great deal, and this House was urged by him

to see that all its findings should be recorded as

truths  and its recommendations implemented.  This

motion, however, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>

seems to give me an idea that there may be

Commissions  of Inquiry but that some  Commissions

are  good  and some not so good. Some  Commissions

would  be acceptable to the People's Action Party,

other  Commissions must be totally  rejected.  But

still,  the People's Action Party finds that  some

parts  of  the  Report should be  praised - such  as

candidates  buying  coffee for  their  helpers  or

candidates wanting to buy a car for one  of  their

helpers.  No regret has been expressed  about  the

findings   of   the   Commission,   although   the

Commission  reported  that  there  has   been   no

concrete evidence to bring these cases to book.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On looking through the Report, I, however,

regretted  the appearance of paragraph 31  whereby

the  Member  for Tanjong Pagar was connected  with

secret societies and through his good offices  was

able to settle disputes amongst them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It is your colleague, the Member for Tiong Bahru (Mr William Tan).



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> The Member for Tanjong Pagar

took  a  big hand. In paragraph 46, another member

of  these undesirable people tried to help him  by

tearing down posters. Furthermore, there are  more

allegations  in  this  Report  and  the  whole  of

Chapter V is devoted to it under the heading "USE

OF  FORCE  AND COMPULSION (Aggressive Attitude  to

Voters)". All these I think, Sir, are the parts of

the  Report  that  should be very much  regretted!

They  should  never have made their appearance  in

the   Report!   If  they  have  not   made   their

appearance,  then  this Report is  good.  However,

they have made their appearance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It astounded me even more that there should be

accusations   of   candidates  being   helped   by

gangsters to win the elections with or without the

knowledge  of the candidates. The Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar said that if you look up the  records,

Tanjong Pagar is an area which can boast the  most

number  of  gangsters  in  Singapore  and  yet  he represents them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I would say that the Commission should

have  specially  written in its  Report  that  the

gangsters voted for him without his knowledge  and

that   some   of  them  helped  him  without   his

knowledge!  But I would like this House  to  note,

Sir,  that when a Commission is appointed by  this

Assembly  and if we have no faith in  the  members

that  are  appointed, or if  we  think  that  they

cannot do a good job, then we should have said  so

immediately upon their appointments, or while  the

proceedings  of the Commission are going  on,  and

not  wait until after the findings are made known,

and  then  fling allegations at them. I am  afraid

that  allegations flung in this way are apt to  be

biased and not fair to all concerned. There may be

a few small faults but generally speaking, I think

the  Commission has revealed to Singapore  that  a

great deal of maipractices are perpetrated by many

of these people who want the world to believe that

they  are  clean by first bringing a complaint  to

this Assembly to have the matter investigated.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the hon. Member has completed his speech.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I was on the point of rising-





<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I have completed my speech.

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member has completed his

speech. The Member for Tanjong Pagar will have  an opportunity in reply.



<br><br>3.52 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  am indeed surprised that the Member for Tanjong

Pagar who moved this motion in this House made  no

reference  particularly to a meeting held  on  2nd

June,  1957 (that is, on page 23, paragraph 54  of

Sessional  Paper No. Cmd. 7 of 1958). I think  the

People's  Action Party should be blamed  for  what

happened  during the meeting held on  Sunday,  2nd

June,  1957.  On  that  day the  Liberal-Socialist

Party held a rally behind the Oriental Theatre and

there was quite a big crowd from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>

neighbouring area attending this meeting.

About  9.15 p.m. on the same night, Sir, while  it

was  going on and a few of our members were making

speeches, a big group consisting of about 600  people marched along Banda Street (that is the street

behind   where  we  held  our  rally)  and   their

behaviour reminded me of the mob action during the

Hock Lee Bus riots.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Before the hon. Member

continues, would he please relate those remarks to

the  motion?  If  he can convince  me  that  those

remarks  are relevant to the motion, then  he  can

carry  on  but,  at the moment, I cannot  see  any

relevance whatsoever.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Sir, what I am saying is in

connection with paragraph 54 of the Report.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I understand that but I

would like some connection with the motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> I am referring to that because

the  Member  for  Tanjong Pagar moved  the  motion reading:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House notes with regret that the

Commission  of  Inquiry into Corrupt,  Illegal  or

Undesirable  Practices at Elections had  made  its

report  .  .  , and  that this  House  urges  the

Government to take action against the persons whom

the  report says the Police have reliable evidence

of   their  having  solicited  and  paid  for  the

assistance of gangsters in their elections."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am referring to is that the crowd

was  led  apparently,  if I am  not  mistaken,  by

gangsters.  That  big group came  to  disturb  our

rally  and was, in fact, led by gangsters. I  have

information that this group was led by the Sio Eng

Hiong  secret  society. Why  did  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar not make reference to this?  Why  I

say that, Sir, is because I am most concerned. The

Member for Tanjong Pagar said, in relation to page

15, paragraph 31 of the Report, that I settled the

dispute  between the secret societies.  The  Superintendent  of the Secret Societies Branch  in  the

C.I.D. told me that the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

said that he represented the Ho clan who belong to

the  108 Group, as distinct from the Teo clan  who

belong        to        the       24        Group.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Where do you come in?



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> I challenge him to deny

that  he  did not  make such  a  statement   in

front   of  the  Deputy Superintendent       of

Police.      I      was  surprised,  Sir,   that

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar   did   not   say

anything in the  office of  the  Superintendent

to deny that. I want to  say  that, because  the

reason  why  I  stepped into  this dispute  was

that the Ho and the Teo clans  in  Duxton  Road

told  me that they  had  no  faith  in the  hon.

Member  and  that  they did  not  like  him  to

come  and interfere  in their   dispute   which

involved them  in  that area.  Eventually,  the

Member    for   Tanjong Pagar   approached   me

because  he  understood that   both  of   these

clans respected me.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Whether he shouts,

"Hear,  hear!" or  does not    shout,    "Hear,

hear!", the dispute was  settled    without    a

fight!  They  did   not belong     to    secret

societies,    as    was alleged  by the  Member

for  Tanjong Pagar, and I  was really surprised

why  he  did  not  deny that  fact in front  of

the  Superintendent  of Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one point I want to make clear. When the

Chairman  of  the   Commission    of   Inquiry  asked me - I am referring

to  page  17, paragraph  33 -  whether I  knew  a  certain man by the name

of   Teck  Hock,  alias  Teck  Ho,  I told  him that I did not know him unless  I  saw  him  in

person.   I   made    a  request    that    this person    should     be

brought to me in person to  identify whether  I knew  him as Teck  Hock

or   Teck  Ho,  but  he never  did so, Sir.  He went  on  to  say  that

Teck  Hock, alias  Teck Ho,  was  formerly  the headman of the Hai  Lok

San  secret society and I  told him that I  had no  idea about this.  I

told  him,  "How  do  I know  if he is a member of  that secret society

when  he does not  have any secret society wording   written  on   his

forehead?" I told  him, if  he were to say that Teck  Hock or  Teck  Ho

was   a  member  of   a secret   society, - these   are the words which

appear at the footnote on page 13:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We were particularly shocked when Mr

William  Tan, a  Member of    the   Legislative

Assembly, told  us:  "I know     many    people connected  with  secret

societies   among    my friends."



<br><br>I   regret,  Sir,  that this remark or sentence has appeared in all the

newspapers and  in  the Malayan Monthly, and  I am   now  so  popularly

labelled as a friend of the  secret  societies. The   Chairman  of  the

Commission  of  Inquiry said he was shocked.  I was  more shocked! Sir,

actually  when  he  confronted  me  with   the  name  of Teck Ho  as  a

member  of the Hai  Lok San  secret society,  I was taken aback because

it  was not written  on his  forehead  that  he

was   a  member  of   a secret society. I  told him that, if he were to

think  like that,  then among  my friends there  must   be  members   of

secret societies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Hon. the Chief Minister when he said in his

speech that this is the type  of  motion  which the   hon.  Member  for

Tanjong Pagar - he is the   Secretary-General of  the People's Action

Party - likes  to   move, because  he  likes   to play  to  the  gallery.

The  hon. Member  knows that this motion may be 85  per cent or 90  per

cent  true. Because  he regretted that  he  had ever  asked for a court

of  inquiry to  be  set up,  he  has today,  in order to clear himself,

moved   a   motion   as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House notes with regret that the Commission of Inquiry

into  Corrupt,  Illegal  or          Undesirable Practices  at Elections

had   made  its  report (Sessional  Paper   No. Cmd. 7 of 1958) without

giving  to some of  the persons,  against  whom allegations  were  made

in      secret,     the opportunity to know  of such  evidence  and  to

cross-examine      such witnesses  and  to  confront     them     with

contrary evidence;  and that  this House  urges the  Government to take

action   against    the persons whom the report says  the  Police  have

reliable  evidence   of their  having solicited and    paid   for   the

assistance of gangsters in their elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy to note, Sir, that the Hon. the Chief Minister

has    rejected    this motion. Even though the Chairman     of     the

Commission  of  Inquiry said   that   he    was shocked  at  the   fact

that  among my  friends there  were many people connected  with  secret

societies,   I    still that this report, though it is not a hundred per

cent true, is 95 per cent or 99 per cent true.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.04 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am very glad to have

had  the  advantage of hearing the speech  of  the

hon.  Member  for  Tiong Bahru.  I  had  a  little

difficulty  in linking some of it to  the  motion,

but  it  is  quite clear that he is  a  very  know

ledgeable man, and I wish that I could have him at

my   side   in   other   places   and   in   other

circumstances.  With his assistance,  I  think  it

might  be possible to achieve what the hon. Member

for   Tanjong   Pagar  has  described   as   quite

impossible,  and that is the bringing properly  to

justice of a number of people who have in the past

indulged in malpractices in elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar went

a  little  outside that paragraph  in  the  Report

which mentions the 1955 elections and referred  to

one  specific case of an admission. It is all very

well,  Mr  Speaker, for people to come  here  and

refer to admissions of this kind and yet stay away

from  the  places  where  such  information  could

really  be made great use of. The hon. Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  knows as well as I do - and  he  has

known  for a long time - as my friend the  Hon. the

Chief   Minister  has  told  us,  just  what   the

difficulties are. He knows those difficulties.  He

knew  them before this Commission was set up,  and

it  is because of those difficulties that the evidence to which he seems to refer in the second part

of  his motion is not anything better than second-hand,  or in many cases third-hand. If the  police

had  any  relevant admissible evidence,  I  should

have  been  able to take action against perhaps  a

number  of  people; but if Members will read  what

the  Commission  has  said,  they  will  see  that

nowhere  is  there anything better  than  evidence

resulting from information which, according to the

police  or  to  police sources,  is  described  as

reliable. Now that is not good enough. On that  it

would  be  very wrong to seek to institute  a  prosecution - unless it were a prosecution  of  someone

for failing to come forward and give evidence that

is within his knowledge. That has been considered,

but unfortunately we have not even got

enough for that, and we have not got it for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



the  reasons which are so well known to  the  hon.

Member  for Tanjong Pagar. There may be people - and

having read this report I firmly believe there are

people - who  have committed offences in  connection

with  elections, and if I could lay  my  hands  on

proper  evidence, I should prosecute - but I cannot.

And  if  I could lay my hands on evidence  against

people  whom  I could prove have got evidence  and

have   refused  to  give  it  to  me,   I   should

prosecute - but I have not got it. I have not got it

because  of  the  need to give  these  pledges  of secrecy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no use leaving things to other people.

That  does  happen in all communities. People  are

apt  to stand back and say they do not want to  be

involved;  let other people get on  with  it.  "Of

course, we know it is all wrong. We know this goes

on;  we know that goes on and someone ought to put

it right." Who is that someone? It is the Attorney-General or the Ministers. But how can the Attorney-General, the Ministers, or the police - anyone  concerned - do  anything  about it unless  people  will

stop  saying, "It is all wrong. I do  not  approve

it,  but  I am having nothing to do with  it."  If

there  is  something that is wrong, come  out  and

help. Perhaps with the help of the hon. Member for

Tiong  Bahru, any other hon. Member of this House,

or   any   citizen  or  inhabitant  of  Singapore,

something could be done if we all had the  courage

to come forward and say, "We need no secrecy."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we want is the truth. We have not got it.

And  so  we have this Commission which was set  up

with this very careful provision for the taking of

evidence  in  camera. Now, because  we  have  that

provision, we have complaints that certain  people

were not allowed to cross-examine witnesses before

the  Commission.  Mr  Speaker,  to  suggest  that

secrecy  of this kind is necessary and to complain

that  one is not allowed to cross-examine witnesses

is  a contradiction that needs no stressing by me.

It  is  a  contradiction so obvious that  I  doubt

whether  any responsible Member of this House  can

possibly, seriously, support this motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.13 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply, Mr Lee Kuan Yew?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> In reply, Sir. Mr Speaker,

Sir,  first  the statements of fact  made  by  the

Chief  Minister. He said he cleared the  terms  of

reference  of  this  Commission  with  me.  If  he

intended   by  that  to  mean  that   he   cleared

paragraphs  1,  2, 3 and 4 at page  3  of  Command

Paper No. 7 of 1958, yes; but if he meant that  he

had cleared with me the procedure which is set out

in  the paragraphs following, that is, 1, 2, 3, 4,

5,  6  and 7, then the answer is no. The terms  of

reference in the report was a thing with which  I,

as  the  mover  of the motion, was concerned.  The

procedure  was not one with which I was concerned.

The Chief Minister quoted me quite rightly that  I

intended  that the Commission should  have  powers

which need not have to be fettered by the rules of

evidence, that evidence should be taken in  camera

if required, and that secondary evidence should be

heard.  But what I am asking the House to note  is

this:

it  is  not  a  failure to observe  the  rules  of

evidence,  but  it  is  a  failure  to  observe  a

fundamental  rule  of natural  justice  that  both

sides  to a question must be heard; that in  these

cases - the  ones  which I have  cited  earlier - both

sides  were not heard. A police officer was heard.

What he said was probably true, but it should have

been given to the person against whom these things

were said in order that he could either say yes or

no,  and further that he might be asked in  camera

whether  or  not  he had taken into  consideration

this, that or the other. When a thing is heard  in

camera to the exclusion of the public, it does not

mean  that  it is heard in camera to the exclusion

of  the  interested party. In many delicate  cases

the  court is cleared. But you cannot have a court

where  the  interested parties have been  cleared,

and then proceed to hear evidence in camera in the

absence of the person against whom allegations are

made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission said it called me up on 13th

February, 1958. Yes, it did, and I was surprised because nothing specific



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>



was  put  to  me. "Did gangsters paint the  P.A.P.

symbol  in Trengganu Street?" I said, "No, not  to

my knowledge." "Well, we want to find out, that is

all."  Many of the findings were never put to  me.

In  my  opinion, although the Commission may  have

been right in not putting it to me because it  was

not  an allegation against me, it should have been

put to the man who was then - not at the time of the

hearing of the Commission, but at the time of  the

by-election - a Committee member of a P.A.P. branch.

It  is  stated in paragraph 35 at page 17  of  the Command Paper:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to information from Police sources

described  as  reliable,  Mr  Lee  Kuan  Yew  was

supported  by members of secret societies  of  108

Group  and  members of 969 secret  society  of  24

Group  of the Cantonese section of Chinatown,  who

canvassed  for  votes  for  him  and  put  up  his

posters. One Police report was to the effect  that

Mr  Ho  Beh Swee was supplying food, refreshments

and  cigarettes to members of the  Sio  Eng  Hiong

secret society of 108 Group."



<br><br>Well,  Mr Ho Beh Swee should have been called  up

and  asked, "Did you supply?", even though it  may

have  been irrelevant to me. As far as I  was  con

cerned, it was res inter alios acta, but as far as

Ho  Beh  Swee  was concerned, this allegation  had

been  made  and  published. He was never  told  of

this, in fact, if it had been mentioned to me that

this  was  said about Ho Beh Swee,  I  would  have

brought  him along to be cross-examined  on  this;

but  he was never called. That is what I am asking

the  House, to note with regret, and I am glad  to

hear  the  Member for Tiong Bahru agrees  with  me

that 95 per cent of this report may be correct.  I

said  that  at  the outset, and in fact,  I  think

Members  of  this House were taken off balance  by

the very calculated stand which he did take at the

opening,  namely, that whilst all  this  had  been

said  and done, the substance was correct and  the

only  regret was that the thing was not done in  a

way which made it beyond reproach. It is not rules

of  evidence, as the Attorney-General knows, but it

is a fundamental principle of natural justice - andi

alterem  partem. He knows that; I do not  have  to

teach     him.    But    the    Chief     Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



may  not  know  it.  It is not laid  down  in  the

Evidence Ordinance of the Colony of Singapore, but

it is a fundamental principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, and this is a matter for even greater

regret,  these  witnesses who  sought  secrecy  in

camera.  Surely they were not afraid to  meet  the

persons  against  whom  they  were  saying   these

things.  They  were police officers, and  probably

amongst  them  was the Officer i/c of  the  Secret

Societies Branch whom I had summoned for  help  in

order  to prevent breaches of the peace.  If  this

officer  was  afraid to meet Mr Ho Beh  Swee,  or

other  members of the Tanjong Pagar Committee  who

were  in charge of the elections, and against whom

he  might have said something, then there is  some

thing seriously wrong with the police force. I can

expect individuals like To Tung Tak, or whoever it

is  who  associated with the Member for  Cairnhill

and  the Member for Tiong Bahru, to be unhappy  at

saying  something about Mr X.Y.Z. in the latter's

presence.  These  were  police  officers,  trained

personnel of the law, and I do not understand  why

their   evidence  was  not  put  to  the   persons concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say this at the outset. Many

speakers,  including, I may say with some  regret,

the Chief Minister, have implied that I have noted

with  regret, because I was involved and I am  now

trying to exculpate myself. No, Sir,If the report

is  read, nowhere is it said that Mr Lee Kuan Yew

went to see the headman of so and so. There is  no

such allegation. It is alleged that some gangsters

went  there and helped, and I would have  been  as

interested as anybody else, for I would  have  had

the  opportunity to go into the evidence. And this

is  police  evidence. Surely the  Attorney-General

has   to  admit  that  if  police  officers   need

protection  from the public and from an interested

party -  be  it  me or Mr Ho Beh Swee - then  I  say

something  is seriously wrong with the instruments

of policy of the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I still intend to proceed with the first

limb  of  my  motion, because I think I  am  fully

justified  in taking note of it; but  in  view  of

what  the  Attorney-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>

General has  said,  I  do  not

intend, with the leave  of  the House, to proceed with  the  second

limb of my motion, namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"and that this House urges the Government to take

action  against the persons whom the  report  says

the  Police have reliable evidence of their having

solicited and paid for the assistance of gangsters

in their elections."

The  Attorney-General has said that the police  in

fact have reliable police evidence, but not of the

nature that could be produced in a criminal court,

and  I  therefore  beg leave to  expunge  from  my

motion the second limb as stated above. I think  I

need  the  consent  of the House,  under  Standing

Orders, not to proceed with the second limb and  I

shall  be  obliged if Members will indicate  their

consent. This is out of respect for a law  officer

who  has  informed me, according to the  evidence.

But  as  to the first limb of my motion, I see  no

reasons whatsoever why this error should have been

committed, particularly in view of the  nature  of

the witnesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I would like to say this: if the Chief

Minister  says  he believes that  this  report  is

correct, then it is a matter for some considerable

regret  that he has not expelled Mr Keng Ban  Ee

from his Party. The report says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"According to information from two separate

Police   sources   described  as  reliable,   this

candidate  sought and obtained the  assistance  of

one Jiman Bin Simen alias Panjang, the Headman  of

329  secret society of 36 Group, and promised  him

that if he was successful in the election he would

present  him with a motorcar as a reward  for  his

help.  Jiman  enlisted members of his  own  secret

society, as well as members of secret societies of 24  Group operating in Jalan Besar area, to assist

Mr  Keng Ban Ee. Mr Keng Ban Ee himself admitted

that   Jiman  had  helped  him  in  his   election

campaign, and had been in charge of one area ...".



<br><br>Why  has  he not been expelled? What is  he  still

doing as a respected and honourable member  of  a

not  quite  so respected and honourable  Party - the Labour Front?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Members on this side of the House - the

Member  for Cairnhill, the Member for Tiong Bahru,

and  the other candidate, Mr Chong Wee Ling - I can

only  quote the Secretary-General of the  Liberal-Socialist  Party  the  day when  this  report  was

published, "I hang my head in shame." And  he  had

reasons    to    hang   his   head    in    shame.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The hon. Member has in effect

suggested that this motion should be considered as

two motions and that, with the leave of the House,

he  wishes to withdraw the second motion. I  think

that  is  perfectly in order, and therefore  I  am

treating this motion as two motions. I will  first

take the second motion which is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"and that this House urges the Government to take

action  against the persons whom the  report  says

the  Police have reliable evidence of their having

solicited and paid for the assistance of gangsters

in their elections."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member has asked leave that that motion

be  withdrawn. Have I the assent of  hon.  Members that that motion be withdrawn?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Aye.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That motion is accordingly

withdrawn. We are then left with the first  motion

and I will put it to the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House notes with regret that the

Commission  of  Inquiry into Corrupt,  Illegal  or

Undesirable  Practices at Elections had  made  its

report  (Sessional  Paper  No.  Cmd.  7  of  1958)

without  giving  to some of the  persons,  against

whom   allegations  were  made  in   secret,   the

opportunity to know of such evidence and to cross-examine  such witnesses and to confront them  with contrary evidence."



<br><br>put, and negatived.

<div align="center"><b>INQUIRY INTO TRADE DISPUTE AT SINGAPORE HARBOUR BOARD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Implementation of recommendations)</b></div>



<br><br>4.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this motion which stands in my

name  is  a sequel to the motion which I moved  in

this House in April this year. On that occasion  I

had  the unanimous support of all Members of  this

House urging the Singapore Harbour Board to accept

and implement the recommendations of the Court  of

Inquiry  which  inquired into the dispute  between

the  Singapore  Harbour Board  and  the  Singapore

Harbour  Board Staff Association. With the Kallang

by-election on, and the proposed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



United  Socialist  Front  which  is  a  new

ganging - up  of  the old actors  on  the  political

stage,  it  would be sanguine of me to expect  the

same unanimity in getting this motion through this

House. I have come here today prepared to meet the

kind  of  niggling excuses from  Members  who  had

pledged, in April, to support me in such a  motion

if  in fact by the next sitting of the House,  the

Singapore  Harbour Board had not  implemented  the

recommendations of the Court of Inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should be acquainted with the real core of the

dispute  before  I go into the specific  findings.

And  quite  frankly  I  do  not  think  the  Chief

Minister, as Minister for Labour and Welfare, will

disagree  if I said that the real core,  the  real

reason  why this thing has blossomed in  this  way

with a threatened strike, is because the Singapore

Harbour  Board wants to break Mr Jamit Smgh,  who

is the Secretary-General of the Staff Association,

and  the Chief Minister is thoroughly dissatisfied

with  Mr Jamit Singh's conduct and is not in  the

least  bit  inclined to intervene or  prevent  the

Singapore  Harbour  Board Staff  Association  from

beating  the  brains out of Mr Jamit Singh.  That

briefly and succinctly is the position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I can view with equanimity the

breaking  of  any individual trade union  official

provided it is fair and he asked for what  he  was

going  to get. But I will not view with equanimity

a  move calculated to destroy someone who happened

to    have    displeased   the   Chief   Minister,

particularly if it involves at the same  time  the

breaking up of a union; and that is what in effect

the Singapore Harbour Board intends to do, and the

Chief Minister intends to sit back and let them do it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the strike has been called off because

the  Singapore Trade Union Congress  had  made  an

appeal  that  there should be no strike  and  that

avenues  should be explored for settling  it.  But

let  us  be  frank and honest. The real reason  is

that the Singapore Harbour Board says, `Well,  all

right,  this is the time. Let's call  in  all  the blacklegs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



and  you, the Government, give us all the arms  of

the police, Singapore Harbour Board Reserve and so

on,  and we'll break them up. Let's see who wins.'

The   Union,  quite  wisely,  took  stock  of  the

position and thought that the time for a fight was

perhaps some other day on some other occasion. But

that  does  not  absolve - although  the  fight   is

avoided   because   the   Union   understood   the

inappropriateness of the time - it does not  absolve

the   Ministry  of  Labour  and  Welfare  nor  the

Minister  himself  from responsibility  in  seeing

that  this  dispute is solved in a way which  does

credit  to courts of inquiries, which does  credit

to peaceful methods of solving labour disputes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the core of the dispute that remains

outstanding is briefly this. Now there are 10 men,

9 to 10 men - my  list shows 9, the Chief Minister says  10-men

who  have  not been reinstated, none of them.  The

Chief  Minister says that is because the Singapore

Harbour  Board cannot find the men.  I  have  been

plagued  and  pestered by these men every  time  I

went  to  the Singapore Harbour Board  Staff  Asso

ciation  and  I  am astounded that  the  Singapore

Harbour  Board Chairman cannot find  them  because

they have been told time and time again to present

themselves - which they did - and never  succeeded  in

getting  employment  and reinstated.  And  I  have

offered  to, and I will give the names,  addresses

and  present the list. I do not know if the  Chief

Minister would consider this is harassing tactics,

but  if he wishes, I will lead the nine people  to

his  office, to prove to him that they  are  still

there waiting for jobs. But if he feels that  this

is  not gentlemanly, then I will just provide  him

with the names and addresses and hope that he will

do something about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that is just the fringe of the dispute. The

real  dispute  is: does the Union,  the  Singapore

Harbour  Board  Staff Association,  represent  the

majority  of  workers  in  the  Harbour  Board  to

warrant  recognition?  And  the  reason  why   the

Chairman of the Harbour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



Board  has  refused to meet the Union to  talk  it

over  is  because it appears that if he meets  the

Union he has, ex hypothesi, acknowledged that  the

Union  represented the daily-rated workers,  which

he  does  not acknowledge, therefore he  will  not

meet the Union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, there is a recommendation here that

there should be a joint negotiating machinery  and

that  a ballot should be taken to see who or which

is  the  union the majority of the members of  the

Singapore Harbour Board staff support. I asked the

question  last year of the Chief Minister  and  he

said  he  was enquiring from the trade  unions  to

find   out   their  views  because   although   he

understood that this was the practice in  America,

he  was  not quite sure whether it was appropriate

here.  Well,  Sir, since then at the Ford  factory

the  employers have agreed with the employees that

that  would  be  a  very convenient  and  suitable

method and a ballot was taken. Secondly, the Trade

Union Congress has issued a statement, not just on

the  initiative of the Secretary who might be said

may  be sympathetic to the Singapore Harbour Board

Staff  Association, but after it had gone  through

the governing council of the Trade Union Congress,

that  the  taking of a ballot is a fit and  proper

method  of  finding out whether  or  not  a  union

represents  the  majority  of  members   under   a

particular employer. And I would like very briefly

and  simply to have the answer of the Minister for

Labour and Welfare. In view of these developments,

does  he  intend to make further inquiries?  I  am

quite  sure  the answer is yes. How long  will  he

take? Will it go on until next year by which  time

a decision may never have been taken by him?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I said before that there is a lot of

politics involved in all this and it came out very

clearly   to  the  forefront  recently  when   the

Singapore  Harbour Board, almost  in  a  state  of

desperation, said, `Ah, well, never  mind  if  the

Union  goes  on strike.' It has got a  negotiating

committee already with six other Unions which  the

Court       of       Inquiry       had       found



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>



did  not represent any sizeable proportion, or any

proportion  at all, of the members of the  Harbour

Board.  Now,  in the appendix to the  report,  the

Court  set  out  the membership  register  of  the

Unions  which  the Singapore Harbour Board  claims

represent its employees. If I may just briefly run

through it, on page 10 of the report:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHBLU (Singapore Harbour Board Labour

Union) - number  of  members  on  the  books,   491;

Registrar of Trade Unions states 322 probably  old

members,  169 new members, another register  shows

316 members, membership declining rapidly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SW&SLU (Ship Wharf and Ship Labour Union) - number

of  members, 325; subscriptions book inspected  by

Registrar  of  Trade  Unions;  in  the  light   of

subscription receipts, membership declining.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSCET (Confederation of the Singapore Chinese

Engineering Tradesmen) - number of members, 292; Registrar of Trade Unions

unable  to  say whether all working for  Singapore

Harbour Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HBEU of S (Harbour Board Employees Union of

Singapore) - number   of  members,   270;   official

notification  of  this  figure  not  submitted  to

Registrar of Trade Unions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MSU (Malay Seamen's Union of Singapore) - number

of members, 117; this figure said by the Secretary

of  the  Union to represent employees of Singapore

Harbour Board; Registrar of Trade Unions unable to

say whether this statement correct. States however

that  only  16 members appeared to have  paid  subscription.  The  remainder  paid  no  subscription

during 1957, and many paid nothing at all for  the last 2 or 3 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHBEWU (Singapore Harbour Board Engineering

Workmen's  Union) - number  of  members,  34;  after

September 1956 nobody paid subscriptions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHBS & WWU (Singapore Harbour

Board Stevedore and Wharf Workers'

Union) - number of members, 307; only

62 applications for membership duly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



completed. Registrar of Trade Unions said that  he

was  told by officials of the union that  245  who

had  defaulted had recommenced to pay subscription

in June - just before the inquiry started. And the

sum  total  of all that book membership  does  not

clear 1,200 members out of a total labour force of

over 8,000 members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, how long can one pretend that these

Unions  exist when they do not, that  members  are

there when they are not? The question of principle

which  the  Minister for Labour and  Welfare  must

decide  is  this:  is  he prepared  to  allow  the

employer  to  take  advantage  of  the  organs  of

Government  to  break a union, when  in  fact  the

Court  of  Inquiry has recommended that  a  ballot

should  be  taken to see whether or not the  Union

has  the support of the majority of members of the

Harbour  Board? Is the Minister  for  Labour  and

Welfare prepared to stand back and tell the Board,

'Yes,  that's  right.  You  carry  on  with   this

negotiating machinery with six unions that  really

do not exist, and refuse to negotiate with the one

union that does exist'?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no possibility for the Minister for

Labour and Welfare escaping responsibility by  his

saying,  `Ah, well, this is a matter  between  the

employer  and  the Union', because in  this  parti

cular case the Court of Inquiry had been appointed

by both sides. And I would like to remind him that

I  saw  him before the Court was appointed;  there

was  delay in its appointment and he told me  that

the  delay  was  because he  had  been  unable  to

persuade the Singapore Harbour Board to accept the

recommendations  in advance,  because  he  saw  no

point  in  appointing a court  unless  both  sides

agreed  to accept its recommendations in  advance.

Subsequently  it  did and then  he  appointed  the

Court.  He  cannot absolve himself from the  moral

responsibility of seeing that the Court  which  he

appointed after both sides had promised to  accept

its   recommendations  does  in  fact   have   its

recommendations accepted by both  parties  to  the

dispute.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House condemns the unreasonable and

obstructive  attitude  of  the  Singapore  Harbour

Board  in  not  complying with the recommendations

contained  in the Report of the Court  of  Inquiry

(Sessional  Paper  No.  S  7  of  1957)   as   was

unanimously urged in this House on the 24th day of

April, 1958, and calls upon the Government to take

steps  to  compel the Singapore Harbour  Board  to

comply with the recommendations in that Report.



<br><br>4.40 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Sir, I second the motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.41 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and Welfare (Dr Lim Yew Hock): Mr Speaker, Sir, the dispute between the

Singapore Harbour Board Staff Association and  the

Singapore  Harbour Board has been the  subject  of

many  speeches in this House; even as far back  as

December last year, the hon. Member for Queenstown

painted  a  very  sorry  picture  of  the  workers

belonging  to  this  particular staff  association

going  on  a  hunger strike on the advice  of  its

General  Secretary. I have listened to the  points

brought forth by the hon, mover of the motion  and

it  would  appear from his speech that  there  are

only  two  main  points to be  settled,  and  that

because  of  the fact that these two  main  points

have  not been settled, he felt it incumbent  upon

him to move the motion standing in his name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what is the first point? He said that nine

persons  had not yet been reemployed. He  said  in

this  House that these nine persons had  presented

themselves to the Harbour Board and had  not  been

taken  back.  I understand from the Harbour  Board

that   these  nine  persons  have  not   presented

themselves  and that they were not able  to  trace

them   although  registered  letters   have   been

addressed to them. Representatives of the  Harbour

Board  Staff Association came to see  me  about  a

week ago on this point, too. I pointed out to them

that  the Harbour Board could not reemploy  people

who could not be found, and if they were really in

evidence,  they  should present  themselves.  They

suggested to me about a week ago that they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



would  bring  the  nine men to  my  office  on  my

undertaking  to take these nine men  back  to  the

Harbour  Board.  It is not a harassing  tactic  at

all.  In  fact  I welcome it. I suggested  to  the

representatives who saw me that if they felt it infra dig, for them to bring the nine men to see the

Chairman  of  the Harbour Board, they could  bring

them  to  me and I would bring them to the Harbour

Board and see that they get re-employed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that much for the first point, that nine

men  will  be  re-employed if  they  will  present

themselves,  and  if the hon. Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar will bring them to my office, it will indeed

be my duty and my pleasure to see that they are re-employed by the Harbour Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming down to the second point which is of

greater  importance - the  taking  of  a  ballot  to

ascertain  whether or not a union  represents  the

majority of employees in a particular organisation

- the  hon. Member quoted the Ford Company and said

that  there balloting had been accepted.  The  two

cases  are not the same. In the case of  the  Ford

Company,  what  was required was  to  satisfy  the

employer that the majority of the workers belonged

to  the union or desired to be represented by  the

union. In the case of the Harbour Board, there are

seven  different  unions,  although  it  must   be

admitted  that the Singapore Harbour  Board  Staff

Association was the first union to be registered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the first union to be registered but its

membership  was only thrown open to  clerical  and

cognate   workers,  never,  never  to  daily-rated

employees until the present General Secretary came

on the scene. How did he bring it about? He did so

by  a  change in the constitution of the Singapore

Harbour Board Staff Association to embrace  daily-rated  employees. He started with the registration

of  a new union called the Singapore Harbour Board

Workers   Union  for  daily-rated  employees.   He

operated   from  the  premises  of  the  Singapore

Harbour Board Staff Association.



I  do  not like to go into the manipulations  that

have  been  taking place in the Singapore  Harbour Board Workers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



Union   and  into  what  has  happened   to   that

particular  union, but what is more  important  to

the  issue  is that under our present Trade  Union

Ordinance only seven persons are required to  sign

an application form, to organise a trade union. To

agree  that a ballot should be taken of  employees

in   any   organisation  when  there  are  already

registered   trade  unions  representing   certain

sections of employees in that organisation  is  to

allow a particular union to work in such a way  as

to  (I would not like to say intimidate because it

is   so  difficult  to  prove)  capture  all   the

employees  in the organisation. This is definitely

wrong  and  I, as Minister for Labour and  Welfare

and  as  a  man  connected with  the  trade  union

movement  for  so  many years, have  come  to  the

conclusion, quite reluctantly, that the taking  of

such  a  ballot in the Singapore Harbour Board  is

not in the best interests of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we blame the Singapore Harbour Board on this

point,  blame  them for something  for  which  the

Minister - I  myself - have taken  the  full  responsibility? The only thing that can be levelled at the

Harbour  Board today is the re-employment  of  the

nine  persons, but the Harbour Board has said time

and  time  again that these nine men will  be  re-employed  if they can be found, if they will  just

present themselves. Let us not cloud the issue  by

saying that the hon. Member for Tanjong Pagar  has

a   list   of  the  nine  names.  When   the   two

representatives  of  the Singapore  Harbour  Board

Staff  Association came to see me they  said  that

they  would  produce the nine men and I  am  still

waiting  for them to do so. Produce the  nine  men

and  the first point to the motion would have been

answered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I do not like to criticise the activities

of  any trade union leader. I do not like it.  But

when  it  becomes abundantly clear to me that  the

activities  of  any  trade  union  leader  is  not

directed  in  the interests of a trade  union  but

directed in his personal interests, I must  resist

any attempt at intimidation to force me to toe the

line.  The  General  Secretary  of  the  Singapore

Harbour  Board Staff Association saw me  and  said

that if I would just call a meeting of the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



Harbour  Board and the Staff Association  he

would  withdraw the strike notice. In other words,

he put the onus on me that if I do not call a meet

ing,  the strike would take place and I should  be held responsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not the way to conduct a trade union. If

it is genuinely felt that a trade dispute requires

strike action, go ahead, but do not do it in  such

a  way  as  to hoodwink the workers. He  has  been

running back and forth. Every time he goes back to

the  Staff Association, he says, `Ha! ha!  I  have

got  this  okay.  Boleh, la, boleh  menang;  tungu

sekijap,  boleh  menang.' It is not  necessary  to

bluff the workers like that. It is not necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again it is most significant that the strike

notice  expires this morning and I would ask  hon.

Members  to  take note of that. Not  content  with

trying  to intimidate the Minister for Labour  and

Welfare, there is this attempt to intimidate  this

House  into accepting a motion which is definitely

most unfair and unfounded.

<br><br>4.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I moved an

amendment  to  the  motion at  the  April  sitting

urging  the Singapore Harbour Board to  carry  out

the recommendations of the Court of Inquiry. I was

most  elated  by the result of the  resolution.  I

believe  that  workers must work in order  to  get

their pay. Workers must stand together, unite,  in

order  that they may better their lot. But I  also

believe  that when they stand together to  bargain

for  what  would  be  more favourable  conditions,

there are also people who will come in to make use

of  them  in order to further their own  political

aims.  I  am against this sort of manoeuvring.  We

are for the workers. We want them to have a higher

standard  of  living. We want them to  be  treated

fairly  but  we do not want them to  be  tools  of

people who promote their own interests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard the case of the Singapore Harbour

Board  presented to us many times. We  have  heard

that  on  the  orders of the Secretary,  the  paid

Secretary,   Harbour   Board   workers   went   on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>



strike.  They received no pay but I would like  to

know  whether the paid Secretary received his pay.

They had on his orders went on a hunger strike.  I

would  like  to know whether the man  who  ordered

them  on hunger strike also refrained from  taking

food, or that he must grow stronger at the expense

of the followers who were sacrificed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we have before us a complaint that there

are  workers  who  have not been given  jobs  even

after  the  Court of Inquiry had recommended  that

they should be re-employed. There are two sides of

the  question. One side says they are there.  They

have  presented themselves but there are no  jobs.

On  the  other  hand,  we  have  heard  the  Chief

Minister  say that he would take them to  the  Harbour  Board if they would come to see him and they

would  have their jobs back. If this is the  case,

then   there  is  no  complaint  whatsoever.   The

complaint should be withdrawn. In fact I was  also

interviewed  one  day  by the officials  concerned

about  the loss of jobs, but after inquiring  from

sources I did find that the claims had not been as

true as they should be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And under such circumstances, bringing of a

motion  and putting up a complaint like this  when

there  is  assurance from the Minister for  Labour

and  Welfare  that they will be given  back  their

jobs  is  wasting  the time of  this  Assembly.  I

personally  think  that this dispute  is  not  one

between  the  labourers and the Singapore  Harbour

Board; it arose from the General Secretary wanting

a pass to get in and out of the Harbour Board; and

when   he  could  not  get  the  pass,  it   means

everything in this world to him - there is a loss of

prestige  and the workers must suffer  until  such

time  when he has restored himself in the eyes  of

his   workers  as  the  all-powerful  man  in  the

Singapore Harbour Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point I heard, and from a very unbiased

stand,  is that the Singapore Harbour Board should

recognise  this union or that union; or one  union

must  be allowed to represent the workers  to  the

exclusion  of the other unions. Well,  if  we  are

going to do that, then let



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



us  have a change in the trade union laws and  say

that  if  there are two unions existing,  then  we

must cancel one. But so long as the law agrees  to

allow people to form trade unions, then every  one

of  the  trade unions should have standing in  the

eyes of the law and the authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am not going to talk about

recognition  of these unions at length.  The  most

important matter is not the recognition of unions,

but  that every worker should have a job! If there

are  not  enough jobs to go round, then no  matter

whether you have one union or many unions, it will

bring  us  no nearer to what we want. It will  not

help the workers a little bit! We must have unions

that  really fight for the workers. But, if unions

are there to see that the workers are not going to

get  what  they  want, but what the leaders  want,

then I am sure Singapore will be happier if we  do

not  have such people who call themselves  leaders

of unions. These are the bogus leaders!



<br><br>5 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> In reply, Sir, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  am sorry to say that I waited in vain  to

hear some coherent argument why the recommendation

of this Court of Inquiry should be flouted, but at

least I have the satisfaction of pinning the  Hon.

the  Chief  Minister down to  a  flat  refusal  to

implement  the  finding that  there  should  be  a

ballot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me, before I go into the argument, just

read  to the Hon. the Chief Minister and his  new-found colleague (the Member for Serangoon) on  the issue of recognition. I am reading now from page 7 of Sessional Paper No. S 7 of 1957:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div align="center">"THE ISSUE OF RECOGNITION</div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) It is because of the disorder in ad

ministration  that  it was  difficult  for  us  to

arrive at a clear-cut finding on the issue related

to the second term of reference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) It was quite clear that the seven unions.

namely, the Singapore Harbour Board Labour  Union,

the  Singapore  Wharf and Ship Labour  Union,  the

Singapore   Harbour  Board  Stevedore  and   Wharf

Workers' Union, the Confederation of the Singapore Chinese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



Engineering Tradesmen, the Singapore Harbour Board

Engineering  Workmen's Union, the  Malay  Seamen's

Union of Singapore and the Harbour Board Employees

Union of Singapore, were not representative of all

daily-rated employees of the SHB, nor in  fact  do

they  represent  a  majority or  even  a  sizeable

proportion of such group of workers."



<br><br>Sir, I repeat the last words of that sentence - "not

representative of all daily-rated employees of the

SHB, nor in fact do they represent a majority,  or

even  a  sizeable  proportion, of  such  group  of

workers."  I  had read earlier to this  House  the

finding  of  the  book membership of  the  various

unions  involved and what I hope to hear from  the

Minister for Labour and his supporter (the  Member

for  Serangoon) is why is that finding wrong,  and

why  should  that finding be rejected,  and  as  a

corollary   to  that  finding  why   should   this

recommendation  be  rejected.  The  recommendation

reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... We would suggest that such evidence be

collected  in  the  form of  a  secret  ballot  by

members whose names appear on the membership cards

of  the  SHBWU  [Singapore Harbour Board  Workers'

Union]  and  the  SHBSA [Singapore  Harbour  Board

Staff  Association].  The  question  to  be  asked

should  be  whether or not each one of  these  men

supports  the  SHBSA. The ballot could  be  easily

arranged by the Ministry of Labour in co-operation

with  the  Registrar  of  Trade  Unions  and   the

Supervisor of Elections."



<br><br>That   very  clearly  and  simply  sets  out   the

recommendations which the Hon. the Chief  Minister

said  that the Singapore Harbour Board had  agreed

beforehand  to  accept, and which the  Member  for

Serangoon  (Mr Lim Choon Mong), in  a  debate  on

24th  April,  1958, said that he  would  urge  the

Harbour Board to accept and implement and that  if

it  did  not do so by the next sitting,  he  would

support  me  in  a stronger motion to  compel  the

Harbour Board to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the Hon. the Chief Minister has given

reasons - I  do  not know whether it  is  1�  or  2�

reasons - why  the ballot should not be implemented.

First  of  all,  he  said  the  Ford  Company  was

slightly different because the ballot was taken as

there was no other union involved and therefore it

was  taken just to find out whether more than half the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



members  were in the union. I should have  thought

that  if  there  were  more  unions  involved,   a

fortiori  it  would be very necessary  to  have  a

ballot  to find out which of the unions have  more

than half the membership but it seems that this is

the  reason why it should not be allowed. But  the

real  reason - the first one is just a half  reason,

the  second one is the real reason and I give  him

one  point  for that - he has decided in  his  words

that  it is now (after dilly-dallying for  a  year

and  more)  not  in  the  best  interests  of  the

workers.  I  thought that was what  the  Court  of

Inquiry  was supposed to do - to find out  what  was

the  best thing to do in the interests of both the

workers  and  the employers and this  is  what  it

suggested.  The  Hon. the Chief  Minister  for  no

rhyme  or  reason now tells the House - but  for  no

obvious  rhyme or reason although there  are  some

not  so very obvious ones, that I can have a  good

guess  at - that it is not necessary to go  on  with

this,  and  that  it is not in the best  interest,

because there are six other unions already  there,

and  that he is not going to allow any trade union

official   to  capture  the  membership   or   the

potential  staff. In his own words, he  would  not

allow  any  trade union official  to  capture  the

workers for his union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I thought that is the purpose of a

union. When a union is formed, the first thing  it

wants  to  do  is  to  expand membership.  When  a

political  party is formed, it is formed  for  the

purpose  of collecting members. If, of course,  it

fails in collecting members, then a new one has to

be  formed for the same original purpose.  He  now

says  that  that  is  a  reprehensible  object  to

achieve, and particularly as it is likely that the

object  has  already been achieved,  he  will  not

allow a ballot to be taken. Let us face the facts.

If on taking a ballot the Staff Association is not

expected  to  get half the ballot  and  these  six

piddling  unions were expected to get the  members

to  support  them, then I suggest to the  Minister

that  his stand would definitely be that it is  in

the  interests of the workers to have a ballot and

he  would  have arranged for it long  ago.  It  is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



because he expects a ballot to expose the emptiness

of  the  six  unions, with whom  I  am  told  some

Labour  Front  types  are  associated,  that   the

ballot  will not be taken. I expected the Minister

for  Labour to take this line eventually and I  am

sorry  that  he  was forced to  take  it  in  this

debate.  But I am even sorrier to note the  Member

for Serangoon who is a great preacher of moral re-armament  principles reminding me -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Correction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - "Never mind who is right. What is right is the issue," and

in a matter such as this, he has failed to see what is right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it on a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> No, Sir. It is a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> No, I do not really want him to

try to denounce the moral re-armament movement just

because  I have let it out that he is in favour  of

it.  If he wishes to denounce it at some subsequent

date,  I  think he could choose a more  appropriate

occasion.  But he did tell us in a debate  on  24th

April that he would not want to take sides and that

he  wanted  to  see  what was  just  and  fair.  In

Hansard, Volume 3 No. 4, column 351-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Column 315?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Bottom of column 314 and top of column 315, or should I begin

perhaps  for  the  benefit of  hon.  Members  whose

memories  may  have  dimmed on this  subject - column

314, last paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, with many politicians who are

interested  parties coming on the scene,  such  may

not  be  the case all the time, and we may have  to

face a large number of strikes and labour unrest in

future.  This must be avoided. One way of  avoiding

such  a case would be to appoint a court of inquiry to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



find out things. And I would say that in many cases

the  best way to settle a dispute would be  not  to

leave  it  to  the employer and the employee,  both

thinking  that they are right, but to leave  it  to

independent   people,  independent  and   impartial

people  who  have  no axes to grind.  And  I  think

Courts of inquiry should be established:

arbitration  courts  should be established.  And  I

believe  that  one  day  we  must  have  compulsory

arbitration  with a panel of people  agreed  to  by

employers and employees alike, and they will sit to

arbitrate.  And  I  would say that  whatever  their

decision  should  be, both sides  should  agree  to their decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a case where the matter has been brought

up  to a court. The court has set out its findings,

the court has made its recommendations. It consists

of  people trusted by all sides and I think that it

would  be  wrong for any party not  to  accept  the

recommendations of such a Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"... We would like to urge the Harbour Board to

accept  those recommendations."-



<br><br>This is the middle of the last paragraph of his speech:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It will create a good precedent for other

employers and employees to follow if we have courts

of  arbitration  or enquiry appointed  at  a  later date."



<br><br>And  so he moves his amendment. We forgive many  of

his  failings because he is so obviously a sincere,

if  often a misled man. We know that he is  genuine

about youth clubs, he does worry about them. He may

not  know  much  about other  things  in  life  but

nevertheless  he tries very hard to  do  the  right

things. As he was, at one time, so very anxious  to

impress  upon me - "Never mind who is right. What  is

right,"  says  he, and I am quoting it  back  as  a

moral  re-armament principle which he  has  quoted.

Never  mind whether the Chief Minister is right  or

the  General  Secretary  of the  Singapore  Harbour

Board  is right! What is right is already  what  he

stated  the last time, that the recommendations  of

the  Court  should be accepted and implemented.  If

this  is the price he has to pay to join the United

Socialists Front - he has his basic relief  in  moral

re-armament - then I say that he is really  embarking

on  a most hazardous adventure that he may yet live to regret.

<div align="center"><b>SECRETARY OF THE SYNOD OF THE DIOCESE OF SINGAPORE BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objects and reasons for this private Bill

are incorporated in the Bill itself and are set

out in the recitals. Briefly they are as follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January, 1949, there was set up a Synod in

the Diocese of Singapore as the local body, which

is the proper body to manage the land and premises

to which it is entitled. Until now, under the

Bishop of Singapore Ordinance of 1911, the

Anglican Bishop of Singapore has been the body

corporate vested with the power to manage the

buildings belonging to the Diocese. This is not

really the function of the Bishop but the function

of the Synod of the Diocese which, as I have

already stated, is a local body properly

responsible for conveyancing,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



collection of rents, payments  of  quit

rents  on properties and the general carrying  out

of these duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 5 of this Bill, it is expressly stated

that the Bishop of Singapore shall be divested  of

the lands hereditaments and premises specified  in

the  Schedule and all rights estates and interests

therein   and  these  shall  be  vested   in   the

Corporation, that is to say, the Secretary of  the

Synod of the Diocese of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a straightforward Bill and I think there is no need to add anything more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of

Mr Speaker as Chairman and such Members as may be

nominated by the Committee of Selection. [Mr John Ede].

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE IMPROVEMENT TRUST IN RELATION TO HOUSING POLICY</b></div>



<br><br>5.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I refer to my question tabled at

this sitting for a written answer this morning and

I   have  since  received  the  answer  from   the

Minister.        My        question         reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To ask the Minister for Local Government, Lands

and   Housing   to   state  the  number   of   properties

allocated    by    the   Singapore   Improvement    Trust

during  the  period  1st  January  to  30th  June,  1958,

excluding   those   allocated   to   fire   victims   and

persons   served   with  demolition   orders   and   shop

houses, showing  the  names and  the  number  of  points

awarded   in   respect   of  each   of   the   successful

applicants    together    with    the    house    numbers

(addresses)  of  the  premises  allocated  to   each   of the applicants."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



And this is the answer I received this morning:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am informed by the Trust that 1,144 dwelling

units  and  66  business premises  were  allocated

during the period 1st January, 1958, to 30th June,

1958.  Of  these,  543  units  were  allocated  to

applicants  from the housing register,  while  the

balance of 671 units were allocations to rehousing

eases  (including  fire  victims),  families  from

clearance areas, transferees, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the request for names and points

awarded,  I  would refer the Member for Queenstown

to  my written answer to his previous question  on

the  same subject on the 17th July, 1957; also  to

my   oral   answer  to  his  question  on   public

inspection  of the applications register.  I  have

nothing to add to these answers."



<br><br>Sir,  the  answer refers to a similar question  of

mine  dated 17th July, 1957 and this is the answer

I got from the Minister at that time:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I am informed by the Singapore Improvement

Trust  that  the  Trust has let  no  new  premises

during the period January/June, 1957, and that any

lettings  during  this period have  been  to  fill

casual  vacancies or in connection with  transfers

only.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trust considers it highly undesirable to

divulge  information as to the names of applicants

who    have    been   successful   in    obtaining

accommodation in vacated premises or the names  of

tenants   who  have  been  transferred  to   other

premises."



<br><br>Sir,  the reply now means that it is the  same  as

what  I  got  last year - "highly undesirable".  Why

should it be "highly undesirable"? Why should  the

public not know about the allocation of houses  by

the  S.I.T. and the points awarded to applicants?

The question is this, Sir:

the S.I.T. works in secret. If the Minister is  to

say  that it is highly undesirable for applicants'

names  to  be divulged to the public, I may  agree

but after allocation when everybody knows that Mr

So  and so has got a house, then why should it  be

undesirable to divulge the name of that successful

applicant? I cannot see why? Why should it be made

a  secret? In market or in some other allocations,

I   am  quite  sure  that  immediately  after   an

allocation  is  made, the names of the  successful

applicants are made public but in this case  where

the  S.I.T. is `concerned, everything is kept very

secret. Personally I am of the opinion that  there

must be some fishy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



business about this question of allocation.

The Member for Pasir Panjang (Mr Wong Foo Nam) at

one time accused the S.I.T. of corruption. I think

in  this instance there is some sort of corruption

or preference is given to friends in the matter of

allocation. If not, why then should this  question

be treated as top secret? The answer is that there

must  be some sort of underhand work being carried

on by some officers of the S.I.T.: I would not say

that everyone of them is involved in this but some

officers - be they junior or senior officers.  I  do

not  see any harm in making known the names of the

successful  applicants and the  number  of  points

that  they are awarded. There is quite  a  lot  of

dissatisfaction  amongst the  applicants  on  this

question  of  the points system of allocation  and

also  the  fact  that some of them  with  stronger

cases  have  not been given accommodation  whereas

others  with  weaker cases or cases of  a  similar

nature   have  been  successful.  These  are   the

complaints. But according to the Annual Report  of

the  S.I.T., there is no complaint by  the  public

about the points system. I refer to page 19 of the

Annual Report for 1957 of the S.I.T.:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The volume of correspondence in connection with

housing  applications  has  reached  a  total   of

approximately  100 letters per day. When  analysed

the  majority  of  these letters complain  of  the

shortage of premises available for allocation, not

the  points  system  by  which  the  premises  are

allocated."



<br><br>Now,  Sir, if the question of allocation  is  made

public, I am sure that the S.I.T. will not receive

100  letters  per  day. The second  part  of  that

statement says that there are no complaints  about

the  points system. It is just utter nonsense. How

can  the  public complain about the points  system

when  they  are  not told about the actual  points

awarded? How can they know about the points system

and  how  can they complain about it when they  do

not  know  about  it?  It is  not  a  question  of

shortage  of  premises  as  the  S.I.T. has  been

building  thousands of houses but it is a question

of houses not being allotted. The S.I.T. awards  a

number  of points to an applicant. As soon  as  he

applies for a house, he is given a receipt and  on that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



receipt  is quoted  the supposed   number    of  points  awarded to  him but   is   that  figure

which is awarded on the  receipt itself correct? The    correct   points awarded  to  applicants

are kept secret and not known to the applicants or   to  anybody.  That figure  on the  receipt

is just a vague figure.  I will  read what  the Annual   Report    says about    this    points

system. I refer to page 20 of the Report:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The applicant is informed of the points awarded at the time of registration and of the

general  factors  which are  taken into account in  the  assessment  of points.  The  fixed  or

"confirmed       value" points   are   assessed after the investigation of the case and are not  disclosed.'



<br><br>Sir,     after      the  investigation   of    a case, the confirmed  or

fixed  points  are  not disclosed    to     the  applicant.  Now,  in  a statement,  the  S.I.T.

says  that there is  no  complaint   about   the points  system. If  the actual or confirmed  or

fixed points awarded to an applicant are not disclosed to him, how can he know how many points he has been awarded?  The figure on the receipt serves no useful

purpose in any way either to the applicant or to anybody.  Why then have the figure on the

receipt?  In the old days, there was no figure of points awarded shown on the receipts.  Lately, the S.I.T. has adopted a new policy by stating the number of points awarded on the receipts but that that figure is not the "confirmed" or fixed value points. Everything is kept  top secret in the files  of the   S.I.T. and  only known to members of the

Estate Committee of the S.I.T.  Even a  trustee of  the S.I.T. does not know   the  number   of

points   awarded.   Why should it be worked  on such lines, that it  is only the members of the

Estate Committee of the S.I.T. who are told  of the  actual  number  of points    awarded    to applicants?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the allocation of houses by the S.I.T. is strictly based on the points system, then

let the public know the points awarded and they should  not be kept  in suspense  as  to   when

they can expect to  get houses.  If the correct points  are made  known to  the  applicant,  he

knows  his chances  and he will not go round  bothering   Assemblymen and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



City   Councillors.   I have  experienced  many cases  of  people   who come  to me to ask  me,

"When   can  I  get   a house?"  A receipt  may show  eight points  but when  I  write  to  the

S.I.T. they  tell   me that  the eight  points

are  not the actual  or confirmed        points awarded     to      the

applicant:   "We   have within  our  files  the confirmed   or    fixed

points.   That   figure means  nothing at all." So why show that figure

on   the  receipt?   By keeping   this   points system  a  secret,  you

cannot blame the public for    harbouring     a suspicion            of

corruption? How can you blame  them? There  are many  cases in which  I

have  experienced  that an  applicant  with a lower  point  is  given

priority    over     an  applicant with a higher

point.  There are  many  cases of such a nature,  but the point that I am

referring  to  is   the face   value   of   the receipt  and  not   the confirmed  points.   So

that             causes dissatisfaction   among the   applicants.   One applicant will say that

another  applicant  has lesser  points than  he has; then why should he be             allotted

accommodation        in preference    to    his application? This  kind of thing will certainly cause   suspicion   and lead  people  to  think that  there  is  monkey business in the S.I.T.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will draw the attention of the Minister to how applications for

accommodation are dealt with by    the   S.I.T.   An applicant approached me about  one and  a  half years ago. He had about 7  to 8 points on  the face   value   of   his receipt.

I wrote to the S.I.T. about his  case.  The  reply which I  got from them was that  the

applicant   must   wait until the completion of the  Kallang fiats.  He waited until early this

year.  Subsequently   I wrote   again  to   the S.I.T. telling   them that  the Kallang flats

were            nearing completion. They  wrote back  saying that there was  no allocation yet.

The applicant then came and  told me that there was  a  house in Dorset Road  which was  vacant

and  he  asked  me   to write   again  to   the S.I.T. and draw  their attention    to    this

vacant  house.   So   I wrote   to   them   and mentioned   that    the applicant would  prefer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



house  to him, in view of the fact that he  had  8

points?   The  S.I.T. replied  saying  that   his

application  could  not be considered  for  Dorset

Road  or Owen Road and that it could only  be  con

sidered  for the Kallang flats. When the applicant

came to see me again, I told him that I could  not

help  him  any  further. So he approached  another

source which I think the Minister knows very well.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> I do not.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> As I was saying, he

approached another source and, as a result, to the

surprise  of  the Minister, he is now  staying  in

that very same house in Dorset Road about which  I

wrote  to  the  S.I.T.! And  yet  they  said  this

person's application could only be considered  for

the  Kallang  fiats! But when he  approached  that

other source, he got his house in Dorset Road! How

did he manage it? I hope the Minister will tell me

that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government claims that it is a

democratic Government and that it is going to have

a  Housing Authority very soon. How soon we do not

know. We have been told by the Minister again  and

again  that  very  soon a Housing  Authority  will

replace  the S.I.T. I was told that it would  come

in  May. This is now July - two months- a nd there  is

still  no  sign of the tabling of a  Bill  to  the

effect  that a Housing Authority will replace  the

S.I.T. I hope that the Minister in his reply  will

also  inform  us when this Housing Authority  will

come  into  being to replace this  top-secret  and

iron curtain S.I.T.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the S.I.T. work strictly to the points

system, I am quite sure that they will be relieved

of all complaints, irrespective of the shortage of

accommodation.  Members of the Assembly  and  City

Councillors  will similarly be relieved  of  these

complaints, which come into their hands every day,

about  allocation of Trust accommodation. In fact,

I  would have tabled a motion deploring the policy

of  the  S.I.T. on this issue, but because of  the

assurance  given by the Minister that the  Housing

Authority will come into being soon to replace the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>

S.I.T., I have only tabled a motion for the

Adjournment.  I  do  hope that when  this  Housing

Authority  is created there will not be  any  such

policy   as   that   no  one   should   know   how

accommodation  is  allocated and  how  points  are

awarded. All these things should be made public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is about the complaints from the

residents  of  Trust  houses on  Jalan  Teck  Whye

Estate.  I refer to the reply given to me  by  the

Minister  this morning on this point.  I  am  very

glad that of the four complaints enumerated he  is

going to look into complaints Nos. 2, 3 and 4, but

not  No. 1 which concerns excessive heat.  If  the

Minister   can  look  into  three  out   of   four

complaints, why cannot he look into all four?  You

have said you can only look into three.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not think the Speaker has.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> I am so sorry, Sir; I was

referring to the Minister and not to you. From the

reply  given by the Minister, Sir, it  is  evident

that  he agrees that the houses on Jalan Teck Whye

Estate  are  really  hot  and  that  the  heat  is

intolerable, because if he did not agree, he would

not  have  said that, by putting asbestos ceilings

on  these houses, the temperature would be lowered

by  only  two degrees. So he has committed himself

by  agreeing  that  they are hot.  Therefore,  the

blame  should fall on the S.I.T., or the  planners

in  the  S.I.T.  That the houses are  hot  is  not

because  of  the cost or the rents of the  houses,

but it is because of the planning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These complaints from S.I.T. residents about

excessive heat are not the first of their kind.  I

was a resident of one post-war house myself and  I

too  complained  of  excessive  heat.  Within   my

constituency, that is Queenstown, the residents of

Redhill Estate also complain of excessive heat  in

their  houses.  Now,  after  receiving  all  these

complaints of excessive heat, cannot the S.I.T. im

prove  on  the conditions of living? It is  not  a

question  of the extra cost of raising  the  roof.

The  Minister said this morning that  raising  the

roof  would  cost  much more than  putting  on  an

asbestos  ceiling. If at the time of  construction

of   the   houses  the  S.I.T. had   taken   into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



consideration  complaints of excessive  heat  from

other quarters, they could easily have improved on

the construction of the houses and raised the roof

for  purposes of better ventilation and  reduction

of  heat.  Why did not the S.I.T. do this  at  the

time  of  construction? The  result  is  that,  by

providing  cheap  houses, the S.I.T. are  forcing

their tenants to suffer from the heat. I think  it

is  the  policy of the S.I.T. that if you want  to

live  in comfort, thea you must go and five  in  a

big  bungalow;  but if you want  them  to  provide

cheap  houses, then you must live under conditions

which they provide, that is, with a ceiling as low

as eight feet. I went into one of these houses the

other  day,  and at the back of the building,  the

height  of the roof is only about 7 feet 6 inches.

I  ask  the Minister if he can bear to live  in  a

house with a roof only 7 feet 6 inches high,  with

a  ceiling made of zinc or asbestos. The  Minister

is pointing to himself. I am sure he will come out

with a statement that although he is a Minister he

is  staying in a little out-house from a bungalow.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, if a man can have a little out-house  with a bungalow, I am quite sure that  that

out-house  will  be  just as  comfortable  as  the

bungalow itself. It is not the same type of  house

as  that built by the S.I.T., and if the owner  of

that  bungalow cannot build a decent out-house,  I

doubt  he  would  ever build that  out-house.  The

Minister will say that he is residing in a  little

out-house, so he has experience of the discomforts

of  living in a little out-house. I challenge  the

Minister  and any officers of the S.I.T. to  come

and stay in one of the houses built by the S.I.T.,

not  for  a day, but just from 10 a.m. to 4  p.m.;

and if they can bear the heat, then I say that the

residents  should be prepared to do  so  also.  If

they  feel  that  they cannot, then  it  is  their

responsibility  to  look  into  this  question  of

excessive heat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these complaints came to the notice of the

Acting Minister and the Assistant Minister on 17th

May  this  year.  They both took  the  trouble  to

arrange for a meeting with the residents of  these

houses  and toured the area with officers  of  the

S.I.T. They left their office work - for which  they

are  paid - and went to that estate to  see  how the residents



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



suffered. Until today no information has been

given  to  the  residents. What action  have  they

taken? It is only when I tabled a question that  I

got a reply and knew what the Minister intends  to

do. It is because of that big protest meeting that

has  prompted the Minister to take action. Had  it

not been for that big protest meeting, and had  it

not  been  for  my question, I doubt  whether  the

residents  would  have been told what  action  the

Minister intends to take or has taken. Sir, is  it

right  to  keep them in suspense? At  the  protest

meeting  the residents went so far as  to  move  a

motion  to boycott the District Council elections.

It  was only through my persuasion that the motion

to  boycott the elections was dropped. So  I  hope

that  whenever  the  Minister or  anybody  on  the

Government side receives any complaints, he should

tell  the complainants of what action he has taken

or intends to take.



<br><br>5.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> When I read the matter which

was  to be raised as a motion for the Adjournment,

I  thought the Member for Queenstown was going  to

talk   on  the  Government's  housing  policy   in

relation  to  the  Singapore  Improvement   Trust.

Unfortunately, Sir, in his long diatribe  I  could

not  find  anywhere  in his speech  where  he  has

related  in any way at all the question of  Govern

ment's housing policy to the S.I.T. He spent  much

of  his time in criticising the S.I.T. in relation

to the administration of the Trust itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to make the position clear to the

Member  for  Oueenstown.  The  Trust,  Sir,  is  a

statutory body and its authority and functions and

the  extent to which it is subject to the  control

of  Government  are prescribed  in  the  Ordinance

creating that body.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> That is no reply.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> This is one of the reasons

why   Government  intends  to  create  a   Housing

Authority  vested with full powers  to  carry  out

Government's housing policy, and since the  Member

for   Oueenstown   has   asked   me   about   this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



Housing Authority, I can say definitely now,  Sir,

that  Bills  on  the  Housing  Authority  and  the

Planning  Department of the S.I.T. will  be  ready

for  First Reading at the next sitting of this  As

sembly. However, it must be emphasised that  while

I  have  certain responsibilities and powers,  the

day-to-day   administration  of  the  Trust,   and

eventually the Housing Authority, must remain  the

responsibility  of the members of the  Board.  The

purpose of creating statutory bodies is to provide

special  services and to entrust  or  delegate  to

them certain functions and duties within the broad

lines of policy laid down by Government which they

are  expected  to  carry  out  in  a  manner  they

consider  best and which, with their attention  to

detail  and administrative routine, they can  more

efficiently carry out. It is therefore,  Sir,  not

conducive to good administration for Government or

the   Minister  himself  to  interfere  with   the

execution by the Board of their ordinary functions

and their day-to-day administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Bukit Panjang Estate, I

replied  this morning to the Member for Queenstown

that  at least three of the complaints put forward

by the residents of Bukit Panjang Estate are being

attended  to.  I  can tell the hon.  Member  this,

Sir - it was not as a result of the protest meeting,

but  it was as a direct result of the visits  made

by  the  Acting  Minister for  Local  Government,

Lands  and  Housing  and the  Assistant  Minister,

together   with  the  Chairman  of  the  Singapore

Improvement  Trust.  In other words,  the  protest

meeting which took place at Bukit Panjang about  a

fortnight  ago had nothing at all to do  with  the

repairs  and  alterations  which  are  now   being

carried out by the S.I.T.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was of course the question of heat. Here

again,  Sir, I do not know whether the Member  for

Queenstown  is aware about it, but  there  are  in

Singapore today probably over 200 houses built  by

the  P.W.D. for labourers and also for  the  other

ranks of the police force, and there are some also

at the Guillemard Road side of the Kallang



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



Airport,  which  have  no  ceilings:  neither  the

P.W.D. nor the S.I.T. have received any complaints

from the residents of these houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the question of allocation. I would

like  to  refer  the Member for  Queenstown  to  a

report  of he Housing Management Sub-Committee  of

the  Central Housing Advisory Committee  published

by   H.M.  Stationery  Office.  London,  page   8,

paragraph 23. Now that reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We recommend that whatever method of selection

is  used, local authorities should generally  make

known the principles on which tenants are selected

and the general practice of which account is taken

on individual applications. The primary importance

of  this, in present circumstances especially,  is

self-evident.  The  precise weight  given  to  the

particuar   factors  should  not  necessarily   be

disclosed. Moreover, we doubt whether it  is  wise

to   make   any   general  practice  o   informing

applicants  exactly  what their  position  on  the

waiting list is at the particular date, as  it  is

to   be   expected   that  the  circumstances   of

applicants,   and  therefore  their  position   in

relation  to  one  another on the  list,  will  be

constantly changing."



<br><br>Sir,  this is the present policy of the Trust  and

it  is  based  broadly on these  conclusions.  The

applicant is informed of the points awarded at the

time  of the registration and of the general  practice  which  takes into account the assessment  of

points. The fixed or confirmed value of points  is

assessed  after investigation of the case  and  is

not  disclosed. The allocation list of  applicants

and  their points are circulated for the  approval

of  the Estates Committee and are confidential  to

members of the Board. This provides some safeguard

against injustice to other tenants not selected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> If the assessment of the

confirmed points is not to be disclosed,  what  is

the  purpose of giving the number of points on the

receipt         of         the        application?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> I think the points given on

the   receipt   of  the  application   is   before

investigation  and  not after  investigation.  The

actual   confirmed   points   are   given    after

investigation and, in some cases, it  may  not  be

recorded on the receipt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, there was one point about corruption.

Of course, this is a never-ending accusation which

comes  up whenever the question of the Trust crops

up, but I must thank the Member for Queenstown for

having  brought  to  my notice  this  question  of

allocation  of the house in Dorset Road.  I  hope,

Sir, that the hon. Member would co-operate with me

in  giving all the necessary information  and  all

the correspondence with the S.I.T. so that I could

look  further into the case and in all probability

hand  it  over to the Corrupt Practices  Investigation Bureau.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> On a point of information, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way. He has only one and a half minutes left.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Finally, Sir, I must point

out  that, in reply to an earlier question of  the

Member  for Queenstown, I did assure him that  if

he  had any suggestions for the improvement of the

allocation  system, both I and  the  S.I.T. would

give them consideration. I have yet to receive any

suggestions from the hon. Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

research into the records at the disposal  of  the

information in a presentable form. The information

will  be circulated in the Official Report in  due course.
