<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>RE-DEMARCATION OF CONSTITUENCIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  whether it is proposed  to  re-demarcate

the    present   boundaries   of   the   fifty-one

Constituencies as their present population  ratios

are quite disproportionate.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department (Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed) (for the Deputy Prime Minister)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  have  been  asked  by  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  to reply. A complete review of electoral

boundaries   will  be  undertaken   as   soon   as

compilation  of  new citizens electoral  registers

for 1967 based on the new laminated identity cards

is  completed. Registration of persons which began

in  May  last year has just ended. Preparation  of

new electoral registers with the correct addresses

of  citizens  eligible to vote shown therein  will

begin soon, and the review of electoral boundaries

will be undertaken in the light of the information

contained in the new registers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the names which appeared in the

electoral registers included all persons who  held

Singapore  identity cards irrespective of  whether

they  were  citizens or not. An amendment  to  the

Elections  Ordinance  will soon  be  presented  to

enable  only citizens to vote. It stands to reason

that,  with  such a revision, electoral boundaries

must  be  redrawn  so that the average  number  of

electorate   in   all   constituencies   will   be

approximately  the same. The creation  of  housing

estates  in  many  areas  and  resettlement  of  a

section  of  the  population have also  made  this

revision necessary.

<div align="center"><b>TIME OFF FOR MILITARY TRAINING</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Deduction of pay)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues</b> asked the Minister of

Defence if he is aware that some employers  deduct

the  pay  of their workers who take time  off  for

training



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>



in   one   of   the   military  or   para-military

organisations;  and  whether  and  what  steps  he

proposes  to  take  to ensure  that  no  employees

suffer   any  loss  merely  by  reason  of   their

voluntary participation in such organisations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon) (for the Minister of Defence):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   the  training  undergone  by  the  People's

Defence   Force   volunteers   comprises   evening

parades,  weekend  camps or  training  and  annual

camps.  The evening parades are held after  office

hours.  Similarly  the weekend camps  or  training

held  at weekend camps hardly interferes with  the

civilian  work of such volunteers. In cases  where

the  evening  parades interfere with  the  working

hours of the volunteers, the officers in charge of

the  training depots usually request the employers

concerned that the volunteers he allowed to  leave

their work early. At present, however, there is no

law compelling the employers to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question raised by the Member for Telok

Blangah,  therefore, really relates to the  annual

camp.  When  they  attend such  annual  camp,  the

volunteers are given the same rate of military pay

as  their  regular  counterparts of  corresponding

rank.  Attention has recently been  drawn  to  the

cases  of daily-rated employees who are unable  to

get  time off for attending annual camp and  whose

civilian pay is greater than the military pay that

they  would draw in attending annual camp. To meet

the  problem,  it has been decided  that  in  such

cases a special allowance up to a maximum of $2.50

per day may be paid for the difference between the

civilian  and military pay. There are  448  daily-rated employees in the People's Defence Force, and

the  majority  of  240 attended annual  camp  last

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration is being given to making legal

provision to cover such cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may add that in respect of Government

employees,  both the monthly paid and  the  daily-rated, there are provisions for granting them full

pay leave for a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>



certain  number  of days a year  for  purposes  of

attending    volunteer   camps    of    recognised

organisations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> A supplementary, Sir. Will the

Minister   introduce  legislation  to   see   that

employers are not allowed to deduct the  wages  of

the employees for such training?



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with regard

to  this  question, probably the Member  is  aware

that the National Service (Amendment) Bill will he

introduced   at  this  sitting.  Those   who   are

requested  to  render national  service  will,  of

course,   be  covered  by  the  National   Service

(Amendment) Bill.

<div align="center"><b>COLONIAL EMBLEM ON UNIFORMS OF POLICE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AND ARMED FORCES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> asked the Minister of

Defence  whether  he  is aware  that  the  present

uniforms  of both the Police Force and  the  Armed

Forces  still  carry  the emblem  of  the  British

Crown,  a symbol of the colonial era, and  whether

he has any plans to cease the use of the emblem.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon (for the Minister of Defence):</b>

Mr  Speaker, the Ministry of Interior and Defence

commenced in June 1966 a full-scale review of  all

the  existing  uniforms  of  the  Singapore  Armed

Forces. This has resulted in a new set of uniforms

having  been devised for the army and new patterns

for   the   police   are  now   being   finalised.

Arrangements are almost complete to introduce  the

new army uniform in the middle of 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the new badges of ranks, these

have already been introduced for the army, and the

British  Crown  is  now  no  longer  used  by  any

officer.  The  crest of the Republic of  Singapore

has replaced this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New badges of ranks for the police have also been

re-designed  and,  as soon as  tenders  have  been

called  and  accepted.  It  will  be  possible  to

introduce  the  new badges for the  entire  police

force.

<div align="center"><b>AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE IN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SECONDARY SCHOOLS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>IN RURAL AREAS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for

Education   if   he   will  consider   introducing

agricultural  science  as a subject  in  secondary

schools in rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, mixed

farming  will be introduced in 1968 as an elective

subject in the secondary vocational classes in the

rural areas. Towards this end, 17 trainees are  at

present  undergoing a two-year  full-time  content

training  in  mixed farming at the Sembawang  Farm

School.  After the completion of the  training  at

the  school  in  May  1967, they  will  undergo  a

further   one   year  of  part-time   professional

training  at  the Teachers' Training College.  The

possibility of introducing Rural Science in  other

secondary  classes  in the rural  areas  is  under

consideration.

<div align="center"><b>COVENT GARDENS IN DELTA CONSTITUENCY</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Measures to improve health environment)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Health   whether  he  is  aware  that  the  health

environment  of  Covent  Gardens  in   the   Delta

Constituency  has been poor and what  measures  he

proposes to take to improve it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Covent

Gardens  is  a  very depressed slum area  composed

largely  of attap houses and a few old  brick  and

tile  shophouses situated at the junction  of  Kim

Seng  Road  with  Havelock Road and  part  of  the

Singapore  River.  The area is low  lying  with  a

tidal  creek running through the area, so that  it

is  subject  to periodic flooding when heavy  rain

coincides with the tides.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these circumstances, the environmental health

of  Covent Gardens, as in other kampongs similarly

situated  elsewhere in Singapore, is bad.  It  is,

however, not of recent origin but has been so  for

many years. I understand Covent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1099</b></font><br><br>



Gardens was placed very high on the priority  list

for  immediate re-development by the  Housing  and

Development Board as compared with adjacent  Bukit

Ho Swee. But when the fire catastrophe occurred at

the  latter  site  in May 1961,  redevelopment  of

Bukit Ho Swee was proceeded with apace, and Covent

Gardens unfortunately remains what it is today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent survey of Covent Gardens, which by the

way  has  no  Street sign at all to  indicate  its

existence whether access is from Kim Seng Road  or

Havelock Road, revealed that there are about 2,500

persons  living  in a little over  100  houses  of

attap  or  zinc construction. Of these, 33  houses

are  built on stilts over the tidal creek or fore-shore  of  the river. As only half of  the  houses

have  latrines, and only 23 use the bucket system,

the  majority,  therefore, have to resort  to  the

primitive  method  of easing themselves  over  the

tidal   creek   or   the  river  with   consequent

pollution. Poultry and pigs are even being  reared

in  about one-half of these houses. As drains  are

generally  earth drains, with refuse being  dumped

indiscriminately into drains and on to  footpaths,

the maintenance of public cleansing was almost  an

impossible  task with only one public  daily-rated

worker  being  assigned to  perform  the  task  of

refuse  clearance of this area, which  includes  a

small private market as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mosquito breeding is extensive because of water-collecting junk lying everywhere and with stagnant

water in drains and pools. The situation has  been

prevented from worsening through weekly oiling  by

the Anti-Mosquito Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Covent Gardens can be made to look

cleaner  soon - as with the recent re-organisation

of  the  public  cleansing service  which  started

early this month in spite of the wildcat strike by

the  Public Daily-Rated Cleansing Workers'  Union,

it   has  been  possible  to  post  six  Emergency

Cleansing  Corps  workers  to  look  after  Covent

Gardens, where formerly there was only one  public

daily-rated worker allotted for this task - the long-term solution,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>



however, is one of total slum clearance of  Covent

Gardens itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although what I have to say further is strictly

not  within my portfolio hut that of my colleague,

the  Minister  for  National  Development,  I  am,

however,  pleased to inform the Member  for  Delta

that  the  Chairman of the Housing and Development

Board has given me the assurance that every effort

will be made to give priority to any family within

this  Covent  Gardens area who would  like  to  be

housed in Housing and Development Board flats with

a  view  to enabling the Board to obtain clearance

of  this  area  at  the  earliest  possible  date.

Applications from families staying in  the  Covent

Gardens  area  will be given special consideration

for   re-housing  in  new  units  that  are  being

constructed in the Urban Renewal Scheme,  Precinct

S.1, which is just across Havelock Road. For those

families    who    prefer   yet    lower    rental

accommodation, suitable one-room units can be made

available at Redhill and Tiong Bahru.

<div align="center"><b>WITHDRAWAL OF GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL FACILITIES FROM</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PROFESSOR TINCKLER</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Tang See Chim</b> asked the Minister for

Health  if he will make a statement as to why  the

surgical  facilities of the General Hospital  were

withdrawn from Professor Tinckler.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

propose  to  give an account of the  circumstances

and   reasons   for   withdrawing   the   surgical

facilities  of  not only the Outram  Road  General

Hospital  hut  also all facilities  in  Government

hospitals  of  Singapore from  Professor  Tinckler

with  effect  from  17th January,  1967.  This  is

because Professor Tinckler on 21st December, 1966,

instituted  legal suits in the High Court  against

the  University  and  its  officers,  and  on  6th

January,  1967,  against my  Director  of  Medical

Services, Dr Ho Guan Lim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would, therefore, be improper were I to state

the  Government's case against the Professor in  a

place  where  he  is  in  no  position  to  defend

himself.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1101</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All I would like to say at the moment is that I

have   had   disturbing  reports  about  Professor

Tinckler  from the Ministry's officials in  charge

of Outram Road General Hospital which satisfied me

that, in the interests of our Hospital and of  the

patients  who are our citizens, he should  not  be

allowed  to carry on as Head of Surgical Unit  `A'

of our Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Tinckler has alleged that he has been

unfairly  reported  upon. I  am,  therefore,  most

anxious  that the question as to whether Professor

Tinckler's   allegations   are   correct   or   my

Ministry's action justified be impartially  judged

by a court of law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that on 28th January, 1967,

Professor   Tinckler  sent  in   his   letter   of

resignation   to   the  Vice-Chancellor   of   the

University of Singapore. In view of this,  I  hope

there  will be an early hearing of the legal suits

instituted  by  Professor Tinckler,  so  that  the

truth  as to whether the Ministry of Health  acted

properly  in the public interests or that  he  was

unfairly maligned can be properly established in a

court  of law. I hope Professor Tinckler will  for

his  part  press  his legal actions  to  an  early

hearing  so  that  the matter  can  be  aired  and

cleared. It is in everybody's interests and  those

of  the University and my Ministry that the  truth

should  be known. It would be most unfortunate  if

the  Professor  were  to leave  Singapore  without

having  his case beard and judged. And let  it  be

remembered that our judicial processes are open to

review  by  the  Privy Council who  can  see  that

justice  is  done and seen to be done  to  all  in

Singapore, without fear or favour.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  is  it  true  that  Professor  Tinckler   is

considering leaving Singapore shortly?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not know whether or not the

Minister has information on that question. But  if

he has, he is at liberty to answer it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand

that Professor Tinckler



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>



is  on  the passenger list of the "Benloyal" which

is  scheduled to sail from Singapore for  Hongkong

at  3 p.m., which is five minutes from now. And  I

hear  that  he is heading for Los Angeles  by  air

from  Hongkong. I do hope that this is not a  case

<div align="center"><b>SOAP FACTORIES OPERATING IN SINGAPORE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Finance the number of soap factories operating  in

Singapore;  whether  the  production  of  soap  is

sufficient  to  meet local needs and  whether  the

prices  of  locally-produced soap have risen  with

the  increase in prices, because of import duties,

of imported soap.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are at present

16  soap  factories  operating in  Singapore.  All

these factories manufacture washing soap but  only

four  are manufacturing toilet soap. Lam Soon  Oil

and Soap (Singapore) Limited is the largest of the

four  manufacturing toilet soap and has a capacity

of  26,800  cwts, per annum. The output  from  the

other  three  factories is negligible.  The  local

market  for toilet soap is estimated to be  16,500

cwts, per annum, which is more than sufficient  to

meet local needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retail price of locally-manufactured toilet

soap  remains unchanged at 30 cents per  cake.  In

the case of laundry soap, some local manufacturers

have  lowered  their  prices.  There  is  thus  no

increase in the price of locally-produced soap.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> The Parliamentary

Secretary  has said that the price of  a  cake  of

toilet soap is 30 cents. Is that true or not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> A locally-manufactured cake of

toilet soap is sold at 30 cents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Is there a controlled price,

Mr Speaker, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I have no information that the

price of soap is 40 cents a cake.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Member's last question

was,  is  there a controlled price? The answer  is

`No'.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> It is not controlled. It is a

fixed price.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> If there is any increase in the

price of soap, what will the Government do?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ramaswamy, do you propose to

take  any  action if there is an increase  in  the

price of locally-made soap?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> There has been no increase in the

price, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, I want a reply. If there

is any increase in the price of soap, what will be

Government's action?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> If there is an increase in the

price, we will lift the duty on imports.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid

I am totally at a loss as to what the intention of

the  Government is in the event of an increase  in

the  price  of  soap. My friend, the Parliamentary

Secretary  to the Minister for Finance, said  that

he  would put a duty on imports. What does he mean

by that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I said, "Lift the duty," not put

it on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

The Parliamentary Secretary has said just now that

the price of locally-manufactured soap is 30 cents

a cake. This is incorrect. From what I can gather,

three cakes of locally-made soap cost $l.10 cents.

I  hope the Ministry concerned will fix the  price

of soap.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> The Member can get any amount of

soap  in the market at 30 cents a cake. If  he  is

paying  $1.10 for three cakes of soap, I think  he

is being swindled!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there has been a hue and cry from the public  that

the   prices  of  locally-manufactured  goods  are

increasing   by  leaps  and  bounds.   Would   the

Government  consider  refraining  from   providing

local manufacturers with tariff protection against

imported    goods,   particularly   pharmaceutical

products, if they cannot meet the demand?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think pharmaceuticals are outside

the  ambit of the original question. In any event,

this  matter  was raised by the Member  for  Telok

Blangah  a  few sittings ago and it  was  answered

completely. But does the Government wish to answer

the  rest  of the question of the Member for  Bras

Basah?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I am not

confining   my  question  only  to  pharmaceutical

products but also to general commodities.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point I made was that I am

trying  to  keep supplementaries relevant  to  the

original question. Mr Ramaswamy has come prepared

to answer questions on soap, and I will permit him

to answer questions only on soap.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I need further notice, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> If I

may,  Mr  Speaker. I would like to reply  to  the

question raised by the Member for Bras Basah.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on the Government side will always try to

protect  an  industry if it is efficient,  and  we

will  always  weigh the interests of the  consumer

with  the benefits of local industry. But when  we

find that the local industry is not efficient  and

has  raised the price very much higher than it was

before,  we  will lift whatever tariff  protection

there  is  to see that the interests of  consumers

are   not  jeopardised.  Does  that  answer   your

question, Mr Ho?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, just now

I  heard  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  say  that

locally-made soap costs 30 cents per cake. If that

is the case, I would like to order through him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Teong, question No. 8.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>LOCAL AND FOREIGN INDUSTRIALISTS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Reaction to export and investment incentives)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  what  is  the  reaction  from  local  and

foreign  industrialists  to  the  incentives   for

export  and  investment granted by the  Government

from 1st January, 1967.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy (for the Minister for Finance):</b> The

investment and export incentives for industries in

Singapore  were announced in the Budget Speech  on

5th December, 1966. A draft Ordinance is now being

prepared,  embodying these new incentives  in  the

legislation, and when completed, further publicity

will  he  given to these incentives  to  both  the

local and foreign business and industrial centres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, purely on the very brief outline of the

incentives  given in the Budget Speech alone,  the

Economic   Development  Board   has   reported   a

significant increase in industrial inquiries  made

both  at  the  Singapore Office  as  well  as  its

overseas  offices.  There  were  a  total  of  180

industrial  inquiries on record for  1966,  or  an

average  of  15 inquiries a month. In  almost  the

first  2  months  of this year (only  up  to  23rd

February),  there  were  already  a  total  of  46

inquiries, or an average of 23 inquiries a  month.

These  were  from  local as well as  international

corporations  which have indicated interest  in  a

wide range of industries, ranging from electronics

to  petrochemicals. Some of the proposals  involve

large sums of investments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These inquiries reflect an almost 50 per cent

increase per month. This increase in inquiries for

the  months  of  January  and  February  has  been

achieved  in  spite of many public holidays.  From

the  serious manner in which these inquiries  have

been  made,  the  Economic  Development  Board  is

confident  that  many of these projects  would  be

carried beyond the mere inquiry stage and would be

implemented.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1106</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be pointed out that in all developing

countries  there  is  always  a  gestation  period

between  the  introduction of incentives  and  the

achievements  of  full  impact  on  the   national

economy.  It  takes two or three years  to  get  a

large  industrial enterprise into  full  operation

even  if the final decision is made today. In  our

case  we  are  confident that the  impact  on  our

economy  may  come  even sooner  than  the  normal

pattern in other countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, would the

Parliamentary  Secretary  to  the   Minister   for

Finance give us a breakdown of the figures of  the

inquiries  for the year 1966? It is no use  giving

us  the  total  figure for the year and  then  the

average  monthly figure, because the increase  may

be  spread gradually over the period of a year, so

that  the increase in the first two months of 1967

may  be  part of a trend and may not, in fact,  be

due to the incentives announced in the Budget.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I have not got the figures now.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case, Mr Ramaswamy, may I

suggest that you circulate the information* in the

Official  Report rather than answer  orally  to  a

further question on the matter.

Development  of  property on a large  scale  takes

considerable planning and preparation, and it will

take  time before the full effect of the  new  tax

concessions  could  be known.  It  is,  therefore,

premature at the moment to gauge from the response

Labour  if he will state, by races, the number  of

applications  received from adults  for  Singapore

Citizenship, and the number approved, in 1965, and

the  number  of  minors  registered  as  Singapore

Citizens in the same year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui (for the Minister for Labour):</b> I

regret  to inform the hon. Member that it  is  not

possible  to  give a breakdown, by  race,  of  the

number  of  applications received from adults  for

Singapore  citizenship and the number approved  in

1965,  as the information is not readily available

from the Registry of Citizenship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Registry does not keep a record of

applications and approved cases by race  as  there

is no racial grouping in respect of citizenship. I

can  only  inform the hon. Member that a total  of

18,669  applications were received by the Registry

in  1965.  This figure includes applications  from

minors.  The  number of applications  approved  in

1965  totals  15,295,  of  which  11,250  were  in

respect  of  adults and 4,045 were in  respect  of

minors.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> I cannot understand the reply of

the  Parliamentary Secretary to the  Minister  for

record by race?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Parliamentary

Secretary's reply is that, in the application form

for citizenship, there is no requirement that race

be  indicated,  so  that  the  Registry  does  not

classify  applications by race. Is  that  correct,

Mr Sia?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> Although the race of the

applicant  is indicated, we do not keep  groupings

by  race.  That is why the figure is  not  readily

available,  as  I have said, because  we  are  not

really interested to know how many Chinese or  how

many Indians are made citizens.

<div align="center"><b>FISHERIES CO-OPERATIVE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for Law

and  National Development whether he will consider

setting  up  a  fisheries co-operative  to  assist

fishermen in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the

principles  of the co-operative movement  is  that

before  a co-operative society is formed, a  group

of   people   with   identical  interests   should

voluntarily come together to discuss their various

problems  and  form  a society  for  their  mutual

benefit.  If there is such a group of  people  who

desire  to  form  a  fisheries  co-operative,  the

Primary  Production Department  will  be  glad  to

assist them in any way possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very often, however, co-operative societies are

formed  with the intention of getting  money  from

the Government. The Government believes that it is

better  to train our fishermen to catch more  fish

rather than to give them money.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fisheries training school is being established

at  Changi to train fishermen so that they can  go

farther  out  to sea and catch more fish.  At  the

same   time,  a  fishing  port  and  fish   market

facilities  are  being constructed  in  Jurong  to

provide  centralised marketing facilities so  that

fishermen  can  get  a  better  price  for   their

catches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures, we think, are more effective ways

to help fishermen than to give them money in order

to help them form a fisheries co-operative.

While a few of them are well equipped to check the

quality  of  their products, many of  the  smaller

feedmills have no such facilities. Steps are being

taken  to  establish a minimum  standard  for  all

has   been  raised  under  these  two  Ordinances,

leaving  a  balance of $23 million still available

for issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are no doubt aware that besides external

sources  such  as  the World Bank  and  the  Asian

Development  Bank,  it  is necessary  to  mobilise

funds   from  internal  sources  to  finance   our

development  programme.  The  Bill  which  is  now

before   us   is  necessary  since  the   previous

legislation, which I mentioned earlier, cannot  be

suitably  amended to increase the amount of  loans

that can be raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One feature of the Bill is a provision in clause

18  that  any  instrument  or  written  law  which

empowers  any person to invest shall be deemed  to

give   that  person  the  power  to  make  advance

deposits  as  well.  In this  Bill  the  scope  of

investment  for  the  Sinking  Fund  is  wider  as

compared   with  that  in  the  Development   Loan

Ordinance,  1961.  Clause  13  (3)  of  the   Bill

authorises   investment  in   securities   of   or

securities   guaranteed  by  any   government   or

international financial institution as may be

determined by the President under section 7 (3)

(d) of the Financial Procedure Act, 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Lim Kim San].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.







<br><br>3.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is the intention to refer the Bill to a

Select Committee, I shall only touch briefly upon

the more important provisions in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under existing practice, what the purchaser of a

flat usually obtains is a 999-year lease in a

building. The freehold title in the land above

which the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>



flat is built is either retained by the vendor who

imposes  on  each of his lessees a service  charge

for  the  maintenance of common parts and property

or  is  conveyed in proportionate  shares  to  the

purchasers  of  all flats built  on  the  land  as

tenants in common. Experience has shown that it is

difficult for tenants to get together and problems

arise  when lifts break down or pipes burst.  This

rather unsatisfactory state of affairs has impeded

the  development and sale of flats in the Republic

and  the Bill now before the House, which is based

on  Australian legislation, takes account  of  the

comments of the former Bar Committee and seeks  to

remove these difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill introduces a strata land register under

which the proprietor of registered land on which a

building  stands,  who  has obtained  approval  of

subdivision  of the building into flats  from  the

competent authority, may apply to the Registrar of

Titles  for  the land and the subdivided  building

thereon  to  be dealt with in lots under  separate

subsidiary strata certificates of title.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also spells out the rights and

obligations  of  the  purchasers  of  flats  in  a

subdivided   building   as  regards   assessments,

easements and restrictive covenants. The owner  or

owners of flats comprised in a subdivided building

shown  in  a strata title plan lodged in the  Land

Titles   Registry  will  become   the   management

corporation of the building as soon as such strata

title  plan  has  been registered. The  management

corporation, consisting of all the flat owners, is

made  responsible  for the maintenance  of  common

parts like lifts and corridors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome

the  introduction of this Bill. How  to  convey  a

flat  and give the purchaser legal title has  long

been    exercising   the   ingenuity   of    legal

practitioners. As you yourself know, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  in  common law the legal owner of land  owns

also the air



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>



space  above the land. He also owns any  permanent

structure  built upon the land. Ti is,  therefore,

difficult in common law to give legal title to the

purchaser of a flat which occupies only  some  air

space  above a plot of land. There is  no  way  of

giving  him legal title to that air space.  Common

law does not provide for that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conveyancing lawyers have devised ways and means

of  overcoming  this problem. To a  large  extent,

they  have  been  successful and flats  have  been

bought  and  sold. But, as the Minister  has  just

pointed out, because of certain common parts  that

are  relative to the flats, the ownership of which

is  not anybody's, the maintenance of these common

parts  has  generally  not  been  taken  care  of.

Consequently  this  is one of the  discouragements

for    flat   owners.   There   is   the   further

discouragement  that there is always  the  nagging

doubt  that  the purchaser may not get  a  perfect

title   to  the  flat,  especially  when  disaster

happens  and the flat is destroyed. This doubt,  I

think,  can  be clearly seen in the reluctance  of

building  societies  and  insurance  companies  to

finance  the  buying  of  flats,  although   these

finance organisations are quite willing to finance

the buying of other forms of landed property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, flat dwelling is a phenomenon

of  our  modern over-crowded cities.  Most  modern

cities are experiencing a grave shortage of  land.

This  is  especially true of Singapore  where  the

total land area is less than 250 square miles. We,

therefore, build upwards instead of sideways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law on land, however, has not kept pace with

modern development. We have inherited a law  which

was  made  at  a time when land was plentiful  and

there  was  neither the economic  nor  the  social

pressure  to build flats. This pressure,  however,

is  present  in Singapore to a tremendous  extent.

Space   is  at  a  premium,  and  for  the  better

utilisation  of  space we in  Singapore  not  only

build flats for dwelling purposes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>



(with which this Bill is mainly concerned), hut we

also  have schools in multi-storey structures.  We

have multi-storey car parks and flatted factories.

I  remember  during an adjournment debate  not  so

long  ago  on  the  resettlement of  farmers,  the

Minister  of  Defence  even  suggested  that   the

Government should consider flatted structures  for

the rearing of pigs.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Poultry, Mr Tang!



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Poultry and pigs, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  From  this  we  can see how  tremendous  the

pressure  is  on  us. I recall a  very  expressive

Chinese  saving, Mr Speaker. Sir, and  with  your

permission may I say it in Chinese? Chun  jin  che

tu.  It means an inch of gold for a foot of  land.

This  precisely  expresses the situation  that  is

prevailing in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is therefore timely, it fills the gap

in  the  land  laws regarding the registration  of

titles  to  flats  and,  in  so  doing,  it   also

facilitates the financing of flat purchasing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The referring of this Bill to a Select Committee

where  its  detailed  provisions  can  be  further

explored and interested bodies are enabled to make

representations, is also welcomed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, "That the Bill be committed to a Select

Committee  consisting of Mr Speaker  as  Chairman

and seven Members to be nominated by the Committee

of Selection." - [Mr Barker]

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved, "That Parliament do now adjourn to
