<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>MARIJUANA</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Measures to end smuggling, peddling and use)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  whether  he  has  received  reports   that

marijuana  is  obtainable at some roadside  coffee-stalls  and other places in the Republic; and  what

measures  are  being taken to put  an  end  to  the

smuggling, peddling and use of the drug.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Police is aware

that marijuana (or ganja as it is known locally) is

being peddled at some sarabat and eating stalls  in

certain  areas, such as Geylang Serai,  Joo  Chiat,

Tanjong  Pagar, Bukit Timah, Wayang Satu.  Measures

to  prevent  the peddling, usage and  smuggling  of

this drug have been intensified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police is responsible for the suppression of

internal  trafficking  and  consumption  of  drugs,

while   the  Customs  Department  concentrates   on

international trafficking and smuggling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1969, 62 persons were arrested for possessing

ganja:  96  persons were arrested during the  first

six  months  of this year. The Harbour Division  of

the  Customs Department, during the first  half  of

this  year,  made several large seizures  of  ganja

(cannabis sativa) from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



coastal  vessels.  On  shore,  Police  and  Customs

squads have also stepped up the frequency of  raids

on  known  and suspected places where  pushers  and

smugglers  congregate. Seizures of  ganja  for  the

first  six  months of this year amounted  to  192.9

pounds  as  compared to 61.9 pounds  for  the  same

period last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of years back, cannabis plants were

found  to be cultivated even on the island  itself,

but   land  patrols  by  Customs  have  effectively

eradicated   these  illicit  farms.   The   Primary

Production  Department  has  also  co-operated   by

educating   local   farmers  to   the   danger   of

cultivating this plant through rural newspapers and

other publicity campaigns. The success achieved  by

the  Customs and the Primary Production Departments

is  reflected in the fact that whilst 548  cannabis

plants  were seized during the first six months  of

1969,  only one plant was seized for the first  six

months  of  this year. Constant vigilance  is  also

maintained  at the Causeway and Airport to  prevent

the entry of this deleterious drug.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, a Seminar on Narcotics Control was held

in  Singapore under U.N, sponsorship.  The  Seminar

recognised that lack of information on the  dangers

of drug abuse increased the risk of habituation. To

counter this, plans are under consideration for the

dissemination of information on the dangers of drug-taking.

<div align="center"><b>TEACHERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(In-service training courses and bonus scheme)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr N. Govindasamy</b> asked the Minister for

Education  (a)  what  is the number  of  in-service

training  courses  conducted by  his  Ministry  for

teachers  in  the four language streams  since  the

beginning of this year; and (b) what is the outcome

of  the  proposed  bonus scheme  for  teachers  who

undergo the in-service training courses.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the

beginning  of  this  year, 35  in-service  training

courses  for teachers in the four language  streams

have  been  conducted.  It is  planned  to  conduct

another 17 in the course of this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bonus scheme had not been finalised when the

Member of Parliament for Telok Blangah raised  that

question  in  the  last session of  Parliament.  My

Ministry is now ready to implement the bonus scheme

which will replace the incremental benefit scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courses will be conducted from time to time on a

variety  of  subjects  designed  to  increase   the

quality  and  efficiency of qualified  teachers  in

Government and Government-aided schools in the four

language streams. All such courses shall lead to an

examination  and  the award of  a  certificate.  On

successful completion of such approved courses, the

teachers will be given a bonus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the greatest benefit is derived

from  the  bonus scheme, teachers are selected  for

the approved courses under a certain criterion.  In

selecting candidates, consideration will  be  given

to  the  relevance  of the subject  matter  of  the

course  to  the  candidate's  teaching  and  extra-curricular   activities,  his  qualifications   and

special interests, and the recommendations  of  his

superior officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the bonus scheme to be implemented, a

teacher   will   be  granted  $150  on   successful

completion  of  an approved in-service  course  and

thereafter  an annual bonus of $150  for  not  more

than  three years provided the teacher teaches  the

subject  of the course for not less than 15 periods

a  week throughout the year. The annual bonus  will

not be granted for more than one subject at any one

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to approved courses under the bonus

scheme, other courses outside the scheme will  also

be   conducted.  Courses  which  lead  to  a  basic

qualification,  such  as the in-service  course  of

teacher-training and other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>



upgrading  courses  for  emplacement  on  a  higher

salary, will not normally be considered as approved

courses under the bonus scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the incremental benefit scheme will be

replaced  by the bonus scheme, teachers already  in

receipt  of  incremental credits will  continue  to

receive them.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  can the Parliamentary Secretary elucidate  to

the  House the rationale behind stopping the  bonus

scheme  after  three  years, although  the  teacher

concerned  may  continue to teach  the  subject  in

which he qualified?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, this is a bonus scheme

and a bonus is terminable.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary

says  that a bonus will be paid for the first year,

second  year  and third year. Why not pay  for  the

fourth and fifth year? Why stop at the third  year?

I  know  a  bonus  can  be terminated.  It  can  be

terminated in the first year.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, conditions change and

the  bonus has to be terminated somewhere. We  have

worked   out  that  a  bonus  of  three  years   is

sufficient as an incentive for teachers to  go  for

in-service training.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, what is the rationale

for  stopping the bonus at the third year and  what

is the criterion for arriving at this decision?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Sir, it has been so worked

out  that  it  is  comparable  to  the  incremental

credits  which  a  teacher would derive  under  the

former scheme.

<div align="center"><b>(Bus services)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  whether  there  are  any  plans  to

provide  bus  services  within  the  Kallang  Basin

Industrial Estate; and if he realises that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>

especially  the  female workers,  employed  in  the

factories in the Estate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore Traction

Company  now runs seven services serving  the  area

bordering  Kallang  Basin  Industrial  Estate.  The

Omnibus  Services Licensing Authority will  request

itself.  At present, the bridge over Kallang  River

construction.  It  is understood  that  the  bridge

should be completed by January next year. By  then,

the  Kallang Basin Industrial Estate will be better

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Sir, is it

<div align="center"><b>TELEPHONE SERVICES AND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>APPLICATIONS FOR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TELEPHONES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for

Communications (a) if he is aware that of late  the

standard of telephone services in the city area has

generally  deteriorated; it  is  increasingly  more

difficult  to get through to a number at the  first

attempt  and  there  appears to  be  an  increasing

number  of  erroneous calls being put through;  and

what   steps  are  being  taken  by  the  Singapore

Telephone Board to improve upon the situation;  and

(b)  what  steps  are being taken  to  shorten  the

waiting  period for new applications for telephones

which  in  certain  areas can be  as  long  as  six

months.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

complaints  over telephone services raised  by  the

Member for Jalan Kayu may be explained as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasing difficulty in getting through to a

telephone  number at the first attempt is  possible

during  peak periods, especially between the  hours

of  10.30  a.m, and 12 noon and again between  2.30

and  4  p.m.  If  a line is engaged, naturally  the

second  caller cannot get through until  the  first

conversation is over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another reason is the capacity of the

automatic   exchange.  The   present   demand   for

telephone  facilities  has  far  exceeded  planning

forecasts.  Although the Singapore Telephone  Board

received the World Bank's approval in December 1969

(only  six  months ago) of a loan  of  $33  million

(US$11  million)  for its $163 million  Development

Plan  for six years (1970-75) with a planned target

of  14 per cent per annum rate of growth, this  has

now  been  found to be inadequate and  the  revised 1971  Development Budget which was originally fixed

at  $29.4  million has just been raised by  30  per

cent to $38.3 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of the second complaint that there

"appears  to  be an increasing number of  erroneous

calls  being  put through", as we are operating  an

automatic  telephone  exchange,  such  errors   can

largely  be  caused  by the person  who  dials  the

telephone. Therefore, it is the human error  rather

than the fault of the automatic exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that some new applications for

telephones  have  to wait for months  before  their

requirements  can be met. Sometimes  the  Singapore

Telephone Board will not even be able to  meet  the

request   for  telephones,  because  the  applicant

happens  to  live  in  an  area  which  is   rather

inaccessible and where it would be just  uneconomic

to  provide  such a service. It would cost  $30,000

just to fix one line for that particular person.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the S.T.B, does make every effort to

reduce the waiting time for applicants. Members  of

this House will be pleased to note that whereas  in

June last year, there were as many as 3,140 waiters

or  3.7  per cent of total working direct  exchange

lines,  the position as at June this year was  only

1,850  or  1.8  per cent of direct exchange  lines.

Therefore, there has been a marked improvement with

waiters being reduced by one-half over that of last

year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

firstly,   it  appears  to  me  that  the  planning

forecast of the Board was quite wrong, in  view  of

the  substantial adjustments that have to be  made.

Can  the  Minister inform the House what steps  are

being  taken to ensure a more accurate forecast  in

future years?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Minister has attributed all the

erroneous  calls to so-called human  errors.  I  am

just  wondering whether they could be due  possibly

to  poor maintenance of the exchange rather than to

human errors.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> We should not be too critical

of the planning forecast of the Singapore Telephone

Board.  In  the past, their Five-Year  Plan  had  a

target  of  12  per cent rate of  growth,  and  the

actual achievement turned out to be 14 per cent. So

they put up the next Five-Year Plan on the basis of

14  per  cent  rate of growth per  annum,  and  the

actual result came to 16 per cent. So it goes on. I

think  the credit for all this should be attributed

to   the   political  and  economic  stability   of

Singapore.  There  has  been tremendous  industrial

progress,  and therefore the demand for  telephones

has  exceeded anticipation. We have to continue  to

try to keep pace with progress up to a point. If we

ask  the S.T.B, to forecast the annual growth  rate

at 20 per cent, and the result turns out to be just

16  per cent, then we are going to overdevelop  one

aspect of the economic sector, the money for  which

could very well be used for other sectors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have said that the faults are not all due to

human error. But most of them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



are. It is true that poor maintenance has something

boundaries of Yio Chu Kang Police Station, which is

situated  at 9- m.s. Yio Chu Kang Road,  about  one

and a half miles away. In view of the proximity  of

Yio  Chu Kang Police Station to the village, it  is

not  considered necessary or economically  wise  to

open  another  police station or a police  post  in

Jalan Kayu at the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The siting of police stations and posts depends

on  the  overall development in any  area.  If  the

development  of  the  area  in  future   makes   it

necessary  to  replace  the present  Yio  Chu  Kang

Police  Station,  consideration will  be  given  to

establishing a station or post in Jalan Kayu.

Defence  (a) what is the total number of  cases  of

robbery  and  theft in the Delta Constituency  from

1st  January,  1970,  up to the  latest  convenient

date;  (b)  whether  he  will  consider  increasing

police  patrols  in the vicinity of  the  Alexandra

Road   Market   where  most  of  the  crimes   were

committed;  and  (c) whether the abolition  of  the

Havelock Road Police Station has diminished  police

vigilance in the area.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for the first

six  months  of this year a total of 163  cases  of

robbery  and  theft in the Delta Constituency  were

reported  to the Police. In comparison  with  other

crime  prone areas in Singapore, the crime rate  in

the  Delta Constituency is the second highest.  The

highest  is  in Toa Payoh. During the same  period,

44,  or  27  per cent, of the cases of robbery  and

theft  reported in the Delta Constituency  occurred

in  the  vicinity  of Alexandra  Road  Market.  The

Queenstown Police Station will continue to  provide

mobile  and foot patrols to police the whole  area.

In   addition,   detectives   from   the   Criminal

Investigation Department are employed to supplement

the divisional police in their work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, although the Havelock Road Police Station was demolished by 1st September, 1969, police vigilance in the Havelock Road area has not diminished. In fact, police patrols have recently been increased for crime prevention work in view of the redevelopment of this area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Choo Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Choo Kok (Delta):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wonder whether the Minister can tell the House  why

there  is  such a sharp increase in the  number  of

crimes in the Delta Constituency.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know

whether  the Member himself can tell the House  why

there is such a sharp increase in crime. Taken as a

whole, the increase is not that high. I think there

is  an  overall increase because of an increase  in

the population. Probably a sociologist will be able

to  tell the Member for Delta exactly why there  is

an increase in crime.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the authorities have carried  out  a

crime  prevention campaign, and an  exhibition  was

staged  in the hope that crime will be reduced  and

prevented.  I would like to know from the  Minister

whether  the  crime  rate has decreased  after  the

staging of such a campaign.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> From reports gathered, the crime

prevention campaign has been quite a success. A lot

of  people  have seen the display and the  kind  of

preventive work that can be done. It is  too  early

for me to say whether there has been an appreciable

decrease in crime as a result of this campaign.  If

people take to heart the lessons that can be learnt

from  this  campaign, I am sure  there  will  be  a

decrease in crime.

a.m, the following day. Criminal activities in  the

area have increased with the increasing population,

and  proposals to increase the police  manpower  to

provide adequate security for the Taman Jurong area

have  been submitted in the estimate proposals  for

there  might  be a case for another police  station

there,  but  at the moment there is no proposal  to

build a large police station in Jurong.

Law  and National Development (a) when construction

of  dwelling  flats in the former Balestier  Estate

along Lorong Limau will begin and when they will be

completed  for occupation; (b) whether those  flats

will  be  offered  first to  residents  in  Kallang

Constituency,  who have been or are  likely  to  be

development   programmes,  and  also   to   Kallang

residents  who are staying in slum-like areas;  and

(c)  what amenities will be provided to the tenants

of those flats.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question is in

three parts and I propose to answer accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Piling work for the flats in the former

Balestier Estate will commence in two months'  time

and  about 2,000 flats are expected to be completed

by  the  end  of  1971.  Another  3,000  flats  are

expected  to  be completed by late  1972  or  early

1973.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) These flats will be offered to both the public

and  the  clearance cases. Residents in the Kallang

Constituency  affected by the  clearance  programme

will be given priority, but not those residents who

are not so affected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) In Balestier Estate, a market and shopping

centre will be provided for the residents, together

with  car  parks  and children's playgrounds.  Four

acres  of  land  will  be  set  aside  for  outdoor

recreational amenities, like basket-ball, badminton

and sepak raga.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Will the Housing and

Development  Board tenants who are now  staying  in

slum-like overcrowded one-room flats in the Kallang

Basin Estate be given preference in transferring to

bigger  flats  in Balestier Estate, and  will  they

continue to stay in the Kallang Constituency?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> They will not be given priority

because  there are other slum-like areas  in  other

constituencies  which deserve as much  priority  as

the  slum  dwellers  of  Kallang.  But  should  any

residents   of   Kallang  be   affected   by   some

development  project  and are cleared  accordingly,

then they will, of course, be given priority as the

clearance  cases  are  given  priority   in   other

constituencies.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the

Minister  explain why the people who were  affected

by  clearance action in other areas outside Kallang

were allocated flats in Kallang? And why the people

in Kallang who



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



were  affected by clearance action were given flats

outside  Kallang,  because  there  were  no   flats

available  in Kallang at the time clearance  action

was  taken  by  the Housing and Development  Board?

What is the wisdom of that policy?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The answer is probably this. The

clearance cases in other constituencies were  given

priority because they were more special cases. But,

as far as is possible, we try to accommodate people

where they want to live, and preferably in the area

or  locality  from  which they have  been  evicted.

People  in  Singapore are reluctant to  move  from,

say,  Katong to Bukit Timah, or from Geylang  Serai

to Sembawang. This is because they have got used to

the   place.  But,  as  far  as  is  possible,   we

accommodate them where they would like to go.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can you please frame your

supplementary question, rather than make a speech?



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> Sir, the question is this.

Should  the  Minister  not  consider  giving  first

priority to those people living in slum-like  flats

at  $20 a month, with no private toilet, in Kallang

as  well as Whampoa and other areas? Some of  these

people  were moved into these slum-like flats  from

resettlement areas, and they were told at that time

that  they  would  be relocated in  better  housing

should it be available.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I think we are all getting confused!

The  question I was asked by the Member for Kallang

was  whether  people in his constituency  would  be

given  priority. The answer was yes, if  they  were

cleared by the Housing and Development Board or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



affected  by housing development. But if  they  are

not affected cases, in other words, if they are not

evicted  by  the  Resettlement  Department  of  the

Housing  and  Development Board, then they  do  not

deserve  the  same degree of priority as  clearance

cases. But we are just as interested in getting rid

of slums as both the Members are or appear to be.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, traffic control

lights   for  the  crossing  of  pedestrians   were

installed  at  High Street following  a  number  of

complaints  received during the  Pedestrian  Safety

Campaign early this year. The experiment was not  a

success  and  caused  confusion  to  motorists  and

pedestrians,  as  a  result of  which  the  control

lights  were  removed. About $450 was  incurred  in

their installation and removal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): From the answer

given   by   the   Minister,  we  know   that   the

installation and dismantling of the traffic lights,

though  it cost only $450, was undoubtedly a waste.

Can  the Minister say that from now on, before  the

authorities   concerned  set  up  similar   traffic

lights,  even on an experimental basis,  sufficient

consideration should first be given?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> I cannot agree more with the Member

that   sufficient  consideration  should  be  given

before  traffic  lights  are  installed.  The   sum

incurred in this case was small - we were fortunate

in  that respect. But I agree with the Member  that

it was rather foolish to erect traffic lights close

to a junction which already has traffic lights.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are 24

overhead pedestrian bridges in the Republic;  three

more  bridges are under construction;  and  tenders

have  been  called for the construction of  another

three.  Ten  of  these overhead pedestrian  bridges

have  been  let  out  for advertisements,  and  the

advertisements  displayed are in respect  of  goods

generally,  medicines, and cigarettes.  The  annual

income  received  from  these  advertisements   was

$54,110 in 1968 and $67,062 in 1969.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): My first

supplementary  question  is  this.  Regarding   the

advertisements  of  cigarettes  on  these  overhead

bridges, cannot the Minister try to cancel them  in

order to discourage cigarette smoking?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next question is on the tenders for the

construction of another three overhead bridges. Can

the  Minister inform the House where they  will  be

built?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if we cancel the

contracts   for   the   advertisements   of   these

cigarettes,  we  will  be  liable  for  breach   of

contract. These are annual contracts, and when they

expire  at the end of one year I assure the  Member

for Jurong that we will follow Radio and Television

Singapore   and   not   renew  advertisements   for

cigarettes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the six bridges, the three under active

construction now are one at New Bridge  Road,  near

the  People's Park; another one at New Bridge Road,

near  Hong  Lim Park; and the third at Tiong  Bahru

Road,  near Redhill Close. The two overhead bridges

which are

already   at   New  Bridge  Road  are,   in   fact,

constructed   by   the   People's   Park    Complex

developers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenders have been called for the construction of

three  more  overhead bridges at Bukit Timah  Road;

one  near  Swiss  Cottage School,  the  other  near

Coronation Road, and the third at Linden  Drive.  I

think  the  Member  will agree  with  me  that  the

traffic along Bukit Timah and Dunearn Roads on  the

main  highway to Johore is indeed very heavy; hence

three more overhead bridges.

<div align="center"><b>REORGANISATION OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>MOTOR TRANSPORT SERVICE OF SINGAPORE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Communications)</b></div>



<br><br>3.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

speak  on the subject of the reorganisation of  the

motor  transport  service of  Singapore  consequent

upon  the  presentation  of  the  White  Paper   to

Parliament yesterday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members  of this House will recall  that  on

the  31st  of  March this year, the Prime  Minister

officially   launched  an  all-out   anti-pollution

campaign  for Singapore. Besides focusing attention

on  the  need  for the early eradication  of  smoky

exhausts from motor vehicles, he also commented  on

some  important  aspects of  road  transport  which

needed improvement, namely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, that the 11 existing bus companies

should   be  amalgamated  into  fewer  but   larger

companies, and the necessity to streamline  present

bus routes for better bus services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, since the employment situation has

improved  considerably and there are now  many  job

opportunities available, pirate taxis would have to

be phased out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, that the diesel tax on private cars

would have to be raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, that taxi licences now limited to 3,800

would be increased to 5,000, and so on.



<br><br>It  was  thus  a matter of time before Government's

intentions on these subjects would be spelt out  in

greater detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after assuming the portfolio of the Ministry

of  Communications two years ago,  I  came  to  the

conclusion that something drastic would have to  be

done   to  overhaul  and  to  improve  the   public

passenger transport service of Singapore.  To  this

end,  I  appointed  a 15-member Transport  Advisory

Board  in  August  1968,  and  its  first  term  of

reference was `To study ways and means



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



how to improve the present public transport service

(bus,  taxi,  etc.)'. Much valuable work  has  been

accomplished by the Transport Advisory  Board  over

the last two years, and up to date it has submitted

two  interim  reports. Most of its  recommendations

have been accepted and implemented or in process of

implementation.  Although  the  Transport  Advisory

Board  has  not been able to come to  any  definite

conclusions regarding the most important aspect  of

public  transport,  namely,  bus  services,  enough

material  and  information  are  available  to   my

Ministry  for  it  to draw up a blue-print,  as  it

were, of a bold three-year reorganisation plan  for

the  motor transport service of Singapore.  In  the

wake  of  an all-out anti-pollution drive, this  is

indeed  the  opportune time, not for dilly-dallying

but  for  decision-making. Hence  the  White  Paper

which is now in the hands of Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tabling the White Paper, may I be permitted to

explain,  in  brief, the guiding  principles  under

which it was drawn up?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) First and foremost, it would have to be a

simple  yet workable plan and capable of  immediate

implementation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) That although Government does not propose to

nationalise the existing 11 bus companies, it  will

not  hesitate to exercise its powers to direct  and

control  the way in which bus companies  and  taxis

are  expected  to provide a reasonably satisfactory

standard of service for a public utility for  which

the  public is paying no less than $120 million  in

fares per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Any proper reorganisation of the public

passenger transport service must require a decisive

and  firm resolve to phase out the illegal `pirate'

taxis and the abolishment of the School (SCH) taxis

and the deadline has been fixed for 1st July, 1971,

or 11 months from now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this decision will have wide social and

economic repercussions affecting the livelihood  of

a  few  thousand, I wish to assure Members of  this

House that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



great  care  and thought have been  given  to  this

matter so that hardship, if any, will be reduced to

the barest minimum possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our plan proposes a two-way approach towards the

resolution of this tenacious problem:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) By creating not less than 6,500 job

opportunities over the next three years  under  the

plan (for details see para. 7.7 of White Paper):

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the present `pirate' taxi drivers be

reluctant  to change their occupation  as  drivers,

there  is an honourable way out for them to earn  a

decent livelihood and to become respectable members

of  the  community by fitting themselves  into  the

many  jobs  that will be made available under  this

reorganisation plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Once Government has decided to crack down

on  the  illegal activities of `pirate'  taxis  and

having  given them more than reasonable  notice  of

nearly  one  year to start a new chapter  in  their

lives, to be consonant with our "Republic's aim  of

building  a law-abiding, disciplined, tightly  knit

and  organised society for Singapore", a series  of

stem  measures will be taken against such  `pirate'

taxi  operators, to be enumerated later, which will

make  it  clear that continuance of such activities

will no longer be tolerated nor worth while.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then are the main targets to be achieved

under this plan (for details, see para. 13 of White

Paper)?  I  shall,  however,  enumerate  the   more

important objectives as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Anti-pollution campaign



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) We shall first tackle the smoky exhausts of

20,000 diesel vehicles which represent  just

over  10  per  cent of the total  registered

motor vehicle population of today.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Next we shall institute an age limit for

public service vehicles (both diesel and petrol)-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Bus services



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The first priority in any meaningful

reorganisation   of   our   public   passenger

transport  service is to increase the  present

public bus fleet from 1,400 by another 600  or

over  40  per  cent to 2,000 within  the  next

three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) It is proposed to introduce suitable

amending  legislation to the Omnibus  Services

Licensing  Authority Ordinance so as  to  give

the  Authority additional and wider powers  to

perform   the  functions  of  a  proper   Road

Transport Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) As from January next year, it is proposed

to  issue  only four licences to bus  companies

to operate bus services in Singapore. This pre-supposes  that  the  10 Chinese  bus  companies

would  have  voluntarily amalgamated themselves

into  three  regional companies  and  that  the

Singapore  Traction  Company  will  also   take

"strong steps to reorganise itself" or else  my

"Ministry  will  have  no  alternative  but  to

intervene".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) A transport consultant is already at work

to  co-ordinate and to rationalise for  maximum

efficiency  the  present 117 bus  routes  which

have  already  been  allotted  to  the  11  bus

companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) School buses



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Every encouragement will be given to the

rapid  expansion of the school bus  service  by

extending the 30 per cent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



reduction   in   road   taxes   for    general

application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) It is estimated that the present school

bus  fleet of 150 will be increased by at least

another 450 or 300 per cent to 600, within  the

next three years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The proposal of the National Trades Union

Congress  to establish a Workers Transport  Co-operative  not  only  for  taxis  but  also  to

provide  a mini school bus service will receive

every   encouragement  and  support   from   my

Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Taxis



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) With the proposed increase in taxi

licences from the present 3.800 by 1,200 or  35

per  cent  to  5,000, it has been decided  that

1,000   of  the  new  taxi  licences  will   be

allotted  to  the  NTUC Transport  Co-operative

when it is formed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) With the introduction of the age limit

for  taxis  at  seven years, at least  30  per

cent  of  the present fleet of taxis or  1.200

are  liable to he de-licensed because of  over

age, unless the present registered owners  are

able  to substitute these over-aged taxis with

new  taxis.  It has been further decided  that

over  the  next  three years  all  de-licensed

taxis  will  he offered to the NTUC  Transport

Co-operative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Of the remaining 20() new taxi licences

to be issued, it has been decided that these be

reserved for Special Tourist Taxis, as suggested by

the Tourist Promotion Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These special taxis will be air-conditioned of

not  less than 2,000 cc, capacity and they will  be

entitled  to charge a higher fare of 80  cents  for

the first mile and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



30  cents  for every subsequent half-mile  or  part

thereof.  Members of this House are aware that  the

current rate for ordinary taxis is 60 cents for the

first  mile and 20 cents for every subsequent half-mile or part thereof.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special taxis will have parking lots reserved for

them  to  operate  from  six  selected  sites,  and

concessions will be let out on tender soon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) `Pirate' taxis



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong, step-by-step measures which clearly

express Government's determination to put a stop to

the  illegal activities of `pirate' taxi  operators

will be as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Since the large majority of private diesel

vehicles are being used as `pirate' taxis,  it

is  therefore proposed to increase by 100  per

cent  the  present  rate  of  diesel  tax  for

private  cars.  The  increase  will,  however,

take effect in two phases. The first phase  of

50  per cent increase will take effect as from

1st  December,  1970 (four months  from  now),

and  the second phase of a further 50 per cent

will  take  effect as from 1st of  July.  1971

(11 months from now).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Seized `pirate' taxis which are in poor

mechanical   condition  will  no   longer   be

auctioned  for re-use as `pirate' taxis  again

but will be condemned and sold as scrap.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The driving licence of the `pirate' taxi

driver will be suspended for one year, in  the

first  instance, and a jail sentence  for  the

second offence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) `Pirate' taxi operations will be made a

seizable offence by legislation. This  means

that  the  `pirate'  taxi  operator  can  be

arrested  on  the  spot,  detained  at   the

police  station and produced  in  court  and

charged the next day.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) School (SCH) taxis



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) As school (SCH) taxis are now paying the

diesel  tax rate for private cars,  these  SCH

taxis  will be liable to pay the 50  per  cent

increase  in diesel tax as from 1st  December,

1970.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) With the proposed rapid expansion of the

school  bus  service  to include  mini  school

buses  as  well,  it  has  been  decided  that

school (SCH) taxis will be phased out as  soon

as  school buses and mini buses are  ready  to

replace them in 11 months' time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) Goods vehicles



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members of the House are already aware, a

pilot  scheme (proposed by the Traffic  Police)  is

already  in  operation as from 1st June to  relieve

congestion on our roads by restricting loading  and

unloading  of  goods during peak hours  along  nine

selected streets of the central business district.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the pilot scheme has been in operation

for only seven weeks, there is no doubt that it  is

already a distinct success, and when the time comes

for a review of the scheme to take place at the end

of  the  year, it is most likely that  it  will  be

extended to other parts of the city by next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) Motor cycles/scooters



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of this House will be pleased to know

that  although  he  wearing of crash  helmets  has

been made compulsory for `L' riders



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



only (which represent only 10 per cent of the total

number of licensed riders in the Republic) as  from

February  this year, more and more are  voluntarily

wearing  crash helmets before it becomes compulsory

for all to do so in January next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fact has been confirmed by statistics of

accident figures kept by the Emergency Unit of  the

Outram  Road  General Hospital. For the  five-month

period February/June 1969 there were 1,462 cases of

accidents  involving motor cyclists or  scooterists

without crash helmets, whereas for the same  period

this  year the number of cases fell to 919, a sharp

fall of 543, or 40 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When compulsory wearing of crash helmets for all

scooterists,  motor  cyclists  and  their  pillion-riders becomes effective as from January next year,

we  should  have less head injuries in scooter  and

motor cycle accidents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Private vehicles



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, it has been decided to subject all

private vehicles to inspection, in respect of  the

following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) On transfer of ownership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) An annual inspection will be required in

respect  of old vehicles to ensure  that  they

are,   in   fact,  in  a  fit  and  roadworthy

condition;  for motor cycles and  scooters  if

over  five years old; and for cars if over  10

years old.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j) Administration will be further strengthened

and facilities improved



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Pending strengthening of the staff in the

Mechanical   Section  of   the   Registry   of

Vehicles,   a   list   of   authorised   motor

workshops or repairers will be drawn up  whose

certificates of inspection that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



vehicles  are in order will be  accepted  by

the Registrar of Vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) A new Enforcement Section will be

established  comprising 80 men  which  could

be  attached  to  the Traffic  Police.  This

represents  a  50 per cent increase  on  the

present   approved  establishment  for   the

Traffic Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) A new Vehicle Inspection Centre,

estimated to cost nearly $800,000, is to  be

built  at  Sin Ming Road, off Upper  Thomson

Road  in  the Ang Mo Kio Industrial  Estate.

Approval  for  funds to  proceed  with  this

project  is, in fact, being sought vide  the

First  Supplementary  Development  Estimates

of  Expenditure for the Financial  Year  1st

April,  1970,  to 31st March,  1971,  before

this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This then is our plan-comprehensive and all-embracing to cover almost every aspect of motorised

transport which, in our opinion, can and should  be

improved  upon.  This  plan can  achieve  the  many

targets  set,  given  determination  and  sustained

effort  on  the part of those responsible  for  its

implementation. In concluding the statement, I  can

do no better than to quote the last paragraph 13.15

of the White Paper which states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This plan is a challenge and a great opportunity

tor those associated with: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Motor Transport in Singapore -the workers,

drivers,  conductors, mechanics,  fitters  and

management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Motor trade, especially the four local

assembly plants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The local banks, finance companies and the

Development Bank of Singapore.



<br><br>It  is  hoped  that all will come  forward  to  co-operate  and  to make their valuable contributions,

as  part of a joint national effort to ensure  that

our  Public Transport service will be placed  on  a

proper footing, once for all and also assist in the

creation  of  not  less than 6,500  meaningful  job

opportunities for our citizens.'

<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao (Katong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to ask whether an opportunity will be given to

Members  to  discuss this White  Paper  in  greater

Minister  not  feel that since much time  has  gone

into the composition of this White Paper, it should

deserve  correspondingly careful scrutiny?  I  also

remember that the Minister did almost promise  that

there would be a debate on this White Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Science and Technology (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has received two studies on the

modernisation of the existing National  Museum.  In

brief,  the conclusion is that the Natural  History

Division of the National Museum should be converted

to  a Life Sciences Division which will display the

functions  of the cell; how genetics  lead  to  the

existence  of  species,  methods  of  reproduction,

locomotion and control of behaviour by the brain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other proposal is that there should also be a

division which will show applications of scientific

principles  in  engineering and  technology.  There

will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



be  in  this division a science arcade given  to  a

series  of  small rooms which will  cover  exhibits

relating  to  specific  aspects  of  science,   for

example,   the  atom,  sound,  radar,   geophysical

exploration  which  is very relevant  in  Southeast

Asia  today.  There  will  also  be  an  Industrial

Technology  Hall  dealing with the techniques  made

use of generally in industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, there will be a Communications and

Transport  Hall  which will show  the  technologies

used in modern communication science and transport,

and  will  link this to the importance of Singapore

as a communications and transport centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two divisions will constitute the Science

Centre.  It  will be an autonomous  statutory  body

responsible   to  the  Ministry  of   Science   and

Technology. The Science Centre will be managed by a

single body, and this body will have access to  the

public  in the collection of funds. It is estimated

that there will be 340,000 visitors annually to the

Science  Centre. It is believed that the scope  and

organisation  proposed for the  Science  Centre  is

such  that  it can form a new institution  with  an

immediate    useful   function   and   considerable

potential.   It  is  a  challenging  concept.   The

strongest  claim  for proceeding with  the  Science

Centre  lies  in the ability of such  a  centre  to

supplement  science and technical  education  at  a

time  when  this  is  one of  Singapore's  greatest

needs.  The centre will certainly be the first  and

only  one  of its kind in the region. It  can  well

attract considerable attention from visitors coming

from  other  nearby  Asian  countries  as  well  as

serving the needs of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. F. Conceicao:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

voice  my  wholehearted support of  the  Bill.  The

Science Centre, as we have just heard, will  be  an

autonomous statutory body. It is good to note  that

whilst  the Science Centre Board will be ultimately

responsible to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister for Science and Technology,  it  will

yet   have  discretion  over  the  acquisition  and

disposal of funds, and have adequate administrative

control over its officers and employees so that  it

will  be in a position to direct the implementation

of its objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of the Board has a particularly

special  logic. The Science Centre, we have  heard,

will  have  two components generally, namely,  life

sciences  and technology. In the real  business  of

living,   these   two   aspects   are,   I   think,

inextricably   intertwined.  One   cannot   produce

technologists  without orientating such  people  to

the  objectives of technology, namely, to make life

much  better  for  the people. At  the  same  time,

trying  to interest our people in life sciences  in

vacuo   is,   I  think,  a  most  difficult   task.

Understanding of the relationship between  man  and

his  environment,  a perception of  the  ecological

problem, can best be inculcated by referring to the

effects  of technology on man. Technology  has  not

been  an unmitigated boon. Advances in science have

resulted in pollution, in noise, anti-conservation,

in traffic jams, in industrial hazards, mental ill-health, and so on. It is only when we bring home to

our  people  a  sense  of  the  vital  relationship

between  technology  and our  down-to-earth  living

that we can ensure a better life for our people  as

well  as help produce technicians and technologists

who  will  contribute to this  gracious  life.  The

setting  up  of this Science Centre  will  help,  I

hope, to combat our ignorance of the effects in the

long run of the exploitation of nature, as well  as

encourage  our people towards such an understanding

of science as will enable our society to advance to

more sophisticated levels of industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we must view this Bill as laying the

foundation for the establishment of the new Science

Centre. This Bill will enable the Board, when it is

set  up, to proceed apace with the negotiation  for

acquisition   of  exhibits,  training   of   staff,

planning for the construction of the centre itself,

and so on.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The centre will eventually take over the National

Museum, at least the exhibits there which relate to

the  life sciences. May I suggest that the  current

site  of  the  National Museum with its  historical

architectural features can serve as  a  centre  for

the  exhibition of such materials as can attest  to

the  various cultural backgrounds that make up  the

multi-faceted life that we enjoy in Singapore.



<br><br>3.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine Tan:</b> The idea of a Science Centre

is  a worthy one. I only hope that it will not turn

out to be expensive. I notice that no estimates  of

financial  expenditure are provided. While  we  are

fully   confident  that  our  Ministers   are   not

extravagant people, as a matter of principle and  a

precedent  for future Ministers who may not  be  so

trustworthy,  this  House  may  want   to   insist,

wherever  possible, on the provision  of  financial

estimates for proposed projects. As an economist  I

am  not used to signing blank cheques. However,  on

this occasion I willingly do so.



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I would like to congratulate the Minister  on

introducing  the  Science Centre Bill.  This  shows

that our Government is interested in advancing  the

technological knowledge of our country. Our country

is small, and therefore we cannot expect to compete

with  other advanced countries in this respect.  We

are  not  able to build an atomic reactor.  At  the

same time we cannot imagine that we will be able to

assemble a satellite to survey space, because  this

project will entail a lot of expenditure and  human

resources.   Nevertheless,   I   would   like    to

congratulate  the  Minister on his  far-sightedness

and effort in modernising our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have modernisation, we must have technology.

Mr Speaker, Sir, on the face of it, this Bill will

not  arouse  the interest of the people because  it

concerns science and technology. It seems  to  have

nothing to do with the workaday life of the people.

However, for the nation,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>



this  is a very important Bill. This is because  it

will  help  promote technology and science  in  our

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this Bill is to set up a

Science  Centre.  I am aware that the  centre  will

entail  a  lot  of  expenditure.  This  Bill   also

provides  that  public donations will  be  exempted

from   income  tax.  This  is  a  very  enlightened

measure. I would like to raise a few questions  and

hope the Minister will clarify them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, what benefit will the centre bring to

the country?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, where will the centre be located and

what will the Government spend on the building  and

equipment of the centre?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, what kind of research will be carried

out, and with what methods?



<br><br>3.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Chiang Hai Ding -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chiang Hai Ding (Ulu Pandan):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Science Centre Bill, which the  Minister

has explained to us, will lead to the establishment

and  maintenance  of a Science  Centre  which  will

exhibit objects related to life sciences as well as

science and technology. The Explanatory Note states

that  the function of the existing National  Museum

as  a  natural  museum will be taken  over  by  the

Science Centre Board. However, the National  Museum

also  has  exhibits  which  depict  the  growth  of

civilisation in Southeast Asia and the  development

of  modern  Singapore. I wish  to  enquire  of  the

Minister  what  will happen to these exhibits,  and

where  can Singaporeans see them in the future.  It

will  be  a  pity  if, in our laudable  efforts  to

promote  the dissemination of knowledge in  science

and  technology, we lose sight of the larger  human

canvas  against  which our industrial  achievements

ought to be seen



<br><br>3.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, several

Members  have made inquiries concerning the running

expenses



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



of  the Science Centre, and raised questions on the

future of the anthropological exhibits which are at

present  located  in the National Museum.  I  would

like to add that the members of the National Museum

Board  have recommended that the Science Centre  be

located  at a new site. I have no doubt  that  when

the  Science  Centre Board has been  appointed,  it

will  be  actively engaged in searching for  a  new

location  for the Science Centre. I am hoping  that

the anthropological exhibits in the National Museum

will  be permitted to remain there, and that  they,

together  with  paintings and other artefacts,  can

form an art gallery for the future. The Ministry of

Culture has been responsible for raising funds  for

an  art  gallery. At present, although we  are  not

quite  certain what progress has been  achieved  in

its  fund-raising campaigns, I have no  doubt  that

the  Ministry of Culture will be only too happy  to

acquire  the  present building, which  is  now  the

National  Museum,  so that it  can  house  the  art

gallery and whatever ancient antiques that  we  may

collect from time to time.

beg  to  move. "That the Bill be now read a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the appointment of the Director of

Audit  was provided for in section 101 (1)  of  the

Singapore Constitution Order-in-Council, 1958. This



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



Order-in-Council was repealed and replaced  by  the

Singapore Constitution, 1963, when Singapore became

part of the Federation of Malaysia. No provision in

the   Constitution,  however,  was  made  for   the

appointment  of the Director of Audit, because  the

Audit  function  was then a Federal responsibility.

After  separation, a similar provision as  that  in

section 101 (1) of the 1958 Order-in-Council should

have  been enshrined ill the Constitution, but this

was overlooked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Act, 1966, has provisions relating to

the  emoluments  and  removal from  office  of  the

Director  of  Audit, but not for appointment.  This

Bill now seeks to regularise the position by making

specific  provision  in  the  Audit  Act  for   the

appointment of the Auditor-General by the President

in   accordance  with  the  advice  of  the   Prime

Minister, in consultation with the Chairman of  the

Public Service Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity has also been taken to change the

designation  of the Director of Audit  to  Auditor-General   to  keep  in  line  with  the  usage   in

independent Commonwealth countries.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Society of Accountants Ordinance

was  passed  in 1963 to register and  regulate  the

conduct   of   all  accountants  and  to   maintain

professional   and   ethical   standards   in   the

profession.  This  Ordinance gave,  for  the  first

time,  recognition  to locally-trained  accountants

and accorded them professional status.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Society had a membership of 226 when it was

first   constituted.  By  the  end  of  1969,   the

membership   increased  to  708.   Based   on   the

experience  in  operating under the Ordinance  over

the   last   six  years,  the  Society   had   made

recommendations  for amendments to  the  Ordinance,

which  recommendations have been  accepted  by  the

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In brief, Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill seeks to

amend the Ordinance to provide for the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) an increase in the number of elected Council

members from eight to 16;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Council members to serve for a term of two

years,  with  half  the number  retiring  each

year;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) an increase in the number to form a quorum

for   Council  meetings  from  seven   to   12

members;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to enable the Accountant-General to nominate

an alternate to attend Council meetings;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) to replace the representative of the

Singapore  Polytechnic on  the  Council  by  a

representative    of   the    University    of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council, as at present constituted, consists

of   eight   elected  members  (four  from   Public

Accountants  and four from Registered  Accountants)

and   three  statutory  councillors.  The  proposed

amendment  is  to  increase the number  of  elected

members  from eight to 16 in order to  give  better

representation, as the membership  of  the  Society

has grown more than three times since 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, Council members retire at the end of

one  year. For the purpose of continuity, provision

is now made to require Council members to serve for

a term of two years, with half retiring each year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the enlargement of the number of elected

Council  members, the quorum for Council  meetings

should  accordingly be increased from the existing

seven to the proposed 12 members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the Department of Accountancy has been

transferred from the Singapore Polytechnic to  the

University of Singapore, the representative of the

Singapore  Polytechnic  on  the  Council   should,

therefore, be replaced by a representative of  the

University of Singapore.

<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Economic Expansion

Incentives  Act  of  1967.  The  Act  itself   was

intended to meet the situation prevailing  in  the

years   immediately  preceding  1967,   when   the

economic future of Singapore was clouded  in  some

uncertainty  as  a  result of our  expulsion  from

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than two years have passed since the

passage  of the Act and these two years have  seen

some  improvement, a great deal of which  was  the

result  of  the operation of the Act  itself.  The

time  therefore has come to take a fresh  look  at

the situation, more especially



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



so as several observers from aboard, including the

International Monetary Fund and a mission sent  by

the  Massachusetts Institute of  Technology,  have

commented on the generosity of our tax incentives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will deal with the main changes which are

provided  for by this amending Bill and leave  out

minor  and technical matters. The principal effect

of  the  Bill,  in so far as it affects  intending

investors,  is  a reduction in the period  of  tax

incentives for export enterprises from 15 years to

eight years. This will apply to the general run of

business,  but  in  exceptional  circumstances  as

defined in the Bill, the 15-year period will still

be available. These are for very large enterprises

with  a capital investment of $ I billion or  more

or   those  with  a  capital  investment  of  $150

million,  of  which more than  half  is  owned  by

permanent residents of the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the 5-year tax relief provided for

pioneer  industries, this incentive is  henceforth

available only to large enterprises with  a  fixed

capital  investment of not less than  $1  million.

Smaller   enterprises   may   apply   for   export

incentives,  but  if  they produce  only  for  the

domestic market they will get nothing as it is not

the  policy  of  the Government  to  give  Pioneer

Certificates to manufacturers who produce for  the

domestic market, whatever their size.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also amendments regarding depreciation

allowances. Hitherto, these can be carried forward

to  the  post-pioneer period at accelerated rates,

which  in effect means an extension of the pioneer

period  beyond  five years to six  years  or  even

seven years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, those who have been granted tax

concessions  under the 1967 Act will  continue  to

enjoy them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of the Government to make changes

in  our tax incentive laws has been known for some

time  both  to local industrialists and industries

abroad.  This  has been somewhat  helpful  to  our

investment promotion efforts. In the last four  or

five months, there



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



have  been  a  series of negotiations  between  the

Government   and  a  number  .of  large  well-known

international firms who wanted to take advantage of

the 15-year tax incentive while the going was still

good.  I am happy to announce to Members that  most

of   these   negotiations  have  been  successfully

concluded, the last one at 4 p.m, yesterday.  As  a

result,  we shall see some very large manufacturing

operations established in Singapore using  advanced

technology  and employing large numbers of  skilled

workers, technicians and engineers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the larger and more important of these

investors are General Electric of the United States

of  America, Philips of Holland and Rollei-Werke of

Germany,   producers  of  the   famous   Rolleiflex

cameras.  Each  of these companies  will  establish

enterprises in Singapore which will employ in their

plants between 3,500 and 5,000 workers by 1975. The

value  of  the aggregate output of these plants  by

1975  is expected to exceed $600 million. The range

of  products manufactured is very wide and includes

consumer   electrical  supplies,  home  appliances,

radios, tape recorders, production machinery, tools

and  dyes,  cameras, lenses and optical  equipment.

These  are  production  operations  and  not   mere

assembly.  A  training programme has  already  been

started  to  produce  the  skilled  craftsmen   and

technicians   who   are   needed   in   these   new

enterprises.  They  are  being  trained   both   in

Singapore  and abroad. I am sure that Members  will

want  me  to express our appreciation to those  who

were  responsible  for  getting  these  very  large

enterprises  introduced in Singapore.  The  persons

concerned  are the very dedicated officers  of  the

Economic  Development Board, who have put  in  long

and  sustained hours of work both in Singapore  and

in promotion offices in Europe and America.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting these large firms to agree to set up

these big projects in Singapore does not mean  that

everything is over bar the shouting. In  fact,  the

real work begins as from now. We have to ensure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



that  large numbers of skilled workmen, technicians

and  engineers are made available in  the  quantity

required and up to the standard of excellence which

these  companies have been led to  believe  we  can

achieve.  If we fail to produce these workers  with

the  requisite skills, diligence and ability,  then

the   whole  foundation  of  our  industrialisation

programme  would  be undermined.  This  requires  a

major  effort not only by the Ministry of  Finance,

whose  work is really done by now, and the Economic

Development Board and other agencies, but  it  will

need  sustained  effort by the Technical  Education

Department  of  the  Ministry  of  Education,   the

Polytechnic,  the University of Singapore,  Nanyang

University,  the National Trades Union  Congress  -

indeed the whole community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed



<br><br>4.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I am happy

to  see  this  Bill.  It has features  that  should

encourage  more  joint ventures,  greater  size  of

industries  and,  most important  of  all,  export-orientation.   Joint  ventures   are   particularly

significant  to an economy like ours, because  when

tax  exemption  is  given, at  least  some  of  the

profits accrue to our Gross National Product. There

is  a very real danger that where an enterprise  is

solely   foreign-owned  and  is   tax-exempt,   the

contribution  to our Gross National Product  during

the  pioneer period may be negligible, if  we  take

into  account  the  real  cost  of  providing   the

economic infrastructure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Bill gives encouragement to joint

ventures  only of enterprises worth at  least  $150

million. It seems to me to be desirable to  have  a

graduated  scale between the minimum  qualification

of  $1  million  for pioneer status  and  the  $150

million   qualification  for  special  depreciation

allowances and export-tax benefits of 15  years  in

order  to encourage those industries that are joint

ventures but which range in between $1 million  and

$150 million.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, we may want to build in a feature to

encourage  management  and  technical  training  to

local people. Perhaps an index of the proportion of

payroll  which is paid to local personnel could  be

used   in   determining  the  amount  of   pioneer,

depreciation and export-tax benefits,  again  on  a

graduated scale. It may be noted that salaries paid

to  non-local  staff may add to our Gross  Domestic

Product but not to our Gross National Product which

is  the  more accurate measure of national economic

welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for raising the qualifying capital expenditure

for an expanding enterprise from $1 million to over

$10  million, I think it may be desirable again  to

have  a  graduated  scale, with so  much  exemption

given   for  so  many  million  dollars  worth   of

additional capital expenditure. It is not clear  to

me  why,  if  we  allow pioneer  benefits  with  $1

million  capital expenditure initially,  we  should

require  reinvestment of $10 million  in  order  to

provide continuing benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the principle of the Bill is well considered and I support it.



<br><br>4.25 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Bill  is  in relation  to  the  economic

expansion  incentives and relief from  income  tax.

The Minister has talked at length in this House  on

various  aspects relating to the status of  pioneer

industries,   tax  exemption  and  other   matters.

According to him, the Bill can help our economy  to

progress further. However, I have several questions

which I would like him to clarify.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, if the amendment Bill is passed, will it

have any adverse effect on those industries with  a

smaller capital? For instance, as a result of  this

Bill,  investors  with a smaller capital  will  not

invest here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, what are the reasons behind the

introduction of this amendment Bill?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, how much revenue can our country get every

year after the Bill is passed?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Whampoa has

made  what,  to  me, appears to be  quite  a  valid

point. It is only a question of whether this is the

right moment to apply the policy he recommends. For

instance, he is recommending a clear distinction in

treatment    between   the   wholly   foreign-owned

enterprises  and  those in which local  capital  is

allowed participation. I am wholly in sympathy with

this policy. The only question is whether we should

introduce it now or wait until our industrial  base

is so firmly established that we can afford to risk

some adverse comment which is bound to arise in the

investing countries. When the time comes,  when  we

are  more  self-sufficient in technology and  know-how, and possibly even in markets, this policy will

not only make sense but can be introduced with less

risk than is the position today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards giving preference for employment of

local  management personnel, may  I  say  that  the

demand  for  management personnel  is  so  much  in

excess of supply that, far from encouraging foreign

investors  to employ local personnel, I have  often

had  to urge them to bring their own personnel  and

not  to  disrupt  the  tight market  situation  now

existing. In fact, it has been necessary for me  to

enter into a gentleman's agreement with some of the

larger American and British companies not to  pinch

each  other's  executive staff. Here again  if  the

supply  and demand position changes, we can have  a

try  at  it,  but it is likely that the demand  for

good  executives  of ability and  high  engineering

skills will remain in short supply for a very  long

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa asked why $10 million for

expansion  when  there is only  $1  million  for  a

pioneer firm. The rationale behind it is that if

a  pioneer firm has been running for some time  and

has  had experience, it has got good value for  its

money.  And  if  it really wants more  concessions,

then  the  size  of the increment  should  be  much

greater  than  is the case with a new  venture.  We

thought  that $10 million was a convenient  figure,

but any other figure will do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang asked whether there

would be any adverse effects on smaller industries.

I assure him that there will be no adverse effects.

Smaller  industries  will not be  persecuted.  They

will still continue to flourish, one hopes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also asked why we introduced this

amending Bill. Perhaps I did not make it very clear

in  my Second Reading speech. The point is that the

original Act has been too generous. We gave  people

15  years' lax exemption, whereas we think now that

with  eight years' tax exemption we will  get  them

coming  in.  Similarly, there is no reason  why  we

should  give pioneer status to very small companies

as  we are doing now. It is a lot of work and quite

often  these small companies do not profit  anyway.

So the pioneer status is quite meaningless to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang also wants to know how

much  more  revenue we will collect  from  this.  I

really do not know. There is no way of making  this

calculation because it all depends on how many  new

firms come in and what profits they make. The  only

thing  that  I  know is that we will  collect  more

revenue under this amending Bill than under the old

one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Dr Goh Keng Swee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg  to  move, "That the Bill he now read a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A national serviceman who joins Government

service  after having served a period of  full-time

national service, is now granted salary increments,

on  appointment, commensurate with the time he  has

spent  in  such  full-time  national  service.  The

various   statutory  boards  have   also   followed

Government's  example.  This  is  to  ensure   that

someone  who  is  called up for full-time  national

service  and later joins the service of  Government

or one of the statutory boards does not lose out to

his contemporary who is not called up for full-time

national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, however, proposes to take this one

stage  further.  A  youth who  undergoes  full-time

national  service will also be rewarded  by  having

such  service included as pensionable service under

the Pensions Ordinance, 1956, if he is appointed to

and subsequently retires from Government service in

pensionable circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, the Pensions Ordinance only allows

for  service in a civil capacity to be included for

pension purposes. The Bill, in seeking to amend the

Ordinance,  provides  for  the  President  to  make

regulations for this purpose. The period  of  full-time  national service could be put in at any time,

whether  before or after the officer's  appointment

to Government service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, Mr Speaker, Sir, is only fair recognition

of  the  service in the cause of our country  which

our national servicemen put in. No one in his right

senses   would   grudge  this   to   our   national

servicemen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill provides that where an

officer is retired in the public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>



interest   under  paragraph  (e)  or   in   special

circumstances  after  having  completed  15  years'

service  under paragraph (j) of subsection  (2)  to

section  7  of the Ordinance, he will  not  draw  a

pension till he has attained the age of 50. This is

to  ensure  that an officer who retires prematurely

does  not  in  the long run benefit more  than  the

officer  who serves his full career in  the  public

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, an officer who is retired at the

age of 35 years in the public interest would, if he

joined  the  service  at 24 years  of  age  and  is

drawing  a salary of $1,000 a month at the time  of

retirement,  normally  be eligible  for  a  monthly

pension  of about $200 plus a gratuity of  $10,000.

If  this  is  paid  to him from  the  time  of  his

retirement  at 35 up to the age of 70, which  is  a

reasonable life expectancy, he would draw  a  total

of $102,000 over the 35 years he is in receipt of a

pension.  Moreover, he would be in  a  position  to

find  other employment after retirement  and  would

benefit  from the Central Provident Fund  or  other

superannuation scheme in addition to the salary  he

would receive from such employment. This surely  is

an  anomalous  situation where an  officer  who  is

retired  or retires prematurely benefits more  than

one  who gives his whole working life to the public

service with loyalty and dedication and retires  at

the normal retirement age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is, however, being made for payment of

gratuity  to  the  dependants  of  an  officer  who

retires prematurely and who does not survive to  50

years.  An officer who retires prematurely and  who

is  mentally or physically incapacitated to such an

extent  that  he  is  unable  to  continue  in  any

employment  before he has attained the  age  of  50

sears may also be paid his pension from the date of

such incapacitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to provide that a police

officer  below the rank of Assistant Superintendent

in  any Auxiliary Police Force, as may be specified

by  the  President by notification in the  Gazette,

may be retired and paid a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>



pension on reaching the age of 45. This is to bring

the  retirement age in the present and  any  future

Auxiliary  Police Force in line with  that  in  the

regular Police Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Toon Chia -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Toon Chia (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, with the changes in our

circumstances and situation, the loop-holes in  our

laws  which  are  not in keeping with  our  society

should be plugged. It is wise for the Government to

introduce this amendment Bill. This Bill treats the

period  of national service as pensionable  service

for   national   servicemen  who  join   Government

service.  In  other  words,  our  youths  who  have

completed national service and who join the  public

service  will have their period of national service

taken  into  consideration when their pensions  are

computed  on  retirement. Their full-time  national

service  is  regarded as effective public  service.

Furthermore,  national  servicemen  who  join   the

public   service  are  granted  salary   increments

commensurate  with the period they  have  spent  in

full-time  national service.  But  I  do  not  know

whether the statutory boards and private enterprise

have  also  implemented this scheme.  What  is  the

outcome  of  the negotiations between the  National

Trades  Union  Congress and private  enterprise  to

ensure  that  our  youths who have completed  their

national service will benefit from this scheme?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, this scheme also applies to the statutory boards. But I do not know whether national servicemen who join the public service and the statutory boards are exempted from having to serve a three-year probationary period. If they have to, then it is in conflict with the principle

that  national  service  is  deemed  to  be  public

service. This will put them at a disadvantage  when

they  compete  with  other  people  who  have   not

undergone national service in promotion exercises.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not a weak country. It is a country

which implements measures when these are necessary.

It  is  a  country  which places  emphasis  on  the

responsibility of its people and it  is  a  country

located  in  a  strategic  position.  In  order  to

survive  and prosper, it is necessary to  follow  a

non-aligned foreign policy and, at the  same  time,

build up its defences. This shows that the measures

which  have  been taken are wise and are  receiving

the  support  of the people. However, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  to  a  young  man who has undergone  national

service,  it  is  proper  for  the  Government   to

legislate  to safeguard his interest and to  regard

his two-year full-time national service as part  of

his public service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support this Bill. I hope the Minister

will  also  pay attention to our youths'  prospects

for   further  studies  in  order  to  ensure  that

national service can be a perfect system.



<br><br>4.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  wish  to  speak on the second part of  the  Bill

dealing  with  public  officers  having  to  retire

prematurely  and  their  entitlement   to   pension

benefits. I do agree with the rationale behind this

Bill that an officer who retires prematurely should

only  be  entitled  to the drawing  of  pension  on

reaching the age of 50 years. However, I feel  that

this  particular feature of the Bill has not  taken

into  consideration the fact that a public  officer

can  opt  for  a  full  pension,  a  three-quarters

pension and a quarter pension with gratuity. What I

want  to know is, if an officer retires prematurely

and  he  is not able to receive the monthly pension

until  he reaches the age of 50 years, will  he  be

entitled  to  receive his gratuity  immediately?  I

hope  that  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  to   the

Minister for Finance will give a "yes" answer to my

query, simply because I think that there will be no

rationale  behind  the move to prevent  an  officer

from  receiving  his gratuity payment  immediately.

The   reason   is  this:  I  will  just   give   an

illustration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>



If  an officer retires prematurely on good grounds,

at  the  age of 40 years, and he is given immediate

pension benefits, meaning that every month he  gets

his  pension allowance, then he definitely  has  an

added  advantage over another serving  officer  who

has got to serve till the normal retirement age. It

gives  him  an extra ten years to draw  that  extra

money.  Therefore, if this Bill seeks to stop  that

loop-hole,  I  think the rationale is  sound.  This

will  not  make those dedicated and loyal  officers

who serve up to the normal retirement age feel that

they have been unfairly treated, and that those who

leave the service prematurely get an added monetary

benefit. But the amount of gratuity will not change

once it is computed -whether he receives it at  the

age  of 40 years or 50 years. He is entitled to it.

Therefore, I would imagine that while, or, the  one

hand,  there is a rationale for stopping an officer

from  getting his pension allowance immediately  on

his premature retirement, I see no rationale at all

for   stopping  him  from  getting  his   gratuity.

However,  I  hope that my fears are  unfounded  and

that  the Parliamentary Secretary will give a "yes"

answer to my query.



<br><br>4.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, let me reply

to  the  Member for Moulmein first. I am  afraid  I

will have to disappoint him. My answer is "No".  If

the Member can accept the rationale that an officer

who  retires prematurely should not get his pension

until  he  reaches the age of 50  years,  the  same

rationale surely should apply to the exercising  of

the  option  to  have  a  gratuity  and  a  reduced

pension.  Surely,  he  is not saying  that  $10,000

today is the same as $10,000 in 20 years' time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

just  like  to  inform the Parliamentary  Secretary

that  the moment a person joins the public service,

before he even thinks of retiring prematurely or in

normal  circumstances, he will have to opt  at  the

outset  whether he wants a full pension or a three-quarters pension



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>



and  the  rest  to be computed in  the  form  of  a

gratuity. The choice is made, and if that statement

is  disputed, then either I have been in the  wrong

Government   service   in   the   past,   or    the

Parliamentary Secretary is not aware of the service

conditions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I stand to

be  corrected,  but I do not think  the  Member  is

right  when he says that an officer has to exercise

his  option at the very beginning of his career  in

the  civil service. He exercises it at the  end  of

his career. Six months before he retires, he has to

give notice, and in exceptional circumstances,  the

President can waive that six months' notice.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

want   to   carry   on  this  diatribe   with   the

Parliamentary Secretary. I think he  has  to  check

that  fact  first because I know  it  from  my  own

experience. As a former teacher, I was required  to

opt  for  full  or reduced pension at  the  outset,

unless,  of course, the Ministry of Education  made

the  mistake of asking me to make the option - that

probably is possible -but I doubt that; in spite of

their  inefficiency, they are not likely to make  a

mistake  like  this  because  this  is  under   the

direction  of the Treasury. As one who happened  to

be  a  civil servant in the past I am quite certain

that  this  is  the  practice. An  officer  is  not

allowed  to  carry on for 10 or  20  years  of  his

career,  and  finally make that option  six  months

before his retirement. In fact, at the very outset,

when he makes the option, it is very clearly stated

that it is irrevocable.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I quote

from  clause  15  (1)  of the Pensions  Regulations

which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`An officer to whom a pension is granted under

the  Ordinance  may, at his option  exercisable  as

hereinafter  provided, be paid,  in  lieu  of  such

pension, a pension at the rate of three-fourths  or

any  greater fraction of such pension together with

a gratuity equal to such number of times the amount

of  the  reduction  so made in the  pension  as  is

specified in paragraph (6) of this regulation.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 (2) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The option shall be exercisable, and if it has

already  been exercised, may be revoked, not  later

than the day immediately preceding the date of such

officer's retirement:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that if the officer does not exercise

the  option prior to the day preceding the date  of

his retirement, the President may, if it appears to

him  in  all the circumstances equitable so to  do,

allow  the  officer to exercise the option  at  any

time  between the date and the actual date of award

of a pension to him.'



<br>Does the Member understand that?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will

continue  this  controversy with the  Parliamentary

Secretary after this session, but the point I  made

earlier  was  not whether the option is exercisable

at  the  beginning or at the end of  the  officer's

career. The point I wanted to make was this. In the

illustration I gave earlier, the officer retires at

the  age of 40 years. Then from 40 up to 50,  which

should  be his normal retirement age, he  gets  ten

years  extra of pension allowance. Therefore,  this

gives  an added advantage to an officer who  leaves

the  service  much  earlier  than  one  who  serves

faithfully   until  the  normal   retirement   age.

Therefore  you  stop  it, and  I  say  there  is  a

rationale for this. But how does this compare  with

gratuity? Because whether you give him gratuity  at

the age of 40, 45, or 50, it is the same amount.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance just now mentioned one point, that is, that the value of money today and its value in ten years' time is not the same. My point is, do you think that it is fair that an officer, after having served a number of years and you allow him to

retire with all the retirement benefits, should not

be  given the amount of money that is due to him in

the form of a gratuity when the money value is much

more than what it will be ten years hence? You  are

not  giving him the added advantage hut that  which

is  rightly his. I do not think it is right for the

Government to prevent him from immediately  getting

what  is  due  to  him as a gratuity.  But  if  the

Government  does  not allow him to  get  a  pension

immediately on his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>



premature retirement, it is merely saying that  his

normal  pension  benefits only start  when  he  has

attained  the  age  of  50  years.  Therefore,  the

Government  is  not giving him ten years  extra  of

pension benefits. But whether the Government  gives

him  the  gratuity before that or after  that,  the

amount  is  still the same. That is my  point,  Mr

Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I really

cannot  see the logic of the argument of the Member

for   Moulmein.  On  the  one  hand,  he   is   not

quarrelling  about the rationale of  not  paying  a

pension until the officer reaches 50 years of  age.

On  the  other  hand, he says we  must  pay  him  a

gratuity now because the amount paid today  is  the

same as the amount paid 20 years hence. Is that the

Member's  argument? If so, I will  borrow  $100,000

from  him  now  and pay him back  $100,000  in  ten

years'  time without any interest. If that  is  his

argument,  he should have no objection  at  all  to

lending  me the money. In fact, the whole point  is

that $100,000 today is not the same as $100,000  in

ten  years' time, it grows. This is because if  you

put  $100,000  into a bank drawing eight  per  cent

interest  per annum, then every year  you  will  be

receiving  $8,000 in interest. And  in  ten  years'

time, the amount will double itself.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to  clarify my point. I do not want to  enter

into   a  controversy  over  the  value  of   money

increasing  or  diminishing in years  to  come.  My

point is this. The Government has no moral right to

use somebody else's money to make money. Similarly,

it  cannot say, "Today, we will not pay in full the

M.P.s'  allowances, or the Ministers'  salaries  or

the  Government servants' salaries. Instead we will

pay them the balance of the money at the end of  so

many  years."  The Government's point  of  view  is

quite  different, because it thinks  it  will  earn

interest  on it. Making money is a good thing,  but

the point is, has the Government the moral right to

take  somebody's money that is due to him and  earn

interest  on it? I think not only is the Government

keen  but  the officer is also keen to get interest

earned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>



from the money put into the bank. But the point is,

who  has  the  moral  right to the  money?  If  the

Government is thinking in terms of paying  him  the

interest, I think that is quite fair, because it is

saving  the  money for him. If he  is  entitled  to

$10,000 gratuity, then the figure of $10,000 is the

same  due  to  him no matter when he is  given  the

gratuity.  That is what I meant when I said  it  is

the  same amount. But whether the purchasing  power

of  money  has  diminished or  not  is  a  separate

matter. This is the money that is automatically due

to  him.  You pay him gratuity after he has  earned

it.  How  can you keep his money and deny  him  not

only  the opportunity to earn interest on  it,  but

you  also  deny him the chance probably  to  buy  a

house, or the opportunity to make use of the  money

profitably.  I think the Government  has  no  moral

right  to  take  that  opportunity  away  from  the

officer concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I just cannot

understand the logic of the argument of the Member.

He  seems  to be tying himself up in knots.  If  he

quarrels about the granting of pension as from  the

age  of  50, all right, that is possibly a question

of  difference of opinion. But he does not  quarrel

about that at all. He quarrels about the fact  that

we are not giving officers a gratuity on retirement

day, irrespective of whether the officer reaches 50

years  of age or not. The Member sees it from  only

one  point  of  view. But there is also  the  other

point of view. He is like a horse wearing blinkers,

Sir! [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> The whole point is that it is

an  anomaly  if an officer who prematurely  retires

should  get pension from the day of his retirement,

while  his  colleague in the civil service,  having

given  full,  loyal and dedicated  service  to  the

nation,  should receive less than this officer  who

has  not  done  that well and prematurely  retires.

Surely  if  that argument applies to  pensions,  it

also   applies   to  gratuities.  Any  businessman,

banker, or economist



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>



can tell you this: $100,000 today definitely has  a

higher value than $100,000 in 10 or 20 years' time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If for example, an officer retires before 50 and

gets   a  quarter  of  his  pension,  computed   as

gratuity,  then us colleagues, who  remain  in  the

service  and continue to give faithful  service  to

the  nation, are at a disadvantage. Then,  at  what

time  are  we  going  to give gratuities  to  those

dedicated civil servants who remain in the service?

At the very time they join the service? Surely this

is not right. That is why I say that the Member for

Moulmein  is  tying himself up in  knots.  He  just

cannot  understand  the logic of  my  argument.  He

agrees  with  one  line of it.  It  is  a  parallel

argument,  Sir.  He agrees with  one  line  of  the

argument,  and  yet  he  says  that  the   parallel

argument is not true. He goes off at a tangent.



<br><br><!-- Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Inche Sha'ari Bin Tadin):</b> He is making a

mistake.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> The same argument, therefore,

applies to pensions or gratuities. Those who retire

prematurely  will be given the option  to  exercise

whether  or  not  to  have a  reduced  pension  and

gratuity. But both the reduced pension and gratuity

will  not be payable until the officer reaches  the

age of 50 years, or sooner if he is incapacitated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think I have sufficiently answered the Member for Moulmein. Actually I need hardly answer the Member for Kampong Kapor, as the only point he raised was the increment in salaries. This is already in force in Government departments as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>



well   as  in  statutory  boards.  The  Government,

however, cannot force this upon the private sector.

But  the Government is doing its part, and we  hope

the  private  sector will follow  its  example  and

treat our national servicemen fairly and squarely.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kapor also talked about

the  probationary period. Surely, Mr Speaker, Sir,

this has nothing to do with pensions. I think it is

only  fair  that if everybody who joins  the  civil

service  is  required  to  undergo  a  probationary

period,  then the same condition should also  apply

to  national  servicemen, even after completion  of

their national service, because in any case they do

not lose out at all. This means that everybody goes

on probation for a certain period. If we make it an

exception for national servicemen, they would  have

an  advantage. Whether or not that is desirable  is

not  for me to say. The point is that it is  better

that   everybody   should   be   given   the   same

opportunity.
