<div align="center"><b>(Suspension of trading of shares)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister why the

Stock  Exchange  of  Singapore (SES) suspended  the  trading  of

shares of Mid-Continent Equipment Ltd on SESDAQ, and whether the

SES should have approved the `Initial

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



Public Offer' application by the company, especially considering

the large percentage of private placement shares.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, trading in the shares of Mid-Continent Equipment Group  Ltd

("Mid-Continent")  on SESDAQ began on 22nd July  1998  following

its  initial public offer ("IPO") of 18 million shares at  $0.15

each.  SES  suspended trading in the counter on 31st July  1998,

following a sharp run-up in prices and large volumes during  the

first eight days of trading, and  confirmed on 11th August  1998

that the shares in Mid-Continent had been cornered. The SES  has

referred the case to the CAD to investigate possible offences of

manipulation  under the Securities Industry Act. The  attachment

(Cols.  985  - 988) that I have circulated to Members  sets  out

fully the facts of the case.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1998/19980904/19980904-HA-0690985.htm">Attachment - The Trading and Suspension of Mid-Continent Shares on SESDAQ (Cols. 985 - 988)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SES approved Mid-Continent's IPO application because

Mid-Continent met the listing requirements for a company  to  be

admitted  to  SESDAQ,  according  to  the  existing  rules   and

procedures. However, the Mid-Continent case revealed  weaknesses

in these rules and procedures that need to be put right.

<br><br><i>Concentration of Placement Shares</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the Mid-Continent IPO was an over-concentration of shares in the hands of a few persons. 90% of

the IPO shares were placed privately with only five persons. The

company's  shares  were therefore vulnerable to  being  cornered

when trading started.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not MAS or SES policy to require companies to sell

the  majority  of shares in an IPO by open subscription  by  the

public,  or  to limit the private placement tranche  to  only  a

small percentage of the IPO shares. The listing rules for SESDAQ

allow  a company to use private placement for up to 25%  of  its

IPO  shares, or a higher proportion if the SES agrees that there

are good reasons for doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, the SES has been flexible in allowing

companies to sell IPO shares via private placement, particularly

for Main

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>

Board  listings.  SES has used this discretion more  widely  for

SESDAQ  listings  since August 1997, in view  of  the  difficult

market conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mid-Continent was similarly allowed a large private

placement tranche of 90%. The problem was not this large private

placement  per  se,  but the small number  of  placees  and  the

resulting over-concentration of IPO shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present SES rules are inadequate to prevent such over-concentration. Moreover, neither the company nor the issue

manager  is required to inform the SES of the number of  placees

and  their respective shares of the IPO issue. For several years

now,  the  SES  has  left it to the issue manager  to  ensure  a

sufficient  shareholding spread after an IPO so that trading  in

the secondary market would be orderly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This needs to be reviewed. In Hong Kong and the United

Kingdom,  a  company can distribute up to 75% of its IPO  shares

via  private placement, but this is subject to a tight limit  on

the  value  of  shares placed to each investor. Hong  Kong  also

requires  a minimum number of such placees.  MAS has  asked  the

SES  to  propose  rules  to  prevent over-concentration  of  IPO

shares,  including  the maximum percentage that  can  be  placed

privately and the minimum number of placees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once provisions to prevent over-concentration of IPO shares

are  put  in  place,  issue  managers will  be  responsible  for

complying  with  them  and  ensuring a  sufficient  shareholding

spread for orderly trading in the secondary market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SES will also introduce requirements on standards of

conduct  for issue managers to bring them in line with the  best

practice internationally.

<br><br><i>Responsibility for Approving Listing Applications</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also reviewing the procedures for approving

listings.    Presently,  the  SES  is  solely  responsible   for

approving  applications  by  companies  to  list  on  the  stock

exchange.  In 1983, after a spate of listings

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>

of  doubtful quality, the Minister for Finance had directed  the

Securities  Industry  Council (SIC) to advise  the  SES  on  new

listing  applications.  The  final decision  on  listings  still

rested  with  the SES, but there was close consultation  between

the SES and SIC. But this arrangement ceased last year after the

SIC  decided  that  it no longer needed to  review  SES  listing

decisions .

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corporate Finance Committee chaired by Mr Lim Yong Wah

is  studying  the  appropriate roles for  the  SES  and  MAS  in

approving  listing  applications and  the  issue  of  shares  by

companies.  One  issue is whether the MAS should  be  given  the

power  to overrule decisions of the SES on listing applications,

where   it  considers  this  necessary  to  protect  the  public

interest.  Regulators in some other jurisdictions  can  exercise

such  veto  powers within a mandated time period. However,  such

powers should be used sparingly and only when the regulator  has

strong  reasons  to  believe that doing  so  is  in  the  public

interest.

<br><br><i>Approval of Listing Applications under a Disclosure-Based Regime</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS agrees with the proposal by the Corporate Finance

Committee   for  a  predominantly  disclosure-based   regulation

regime. This will give more room for the market, rather than the

regulator,  to  judge the commercial merits of transactions.  It

will  help  to  develop  deeper capital  markets,  with  broader

participation from institutional investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But disclosure-based market discipline is not an automatic

formula  for sound and orderly financial markets. In established

markets  which  adopt a disclosure-based regulatory  philosophy,

the  stock  exchange  or  regulator  does  not  totally  suspend

judgement  on  the  proposals put to it. The stock  exchange  or

regulator should not attempt to judge commercial merit,  but  in

some  instances it may have non-commercial grounds  to  conclude

that  a proposal is not in the public interest. For example,  it

may  have  reasonable  cause  to  doubt  the  integrity  of  the

directors or major shareholders of a listing applicant.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>

In   such  cases,  it  may  consider  disapproving  the  listing

proposal. We too need to develop such safeguard mechanisms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained MAS' position with regard to approving

listing applications in order to clarify what a disclosure-based

regime  means, and not to comment on the specific case  of  Mid-Continent.  MAS will evolve its regulatory style to  allow  more

free  play  in  the market. But it will not lower  standards  of

integrity,  or  allow our financial markets to be  brought  into

disrepute through manipulation and sharp practice.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

the Deputy Prime Minister has said that he would not comment  on

the case, I would not ask about the case.  May I ask him whether

he  could  explain  what  are the rules  and  penalties  against

manipulation of shares?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, I believe manipulation of

shares is a criminal offence and one can go to jail.

<div align="center"><b>HUMANITARIAN AID AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TO INDONESIA</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  whether  the  Singapore  Government  will  review  its

humanitarian aid and financial assistance to Indonesia  in  view

of  the unfavourable comments and doubts expressed by Indonesian

President B.J. Habibie.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar) (for</b>

<b>the Deputy Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in his National Day

Rally  speech on 23rd August 1998, the Prime Minister  laid  out

the rationale for our assistance to Indonesia.  We have a vested

interest   in  Indonesia's  stability,  growth  and  prosperity.

Indonesia  is a close neighbour and a major trading partner.  We

have  large  investments  in Indonesia. An  Indonesian  collapse

would hurt Singapore as well as affect the regional economic and

investment climate.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister also pointed out that because Singapore

is  a  small country, our capacity to help Indonesia is limited.

But we are committed to helping our neighbours within our means,

so  that  Indonesia and the region can recover from the  present

crisis as soon as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the sitting on 1st June 1998, the Deputy Prime Minister

had  informed  Members that the Singapore  Government  would  be

proceeding  with humanitarian aid to Indonesia as  well  as  the

proposed Bilateral Trade Finance Guarantee (BTFG) scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, on 6th July 1998, the Singapore Government

announced  that it would provide humanitarian aid  in  rice  and

medicine  worth  S$12  million  to  Indonesia.   Singapore   and

Indonesian  officials  have started  work  on  implementing  the

assistance.  Minister  for Education  and  Second  Minister  for

Defence, RAdm (NS) Teo Chee Hean, visited Indonesia from 5th-7th

August 1998 to deliver the first shipment of humanitarian aid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesian Minister of Defence and Security/ABRI Commander,

Gen.  Wiranto,  received the humanitarian aid on behalf  of  the

Indonesian  Government  at a hand-over ceremony  on  6th  August

1998. In his speech, Gen. Wiranto expressed his appreciation and

gratitude to Singapore, and described the handing-over  ceremony

as  a  milestone in strengthening the ties of friendship between

the two nations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 4th August 1998, just before Minister Teo's visit to

Indonesia, the Asian Wall Street Journal (AWSJ) had published an

interview  with  President Habibie, covering Indonesia-Singapore

relations. It quoted President Habibie as saying that "a  friend

in  need  is  a  friend indeed. I don't have that  feeling  from

Singapore",  and  that  "There  are  211  million   people   (in

Indonesia). Look at that map. All the green (area) is Indonesia.

And that red dot is Singapore. Look at that."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minister Teo's visit to Indonesia was planned and scheduled

earlier.  It  was  not  made in response to President  Habibie's

comments  to the AWSJ. Minister Teo called on President  Habibie

on 6th August 1998.  President Habibie repeated to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>

Minister  Teo  what he had said to the AWSJ. But  he  also  told

Minister  Teo that he had a vested interest in maintaining  good

Singapore-Indonesia  relations.  He  thanked  Minister  Teo  for

Singapore's humanitarian assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsequently, other Indonesian officials have expressed

their  appreciation.  The Indonesian media  has  also  generally

reported  favourably on our humanitarian assistance.  Kompas,  a

major  Indonesian daily, on 12th August 1998 referred to  it  as

evidence "that our bilateral relations remain in a good state".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue with our humanitarian assistance.

Singapore  and  Indonesian officials are  now  working  out  the

details of the second delivery of aid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the proposed Bilateral Trade Finance Guarantee

Scheme,  we  remain prepared to proceed with the scheme,  as  we

believe   it  can  help  to  restore  confidence  in  Indonesia.

Singapore officials held the first meeting with their Indonesian

counterparts  in  April. The Indonesian officials  said  at  the

meeting  that they would have to study the proposal  in  greater

detail.   In  his recent Jakarta trip, Minister Teo agreed  with

Coordinating   Minister  for  Economy,  Finance  and   Industry,

Ginandjar  Kartasasmita, that officials from both  sides  should

continue discussions on the BTFG. Singapore officials are  ready

to  resume  discussions as soon as their Indonesian counterparts

convene the next meeting.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  humanitarian  aid represents a  sincere  and  genuine

gesture  of  Singaporeans.  I am sad  only  to  be  received  by

doubts and cynicism and reciprocated by callous remarks ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Are you asking a question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> I would like to ask the Minister

whether  he  would inform President B. J. Habibie of Singapore's

disappointment over his remarks.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think we take it from

the  point  which I have mentioned.  As I have said,  the  Prime

Minister  has  said  that Singapore has  a  vested  interest  in

maintaining good relations with Indonesia and a vested  interest

in  Indonesia's  stability,  growth and  prosperity.   President

Habibie  has  also informed Minister Teo that he  has  a  vested

interest in maintaining good Singapore-Indonesia relations.   So

the  leaders  at  the highest levels have said  that  they  have

vested   interest  in  maintaining  good  bilateral   relations.

Singapore will work on that basis.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Am I to understand that the

remarks  do  not  represent the views of Indonesian  people  and

because  of  that,  we  will continue  with  our  commitment  to

humanitarian aid  to Indonesia?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to

speculate  on  remarks and comments made by  other  leaders.   I

would  confine myself to saying that both sides, at the  highest

levels, have expressed the wish to embark on good relations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> May I ask the

Minister  whether in giving financial assistance  to  Indonesia,

will   Singapore   Government  consider   adding   environmental

conditions   so  that  our  assistance  will  not  inadvertently

accelerate economic activities and conditions in agriculture and

other  sectors that give rise to the haze, and especially if  it

leads to fire?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have given and

extended humanitarian assistance in good faith, considering  the

difficulties which are being faced by the Indonesian  government

and its people.  When we give such aid, we give it in good faith

and we cannot micro-manage and attach too many conditions of the

nature that the Member has said.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I wish to clarify with the Minister that I

was  speaking  on  the  financial assistance  and  the  possible

bilateral   trade   financing  scheme,  not   the   humanitarian

assistance which I accept.

<div align="center"><b>(Setting up)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ong Kian Min</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether

the Government will consider setting up a development assistance

programme,  which is funded within our means and  resources,  to

serve  as a mechanism for providing (i) loans, grants, technical

cooperation  and  other  forms  of  assistance  for   meaningful

projects  in  the region; and (ii) humanitarian aid,  where  the

situation requires.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  Singapore  is a small economy  relative  to  the

neighbouring  countries in the region.  The assistance  that  we

can  give  through  loans,  grants and  humanitarian  aid  would

naturally be limited.  Singapore should focus on areas where our

help can be most effective.  This would principally be in giving

technical  training, helping local companies establish  economic

activities   in  these  countries,  and  offering   humanitarian

assistance  where  the situation requires.   These  are  already

adequately covered by well-established mechanisms.  There is  no

need to start yet another development assistance programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore provides training and transfer of technical

expertise  to countries in the region through the Singapore  Co-operation  Programme  (SCP), administered  by  the  Ministry  of

Foreign  Affairs.  It comprises of two programmes,  namely,  the

Third-Country Training Programme and the Technical  Co-operation

Programme.   Approximately  S$16.25  million  has  already  been

allocated to the Singapore Co-operation Programme this  year,  a

considerable  portion  of  which  has  been  channelled  towards

Indonesia and Vietnam.  Training is concentrated on areas  where

Singapore  has  special  competency  and  experience,  such   as

maritime   management,  information  technology  (IT),   airport

management,   environmental  management,  economic   and   trade

development   and   financial   services.    In   1997    alone,

approximately 800 public officials from Indonesia, Malaysia, the

Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam benefited from this programme.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore also provides help through the Regionalisation

Assistance  Schemes  administered by  the  Economic  Development

Board  for  local  companies venturing  into  the  region.   The

Assistance   Schemes  comprise  seven  support  programmes   for

Overseas     Project     Identification,    Overseas     Project

Implementation,  and  two  support  funds  for   Joint   Venture

Feasibility Studies in third countries.  The aim is  to  provide

selective aid in the form of economic incentives - mainly grants

and  financing  schemes  -  for local enterprises  to  undertake

meaningful   and   viable   development   projects   and   other

investments.   These will in turn help generate  employment  and

contribute towards economic development in these countries.   In

FY97,  the  Government spent approximately S$18 million  on  the

Regionalisation Assistance Schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of humanitarian aid, the Government has offered

support  in cash and kind towards humanitarian relief in various

disasters  around the world.  These have typically been  on  the

scale  of tens of thousands of dollars.  None have been  of  the

magnitude  of  the  S$12  million worth  of  rice  and  medicine

Singapore  is offering Indonesia over and above the S$5  million

raised by the Singapore Red Cross.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> I would like to ask the

Minister   if  the  ringgit  deposits  held  by  the   Singapore

Government can be deployed towards these or similar purposes for

projects,  say, in Malaysia and, if not, what is the  status  of

Singapore's  ringgit  deposits in light of  the  recent  capital

control measures undertaken by the Malaysian government?

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> The question is slightly outside

the  ambit  of the question.  However, I do not think  that  the

ringgit holdings should be used for specific purposes because we

can fund all our aid projects from our normal pool of funds.  On

the  question of the status of our ringgit deposits,  the  Prime

Minister  has  already  said  that the  Government  has  several

billion dollars worth of ringgit in its reserves.  Some of these

ringgit are in the form of on-shore deposits placed with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>

Malaysian banks in Kuala Lumpur.  But the bulk of it is held  in

ringgit deposits in Singapore banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GIC is currently seeking clarification from the

Malaysian  authorities  on the status of  our  on-shore  ringgit

deposits and GIC is also discussing with our local banks on ways

in  which  the ringgit deposits can be repaid to the Government.

However, whatever the outcome of these discussions, I can assure

the  Member that the GIC will not suffer any capital loss on its

ringgit holdings.

<div align="center"><b>BUY BACK OF COMPANY'S SHARES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Implementation)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Ker Sin Tze</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether

he  will  consider allowing companies to buy back  their  shares

from  the  market  and, if so, whether such  a  scheme  will  be

implemented in the near future.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the share buy-back

proposal  is in fact included in the Companies (Amendment)  Bill

1998  being tabled today.  It had been developed after extensive

consultation  with  the Stock Exchange of Singapore  (SES),  the

Association of Banks of Singapore (ABS), the Singapore  Merchant

Bankers'  Association  (SMBA), the Law  Society,  companies  and

industry  participants.  The proposal will be  implemented  when

Parliament has discussed and agreed to pass the Bill, which will

hopefully be in November or earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment, if passed, will allow the purchase or

acquisition  by a company of its own shares, without  having  to

apply  to  court  for approval.  Currently, a company  can  only

return capital to its shareholders by way of a capital reduction

under section 73, which requires confirmation by the High Court.

This  can  be  a time-consuming and expensive process.   Capital

reduction  also  does  not  give  listed  companies   the   same

flexibility as a share repurchase in terms of the method, timing

and amount of capital to be returned to shareholders.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate safeguards and disclosure requirements have

been  incorporated  in the proposed amendments  to  ensure  that

share buy-backs by companies will not be abused to the detriment

of  shareholders and creditors.  The details are set out in  the

Companies (Amendment) Bill 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional safeguards for public listed companies will be

formulated  by the Stock Exchange of Singapore as  part  of  its

listing rules.

<div align="center"><b>NURTURING OF ENTREPRENEURIAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Introduction of fiscal measures)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Finance (a)

what  kind  of fiscal measures or policy changes the  Government

will   introduce   to   nurture  an   entrepreneurial   business

environment in Singapore; and (b) what avenues are open to local

enterprises   to  develop  partnerships  with  Government-linked

companies  in  order to capitalise on emerging opportunities  in

the region.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a number of policy

changes  and programmes have already been implemented to nurture

an entrepreneurial business environment in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bankruptcy laws went through a major reform in 1995.

One  of the primary objectives of the new Bankruptcy Act was  to

encourage entrepreneurship, especially in cases where bankruptcy

had arisen from misfortune rather than malpractice, by having  a

more   liberal  regime  in  bankruptcy  discharges.   With   the

liberalization, bankrupts are also encouraged to work towards an

early  discharge.   The  law  was also  amended  to  enable  the

Official  Assignee to discharge more bankrupts  by  certificate.

Further  studies are currently being undertaken to determine  if

additional changes are necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also appointed a Corporate Finance

Committee  under  the Financial Sector Review  Group,  which  is

currently looking into ways to facilitate the listing of  start-ups  on  the  stock exchange.  Details will be released  in  due

course.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Government has also been actively

promoting the venture capital industry in the mid-1980s.  As  at

the  end  of 1997, there was over $7.7 billion worth of  venture

capital  funds  managed  in Singapore.  Currently,  these  funds

enjoy  tax  exemption on the gains from disposal of investments,

and on certain investment incomes for a maximum of 10 years.  To

further encourage the growth of the venture capital industry,  I

have  announced in this year's Budget Statement that the current

10-year limit will be extended, on a case-by-case basis,  by  up

to a further five years, at a concessionary tax rate of not more

than  10%.  This will encourage venture capital funds to take  a

longer-term  perspective of their investments  and  to  minimize

premature divestment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also established a $50 million

Technology Development Fund (TDF) which co-invests with  private

venture  capital  firms  to fund early  stage  ventures.   Other

similar    funds    include   the   $100   million    Technology

Commercialization  Fund and the $100 million Pharmaceutical  and

Biotechnology  Growth  Fund.   EDB  Investments   Pte   Ltd,   a

subsidiary of the Economic Development Board, also runs  venture

capital  funds  that  invest in start-up  companies  at  various

stages of development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the concern on the avenues open to local enterprises

to  develop  partnerships with GLCs, I would like to  point  out

that  GLCs  have  been forming partnerships with  smaller  local

enterprises for regional projects.  However, the test is in  the

degree of complementarity between the specific needs of the GLCs

and  the capabilities of the SMEs.  We should not force  a  pace

beyond what commercial reality dictates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also been facilitating the development

of   partnerships   between  the  GLCs  and  smaller   Singapore

companies.   An example is through the business interaction  and

networking  made  possible  at  Trade  Development  Board  trade

missions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLC/SME partnerships are already beginning to happen on the

ground.  For

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>

example, STIC, a GLC, has brought its core group of suppliers to

Wuxi  in China and paved the way for the latter to form business

tie-ups  with  our  suppliers  there.   Sembawang  Shipyard  has

brought  a number of local contractors to support their  Karimun

yard  in  Indonesia.   Another  example  is  PSA  helping  local

companies bring their port-related innovations to overseas ports

that PSA has invested in.

<div align="center"><b>UNEMPLOYMENT AND JOB PLACEMENT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

what is the latest unemployment figure; what is the success rate

for  the  job placement service that his Ministry provides;  and

how  many  workers  have  been able to find  jobs  through  this

service.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, the labour market continued to soften in the second quarter

of  1998.  The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 2.3% in

June 1998.  This was slightly higher than 2.2% in March 1998 and

substantially higher than 1.7% in June 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual unemployment rate without adjusting for seasonal

factors  was 3.2% in June 1998 compared with 1.9% in March  1998

and  2.4% in June 1997.  Unemployment is traditionally  high  in

June as this is the period that the new local tertiary graduates

join  the  ranks  of job seekers.  An estimated  62,100  persons

(seasonally  unadjusted  figure) were unemployed  in  June  1998

compared with 36,500 in March 1998 and 45,500 a year ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employment Service Department of the Ministry of

Manpower  registered about 1,500 to 1,700 new  job  seekers  per

month in recent months.  About 80% of job registrants were  able

to  get  job referrals from the Department.  Based on companies'

feedback,   about   6%  of  the  total  job   registrants   were

successfully  placed in employment.  The ESD records  show  that

about  50%  of  the registrants were able to find employment  on

their  own,  or they rejected the job offers by the  prospective

employers.   The  reasons  cited  for  rejection   include   the

unsuitable nature of work, working hours, location of workplace,

or salary.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan (Nominated Member):</b> Will the Minister

please  enlighten  the  House  as to  whether  the  duration  of

unemployment   has  increased  and  also  the  nature   of   the

unemployed,  in other words, are these predominantly  older  and

unskilled workers?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not have the

figures on the re-employment rate.  But I understand that the re-employment  rate between the first and second quarters  has  not

changed substantially.  There may have been a slight lengthening

in the period of unemployment among those who were retrenched or

out of work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the profile of the unemployed persons, as

most of the retrenchments in the last two quarters, about 68% to

69%  of  the  retrenched  workers, came from  the  manufacturing

sector,  you  will expect to find more women.   In  fact,  there

could  well  be a higher proportion of the older or  middle-aged

workers,  ie, those above the ages of 35-40 and above, and  that

in  itself presents an added dimension to the problem.   Because

they are older, less educated and less skilled workers they have

greater  difficulty  finding new jobs and that  is  why  we  are

investing so much money and effort in providing them with skills

upgrading  opportunities so that they can take on the  new  jobs

that are being created in the other sectors of the economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> I would like to ask the

boards  will consider increasing their intake of these graduates

in view of the shrinking job market in the private sector.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the labour market

loosens  and employment creation slows down, we can expect  that

even  graduates  will find greater difficulty in  getting  jobs,

particularly new graduates, and this is to be expected.  I  hope

that  this  year's batch of new graduates will  understand  this

position and also, more importantly, revise their expectations.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our part, we will assist graduates who need job

placement  assistance.  They can register  with  the  Employment

Service  Department if they have difficulty finding  a  suitable

job  match on their own.  We will help them find a suitable  job

match  because  we  have a team of officers  in  our  employment

facilitation  team who will make contact with all the  employers

in  the various sectors that we know are still recruiting staff.

We will try to help the graduates who register with us to find a

suitable job match.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the statutory boards and Government departments, let

me  assure  the Member that Government departments and statutory

boards  will  continue to recruit manpower  according  to  their

needs.   Faced with this crisis, we should not try to  take  the

approach  of  using the Government as a sponge to  soak  up  the

surplus manpower as the economy slows down.  There is a limit to

how much the Government can do to soak up this surplus manpower.

What  we have to do is to create real jobs for them.  We  should

not just randomly recruit graduates because we want to provide a

refuge for them in this period of economic slowdown.  That would

be unwise.  It would lead to Government inefficiency and, in the

long  term, it will hurt us more than it will benefit us.   What

we  should do is to try to stimulate development, bring in  more

investments, and create more jobs so that the graduates can  get

employment and make a real contribution to the economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I quite agree with the Minister that we

should  not employ surplus graduates at this time.  But  clearly

if  there  are a number of ministries or departments  which  are

understaffed, according to their establishment guidelines, would

the  Ministry of Manpower consider, using this time, filling  up

those establishment limits?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it goes without

saying that if a ministry or department is understaffed, whoever

is in charge will look at this loosening of the labour market as

a  golden  opportunity to fill up the vacancies that he  has  to

live with for so long.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Does the Minister have any

statistics  to  show that the starting salary for new  graduates

has dropped and by how much has it dropped?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this year's batch of

new graduates has just entered the job market in the last 1«  to

two  months.   So I think it is still too early to  gather  such

details.  We will in due course have such information available.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, in a recent report in

the  newspapers,  it  was reported that  the  starting  pay  for

graduates  hired  in  the civil service is the  highest  in  the

industry.   Will the Government take this opportunity to  revise

this  downwards  so that it sets a trend for  the  rest  of  the

private sector?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the civil service

salaries are closely pegged to the private sector.  If, in fact,

the  private sector's starting salaries are going down,  in  due

course, the civil service will also make an adjustment.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Reduction)</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Cyrille Tan -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. To ask the Minister for Manpower, with regard to the

Government's  stand  that  a  cut  in  the  employers'   Central

Provident Fund contributions will only be considered as  a  last

resort, what constitutes a "last resort".

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Question No. 7, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since 1987, we have

built up a flexi-wage system to enable companies to adjust their

wage  costs  through the variable component of wages,  based  on

company's  performance.  This variable component now constitutes

16%  of  total  wages.   In the unionised sector,  the  variable

component  is  20%.  This provides a cushion  for  companies  to

reduce wage costs in difficult times.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NWC recommendation for 1998 is wage restraint. It was

formulated  in  May, when the forecast for economic  growth  was

2.5%-4.5%  for  the  year. Since then the regional  outlook  has

deteriorated.   We now expect the economy to grow  by  0.5%-1.5%

for  this year. The figure is still positive, but this does  not

truly reflect current reality.  In a rapidly changing situation,

quarter-on-quarter  figures  give a  better  indication  of  the

direction of the economy, although they are more volatile.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a quarter-on-quarter basis, seasonally adjusted growth

was only +0.3% in the first quarter, and was -1.7% in the second

quarter.   We  can expect very weak or negative growth  for  the

rest of the year and next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These difficult economic conditions are already being

reflected  in  wage  settlements.  My Ministry's  data  on  wage

settlement  achieved  so far showed that  the  weighted  average

basic  wage increase up to July this year is only 2.5%, compared

to   5.9%  last  year.   The  average  increase  agreed  between

management  and unions has progressively dropped  since  January

this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, NTUC data paint the same picture. NTUC has reported

that  over  the  last two months, 48 companies  employing  4,490

workers settled for a wage freeze, out of which one company  had

a  wage cut.  Many more requests for wage freeze are now on  the

negotiating table.  NTUC expects that for the year as  a  whole,

the average basic wage increase will only be 1.5%-2.5%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, variable payments are likely to be cut.

NTUC  expects bonuses, including the Annual Wage Supplement,  to

average  1.0-1.3 months this year, down from the 2.3  months  on

average that were paid out last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, overall, total wages are likely to decrease by 5%-8%

this   year,   compared  to  last  year.  This  is  a   valuable

contribution  to  cutting business costs, and helping  firms  to

remain viable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flexi-wage scheme is therefore working. Union leaders

have been very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>

responsible,   moderating  the  expectations  of   members   and

negotiating  realistic settlements. Many companies  are  already

exercising  not just wage restraint, but severe wage  restraint.

This  is a prudent interpretation of the NWC recommendations  in

the present circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the question is whether flexi-wage adjustments alone

will  be  enough. Flexi-wages are effective for making  firm-by-firm  adjustments, when individual companies are in  difficulty.

But  if we need to lower wages across-the-board, as part  of  an

overall   reduction  in  our  business  costs,  then  flexi-wage

adjustments  may need to be supplemented by a cut in  employers'

CPF contributions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regional crisis has altered the competitive landscape.

Many  Asian  countries have seen large currency depreciation  of

25%-75% against the Singapore dollar.  With unemployment rising,

their  wages  have not increased to compensate for  the  reduced

purchasing power.  This has sharply reduced their labour  costs,

and made them more cost-competitive compared to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our electronics exports have lost market share in the US.

Other  Asian countries have lost market share too, but  by  less

than  Singapore.  The retrenchments in our electronics  industry

are  partly  caused  by companies shifting production  to  other

countries,  including Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea.   This

goes  beyond the normal process of industry upgrading. It  is  a

sign  that we are becoming less competitive.  We must watch this

carefully, and not allow our manufacturing sector to be hollowed

out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Prime Minister said at the National

Day  Rally,  our  solution  is not to depreciate  the  Singapore

dollar  to  match that of our competitors. That would erode  the

purchasing  power  of workers' wages, and reduce  the  value  of

workers' CPF savings, through higher inflation.  It is better to

maintain  a  stable exchange rate, and tackle the components  of

business  costs  directly, whether they are wages,  rentals  and

land  prices,  and  Government  taxes  and  charges.   Indeed  I

understand this has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>

been  the  MAS'  policy - to maintain a stable Singapore  dollar

exchange  rate,  but  within flexible limits  that  reflect  our

economic fundamentals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on a trade-weighted basis, the Singapore

dollar  exchange rate has risen only slightly since  the  crisis

began,  particularly  if we discount the  effect  of  the  large

depreciation of the Indonesian rupiah.  The purchasing power  of

the  Singapore dollar has been maintained, as seen in  our  very

low consumer price inflation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government will reconvene the National Wages

Council  to  update  their  recommendations  in  the  light   of

developments  since May, and issue new wage guidelines  to  help

the economy cope with the continuing crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Trade and Industry is currently studying

all   components  of  costs  in  Singapore  to   establish   how

competitive we are in this changed situation, and what  we  must

do to strengthen or restore our competitiveness.  This will be a

major  focus  of  the  report of the  Committee  on  Singapore's

Competitiveness, chaired by Mr Lee Yock Suan.  The  report  will

be  ready  before  the end of the year.  In an overall  plan  to

reduce costs, wages will have to bear its share of the reduction

through the flexi-wage adjustments and, if necessary, a CPF cut.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister what are the chances of not having a CPF cut this year?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, in a nutshell, a cut in the

employers'  CPF next year is very likely, but we  will  have  to

wait   for   the  report  from  the  Committee  on   Singapore's

Competitiveness to make its full recommendation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central):</b> Sir, I would like to

ask  the  Minister  whether the Government is  taking  steps  to

ensure  that  employers do their fair share to see  an  economic

turnaround  instead of taking the easy way out by cutting  wages

or cutting employers' CPF contribution.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> As I have explained in my answer, it is

not just a question of cutting wages.  Government will also make

a  comprehensive review of all taxes, rates and levies  to  help

minimise  cost of business in Singapore.  At the same  time,  it

stands to reason that employers faced with this crisis will also

be  examining  their  business  strategy,  re-engineering  their

business operations, for instance, looking for new product  mix,

in  order  to survive this crisis.   They will have to look  for

new  markets and in their efforts, they will receive  additional

support from Government.  The Trade Development Board will  help

them to look for new markets for their products.  In the case of

Singaporeans  who want to invest abroad and to find  new  places

where they can invest, Government will also provide the kind  of

support  to help them reach out to new locations where they  can

invest to continue their business.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, my question has

partly  been  asked  by  Mr  Rai.   In  the  light  of  Malaysia

implementing its currency control policy and its adverse effects

on  Singapore, will there be a possibility now that CPF will  be

cut this year rather than next year?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Malaysia's imposition of

currency control took place barely three days ago.  We can  wait

a while to see the full impact on Singapore before we decide how

it  will  affect us and what should be our response  by  way  of

improving our wage competitiveness.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, the NWC

negotiation  had indicated a downward trend.  Furthermore,  most

of  the unions have agreed to cut the variable component  and  I

think  we also know that if things become very bad, maybe a  CPF

cut  will  be  the  last resort.  Then why is there  a  need  to

reconvene the NWC?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, when the NWC made its recommendation

this year, it was through a series of deliberations in April and

May.   The  situation  then  was very different.   The  regional

crisis has got worse over this period, between May and now.   In

fact, the regional crisis has not bottomed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>

out  yet.  Changes are still taking place almost on a day-by-day

basis.   Malaysia has just introduced exchange  control,  as  Mr

Chiam has mentioned.  This is a sign of the seriousness of their

economic  problem.  And as the Prime Minister had  said  at  the

National  Day  Rally,  when there are economic  difficulties  in

Malaysia, it will have a serious impact on Singapore.   We  will

be  affected  when they have difficulties.  Likewise,  Indonesia

continues to face serious economic difficulties.  A shortage  of

essential  food  supply  continues to cause  social  unrest  and

create  problems of law and order.  This year and the next  year

will therefore be very difficult years for Singapore.  There  is

a  real  likelihood  that  we  will  end  up  with  much  higher

unemployment than we have experienced since the mid-80s.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reducing business costs, including wage cost, will help our

companies to weather this crisis.  It will help us to reduce job

losses though it may not lead to a quick recovery because we are

suffering  largely  from  the impact  of  the  regional  crisis.

Hence,  I think it is necessary at this juncture for us to  take

another  look  at  our wage policy.  So by  reconvening  NWC  to

review  its recommendations made in May this year will give  the

trade unions representing the workers and the employers who  are

component  parties  of the NWC to re-examine the  whole  changed

environment and come to a new consensus on how we could  improve

our wage competitiveness.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, may I ask how soon

will  the  NWC  be  reconvened and what is top  on  the  agenda,

whether it is a CPF cut or implementing a wage freeze?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I will try to get the reconvening of

NWC  settled as soon as possible.  I expect that we will be able

to  make an announcement by next week.  The priority for NWC  to

consider  would be the wage guidelines, what should be the  wage

guidelines for the rest of the year.  NWC will also examine  the

background to the need for a CPF cut and make its recommendation

in that respect.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, it is indeed laudable

to  note  that the NTUC has taken the initiative by  urging  its

members  to  go  for wage restraint.  In view of  the  worsening

economic  situation, what further measures are being  considered

to  save  jobs  and to restrain and, wherever possible,  prevent

further retrenchments?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, as I mentioned in my main answer,

the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness will be looking  at

all  these issues and to develop a new strategy for us  to  cope

with   the   crisis.   This  would  include  how  to  seek   new

investments, how to look for new markets for Singapore,  how  to

reduce  our overall cost of business so that we can become  more

cost competitive in view of the changed condition.  And it would

include, of course, how much more effort and investment we  must

put  into  upgrading the skills of our workers so that they  can

take on the new jobs that are created by the flow of investments

coming into Singapore.  This will be settled by the Committee on

Singapore's Competitiveness.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister when will the

Government  announce  the public sector bonus  in  December  and

whether the 13th month annual wage supplement is part of  flexi-wages for the public sector?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> The NWC, as I said, will be reconvened

sometime next week.  After the NWC has the chance to meet and to

discuss and make its recommendation, the public sector will then

announce its position.  As to whether the 13th month annual wage

supplement  is part of the variable component, as I said  in  my

answer, the NWC has already indicated that it will be considered

adjustable.  In the case of a company that is doing  very  badly

and making losses, certainly the AWS may also be reduced.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would like

to  ask  a  question related to the consequences of a  CPF  cut.

Would  the Government encourage or allow the banks to reschedule

loans for private properties if there is a CPF cut,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 924</b></font><br><br>

because  this  will be the main concern when  the  CPF  is  cut,

especially  now  that the HDB has announced that  it  will  help

those  who  have  bought HDB flats?  But in the private  sector,

there does not seem to be any clear direction on this.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, should there be a need to cut

employers'  CPF contribution, we understand that it  will  cause

difficulties  to  home  owners  who  are  servicing  their  home

mortgage  loans.  This includes those who have bought HDB  flats

and  those who have bought private properties.  In the  case  of

those  who  bought HDB flats, HDB will look into how  to  assist

them over this period.  When we made a similar cut in 1986,  HDB

offered rescheduling of their loans, longer repayment period and

a  ballooning  repayment  scheme.  There  is  a  whole  host  of

alternatives that can be found and can be offered to home owners

who  have  difficulties.  In the case of the private properties,

during  the  mid-80s when we had to cut CPF, Government  offered

them a  soft loan pegged at CPF interest rate.  It is a bridging

loan  to help them over this period.  We will look at all  these

possibilities.  We will look at all these means of helping  home

owners  who are adversely affected and implement those that  can

help them to cope with the crisis.

<div align="center"><b>WEST MALAYSIAN WORKERS' CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Seng Han Thong</b> asked the Minister for Manpower (a)

what  exactly was the Malaysian Government's call on the  return

of West Malaysian workers' Central Provident Fund;  (b)  what is

our  official  response to the call;  and (c) if  there  is  any

official response, what are the conditions attached.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, several Malaysian

leaders have made statements, questioning why Singapore chose to

treat  East and West Malaysians differently with regard  to  CPF

withdrawal conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are reasons for the distinction between East and West

Malaysians.   West Malaysian CPF members are distinguished  from

other  foreign  CPF  members because  of  the  historical  links

between

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>

Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore.  Geographic proximity enabled

many  West  Malaysian  workers  to  shuttle  frequently  between

Peninsular  Malaysia  and  Singapore.   West  Malaysians   often

returned  to  Singapore to work after a period of  absence  from

Singapore.   This  was unlike other foreigners, including  those

from East Malaysia, who were fewer in number and seldom returned

to work after they had left.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Malaysian CPF members, in fact, are given preferential

treatment  over  Singapore members.   Apart  from  enjoying  the

privilege   of   tax-exemptions  on  their  CPF  savings,   West

Malaysians  can  withdraw their full CPF savings  from  age  50,

without having to set aside the minimum sum, provided that  they

have not worked in Singapore for at least two years prior to the

withdrawal request.  Singaporeans can only withdraw their CPF at

the  age  of  55,  and after they have set aside the  prevailing

minimum sum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, CPF funds belong to individual account holders and not

to  governments.  There is no question that the CPF  savings  of

West  Malaysians  will  always belong  to  the  West  Malaysians

themselves.  Only individual West Malaysians can withdraw  their

own  CPF  savings  when  they  meet  the  age  criteria.   Their

contributions were made in accordance with the prevailing  rules

and  withdrawal conditions that have been in place  since  1971.

All  workers  in Singapore, including those from West  Malaysia,

were  well  aware  of  these rules upon assuming  employment  in

Singapore.   They  are therefore bound by the  withdrawal  rules

that  they  had  accepted  when  they  first  came  to  work  in

Singapore.  From 1st August 1995, all foreigners, including West

Malaysians,  were not required to contribute to  CPF.   However,

West  Malaysians who have savings accumulated before  this  date

must continue to be subject to the prevailing withdrawal rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Prime Minister

Dr  Mahathir Mohamad discussed a framework for wider cooperation

between Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>

and  Malaysia, including changes in CPF withdrawal criteria  for

West  Malaysians.   Although they have held further  discussions

since  then,  they  have not yet reached  an  agreement  on  the

framework for wider cooperation.  Once an agreement is  reached,

this issue will be resolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Malaysian Minister of Human Resources wrote

to  me  to  enquire  on  this matter.  I  have  replied  to  the

Malaysian Minister to explain that the matter should be left  to

the  two  Prime Ministers when they resume their discussions  on

bilateral cooperation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, did the Ministry receive any

feedback  from West Malaysian workers that they prefer to  leave

their savings with the CPF?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> While my Ministry did not receive such

direct feedback, I understand that there had been calls made  to

the  NTUC  by  West  Malaysian workers who  have  expressed  the

sentiment that they prefer very much to leave their savings with

the CPF than for it to be repatriated back.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the Minister what

the  Government's  response would be to  Malaysia's  attempt  to

bring  this  matter  to  the International  Labour  Organisation

(ILO).

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a Question for

Written Answer on this subject.  Nevertheless, if they do  bring

it  up to the International Labour Organisation, we will respond

accordingly,  because we believe that there is really  no  basis

for  the  ILO to adjudicate in such a bilateral issue.  This  is

not within the charter of the ILO.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Boundaries and Survey Maps Act and the

Landmarks   Act  were  enacted  long  ago  in  1884   and   1882

respectively.   The Bill seeks to repeal both Acts  and  to  re-enact  them  as  a  single new Act.  This new Act  will  contain

provisions  of  the  two Acts that are still relevant  and  also

introduce new provisions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 928</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new Act will primarily (1) facilitate the adoption

of  modern  surveying technology; (2) legalise  survey  maps  in

electronic  form  to  reflect  the  computerisation  of   survey

records;  (3) define the powers and duties of the Chief Surveyor

who will administer the new Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill empowers the Chief Surveyor to

establish  and maintain a coordinated cadastre. Currently,  land

parcels  are  defined by boundaries represented by bearings  and

distances  with  reference  to  boundary  marks.   This  is  old

technology.   The Survey Department has shifted to  the  use  of

satellite technology or Global Positioning System.  This  modern

technology  allows boundaries to be demarcated and defined  more

accurately.   For  the shift, the Chief Surveyor  will  need  to

establish  and maintain a legalised set of boundary points  with

precise   coordinates   called   coordinated   cadastre.     The

coordinates  of  the cadastre will act as reference  points  for

defining land parcels.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Surveyor will convert existing areas already

surveyed to the coordinated cadastre within five years,  ie,  by

Year  2004.   Section 7 of the new Act provides for the  gazette

declaration of these areas as and when they are converted.   The

conversion  will only define existing land lots more accurately.

It will not affect their land areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Survey Department has completed the computerisation of

survey  data.   Maps are now being maintained electronically  in

graphic databases in computers.  It is timely to recognise  such

electronic maps.  This will pave the way for electronic commerce

of electronic survey records.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 3 to 6 make the Survey Department responsible for

administering the new Act and provide for the appointment of the

Chief  Surveyor by the Minister.  Under the new Act,  the  Chief

Surveyor will:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Conduct cadastral survey of any land parcel;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Establish, protect, maintain, repair, alter or remove

survey control marks on any land parcel;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Inspect and verify the accuracy of cadastral surveys

submitted by registered surveyors;  and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Assign lot numbers, maintain survey records and make

available such records and plans at prescribed fees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 45 sections in the Boundaries and Survey Maps Act

catering  for  the  survey of all lands  in  Singapore  and  the

publication of the maps.  By October 1978, every land parcel was

systematically  demarcated, surveyed and their  maps  published.

The  Chief  Surveyor  has identified 33 of the  45  sections  as

redundant.   These  33  redundant  sections  will  therefore  be

excluded from the new Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, all 16 sections of the Landmarks Act are

redundant  and  should  be repealed.    The  Landmarks  Act  was

enacted  in  1882 to provide for the establishment of  landmarks

used to define the boundaries of  land lots.  The new Boundaries

and  Survey  Maps Act has catered for land lots to be demarcated

by boundary marks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A consequential amendment arising from the substitution of

the  definition of "title survey" to "cadastral survey"  in  the

new Act will also be made to the Land Surveyors Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without amendment,

read a Third time and passed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 930</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Illegal Immigrant Problem</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall first touch on the illegal immigrant problem

and  the  proposed  enhancement of penalties  for  some  of  the

existing immigration offences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is a small country with limited resources. The

presence  of illegal immigrants will pose a serious  social  and

security  problem,  and compromise the safety  and  security  of

Singaporeans.    We have therefore taken, and will  continue  to

take, a tough stand against all immigration offenders - be  they

illegal  immigrants,  their  smugglers,  overstayers,   or   the

harbourers and employers of such people - especially  given  the

current regional economic situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since early this year, the Police Coast Guard (PCG) has

stepped  up  patrols in our waters to deter and  arrest  illegal

immigrants.     The   Police  and  Singapore   Immigration   and

Registration  (SIR)  have also raided  hideouts  and  haunts  in

Singapore  to  flush out immigration offenders.     Joint  raids

were also conducted with the Ministry of Manpower in the service

and  manufacturing sectors, for example, at food courts,  hawker

centres  and  factories.    These raids  have  resulted  in  the

arrests of 9,449 illegal immigrants and 5,425 overstayers in the

first  seven  months of 1998 alone, compared  to  7,599  illegal

immigrants and 6,314 overstayers for the whole of 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These enforcement measures must be backed up by tough laws

and  strict  penalties  for those who have  committed  offences.

My  Ministry  has  undertaken  a  comprehensive  review  of  the

penalties for the various types of immigration offences.   While

we  found  existing  penalties to  be  generally  adequate,  the

penalties for some offences need to be enhanced to enable us  to

effectively  deal  with  the illegal  immigrant  problem.    The

Immigration  Act  has  to be amended to  give  effect  to  these

enhanced penalties.

<br><br><i>Enhanced Penalties</i>

<br><br><i>(i)  Attempted illegal entry and departure</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, attempted illegal entry and departure attract

penalties which are less

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 931</b></font><br><br>

severe  than  those  for  actual illegal  entry  and  departure.

While  the  penalty for illegal entry is a maximum  six  months'

jail  and  mandatory  caning  of a minimum  three  strokes,  the

penalty  for the attempted illegal entry offence is imprisonment

of  between three months and two years and a fine of $4,000, but

no  caning.    For illegal departure, the penalty is  a  maximum

$2,000  fine  and  six  months'  jail,  while  the  penalty  for

attempted  illegal departure is a maximum $2,000 fine and  three

months' jail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry proposes to equate the penalties for attempted

illegal entry or departure to the penalties for illegal entry or

departure  respectively because there is no reason to  treat  an

unsuccessful  act of illegal entry or departure  more  leniently

than  a  successful one.    Clauses 3 and 4(a) of the Bill  will

amend  sections  5  and 6 to make attempted  illegal  entry  and

attempted  illegal departure punishable with the same  penalties

as illegal entry and illegal departure.

<br><br><i>(ii)  Abetment of illegal entry</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smugglers of illegal immigrants bring the illegal

immigration problem to Singapore and therefore have to be  dealt

with  severely.    Currently, those  convicted  of  engaging  in

the business  of conveying prohibited immigrants into Singapore can

be  jailed  between  two and five years and  caned  a  mandatory

minimum of three strokes.    Although this penalty is adequately

severe, in reality, many traffickers, boatmen and runners caught

smuggling  illegal  immigrants  escape  punishment  under   this

section.    Instead, they are charged with abetment  of  illegal

entry.   This is because it is, in practice, difficult to obtain

evidence  showing  that  the traffickers  have  engaged  in  the

business  of smuggling illegal immigrants.    As abettors,  they

are  liable  to be jailed between six months and two  years  and

fined up to $6,000, but do not receive corporal punishment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me relate an actual example to illustrate the point I

am  making.    On  7th May 1998 at 3.30 am, Police  Coast  Guard

intercepted a fast-moving sampan, fitted with a 200 hp  outboard

engine, at sea off

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 932</b></font><br><br>

Changi  while it was proceeding from Batam towards Pulau Tekong.

There  were  two  boat  operators and three  passengers  in  the

sampan.   None of them possessed valid travel documents and they

were  all  arrested.    The two boat operators were  charged  as

abettors,  and  sentenced  to seven months'  imprisonment  each.

The  three  passengers  were charged  for  attempting  to  enter

Singapore illegally, and sentenced to three months' imprisonment

each.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two boat operators could not be charged as traffickers

because we did not have adequate proof that they were engaged in

the  business  of  conveying illegal  immigrants  to  Singapore.

Under  our proposal to equate the penalty for attempted  illegal

entry  to  the  penalty for illegal entry, caning for  attempted

illegal entry will become mandatory for the passengers.   But it

is  absurd  that  the  passengers are caned under  the  proposed

amendments while those who facilitated their illegal entry,  ie,

the boat operators, are not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is more effective to tackle the problem at source, and

deter   the   conveyance  of  illegal  immigrants  to  Singapore

altogether.  Besides, these so-called "abettors" are  as  guilty

in   bringing  in  illegal  immigrants  as  those  convicted  as

smugglers.   Therefore, deterrent penalties have to be  imposed.

To  ensure  that  these  smugglers do not  escape  the  corporal

punishment  meted  out  to  those convicted  of  trafficking  in

illegal immigrants, we propose that the penalty for abetment  of

illegal  entry be amended to include mandatory caning.   Clauses

11(b)  and  (d) of the Bill amend section 57(1) of  the  Act  to

provide  that abettors of illegal entry under section 6 will  be

punished with a mandatory minimum of three strokes of the  cane,

in  addition to the existing penalty of between six  months  and

two years' jail.

<br><br><i>(iii)  Employment of immigration offenders</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers of immigration offenders should also be severely

dealt  with.   This is because if employers do  not  offer  them

jobs,  illegal  immigrants will not  be  attracted  to  come  to

Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 933</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, employers of more than five immigration

offenders can be sentenced to between six months and two  years'

jail, fined not exceeding $6,000 and caned.  Clause 11(c) of the

Bill  amends  section 57(1B) of the Act to increase the  maximum

fine  for employers of more than five immigration offenders  who

cannot  be caned because they are females or more than 50  years

old from $6,000 to $10,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporate bodies which employ immigration offenders are

fined  between  $50,000 and $100,000 in lieu of  mandatory  jail

sentences  or caning on conviction.  In addition, an officer  of

the company who approves the employment is personally liable  to

be   prosecuted   for  the  offence  of  employing   immigration

offenders.   He is liable, on conviction, to the same  penalties

for   employing  immigration  offenders.   Clause  11(f)  amends

section  57(2A)  to  increase  the  default  fines  in  lieu  of

mandatory  jail  or  caning for corporate  bodies  convicted  of

employing immigration offenders to between $100,000 and $200,000

to maintain the deterrent effect.

<br><br><i>Rebuttable Presumption for Attempted Illegal Entry</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the proposed introduction of a

presumption clause for attempted illegal entry under  section  6

of  the Immigration Act.  Illegal immigrants arriving by sea and

who  are  caught in our territorial waters before they disembark

from   their  vessels  are  not  considered  to  have  "entered"

Singapore  within the meaning of the current provisions  in  the

Act.  Although they can be charged with attempted illegal entry,

there  is a problem of proof of intent as the illegal immigrant,

when  caught, usually claims that he has no intention  to  enter

Singapore.  Added to this is the problem created by the right of

transit under international law.  These illegal immigrants often

claim  that  they are exercising their right of transit  through

Singapore  waters  as a legal defence.  Short of  a  confession,

there is often no way to rebut their claim.  By relying on  such

a defence, the illegal immigrants can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 934</b></font><br><br>

create  a  reasonable doubt as to whether they had  intended  to

enter  Singapore  illegally.  Such evidential difficulties  have

made  it  difficult for the Police to prove such cases beyond  a

reasonable   doubt  as  required  by  law  and  to  successfully

prosecute some of these illegal immigrants in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deal more effectively with similar cases, my Ministry

proposes  to introduce a presumption clause in the Act  so  that

any  foreigner fitting the profile of an illegal immigrant found

in  our  port waters will be presumed to be attempting to  enter

Singapore illegally if -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) he does not carry any valid travel document; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) he has no visible means of subsistence, eg. inadequate

funds or resources for a person's basic upkeep for a week's stay

in Singapore; or

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) he has taken precautions to conceal his identity or

presence  from our Police or Immigration officers, eg. by  lying

low in the boats or by travelling at night without a light.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4(b) of the Bill amends section 6 of the Act to

insert  subsections (4) and (5) to provide for this  presumption

clause.   The presumption will assist the prosecution by putting

the  onus  on the accused to satisfy the Court that it  is  more

probable than not that he was not attempting to enter Singapore,

which is a heavier burden than merely raising a reasonable doubt

that he was attempting to enter Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate how the presumption clause will be used

with  an  example.  On 24th February this year at  2.30  in  the

morning,  the  Police  Coast Guard (PCG)  detected  a  motorised

sampan  heading  from Batam towards Singapore.  PCG  intercepted

the  sampan at the sea off Changi after a short chase.  It found

10  passengers  and  two boat operators  in  the  sampan.   They

carried  with them small amounts of cash in rupiah and  ringgit,

and did not possess any valid travel documents.  They also tried

to lie low to escape detection by PCG.  The boat operators and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 935</b></font><br><br>

the  passengers were successfully prosecuted in this case.   But

the onus was on the prosecution to adduce the necessary evidence

to  prove  a  prima facie case to the court that  these  accused

persons  had attempted to enter Singapore illegally.   This  was

despite it being patently clear what the intentions of the  boat

operators  and their passengers were.  On the other  hand,  once

the  presumption clause is inserted in the law,  the  burden  of

proof would then fall on the accused persons to produce evidence

to satisfy the Court that it is more probable than not that they

were not attempting to enter Singapore illegally.

<br><br><i>Proposed Identification Card for Foreign Workers</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the amendments which are necessary for

the  implementation  of  the proposed  identification  card  for

foreign  workers.  Currently, a work permit holder is  issued  a

Work  Permit,  with  the  immigration Disembarkation/Embarkation

pass  incorporated  on the reverse side  to  show  that  he  had

entered Singapore through legal channels.  In addition, a  Visit

Pass  showing  the  permitted duration of stay  granted  by  the

Controller  of  Immigration is endorsed  in  the  passport.   To

prevent  the  worker from absconding, it is common practice  for

the  employers  to  hold on to the worker's  passport  and  work

permit  card,  leaving the worker with only a photocopy  of  his

work permit card.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this practice makes it difficult for enforcement

agencies to identify whether a foreigner is a legitimate  worker

or  an  illegal  immigrant.  Photocopies  are  usually  of  poor

quality, and they can be easily forged.  The current work permit

card  also does not capture the fingerprints of the holder, thus

making  it  difficult for enforcement agencies  to  conclusively

identify  that  the  person carrying the  work  permit  card  is

actually  the  person identified in the card.  In  addition,  it

does not have adequate security features to prevent forgery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address these shortcomings, my Ministry and the Manpower

Ministry will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 936</b></font><br><br>

be  jointly  implementing a new identification card for  foreign

workers,  which will combine the current work permit  card,  the

Disembarkation/Embarkation card and the  visit  pass.   It  will

contain enhanced security features, including the fingerprint of

the  foreign worker, and an expiry date that will coincide  with

the  expiry  of the work permit and visit pass.  Not  only  will

this  new  identification card reduce the likelihood of forgery,

fingerprint records will also allow our enforcement agencies  to

more   conclusively  identify  the  card-holder.   The  proposed

identification  card will be implemented in  phases,  commencing

from the end of this year.  More details will be released in due

course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 of the Bill amends section 55(1) of the

Immigration  Act  to  provide  for  the  Minister  to  make  new

regulations  pertaining to the recording, storage and  retrieval

of  the  fingerprints, including thumbprints, for  the  proposed

identification card for the foreign workers.  These  regulations

would  also  empower  law enforcement agencies  when  conducting

raids  to  demand  finger and thumb prints from persons  holding

these  new identity cards for verification purposes.  Since  the

visit  pass for work permit holders would no longer be  endorsed

in  the passport, clause 11(e) will amend section 57 of the  Act

to  require an employer or harbourer of an immigration  offender

to  prove  that he had exercised due diligence by  checking  the

original   pass  (which  will  now  be  incorporated  into   the

identification  card for work permit holders)  and  ascertaining

that  the holder of the passport is the person named in the pass

or  permit,  before he could rely on the holder's possession  of

the  visit  pass  as a legal defence that he did  not  knowingly

employ or harbour an immigration offender.

<br><br><i>Other Amendments</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Amendment Bill also proposes other amendments to

facilitate  the  enforcement actions of Immigration  and  Police

officers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Immigration Act currently only empowers the

Controller of Immigration to require those seeking to enter

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 937</b></font><br><br>

Singapore and those applying for passes and permits to submit to

medical  examinations as a condition for  issuing  the  pass  or

permit.  However, the Controller of Immigration is not empowered

to  require  those  who  are already holding  valid  passes  and

permits to undergo medical examination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Ministry of Health's statistics, since

1993, more than 2,000 foreigners living and working in Singapore

have  been  found  to  be HIV-positive.   Their  illnesses  were

detected  when  they fell ill or when they applied  to  purchase

insurance  policies or when they applied to renew  their  passes

and permits.  Currently, only new PR and work permit applicants,

and work permit holders applying to renew their work permits are

required   to   undergo  the  medical  screening  before   their

applications  are  approved.  From early next  year,  employment

pass  and  other  long-term immigration  pass  holders  will  be

required to undergo medical examination before these passes  are

issued to them.  The extension of the medical screening to these

groups of foreigners will help to keep out foreigners who are  a

potential  threat to our public health.  More  details  will  be

announced later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 of the Bill will amend section 29 of the Act to

empower  the  Controller of Immigration to  require  holders  of

entry  permits and passes to undergo medical examination at  any

time,  and  for  the  medical records to  be  disclosed  to  the

Controller  of Immigration.  Those holders of entry permits  and

passes  who  refuse to undergo such medical examination  can  be

fined  a maximum of $2,000 and imprisoned up to six months,  and

have their passes revoked.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment is necessary so that the Controller can have

access  to  medical  information, which will facilitate  him  in

identifying and repatriating foreigners with infectious diseases

who   are   in  Singapore.   The  proposed  access  to   medical

information   for  the  Controller  will  not  be  confined   to

infectious diseases alone.  It will also apply to other medical

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 938</b></font><br><br>

conditions, such as mental illnesses, insofar as a foreigner may

be a danger to society as a result of his medical condition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, section 49(1) of the Immigration Act currently

only  empowers the Controller of Immigration or any  immigration

officer authorised by him to seize vessels or vehicles below  76

tonnes  used  in  the  commission of  any  immigration  offence.

Clause  9 will repeal and re-enact section 49(1) of the  Act  to

empower  any  Police officer authorised by a Deputy Commissioner

of  Police  to  perform the same function.   This  is  aimed  at

enhancing  Police's operational efficiency as the  Police  Coast

Guard has been tasked to police our territorial waters and  deal

with  illegal  immigrants  attempting  to  enter  by  sea.    In

practice, the decision to seize such a vessel is now handled  by

the  Police  and  it  is  necessary for Police  officers  to  be

similarly  empowered to authorise such seizures,  thus  avoiding

any unnecessary delay in handling such cases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 also amends section 49(1) to make it clear that

the  Court's  power  to forfeit a vessel or  vehicle  under  the

section  may be invoked notwithstanding that no person has  been

charged.   This  latter  amendment is necessary  as  Police  had

encountered cases where vessels or vehicles were seized but  the

passengers and operators evaded arrest and could not be charged.

On  3rd  March this year, at 2.30 am, for example,  a  speedboat

carrying  suspected  illegal immigrants was  pursued  by  a  PCG

patrol  craft  in  the Johor Bahru Straits and the  two  vessels

subsequently collided.  The five persons on board the  speedboat

were  seen  jumping  into the sea and swimming  towards  Tanjong

Murai  shore, which is next to Lim Chu Kang Road and  the  Murai

Reservoir,  before  they escaped into the darkness.     Although

the  speedboat was seized and towed back by PCG, it  had  to  be

treated as unclaimed property and could not be forfeited because

no one was charged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, clause 5 will amend section 8(1) of the Act to

clarify the law relating to a prohibited immigrant by making  it

clear  that a foreigner who is a member of any of the prohibited

classes specified in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 939</b></font><br><br>

subsection  (3) is a prohibited immigrant within the meaning  of

the  section.     Such prohibited classes include  persons  with

mental  illness  or  infectious  diseases,  and  those  who  are

prostitutes,   vagrants  and  beggars.      In   addition,   the

Controller  can deem any other foreigner who in the  opinion  of

the Controller is a member of any of the prohibited classes,  to

be a prohibited immigrant.    Clause 8(b) seeks to amend section

8(3)   to  explicitly  list  anyone  with  the  Acquired  Immune

Deficiency  Syndrome or infected with the Human Immunodeficiency

Virus to be a prohibited immigrant and liable to be denied entry

or  repatriated.  Clause 8 will amend section 38 to create a new

subsection (2) to empower an immigration officer to exercise the

powers  of  a  Police officer under the Criminal Procedure  Code

(Cap. 68) in relation to investigating seizable offences.   This

is  necessary to ensure that the immigration officers are  given

sufficient investigation powers to carry out their duties  under

the Act.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, ensuring that we properly manage the inflow, presence

and  outflow of a large pool of foreign visitors and workers  in

Singapore,  be they legal or illegal, is one of the Ministry  of

Home  Affairs' greatest challenges.   In managing  this  foreign

population,  we  need  to  strike a  fine  balance  between  our

economic  objectives and ensuring that we do not compromise  the

sense  of  safety  and  security of  Singaporeans.    Since  the

Immigration  Act  was  last  amended  in  1995,  our   operating

environment  has changed significantly.   The proposals  that  I

have  presented  today  are necessary to  ensure  that  the  Act

remains relevant to our needs, and will help to make Singapore a

safer and more secure home for all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

in  order to maintain peace and order in Singapore.  However,  I

wish  to  take  this  opportunity  to  urge  the  Government  to

seriously  consider  relaxing  the  restrictions  on  bona  fide

tourists   who   come  to  Singapore  through  legal   channels,

particularly the tourists from China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the start of the Asian currency crisis, tourist

arrivals  from our traditional sources such as Japan,  Thailand,

Malaysia and Indonesia have dropped substantially owing  to  the

internal economic difficulties of these countries.  The  tourism

industry  has  suffered gravely.  Statistics  announced  by  the

Singapore Tourism Board (STB) recently revealed that during  the

first  seven months of this year, tourist arrivals have  dropped

to  just 3,610,495, a drop of 17.6% as compared to the 4,381,664

for the same period last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, the China market seems to be showing

excellent potential. According to the STB, China is among one of

Singapore's top 12 sources of inbound tourists.  From  the  11th

ranking  in 1996, it has gone up to the 10th ranking last  year,

and  in the first seven months of this year, it has risen to the

9th  ranking, with a total of 163,745 visitors, an  increase  of

13%  from  the same period last year.  With the national  income

growing all the time, more and more people from China will  have

the  means  to go on oversea tours.  Because of the geographical

and  human  affinities between the two countries, Singapore  has

become  one  of their most popular tour destinations.   On  this

account, I believe that given more encouragement, the number  of

tourists  coming from China to Singapore will increase by  leaps

and  bounds.  This will help to stimulate the dispirited tourism

industry  in Singapore, and can accelerate the recovery  of  the

service and retail industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, unfortunately, since the implementation of

the new tourist visa regulations for Chinese visitors in 1996 by

the Singapore Immigration Department, tourists from China are no

longer entitled to the 48-hour visa-free stay in Singapore.   To

make  things worse, the authority requires the travel agents  in

Singapore to furnish a $1,000 security deposit for each

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 941</b></font><br><br>

Chinese  tourist coming to Singapore when they apply for  a  96-hour  visa to stay in Singapore.  This has resulted in the  loss

of  many  potential visitors from China, and moreover gives  the

mistaken  signal that they are not welcomed in Singapore.   This

misunderstanding is certainly detrimental to the development  of

long-term bilateral relations between Singapore and China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the $1,000 security deposit is meant to prevent

Chinese visitors from overstaying or absconding, then it is  not

practical at all.  For this very small number of black sheep who

are  prepared  to  flout the law, this $1,000 means  nothing  to

them. It does not serve any deterrent effect at all.  Why are we

knocking out everybody with one sweeping blow just because there

are a couple of black sheep in the flock?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, the Immigration Department takes about 14

days  to  process a visa application for a visitor  from  China.

After  obtaining the original copy of the visa, the travel agent

will first of all fax a copy of this visa to its counterpart  in

China,  and then send the original copy over to China by courier

service.  The whole process, from the time of submission of  the

application  to  the time the original visa is received  by  the

travel  agent  in  China, takes about one whole  month.   If  we

compare  this  standard  of  service  to  the  high  speed   and

efficiency of the checkpoint at Changi Airport, there is  indeed

a whole world of difference!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, faced with stiff competition, the travel

agents  normally  will  have to dig into their  own  pockets  to

furnish  upfront  the $1,000 security deposit for  each  of  the

tourists  from  China when they apply for their visas.   Let  us

make  a  simple  calculation.  Singapore receives about  250,000

visitors  from  China  each year, or an average  of  20,000  per

month.   So  at $1,000 per visitor, the travel industry  has  to

activate  $20  million of their capital each month  as  security

deposit  for  their Chinese visitors.  Although the  Immigration

Department has made some administrative adjustment to reduce the

amount of the security deposit by half,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 942</b></font><br><br>

with effect from the 1st of this month, the revised amount still

stands  at  $10  million.   Now, with an  increasing  number  of

Chinese  tourists visiting Singapore, the huge  amount  of  bank

guarantees  "stuck"  with the security deposits  will  certainly

affect  the  cash-flow  and business operations  of  the  travel

industry.   In  this present time of economic  difficulty,  this

measure  adopted by the Immigration Department is really rubbing

salt into the wounds of the travel industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, only government officials from China are

exempted  from  visa requirement for up to  48  hours'  stay  in

Singapore.  But the period of 48 hours is apparently too  short.

When  the Chinese government officials come to Singapore,  apart

from official duties, they also hope to take the opportunity  to

spend  some  time  touring Singapore.  Some of these  government

officials  approached  the  local travel  agents  to  assist  in

applying  for extension of their stay in Singapore.   But  there

was nothing the travel agents could do to assist them.  From the

business point of view, this is a great pity because business is

brought right up to their door-step. Yet, they could not benefit

from it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since Singapore wants to develop itself

into an international metropolis, it should have the magnanimity

and  openness of an international metropolis.  As such,  I  hope

that  the Ministry of Home Affairs would reconsider this  matter

and grant visitors from China the facilities of obtaining a visa

on  arrival,  or even to exempt them from the visa  requirement.

In  the  meantime, may I suggest that the Immigration Department

remove  the  requirement for travel agents to furnish  a  $1,000

security deposit for each visitor from China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, some people may say that since Singapore

citizens  are  required  to apply for a Chinese  visa  to  enter

China,  then the Singapore Government has to adopt a  reciprocal

arrangement  for all PRC nationals to have a Singapore  visa  to

enter  Singapore.  In my view, as an open metropolis,  Singapore

does  not  need  to  conduct itself in this  manner.   Moreover,

unilateral   waiver  of  visa  is  not  without  precedence   in

Singapore.  As we all know,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 943</b></font><br><br>

Singapore  citizens need to have an American visa to  enter  the

United States, but US citizens do not require a visa to come  to

Singapore.   Since  the  Immigration  Department  can  allow  US

citizens  to enter Singapore without a visa, I feel they  should

also  accord a similar privilege to PRC nationals.    Otherwise,

this  may  create a misunderstanding that Singapore is  adopting

double  standards in dealing with the entries of Chinese and  US

citizens to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shriniwas Rai:</b> I am obliged to you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

for giving me this opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having heard my friend, Mr Tay, I would just add,

before I come to the Bill proper, another concern.  I have known

of  a  case, a year ago, where the father, a PR, was working  in

Singapore  and his son wanted to visit him, and he was  required

to  pay  a surety bond of $5,000.  He could not get the visa  in

India.   So the father had to make the application.  Of  course,

when I took up this matter with the Immigration Department, they

tried  to console him and me by saying that this was because  we

have  such a large flow of people coming here.  I can understand

the problem, Sir, but we must be selective.  We must look at the

genuine  cases,  like  those people  who  have  family  ties  in

Singapore.   A  visit  of two weeks will  do  whoever  is  being

visited some good rather than harm.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, having listened to the Minister, I must

say  that  he  has given all the details and he has  given  this

House  the  reason  why  this Bill is  necessary.   One  of  the

earliest laws that Singapore had was the Immigration law in  one

form  or another.  Sir, I will not deal with the Bill clause  by

clause,  as  the Minister has amply dealt with them.   I  am  in

support  of most of the provisions, especially those which  deal

with  higher  punishments.  I think it is high time we  enhanced

the penalties because, despite an amendment to the law some time

ago,  there is, as the Minister has pointed out, an increase  in

both  illegal  immigrants and overstayers.  Members  may  wonder

whether the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 944</b></font><br><br>

increase  in  punishment  will deter.   Certainly,  the  illegal

immigrants will have to think twice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing which I had spoken earlier in this House is

this.   Our  missions  abroad have also to  carry  the  task  of

informing  the public there that anybody who flouts the  law  in

Singapore will be severely dealt with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one area which has been of some concern to lawyers

would be the question of presumption.  It is not something  new.

It  has  been in our law and I think we should have  it  because

unless we have this presumption, we are going to have difficulty

in enforcement.  In any case, I would like to assure the Members

of  this House and the public at large that the presumption  can

always  be  rebutted.  It is for the person who  is  charged  to

disprove.  It does not make him guilty straightaway.  So I would

say  that it is timely and we should have it, especially in this

law,   as   the  Minister  has  graphically  pointed   out   the

difficulties  our Coast Guard and Immigration officers  have  to

face.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, other than our Malay community, we are basically

immigrant people.  We will have immigrants and we encourage them

to  come here.  We are encouraging talents to come here, as  the

Prime Minister has pointed out in his National Day Rally Speech.

But  at the same time, we must keep a check and balance whom  we

want  to  welcome  in Singapore.  Although it would  be  out  of

point,  I would like to request the Minister to consider getting

fast  speed boats and things like that so that our coastal areas

can be amply guarded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another area which I am also concerned, and I think

the  Minister  has  pointed out, is people who  pose  danger  to

public health.  My concern is on a very small but very important

area.   We do not want the flesh trade in Singapore to increase.

This  happens  in most countries where, because of the  economic

downturn, some desperate people are driven to this.  It is  very

important  that we must keep a tight check, not just  on  public

morality but also on the question of public health.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 945</b></font><br><br>

And  I  am  glad  that  we have now imposed  a  condition  which

requires a compulsory check by a qualified medical practitioner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one problem that we would have to consider is this. I

know  it  is  a serious problem  how to discourage  people  from

travelling with false documents?  In my course of work,  I  have

had  to  deal  with this problem twice.  I think the  Government

must take precaution because some Singaporean racket is involved

and  unless  we  know  the source, unless we  get  these  people

busted, the poor victims will always be exploited.  I know it is

very difficult to ask every visitor to be thumb-printed, but  it

is  important, for our own national security, that  whenever  an

immigration officer feels that there is reason to believe that a

person is not of bona fide standing, then we should impose  this

condition.   Because there is nothing to stop these people  from

travelling with a new passport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these observations, I would like to support the

Bill  and  I  would urge the Minister to consider reviewing  the

whole  of  the immigration law so that the national security  of

Singapore is not put to risk.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the

Bill,  especially on the provision to impose penalties for those

involved  in illegal immigration and entry into Singapore.   The

deteriorating  economic and political situation  in  the  region

could  turn Singapore into one huge haven for refugees if we  do

not  have  stringent  and  punitive measures  to  deter  illegal

immigration.  This little country can ill afford to  accommodate

or  hope what could potentially be a bigger problem than we have

ever thought.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, however, concerned about something quite different

about  amendments  to section 8(b) and would like  to  seek  the

Minister's clarification on the matter for two reasons:  (1)  on

the effects of tourism and visitors; and (2) on justice should a

visitor  find  himself in breach of a law after he  has  entered

Singapore.  Section 8(b) terms a person suffering from AIDS as a

protected immigrant.  I would like to draw

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 946</b></font><br><br>

a   difference   between   a  person  visiting   Singapore   and

subsequently an AIDS patient finds himself to have breached  the

law as against a person or AIDS patient who enters Singapore and

engages   in   activities  that  certainly   bring   danger   to

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that while we should have thorough and stringent

medical  examination as a pre-requisite to allowing  someone  to

work  in  Singapore  or  stay  here  for  a  long  period,  such

precautions are necessary to ensure that AIDS patients will  not

cause  health and other problems.  However, I seek clarification

on  the  following.   First, does the clause impose  unnecessary

barriers and prohibition of travel of AIDS patients amongst  our

visitors  and  tourists?  Secondly, are  we  not  discriminating

against AIDS patients by making travel and access in and out  of

Singapore difficult for them?  I am not making a moral  judgment

here  but I think we can guarantee travellers/visitors free  and

unobstructive access to travel in Singapore so long as  they  do

not cause danger to Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Sir, I thank the Members for speaking up

on this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me answer Mr Zulkifli's point about HIV

carriers.   This  amendment  is not intended  to  stop  any  HIV

carrier  from  coming here as a tourist.  If he  is  here  as  a

tourist, a short-term visitor, he is not subjected to this Bill.

This  amendment on medical examination of people who may be  HIV

carriers  only  applies to those who work in  Singapore  or  who

apply  to  work in Singapore, and those people who  are  staying

here for some time.  So if they are here as short-term visitors,

they  are  not  affected.  If they are here on long-term  social

visit  pass, then they would be affected.  For example, if  they

are here on a student pass, even though they may not be workers,

they would be subjected to this amendment if they are here for a

long  period.  Similarly, for those who are here on professional

visit  pass,  they  would also be subjected to  this  particular

requirement.  So let me assure the Member that this Bill is  not

to deter any tourist who may be an HIV carrier.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 947</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now talk about another point which Mr Rai

raised before I talk about the general point about visitors.  On

speedboats, yes, indeed, we have to have a lot of speedboats and

this  is  what  the Police Coast Guard is doing:  upgrading  its

capability and resources and renewing its speedboats  when  they

become  due  for  renewal.  And as a result,  we  are  going  to

acquire a few more very fast boats.  Recently, I sat in one  and

found it very good indeed.  I think it would be adequate for the

purpose  of patrolling our shores to ensure that those who  come

on  very high speed speedboats will easily be caught by  us  and

there would be no way of getting away from it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the more general point about tourists, this amendment is

not  intended  to  discourage  tourists.   We  want  to  welcome

tourists  but at the same time we do not want these tourists  to

become overstayers.  And how do we do that?  It is to make  sure

that  those whom we think or believe are likely to be  potential

overstayers,  we  must  make it difficult  for  them  to  become

overstayers.  Therefore, for some time now, we have  implemented

visa requirements for those who come from India and subsequently

for  those  who come from China and now for those who come  from

Bangladesh.  We require them to furnish a bond and apply  for  a

visa before they can come here as a visitor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they come here to work, then of course their agents will

bring them in and apply for work permits and if their permit  is

approved,  they will come here to work.  But if they  just  come

here and claim to be a tourist and eventually overstay, then  we

must find ways to sieve them out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not our intention to impose stringent conditions on

tour companies bringing in tourists.  It is not our intention to

dry  up  their  business by requiring them to  put  up  security

bonds.   But while we welcome tourists, while we want to promote

such  tour  companies, we must also bear in mind that we  should

not  allow  some  of these people who come here to  overstay  in

Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 948</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just give Members some data to illustrate what I

mean  when  we  have to impose visa or security bonds.   Let  me

start with 1994.  Otherwise, it will go into history and it will

take  a  long  time.  In 1994, among the total number  of  9,846

immigration  offenders, 2,686 or about 25% of them were  illegal

immigrants.  7,001 or the majority of them were overstayers.  In

1994, we imposed visa on Indian tourists and subsequently we saw

a  slight  decline in the number.  No visa was imposed on  those

who came from China.  But in 1996, we decided to impose visa  on

those  who  came from China.  As a result, we saw the number  of

overstayers  from  China went down and  the  number  of  illegal

immigrants from China went up.  Before I go into the details  of

such  overstayers and immigration offenders, I  will  just  give

Members the other figures which I was referring to earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1995, we had 11,732 immigration offenders. 6,587 or

just  slightly about half or 55% of them were overstayers.   But

the number of illegal immigrants had gone up to 5,001.  In 1996,

we  had 14,260 immigration offenders.  The number of overstayers

was  8,553 and the number of illegal immigrants was 5,700.  Then

we  decided  to  impose visa, as I said, on PRC  visitors.   The

number  of illegal immigrants subsequently went up to  7,599  in

1997, out of a total of 13,913 immigration offenders.  That  was

all  normal  activity.  In other words, police carried  out  the

normal  enforcement,  etc.  But since March  this  year,  police

stepped  up their enforcement together with the Immigration  and

they   patrolled  our  coast  more  strictly  and  they   raided

worksites,  residences, haunts, etc.  The number of  immigration

offenders  arrested in the first seven months alone was  already

more  than  that for the whole of last year, 14,874.  And  among

them, a great majority, 9,449 were illegal immigrants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who made up most of these people? I will come to the

details  which I am talking about.  On Indians, after we imposed

the  visa in 1994, it took a while to take effect and the number

of  overstayers  increased somewhat, but not  that  large,  from

1,342 in 1996 to about 1,452 in 1997.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 949</b></font><br><br>

But  the number of illegal immigrants coming from India has shot

up  from 387 in 1996 to 909 in 1997.  In the first seven  months

of  1998, the number of illegal immigrants arrested shot  up  to

1,700.   So  when they cannot come through the normal way,  they

will  come  in  by the illegal way, ie, by smuggling  themselves

into Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is more startling is the number of illegal

immigrants  from PRC ever since we imposed the visa requirement.

In  1996,  the  number of overstayers, ie,  those  who  came  to

Singapore  legally and overstayed was 2007, but  the  number  of

illegal  immigrants  was only 516.  After we  imposed  the  visa

requirement, the number of PRC overstayers arrested  dropped  to

694, but the number of illegal immigrants of PRC origin arrested

went  up  to  1,854.   In other words, the  figure  has  changed

significantly.   If  they come in legally, they  will  overstay.

When we imposed a visa requirement, they will smuggle themselves

in.   So  if  we do not have a visa requirement, there  will  be

overstayers.  Now we have, of course, to take enforcement action

to  look  for them and eventually repatriate them when they  are

arrested.   So I am not in favour of making it more liberal  for

tour  companies to bring in foreigners, whether from PRC,  India

or  any  other country, who are likely to overstay in Singapore.

We must continue with these visa rules to make sure that they do

not  overstay.   Then we can take other actions  to  reduce  the

number of illegal immigrants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To complete the picture, just in the first seven months of

this  year,  the number of PRC illegal immigrants  arrested  was

1,909  which  is already more than that for the  whole  of  last

year,  although the number of overstayers has gone down to  768.

The  more liberal we are in our visa rule, the more people  will

come  in here and overstay.  It makes our problem very difficult

because  for Chinese, Indians or Bangladeshis, it is  very  easy

for  them  to  blend in with the environment and for enforcement

action, it is very difficult to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 950</b></font><br><br>

look  for  them  until  we ask them to  produce  their  pass  or

identity card.  So we must continue with this very strict policy

of  making  sure  that  only those who  come  here  are  genuine

tourists, and they must have the money.  If not, they should not

come  here as tourists. For those who want to come to work, they

must apply for a permit.  We should not impose visa on the basis

of  whether  the  country is friendly or not  friendly,  and  we

cannot compare whether an American citizen is more favoured than

a  PRC  citizen.  We treat all nationalities equally, but  if  a

particular nationality has a tendency to overstay, then we  must

look  at  the  visa rule and apply the rule.  If Americans  come

here and overstay, then we will apply the visa rule on them.   I

see  very  little evidence of that now.  So we do  not  need  to

reciprocate the American visa rule on Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immigration Department recently made some adjustments to

the   bond  requirement  of  tour  companies.   For  those  tour

companies  which bring in tourists from PRC and  they  can  look

after them and make sure that they go home, we can be a bit more

flexible, and that is where adjustments have been made to reduce

the  bond  required for such tourists.  But if they cannot  look

after  their  tourists who run away, then of course  their  bond

value will go up.  That is what we have done.  I hope that these

companies which bring in such tourists will continue to do their

work and make sure that their tourists go home so that they  can

reduce their financial burden.  Actually, it is just a bond from

a bank.  We do not require the money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amendment is proposed because persons who are

required  to  undergo medical examination by the  Controller  of

Immigration for an infectious disease has to be referred to  the

Communicable Disease Centre at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, which

is  now a restructured hospital.  Therefore, there is a need  to

broaden  the  definition  of  "Government  medical  officer"  to

include private medical practitioners in restructured hospitals.

The   new  definition  will  provide  the  Controller  with  the

flexibility to designate other private medical practitioners  in

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SCHEMES</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry whether the Government is prepared to help the many

businessmen who face severe credit squeeze or cash-flow problems

in their ventures into the regional markets and probably require

some extraordinary assistance to tide over this difficult period

before they can bounce back; and, if so, what are the

enhancements that can be immediately introduced to existing

Government financial assistance schemes to help these specific

areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local companies which require fixed asset financing for

regional  projects  can apply to the Economic Development  Board

for  its  Regionalisation  Finance Scheme  (RFS).   This  scheme

provides  SMEs  with  financing  for  equipment  and  industrial

properties  in  their overseas operations.  Since  the  regional

financial crisis started, the EDB has received and approved more

RFS  loan applications.  In the first 7 months of 1998, 9  loans

amounting to $12 million have been approved, compared to a total

of 10 loans for $8 million in 1997.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trade Development Board has expanded its Trade

Development  Incentives  to  assist  companies  in  setting   up

overseas   marketing  offices  and  other  business  development

programmes  such  as  branding, franchising  and  licensing.  To

assist  companies  in  exploring  new  markets,  TDB  has   also

increased  its funding for companies participating in its  trade

missions and in approved trade fairs.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry welcomes suggestions on how we can further

assist our investors here and abroad.  Any measure taken must be

based  on  sound market principles and recognise  the  financial

risks  and  rewards of any investment decision.  We  cannot  use

public funds to bail out any project which has become non-viable

as a result of the regional economic crisis.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT CHARGES AND LEVIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Trade

and Industry whether the Government, in recognising the pressing

need  to  watch  and lower the business costs in  order  to  woo

investors, save jobs and help firms stay competitive,  will  (i)

take  immediate steps to reduce government charges  and  levies,

including the foreign worker levy, port charges, Electronic Road

Pricing   charges,   petrol  taxes,  Housing   and   Development

Board/Urban  Redevelopment Authority  car  parking  charges  and

Goods   and   Services   Tax;  and  (ii)  seriously   reconsider

establishing  an  Inter-Agency  Government  Charges  and  Levies

Review Committee to strengthen the existing Government mechanism

of  monitoring and co-ordinating all the major fee hikes of  all

Government    agencies    to    maintain    our    international

competitiveness.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our cost competitiveness relative to the regional countries

has  been  affected by the sharp depreciation  in  the  regional

currencies.  The Government has therefore taken steps to  reduce

business  costs  through various cost-cutting  measures  in  the

FY1998  Budget and the June off-Budget package.  These  measures

include   property  tax  rebates,  rental  rebates  and   tariff

reductions.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excluding material costs, the major component of business

cost is wages.  In May this year, the NWC recommended that firms

exercise  wage  restraint and put the flexible  wage  system  to

effective use given the economic slowdown.  Taking the lead, the

civil service cut

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 955</b></font><br><br>



its mid-year variable bonus payment from three-quarter month  to

half a month and indicated that there could be further reduction

in  the  year-end payment.  Companies and unions have  exercised

wage  restraint this year.  Many have settled for a wage freeze;

some  a  wage  cut.   If  the  economic  situation  deteriorates

further,  a cut in the employers' CPF contribution rate  may  be

necessary to reduce wage levels across the board.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is monitoring the overall business cost

situation  closely.  We will do whatever is  necessary  to  keep

Singapore  competitive.  This includes reviewing all  Government

fees  and  charges as well as a possible CPF cut.  The Committee

on   Singapore's  Competitiveness  has  obtained  feedback  from

businesses and will deliberate further on this matter.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Tay's second question, it is not necessary to set up

another  committee to monitor and coordinate  major  fee  hikes.

There  is  already  a  mechanism  in  place  to  coordinate  fee

increases.  The Ministry of Finance monitors and coordinates the

magnitude and timing of any fee increases.  My Ministry monitors

the  impact  of such increases on both the Consumer Price  Index

and  Unit  Business  Cost to ensure that we remain  competitive.

Major fee hikes require the Cabinet's approval.

<div align="center"><b>DOMESTIC NON-PERFORMING LOANS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Tsao Yuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Dr Lee Tsao Yuan</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether  there  has been an increase in domestic  non-performing

loans  as a result of the economic downturn, with regard to  (i)

absolute  magnitude;  (ii) magnitude as a  percentage  of  total

domestic loans; and (iii) the number of such loans.



<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 30th June 1998, the total domestic non-performing

loans  (NPLs)  of  the 6 local banking groups amounted  to  $5.4

billion  or  3.9% of their total domestic loans.  This  compares

with  $3.1  billion or 2.3% of total domestic loans in  December

1997.  The  number  of such loans was 7,913, compared  to  6,213

loans six months earlier.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;87% of the domestic non-performing loans are in the

'substandard' category, with 6% in the 'doubtful'  category  and

7%  in  the  'bad'  or  'loss' category.  The  banks  have  made

provisions  for  all NPLs in line with MAS guidelines,  ie,  10%

provision  for the unsecured portion of substandard  loans,  50%

for doubtful loans and 100% for loss loans1.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40% of the increase in NPLs is due to the banks adopting

stricter criteria for classifying loans. Banks now automatically

classify  loans as NPLs once the principal or interest  payments

are  3 months or more in arrears, compared to the previous  rule

of   6  months.  3  months  is  increasingly  the  international

practice.  In addition, banks are continuing to treat all  loans

to  borrowers with weak financials as NPL, regardless of whether

they  are in arrears. The remaining 60% of the increase in  NPLs

reflects the slowdown in the Singapore economy.



<br><br>_________________



<br>1  Non-performing  loans are those graded Substandard,  Doubtful

and Loss. The definitions are as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Substandard : loans are classified substandard when their

normal repayments are overdue or may be in jeopardy. Also

included in this category are performing loans which are graded

substandard solely because of the borrowers' weak financials.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Doubtful : loans are classified doubtful when full

liquidation of outstanding debts appear questionable and the

accounts suggest that there will be a loss, the exact amount of

which cannot be determined as yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Loss : loans are classified as loss when

outstanding debts are regarded as uncollectible.

<div align="center"><b>BRUNEI RINGGIT TO THE SINGAPORE DOLLAR PEG</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether the Brunei ringgit to the Singapore dollar peg poses any

adverse  risk  to  the Singapore dollar in view  of  the  widely

publicised  Amadeo  scandal and the  current  fragility  of  the

Brunei  economy;  and if so, whether the Government  intends  to

take any measure to delink the Brunei ringgit from the Singapore

dollar.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Currency Interchangeability Agreement (CIA) between

Singapore  and  Brunei has been in operation  since  June  1967.

Under  this  agreement, the currency notes of  one  country  are

acceptable  in  the other country as customary tender,  although

not  legal  tender. The CIA applies only to currency notes,  but

banks  in Singapore have extended it to include interbank funds.

This  reflects the confidence of the banking communities in both

Singapore and Brunei in the CIA.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arrangement has benefited both countries. Firstly, it

has  strengthened  financial links between  the  two  countries,

enabling  Brunei banks to utilise the Singapore  dollar  banking

and  financial facilities in Singapore as though  they  were  in

Brunei dollars.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 959</b></font><br><br>



Secondly,  by  eliminating exchange rate  risk  and  transaction

costs,  it  has  facilitated  bilateral  trade  and  investment.

Thirdly,  both Singapore and Brunei have enjoyed low  inflation,

as  a  result  of  the credible Singapore dollar  exchange  rate

policy.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brunei is currently experiencing some financial and

economic  turbulence.  Contributing factors  include  the  Asian

currency  turmoil,  the  sharp fall  in  oil  prices,  and  also

problems  that  are more specific to Brunei.  But  unlike  other

regional countries, Brunei does not suffer from an over-extended

financial  sector,  an overbuilt property market  or  a  current

account deficit.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's own economic and financial fundamentals are

sound.   Brunei is not a large market for Singapore's goods  and

services, representing 1% of our total trade.  Its capital flows

are small in Singapore's context.  As a result, the developments

in  Brunei have had only a minimal and transitory impact on  the

Singapore dollar.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits Times (17th August) quoted one senior Bruneian

official  as  saying: "The currency agreement has withstood  the

test  of  time  and is working very well.  We see no  reason  to

change  it." Singapore concurs with this view. In fact, MAS  had

earlier publicly stated (15th July) that we have no intention to

break the CIA.

<div align="center"><b>USAGE OF SINGAPORE DOLLAR</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether the Monetary Authority of Singapore will allow Singapore

outside Singapore.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore residents may borrow S$ for use outside

Singapore,  without  the need to consult  MAS.   Singapore-based

companies  which  are  not jointly-owned  or  majority-owned  by

Singapore citizens and hence are non-residents, have to  consult

MAS if they wish to borrow S$ for use overseas.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a working guideline, the amount of S$ financing allowed

for  such projects will be more generous where the companies are

under  Singaporean management control or have Ministry of  Trade

and Industry (MTI)/Economic Development Board (EDB) sponsorship.

Such  companies  will  be  allowed 100%  of  the  project  costs

financed  in  S$ if the Singaporean shareholding is between  21%

and  49%,  or  up to 50% of the project costs if the Singaporean

shareholding  is  less  than  21%.   Overseas  projects  without

Singaporean management control and MTI/EDB sponsorship  will  be

allowed  S$  financing up to the proportion of  the  Singaporean

shareholding.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases, the S$ proceeds from the credit facilities

must  be  converted  or swapped into foreign  currency  for  use

outside Singapore.  This follows naturally as the S$ is  not  an

international currency.

<div align="center"><b>CLAIMS BY REPATRIATED FOREIGN WORKERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

what  arrangements,  if any, are there to  investigate  and,  if

legitimate, to pursue any claims by repatriated foreign  workers

for   unpaid  wages  or  other  benefits  due  from  Singaporean

employers.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers are not allowed to repatriate their foreign

workers  who  have  outstanding salary claims.  When  a  foreign

worker  files a wage claim with the Labour Relations Department,

his  employer  is  cautioned not to  repatriate  him  before  an

amicable settlement is reached. If the employer repatriates  the

worker without settling the claim, he could be disqualified from

applying for new work permits.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 961</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foreign Workers' Unit of the Ministry handles

employment claims and complaints lodged by foreign workers.  The

service is provided free of charge. Complainants do not need the

service   of  lawyers  to  pursue  their  claims.   To  increase

awareness of the protection accorded by the Employment  Act  and

procedure to file employment claims, leaflets in various foreign

languages have been produced and distributed to foreign workers.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since January 1998, the Unit has helped some 3,700 foreign

workers  who had lodged employment-related claims against  their

employers. Where an amicable settlement cannot be reached at the

conciliation  meetings, workers' claims which  fall  within  the

ambit  of  the  Employment  Act  will  be  adjudicated  by   the

Commissioner for Labour at the Labour Court.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the worker is unable to file his claims in person with

the  Ministry  against his employer, he could  lodge  a  written

claim  with  us from anywhere, including from his home  country.

The  Ministry  has been able to help them recover  their  unpaid

wages.  In  1998,  the  Ministry's Labour  Relations  Department

helped 35 such workers.

<div align="center"><b>MERGER OF FINANCE COMPANIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister what

steps  the  Government  intends to  take  to  encourage  finance

companies  to  merge  so  that  these  companies  can   actively

participate in the growth of the financial sector in Singapore.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Companies Act was revised in December 1994 to

raise the minimum capital requirement for finance companies from

$0.5  million  to  $50 million. The aim was  to  enable  finance

companies to have the resources to compete more effectively  and

increase  public confidence in them. The finance companies  have

been  given  up  to  year 2003 to comply with  the  $50  million

minimum capital requirement.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the raising of the minimum capital requirement, 3

finance  companies  with  small capital  funds  have  ceased  to

operate.  Of  the 18 finance companies currently  in  operation,

five  have capital funds of less than $50 million. If they  fail

to  increase  their capital funds by 2003, they  would  have  to

merge with larger financial institutions or cease operations.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has, through frequent dialogue, encouraged the smaller

independent  finance companies to merge to meet competition  and

upgrade   their  operations.   However,  this  is  a  commercial

decision left to the finance companies.  They will have to judge

how  best to meet the pressures of the marketplace, particularly

as  we  gradually  liberalise the domestic financial  system  to

allow for greater competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18 Mr Shriniwas Rai asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs

what  steps will the Government take to implement the  provision

of  the Points of Agreement signed by Malaysia and Singapore  in

view of the former's stand.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. S. Jayakumar:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and I have spoken at length in

this House on 5th June 1997 on the background to the POA as well

as  its  specific provisions. I will therefore not repeat  these

details.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will know from the debate last year that

Singapore's  position  is  that  the  POA  is  a  Government-to-Government  agreement between Singapore and Malaysia which  took

effect and became operative on 27th November 1990, ie, the  date

on which it was signed.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 963</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia, however, has taken a different position. Last

year,  they maintained that the POA "would only come into effect

if  and when KTM should decide to vacate Tanjong Pagar Station".

More  recently, several Malaysian leaders have made comments  to

the press questioning the status and validity of the POA.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, Singapore officially proposed that the

disagreement  over  the correct interpretation  of  the  POA  be

submitted  to  the International Court of Justice (ICJ).   There

was no response to this.  On 8th July 1998, Ministry of Law,  in

response   to  the  further  statements  by  Malaysian  leaders,

reiterated Singapore's position on the binding legal  nature  of

the  POA;  that there was no requirement for it to be  ratified;

and repeated our proposal to have the dispute referred to ICJ.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways to resolve this matter. One is to

proceed through the legal process and agree to submit the  legal

issues for arbitration or to the ICJ for a decision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, we could resolve it within the framework of

wider cooperation which PM Goh had proposed to Dr Mahathir.   As

PM  Goh  told  this  House in June last  year,  he  informed  Dr

Mahathir  that  he  could  overcome  the  political  and   legal

difficulties  of varying the POA only within this  framework  of

wider cooperation.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PM Goh recently reiterated in his National Day Rally speech

that  he will try to resolve bilateral issues, such as the  POA,

and  enhance  bilateral relations within a  framework  of  wider

cooperation.  We will continue to take this approach.

the  programmes in view of the current economic uncertainty  and

the  fact that the Government is likely to incur budget deficits

in fiscal years 1998 and 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, MND is preparing its FY99 budget plan for

submission  to  the  Ministry of Finance.  Given  the  budgetary

constraints,  we have to manage our limited financial  resources

carefully   according   to  the  country's   priorities.   These

<div align="center"><b>NATURE RESERVE LAND</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <b>Mr Simon S C Tay</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  what is the exact area of protected nature  reserve

land  that was cleared for use for water storage facilities  and

if  he will consider increasing the remaining nature reserves to

compensate for the area so used.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exact area that was cleared for the construction of the

service reservoir is 11 ha. This area was specifically chosen to

minimise the impact on the nature reserves. It consists of young

forest  with  no  key  forest  species.  After  the  project  is

completed,  about 7.5 ha will be fenced in as a protected  area.

The  remaining  area, which consists mainly of slopes,  will  be

turfed   to   reduce  erosion  and  reverted  back  to   natural

vegetation.  NParks will speed up the regeneration  by  planting

back with native plants to reforest the site, wherever possible.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's query on whether the area of the nature

reserves  should be increased to compensate for the land  to  be

taken  up by the proposed water storage facilities, MND  has  no

plans to do so. Firstly, the present case is an exceptional  one

and  the  land take has been minimised significantly.  Secondly,

the  size  of  the nature reserves has to be determined  by  the

value  of  the  bio-diversity contained in it  as  well  as  the

overall balance of competing requirements for land in Singapore.

It  is  therefore  not  a sacrosanct constant  that  has  to  be

maintained.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would however like to reassure the Member that NParks

will monitor and safeguard the integrity of the nature reserves,

wherever feasible.

with the Malaysian Government on the access to and management of

the  lighthouse on Pulau Pisang and whether there have been  any

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The island of Pulau Pisang belongs to Malaysia. Singapore

currently  operates the lighthouse on Pulau  Pisang.   Under  an

indenture  dated 6th October 1900, the Sultan of  Johor  granted

the  plot of land on which the lighthouse stands, as well as the

roadway leading to the lighthouse, to the Straits Settlement and

its  successor,  Singapore.  The total plot of land  granted  to

Singapore  amounted  to just over two acres.  According  to  the

indenture, this arrangement continues in perpetuity as  long  as

Singapore operates the lighthouse.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lighthouse is a navigational aid for ships passing

through the Malacca Straits.  At any one time, the Maritime  and

<div align="center"><b>SUSPENSION OF ELECTRONIC ROAD PRICING</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap</b> asked the Minister for

Communications, in view of the deteriorating economic crisis, if

the  Minister will consider suspending the implementation of the

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERP system is a traffic management tool. It is not to

generate  revenue.   Its primary purpose is  to  bring  about  a

smoother  flow of traffic, and more efficient use  of  our  road

network  so as to support economic activities and to maintain  a

clean and safe environment.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ERP is a major component of the Government's traffic

management policy, which emphasises usage rather than  ownership

restraint.   Part  of this policy has already  been  implemented

this  year in the form of major vehicle tax reductions  and  ERP

rebates.   For  example, an average 1600 cc car will  pay  about

$440 less in taxes due to the road tax reduction of $240 and ERP

road  tax  rebate of $200.  An average heavy goods vehicle  will

save about $580 in annual road tax due to the road tax reduction

of  $280  and  ERP  road tax rebate of $300.  In  addition,  the

Registration  Fee for new heavy goods vehicles was reduced  from

$14,000  to  $140. The overall package will cost the  Government

about $1 billion over 5 years.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority or 76% of motorists who do not use the ERP

will enjoy the full savings.  15% of motorists who make only one

ERP  pass  per day will also save as the rates are no more  than

their  previous  ALS/RPS charges.  In fact, we  have  introduced

lower ERP rates on the expressways to spread out traffic to  the

shoulder periods when traffic volume is lower.  For the CBD,  we

have lowered ERP rates generally and shortened the ERP hours  on

Saturday.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the motorists who make more than one ERP pass

per day will have to plan their trips carefully and adjust their

travel  patterns  to minimise their ERP cost.   Some  businesses

will  need time to adjust to ERP.  Hence, we decided to phase-in

the  ERP charges for commercial vehicles and taxis over the next

4 years.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 969</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ERP system is a fairer and more equitable system than

the  previous  manual ALS and RPS.  It is part  of  our  revised

traffic  management policy, which reduces the cost  of  motoring

for those who choose to make less use of our roads and help keep

traffic free-flowing.  As such, my Ministry will not suspend the

implementation of the ERP on the CBD. However, we  will  monitor

the  traffic  conditions and adjust the  rates  to  ensure  that

motorists are not charged more than is necessary to keep traffic

free flowing on our roads.

<div align="center"><b>SUBSIDISED RETRAINING PROGRAMME FOR EXECUTIVES AND</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PROFESSIONALS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chuang Shaw Peng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26. <b>Mr Chuang Shaw Peng</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

whether  the Government plans to have any subsidised  retraining

programme  for  executives  and professionals,  similar  to  the

Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP) for lower-skilled workers.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP) was launched to

address  the  issue of long-term employability of  less-educated

workers.   Workers  with  less than secondary  education  number

almost  600,000  or  40%  of the present Singaporean  workforce.

They  are  particularly vulnerable because  they  lack  adequate

skills and, as a group, face the most difficulty in coping  with

the  economic restructuring.  The SRP focuses on equipping  them

with  basic, nationally recognised and portable skills  so  that

they can move on to higher-skilled jobs.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is aware that in the present economic

climate,  executives and professionals are also concerned  about

their  employment prospects.  A number have lost their jobs  and

may be finding it difficult to secure alternative employment, at

least  at  a  salary or seniority equivalent to  that  of  their

previous job.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Government is of the view that a structured,

broad-based retraining scheme similar to the SRP for  executives

and  professionals  is  not necessary.   The  circumstances  for

executives and professionals are rather different from those  of

the  less-educated  workers.  Unlike the less-educated  workers,

executives  and professionals do not, as a group,  lack  skills.

They  are also expected to take greater responsibility for their

own skills upgrading and career development.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this period of economic downturn, executives and

professionals  should be prepared to adjust their  expectations.

They  should  not be too choosy about jobs.  If  need  be,  they

should  be  willing to accept lower salaries and more  demanding

duties.   If  they  need assistance in finding  jobs,  they  can

approach the Employment Service Department of my Ministry, which

will do its best to match them with appropriate vacancies.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The critical issue for executives and professionals is to

continuously update and enhance their existing stock  of  skills

in  order  to  keep up with new developments  and  demands.   My

Ministry is studying ways to widen the opportunities to  do  so.

For  instance,  in some countries universities and  polytechnics

have  a  system that allows their graduates to return every  few

years  in order to update their knowledge in their chosen field.

MOM  and  MOE  will  study  the feasibility  of  providing  more

opportunities  for  such  refresher  courses  or   updating   of

knowledge for our skilled workforce.

his  Ministry's  stand  on the Malaysian Trade  Union  Congress'

decision to bring up to the International Labour Organization  a

dispute  of the withdrawal of West Malaysians' Central Provident

Fund contributions.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently there was a newspaper report concerning a comment

by  the  President of the Malaysian Trade Union Congress  (MTUC)

that  he  would be taking up the CPF withdrawal issue  with  the

International  Labour Organisation (ILO).  He was also  reported

to  have  accused  the  Singapore Government  of  discriminating

against  West  Malaysians  in the  CPF  withdrawal  rules.   His

accusation is completely baseless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained in this House, West Malaysian CPF

members are distinguished from other foreign CPF members because

of   the  historical  links  between  Peninsular  Malaysia   and

Singapore.  West  Malaysians  in  fact  are  given  preferential

treatment over Singapore members.  They can withdraw their  full

CPF savings from age 50, without having to set aside the minimum

sum,  provided  that they have not worked in  Singapore  for  at

least 2 years prior to the withdrawal request.  Singaporeans can

only  do so at the age of 55, after setting aside the prevailing

minimum  sum.   All  foreigners working in Singapore,  including

West  Malaysians, were well aware of these rules  upon  assuming

employment in Singapore since 1971. They are therefore bound  by

the withdrawal rules that they had accepted when they first came

to  work in Singapore.  Changes to the CPF withdrawal conditions

for West Malaysians are being discussed between PM Goh Chok Tong

and  PM Dr Mahathir Mohamad in the context of wider co-operation

between  Singapore and Malaysia.  Once an agreement is  reached,

this issue can be resolved conclusively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our view, there is no basis for the MTUC to file any

complaint  with the ILO.  As far as we are aware,  there  is  no

constitutional procedure under the ILO for a trade union of  one

country  to  file a complaint against the Government of  another

<div align="center"><b>AIR TRAFFIC SERVICE ARRANGEMENT OVER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SOUTHERN PENINSULAR MALAYSIA</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Cyrille Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Cyrille Tan</b> asked the Minister for Communications

what  is  his  Ministry's response to the Malaysian Government's

proposal of reclaiming control of the air space surrounding  the

southern part of the Malay Peninsula.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air traffic service arrangements are drawn up under the

auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)

which  is  the  international organisation responsible  for  the

safety  and  efficiency of international  civil  aviation.   The

existing arrangement over Southern Peninsular Malaysia has  been

in existence since 1975.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this arrangement, Singapore undertook the

responsibility to provide air traffic services without charge to

all  users,  thus ensuring that air navigation in this  area  is

conducted  with  the  highest level of  safety  and  efficiency.

Everyone   in   the  international  civil  aviation   community,

especially  airlines, pilots and air travellers,  benefits  from

this arrangement.  It has also contributed to the growth of  air

traffic and helped develop economies and airports in the region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any changes to air traffic service arrangements are

normally  discussed  and endorsed by ICAO  because  it  involves

issues  of safety and efficiency and is of vital concern to  all

members of the international civil aviation community.

<div align="center"><b>COUNSELLING PROGRAMME</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Community  Development,  since the  amendments  to  the  Women's

Charter  in May 1997, how many referrals have been made  to  his

Ministry by the Subordinate Courts for mandatory counselling  of

abusers;   how   his  Ministry  implements  and  evaluates   the

effectiveness of the counselling programme; and if  a  plan  has

been  put  in  place  to increase the pool  of  counsellors  and

support resources for handling such cases.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Abdullah Tarmugi:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of mandatory counselling up to July

1998,  the  Family Court has referred 199 cases for counselling.

Of  these, 144 cases were for counselling of perpetrators  only,

and  55 were cases where both the perpetrators and victims  were

referred for counselling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mandatory counselling programme is still relatively

new.  It would be too early to assess its full effectiveness  at

this point in time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In administering the programme, the Ministry processes and

undertakes initial assessment of all cases referred by the Court

before  referring  cases to counsellors  from  the  Ministry  or

appointed  social  service agencies for  mandatory  counselling.

The  Ministry coordinates and monitors the work of the appointed

social service agencies and the counsellors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training programmes are in place to develop a pool of

qualified social workers and counsellors with the competence and

skill to deal with family violence cases.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCD has organised a number of training workshops, case-conferences and regular dialogue sessions with social service

agencies.  It has also commissioned  agencies like the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 981</b></font><br><br>



Counselling and Care Centre and the Family Resource and Training

Centre  to  conduct  a number of specialised courses for  social

service agencies.   Among the courses covered are Management  of

Family  Violence, Couples in Violent Relationships  and  Working

with Perpetrators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now 25 social service agencies providing

mandatory  counselling up from 15 in July  1997.   All  agencies

providing  mandatory  counselling  services  receive  Government

funding on a per capita basis.

<div align="center"><b>TAMIL LANGUAGE IN SCHOOLS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Shriniwas Rai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Shriniwas Rai</b> asked the Minister for Education (a)

what  is the number of schools offering Tamil as a mother tongue

in  primary and secondary schools and the number of students who

are  studying the language; and (b) whether the Government  will

consider allowing more primary schools to offer Tamil as well as

allowing  one  of the polytechnics to offer it  as  a  part-time

course so as to encourage growth of Tamil scholars in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamil is taught in 147 primary schools and 77 secondary

schools.  In addition, Tamil is taught at the Umar Pulavar Tamil

Language  Centre and 5 other secondary schools  which  serve  as

Tamil  Language centres for pupils  from secondary schools which

do  not  offer  the subject.  Currently, 13,671  primary  school

pupils and 7,558 secondary school pupils study Tamil.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Education will introduce Tamil language

teaching  in primary schools where there is a sufficient  demand

from  pupils  to  offer  the  subject.   As  the  focus  of  our

polytechnics  is  on training practice-oriented middle  managers

and  technologists for the Singapore economy, they are currently

not  engaged in offering Diploma-level programmes in  languages,

whether  on a full-time or part-time basis.  There are no  plans

to do so in the near future.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member would be pleased to know the National University

of  Singapore  is starting a South Asian Studies Programme  next

July,  which  will  include optional Tamil modules.   This  will

allow those with an interest in Tamil to pursue it at NUS, while

serving  our broader objective of fostering interest in  studies

on South Asia.

<div align="center"><b>EXPELLED STUDENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Education,  when a student is expelled from school, whether  his

or her offence is made known to all other schools and whether it

will  prejudice  his/her application for  admission  to  another

school.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a pupil is expelled from school, the parents usually

appeal  to Principals in other schools, often nearby,  to accept

their child.  If a school is prepared to consider accepting  the

pupil,  the Principal will ask the sending school to  give  some

background  on him before making a final decision.  This  is  to

understand  the nature of the pupil's problem and to  decide  on

the  best way of helping him.  At this point the pupil's offence

is  revealed to the Principal of the receiving school only.  The

Ministry does not publicise the offence of the offender.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If parents fail to find a school on their own, they will

turn  to  MOE  for  assistance.  The pupil,  together  with  his

parents, would be interviewed by the School Inspector or another

appropriate   officer,  to  determine  whether  the   pupil   is

remorseful and  sincere in wishing to continue studying. We also

have  to determine if re-admitting him to a school will  pose  a

risk  to the safety and well-being of other pupils in the school

he is seeking admission to.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 983</b></font><br><br>



Once  we are satisfied that the pupil should be helped, we  will

assist  him in finding a place in another school with a vacancy.

When  MOE  approaches other Principals to accept the pupil,  the

offence  is  revealed to them for the same reasons as  indicated

earlier.

<div align="center"><b>YOUTH EDUCATION CENTRES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh</b> asked the Minister for

Education  if his Ministry will help, through subsidies  or  the

provision of suitable vacant school premises, approved community

service  agencies to operate Youth Education Centres  which  can

help  school drop-outs to study and resit Primary School Leaving

Exam, O and A level exams.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOE currently provides subsidies for 2 types of pupils:

pupils  in the mainstream schools and those in special education

schools which are run by Voluntary Welfare Organisations  (VWOs)

registered with MOE.  The Ministry does not provide subsidies to

community  service  agencies to operate Youth Education  Centres

which   can   help   school  drop-outs  to  study   and   re-sit

examinations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Youth Council (NYC) is looking into the problem of

out-of  school  youths.  We understand that the TOUCH  Community

Services have been asked to work together with Marine Parade CDC

to  set  up  a Youth Learning Centre (YLC) for youths  who  have

dropped out of schools.  The proposal will be forwarded  to  NYC

for  consideration.   NYC  will  liaise  with  other  Government

agencies to  help them in their efforts.
