<div align="center"><b>ORAL ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>LORONG LIMAU AREA</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Eviction of residents for industrialisation projects)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b> asked the Minister

for Law and National



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1276</b></font><br><br>



Development  (a)  whether the  Lorong  Limau  area  is

urgently required for industrialisation projects,  and

when;  and  (b) whether he will defer the eviction  of

the residents of the area to a later date.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. W. Barker:</b> The answer to the question is

"Yes". The Lorong Limau area is urgently required  not

for  industrialisation projects but for re-development

purposes.  The Housing and Development Board  will  be

commencing  redevelopment  as  soon  as  the  area  is

cleared.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for redeveloping this area are threefold.

Firstly,  the  area is frequently subject  to  floods.

Secondly,  with the redevelopment of the  area,  there

will  be better utilisation of the land to house  many

more  families than the number of people that  are  at

present   residing  there.  Thirdly,  the   one-storey

Housing  Board flats there are very old  and  in  very

poor condition, resulting in high maintenance costs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the second part of the question is that

no  notice  to  quit  has as yet been  served  on  the

residents of the Housing Board flats affected in  this

area,  and  I hope that no eviction will be necessary.

Those  residents who co-operate and move out of  these

Housing   Board   flats  will  be   offered   suitable

alternative  accommodation  in  other  Housing   Board

estates. In fact, some have already moved and we  hope

that it will not be necessary to issue notices to quit

on the others.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Can the Minister state how many flats there

are involved and how big is the area?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, at the moment there are about 400

to 500 flats occupying an area of about 46 acres.

<div align="center"><b>COMMISSION, 1966</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question [14th March, 1967],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House takes note of the Report of the

Constitutional  Commission, 1966,  presented  to  this

House as Command Paper



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1277</b></font><br><br>



No.  29  of 1966, and endorses the Government's  views

thereon  as  set out in the Statement by the  Minister

for  Law  and National Development made at the sitting

of  this House on 21st December, 1966.". - [Mr E.  W.

Barker]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> When we rose last night, Mr Ho Cheng

Choon had the Floor. Mr Ho.



<br><br>2.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has

already    announced   the   acceptance   of   certain

recommendations  of the Commission,  particularly  the

second  method  of entrenchment of the  provisions  to

protect  fundamental  rights. I would  also  urge  the

Government to accept the first method of entrenchment,

namely,  that  a Bill altering the Constitution  shall

not be passed by Parliament unless it is expressed  to

be  one  that amends the Constitution and contains  no

other  provisions.  Sir, this  will  help  Members  of

Parliament  understand better that the Bill  is  meant

for  the purpose of altering the Constitution, because

not  all people know the niceties of the law. So  this

first method will help us to grasp the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take you, Mr Speaker, as an example. If a Bill

is  introduced  in the House specifically  stipulating

that  it is meant to alter the Constitution, then  you

will  know  that under the Constitution it  needs  the

support of two-thirds of the Members of Parliament  to

vote on it before it can be passed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the third method of amendment to the

Constitution which provides for a referendum to decide

on the adoption of the Bill altering the Constitution,

in  my  view, this third method is redundant  and,  in

fact,   rather  cumbersome,  because  there  will   be

difficulties if we implement it, especially in  regard

to the assessment of public opinion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a very small country and newly independent. We

have elections once every five years. In 1963 we had a

general  election. We have also had a few by-elections

since then. Even then



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1278</b></font><br><br>



the  electorate had grumbled about being  required  to

vote at the elections, especially the by-elections. In

some  constituencies the electorate had to  vote  only

once,  but  in other constituencies they had  to  vote

twice.  So  if a Bill were to be introduced  into  the

House  every year to amend the Constitution,  and  the

people  were required to vote on it, then it would  be

rather  troublesome and it would also incur a  lot  of

expenditure. The result would be contrary to  what  we

would expect.



<br><br>2.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

take   this   opportunity  to  echo  the  Government's

appreciation   of   the  highly   commendable   Report

presented   to   Parliament  by   the   Constitutional

Commission, 1966? I have read and studied  the  Report

thoroughly, and I must say that it is one of the  best

Reports  ever  presented. I am, however,  particularly

happy  to  note  that the Government  has  given  very

careful  consideration to the Report and that most  of

the  recommendations are acceptable though a  few  are

not,  while there are other recommendations which  the

Government agrees in principle but differs in detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Sir, allow me to make a few observations on

the  various headings. There are (1) the Ombudsman (or

the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration; (2)

the  Council  of  State;  and (3)  the  Protection  of

Fundamental  Rights  and Freedoms of  the  Individual.

Before  touching  on the office of  the  Ombudsman,  I

would  like  to refer to the fears expressed  in  some

quarters  that the country is heading in the direction

of being a one-party State. According to them, this is

not good for a country and would in the end lead to  a

dictatorship or a totalitarian government.  To  dispel

their  fears,  may  I ask these people  one  important

question? Whether or not the P.A.P. Government is,  in

fact,   practising   parliamentary   democracy?    The

Government is essentially democratic socialist and  it

is,  in  fact, practising parliamentary democracy.  We

have  a  President  who  is  a  Malay;  the  Executive

comprising the main races of which the Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1279</b></font><br><br>



Minister  is  a Chinese; the Judiciary  of  which  the

Chief Justice is a Chinese; the Commissioner of Police

who is a Eurasian; and not forgetting that the Speaker

of  Parliament is an Indian; the Army Commander  is  a

Eurasian; and in the Civil Service the heads are  made

up of citizens of the various races.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can go on and point out many others. Suffice it

to  say  that it is not and never will be the P.A.P.'s

policy to be dictatorial as long as it is entrusted to

look  after the interests of the nation. I think  this

is  sufficient  enough  to  show  to  the  world  that

Singapore  is  truly  a  multi-racial  society,  truly

practising  democracy. We are not like some  countries

which   talk  of  multi-racialism  and  yet   practise

feudalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point on parliamentary democracy is that we

still  have the one-man-one-vote system. We  have  the

Parliamentary  elections once every  five  years,  and

whenever  vacancies occur in Parliament  they  are  at

once  filled through the by-elections. Therefore,  how

can   people   say  that  there  is  no  parliamentary

democracy  in  Singapore? I think  that  these  people

ought to have their heads examined. The Government  is

elected by the people, and the only reason I can think

of  why  the  people  of Singapore keep  on  returning

P.A.P. candidates  at the various by-elections,  even

though they know full well that the P.A.P. already has

more  than two-thirds majority in Parliament, is  that

the  P.A.P. is  the  only political  Party  that  can

provide  a  clean  and  honest  leadership  and   also

maintain this progressive society whereby everyone  is

able  to  have  a happy life. Therefore,  this  purely

reflects   the  confidence  of  the  people   in   the

Government   to   legislate   honestly,   fairly   and

reasonably in the interests of all concerned.  If  the

existence of a one-party State is brought about, as it

is likely to happen, then it is no fault of the P.A.P.

nor  of  the people. It is the will of the people.  We

must not forget, Mr Speaker, Sir, that there is still

the  Opposition in this House, because the P.A.P. has

not  got all the 51 seats. Two hon. Members are absent

and their whereabouts are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1280</b></font><br><br>



unknown.  Why  they choose to be so is for  them,  and

them  only,  to  answer.  I cannot  answer  for  them.

However,   I   must  stress  that  the  P.A.P. wants

Opposition,  and we the Backbenchers  will  play  this

role  well.  Be  that  as it may,  Sir,  we  will  not

abdicate  our responsibility and we will  continue  to

serve the people to the best of our ability, come what

may.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come to the first point, the office of

Ombudsman.  I  refer  to  the vast  powers  which  the

Ombudsman  has,  as  recommended in  the  Commission's

Report. I am inclined to agree to this office,  but  I

would like to make a suggestion. I would propose that,

instead  of  vesting vast powers in one person  alone,

which would not serve a useful purpose, a committee of

three be set up with each taking turns as Chairman and

serving  a  minimum period of, say, three years.  Sir,

the  general belief is that two heads are better  than

one,  and  I think three heads well screwed  on  their

shoulders,  so  to speak, would make the  office  more

formidable and less fallible.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> What about a

hundred heads?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> That would come later in the

Council.  Even the Ombudsman can be fallible,  and  to

err  is  human. However, with three persons in office,

the   administration  may  be  slower  but  it   would

definitely  and positively be surer and more  reliable

in  consequence. For all practical purposes, when  one

Ombudsman  has  to  conduct  investigations  and  make

public  his  findings, it would be from one viewpoint,

from  one  angle. However, if there is a committee  of

three, the findings then would be a consensus of or  a

majority  of opinion amongst three, and this would  be

more  reliable.  And  as  the  complaints  would  fall

broadly  within  the two categories mentioned  in  the

Report,  I  think one man's view, opinion or  decision

varies with another, and this depends on how the facts

are   presented;  also  the  emphasis  on  which   the

Ombudsman relies before he exercises his discretionary

powers,  if at all discretionary powers and  decisions

are  subject  to investigation by the  office  of  the

Ombudsman, as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1281</b></font><br><br>



stated  in  the Report. But I would like to  emphasise

that there exists in Singapore a department that deals

with  public  inquiries  and complaints.  The  Central

Complaints Bureau is, in fact, doing a fine  job,  for

on  many  occasions I had to refer to this  department

complaints which I felt should be attended to  by  it,

and  I  am happy to say that all have been dealt  with

satisfactorily.  Therefore,  the  suspicion  that  the

complaints would not be properly investigated does not

arise. However, if the committee, as I have suggested,

is to be set up at all, may I suggest that the members

be  drawn from people of high calibre and eminence  in

public administration, and who are not members of  any

political  party,  and  for  that  matter,  are   non-partisans in political affairs?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the recommendation for the setting up of

the  Council  of State, it is noticed  that  the  main

support for the creation of this Council rests on  the

fact   that  there  is  no  effective  or  responsible

Opposition  in  Parliament. As I have  already  stated

earlier, this surely reflects on the confidence of the

people in the Government to legislate honestly, fairly

and reasonably in the public interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I also point out that we still have the

Select  Committees of Parliament which  always  invite

constructive    and   well-informed   criticisms    or

amendments to measures proposed in Parliament. If  the

setting  up of the Council of State would not only  be

too  expensive,  it would, in effect,  only  serve  to

delay  the passage of Bills. And if the Council is  to

be  set  up,  it  would, to my mind,  tend  to  become

somewhat like an Upper House where its composition  is

made  up  of  non-elected members. They  would  likely

become  more  or less the Senate, though their  duties

would be purely advisory. Though the Council would sit

in  private, still its reports on the deliberations on

the  Bills referred to them would have to be presented

to  Parliament.  Is it intended that  the  Council  of

State  replaces  the Select Committees  which  Sit  in

public  to  hear public views? However,  if  its  sole

function is merely to advise, then I see no reason why

it should be so set up, for the Select Committees



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1282</b></font><br><br>



would  serve a more useful  purpose  as  they

stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I refer to the question of protection of

fundamental rights and freedom of the individual. Sir,

if  we  are  to continue to have democracy, then  this

question  is of paramount importance to all  citizens,

including  individuals. Therefore, the recommendations

of  the  Commission to embody in the Constitution  the

protection of the rights of life and personal  liberty

of  the individual, the prohibition of slavery of  all

forms  and  of  forced labour, the protection  against

retrospective  criminal  laws  and  repeated   trials,

equality of all persons before the law, prohibition of

banishment and freedom of movement, freedom of speech,

assembly,  association  and  religion,  are  all  very

important  characteristics of a  true  democracy.  The

fact  that the Government will ensure that steps  will

be  taken  to incorporate them in the Constitution  is

another sign that it is practising democracy in  spite

of  the  overwhelming majority it has  in  Parliament.

This should dispel the fears of the evils of Singapore

having  a one-party system. This will be the necessary

guarantee  to  every individual of his rightful  place

here.  However,  I  must  stress  strongly  that  this

society   will  collapse  if  the  people,  especially

certain  sections, continue to exploit this  issue  in

spite  of the vigorous steps the Government is  taking

to  ensure a fair deal to all. Therefore, the need for

building an organised society out of peoples of varied

migrant  origins is a heavy task. But  I  am  positive

that  with patience and tolerance amongst the  people,

this  organised  society, built upon  multi-racialism,

will  ultimately  emerge  and  Singapore  will  be   a

showpiece,  not only in South-east Asia, but  also  in

the  world where everyone enjoys equal franchise. Sir,

I  give  my  support to the motion  as  moved  by  the

Minister for Law.



<br><br>2.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  giving  my views on the motion  before  this

House  in  the name of the Minister for Law,  I  would

like,  first,  to  express the  gratification  of  the

Government that a unanimous



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1283</b></font><br><br>



report was, in fact, possible despite the fact

that  almost  every minority group  in  Singapore  was

represented in the Constitutional Commission. It is  a

reminder,  in  fact, of the value  of  having  certain

common denominators in any group of people if they are

to  function  effectively and cohesively.  The  common

denominators in this case were that, first, they  were

lawyers   in  the  English  tradition,  and,   second,

whatever  their  religious,  their  ethnic  and  their

linguistic  origins may have been, they  had  not  got

embroiled in, and debased by the excesses of  communal

mass politics. I am not suggesting that a multi-racial

society is the ideal society in all circumstances.  In

fact, the great powers of this world today consist  of

nations which are ethno-centric in composition.  True,

both the Americans and the Russians have more than one

single race or one single language group or one single

religion.  But there is in both countries  one  single

race  or ethnic group which shares one common language

and  whose  culture is, by reason of its  dynamism  or

aggressiveness,  far  in  dominance  over  the  others

comprised  in  the  nation. Be  that  as  it  may  for

aspirants  to  world powers, we are confronted,  as  a

young   migrant   community,  with  the   problem   of

continuing a tolerant, meaningful society for some two

million  people nearly all of whom cannot trace  their

links  with the Republic for more than 150 years.  For

when  Stamford  Raffles landed here in February  1819,

there  were only 120 Malays and 30 Chinese, and  there

cannot  be  very  many of us here who  can  trace  our

ancestors to those 120 Malays and 30 Chinese.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Multi-racialism in a permissive, tolerant society

becomes an imperative for us and those societies  like

us,  which, for one reason or another, have taken into

one  geographic whole large components of people  with

diverse  ethnic, linguistic and religious backgrounds.

The reasons we advanced before merger and Malaysia why

such  a  larger whole would have provided a much  more

stable, a broader basis for the survival of the values

which we would like to carry forward from the old into

the new society,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1284</b></font><br><br>



are   still   valid.  And  when  we  found   ourselves

confronted suddenly with the problem of an independent

Singapore,  our pre-occupation was how to ensure  that

the  perils of communal politics shall not inflict us.

Unless  care is exercised, we could so easily be  torn

as-under.  The  problem is how to create  a  situation

where  the  minority either in ethnic,  linguistic  or

religious  terms,  is  not  conscious  that  it  is  a

minority; where the exercise of its rights as an equal

citizen  is so natural and so accepted a part  of  our

society  that it is not conscious of the fact that  it

is sharing, within this wider whole, equal rights with

the dominant ethnic groups who accept its equality  as

a matter of fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me review the events which led us to the

necessity of having such a Commission. Multi-racialism

is   a   tenet  which  has  been  espoused  by   every

responsible  political party from the very  beginnings

of   party  politics  in  Singapore.  It  was   almost

something  taken  for granted as an axiom  before  you

expounded  your political credo. But we discovered  in

the years 1964 and 1965 how easily it was stretched to

breaking  point just by a small group of people  being

permitted to expound extreme philosophies of political

forms  of  government based on ethnic,  religious  and

linguistic  loyalties.  We felt  that  the  Commission

would  get  the problem in perspective. It would  also

make  people with a proclivity towards politics, based

on loyalties of either ethnic, linguistic or religious

ties, assess their possibilities of attaining power on

the basis of such manipulations. The Commission gave a

patient  hearing to all those who appeared before  it.

And, if I may add, not only a patient but an extremely

polite  hearing  to  all manner of propositions  which

were placed before it as sound political propositions.

Their  unanimous  conclusion is that  it  is  a  man's

position as a citizen and his ability to exercise  his

rights  as a citizen and be protected in the  exercise

of   his  rights  regardless  of  race,  language   or

religion,  that must be ensured. That is  the  biggest

single  contribution  the Commission  made  to  multi-racial understanding, tolerance and acceptance of each

other's differences in our society.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1285</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>But  let me hasten to add that this is not a sound and

enduring  basis  on which we can secure  that  such  a

society  will  always be tolerant and will  always  be

permissive. The problem is, how do we institutionalise

some  of these forms and practices so that in the next

generation  these things become part of  the  accepted

way of life?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the factors which will influence our social

fabric? I suggest they can be divided roughly into two

categories,  our  own internal policies  and,  second,

international  policies  affecting  our  own  internal

policies.  We  by  our educational  policies,  by  the

values  which  we  systematically  inculcate  in   our

people, can ensure that the next generation will  find

it  much more natural to accept a scheme of things  in

which the exercise of authority in this society by one

person  over another does not depend upon his  colour,

his name, the kind of church or temple he goes to,  or

the language he speaks to his family at home. In turn,

the  inculcation  of  these  values  in  our  children

becomes easier if the opinion formulaters in all these

various  community groups are conscious  of  the  fact

that their attitudes and their actions cause either  a

favourable or an unfavourable reaction on the  others.

In   other  words,  it  is  not  just  a  process   of

exhortation.  It  is exhortation of values  which  are

desirable, and the constant reaction of the individual

who  is being exhorted to adopt a particular scale  of

values, against the experiences of his own life. If he

finds the exhortation incongruous to the experience of

his life, the exhortation will be rejected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me elaborate. Recently the Government was

confronted  with  a difficult and a delicate  problem,

for  all  religious problems are delicate. A group  of

Buddhists  applied for permission to use  loudspeakers

for  their religious services. All churches or temples

wish to expand their flock and, with modern electronic

aid, the desire to modernise the proselytising zeal is

only  natural. If the answer from the Commissioner  of

Police  who  is  in  charge of these applications  was

"No",  then  inevitably unjust  conclusions  would  be

drawn  that some denominations are more favoured  than

others. For instance, it is well known that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1286</b></font><br><br>



followers  of  the  Muslim religion  are  summoned  to

prayer  with  modern electronic aid.  I  am  happy  to

report   that  after  a  sober  but  sometimes  trying

exploration of all the compromise proposals, the Inter-Religious  Council  was  able  to  reach  some  common

principle upon which all such practices or innovations

will  be dealt with, and it was agreed that so far  as

was  possible,  such  electronic  devices  should   be

confined  to the precincts of a religious  place.  But

sometimes  either by non-enforcement  of  the  law  or

otherwise, exemptions had been made in the  past,  and

this  particular practice had not been complied  with.

In  such cases, if there were undue invasions  of  the

privacy  of  other  persons, self-restraint  would  be

applied.  Self-restraint, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  of  the

people who were otherwise permitted and have, in fact,

been  permitted to practise particular forms of  calls

to  prayer.  Under the new circumstances of  it  being

cited  as a precedent for others to do likewise,  they

have  agreed to inhibit their own practices. If  there

had not been this capacity to appreciate a problem, if

the  attitude  is, "I have always been allowed  to  do

this.   You  have  never  been  allowed  to  do  this.

Therefore, that must be so," then it is impossible  to

maintain  this  easy  relationship.  Eventually,   the

success of our efforts must be measured by the ability

to  build  these attitudes and these reflections  into

the next generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But however assiduously and zealously we pursue these

policies,  there  are  events  which  can  take  place

outside and around us which will have deep and searing

repercussions  on our own social fabric.  Recently  my

colleagues  and  I  were  confronted  with  the   very

unpleasant task of deciding what to do with two sampan

loads  of  refugees  who came seeking  sanctuary  from

depredations which had overtaken them in  some  island

to  the  south-west of us. Villages were burnt,  other

human  miseries occurred which led them to  take  this

very  desperate  step  of seeking  sanctuary,  knowing

that,  in fact, the chances of getting sanctuary  were

negligible. If, swayed by human sympathy, we permitted

this, then we must be prepared to admit some two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1287</b></font><br><br>



million  or  maybe  three million  people  in  similar

circumstances who will seek refuge in Singapore within

the next few years. Even assuming that our economy can

carry  them,  or  that they come  in  with  sufficient

resources  to make a contribution to our  economy,  it

must  mean  a  mutation in our attitude, because  they

must have their repercussions on the attitudes of  the

rest of the population. This is what happened in India

and  Pakistan  with  each  successive  collision,   as

victims  of  atrocities streamed across the boundaries

carrying  their  tales of horror of what  happened  to

people  on the basis of the colour of their skin,  the

structure  of their nose, their eyes, the  texture  of

their  hair.  Emotions are aroused which  jell  people

into  either unquestioning loyalties to those of  like

appearance,  or blind hate and fear and  hostility  to

those  groups who look different from them.  The  fact

that  the  majority in my Cabinet are  ethnically  and

linguistically  of similar types to those  who  landed

here,  made our decision all that much more meaningful

to  those  of  my  colleagues who do not  share  these

ethnic  and linguistic characteristics. What  we  must

constantly  remember  is that,  despite  ourselves,  a

situation  may  arise  in  which  xenophobia  actively

encouraged  or otherwise accidentally allowed  out  of

hand  spreads its pernicious influence throughout  our

own  society.  Hence  the importance  of  having  some

mechanism  whereby  members of our society  are  given

some  assurance until long-term values are  inculcated

in  the  whole society, that there will be  more  than

fair play, more than what they could normally have had

the  right to expect as citizens free and equal of the

others in the society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against this background that we had to decide

what  parts of the recommendation to accept  and  what

parts   to  reject.  The  acid  test  is,  does   this

particular recommendation, first, help to promote this

feeling  of  oneness  regardless of  all  the  ethnic,

religious and linguistic differences, and in the  long

run  promote  the  sense of being  and  feeling  as  a

community? Second, even if it does not do that in  the

long run, does it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1288</b></font><br><br>



in  the interim provide that assurance of consultation

and participation by minority groups in the management

of  our  society, which consultation and participation

would not normally have been open to them on the basis

of one man one vote?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now deal with the principal recommendations of

the Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council of State. I know that many Members in this

House,  particularly those with some training  on  the

elective principles of representative government, feel

that this is a proposition which runs contrary to  the

whole thesis of representative government. It is  true

that  by  whatever  name we call  it  and  however  we

disguise  its  advisory capacity, it  is,  in  effect,

clothing  with some authority the views of a group  of

people  who really cannot be said to be representative

of  the electorate, because they cannot claim to speak

on behalf of the majority of any particular section of

the  community.  But that having been  said,  I  think

provided  there  are  certain  safeguards  as  to  the

possible  misuse or abuse of the forum which  we  will

create  by  constituting  this  Council  of  State,  a

genuine   contribution  can  be  made  to  give   that

participation  and consultation which could  make  for

much happier living for everybody.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the very nature of our population, it is likely as

the years go by that Members of this House will become

younger and younger and not older and older. The young

have  a  habit of choosing those most like themselves,

of voicing the sentiments, the styles and the moods of

their generation, and over the next ten years or  even

in  the  next five years, two-thirds of the electorate

will be below the age of 35. I do not say that a young

representative Chamber is a bad thing in itself, but I

do  say  that - perhaps this is part of the consolation

of  growing old, Mr Speaker, Sir - there is  something

about  the  process  of learning which,  by  the  very

nature  of  things, take time. If we had  been  older,

less  idealistic, more cynical and we had with greater

circumspection    weighed   the    possibilities    of

amalgamation  between two very different  textures  of

society, perhaps we may not have gone into



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1289</b></font><br><br>



merger  and  Malaysia  with the zest,  enthusiasm  and

idealism  with which we were fired. Perhaps a  lot  of

unhappiness might have been avoided. It is not that we

would  not  have tried to do it, and I  think  it  was

right  that  we did. But our actions would  have  been

tempered with a great deal of circumspection as to the

way  in which one could slowly and gradually interlock

two very different ways of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the view of my colleagues and myself that the

elders  in  this community - and the problem  is  that

there are not very many such elders in the community -

can  make  a  positive  contribution  to  a  good  and

tolerant  government. I have mentioned one reason  why

the older generation may not be adequately represented

in  Parliament with the passage of time.  There  is  a

second  reason  why  many people  of  scholarship  and

distinction in their particular profession or vocation

are  reluctant or emotionally unfit to enter into  the

sharp  conflict of the open political arena. They  and

many people find it distasteful. It is not natural for

people  educated  and brought up in a  more  sheltered

atmosphere  to expose themselves, their public  stance

and  their private lives to open and sometimes vicious

political attack. My colleagues and I appreciate  this

very  much,  not  because  we  enjoy  these  political

attacks  but  because over a passage of time  we  have

developed  a  certain tolerance to all  this  constant

snipping   and   cudgelling.  But  we  are   extremely

conscious of the fact that it is not easy to  get  men

of  intellectual  qualities to join us  in  this  open

arena, because the heat and the dust is something they

find uncongenial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A President's Council, which really is what the

Council  of State will be, a kind of Privy Council  to

the   Queen,  and  so  an  advisory  council  for  the

President,  can  make a valuable contribution  to  the

mechanics  of  a  representative government,  provided

that  there are sufficient safeguards to see  that  no

sectional  or functional interest can be  peddled.  In

other  words,  nobody can get on a hobby-horse  either

for  life  or  for  a  specific  period  to  pursue  a

particular sectional interest, whether for gain or for

any other reason. Hence we differed profoundly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1290</b></font><br><br>



with the proposition that such a  meeting  of

the Council should be in public. If anybody challenges

the right of the representatives of the people to take

a particular course of action, then they must have the

courage  to  come out openly into the political  arena

and  denounce these policies. But if they  reserve  to

themselves  the right to advise caution or perhaps  to

take  a  middle course, without entering the political

arena, then this advice should not be given in public,

for  it  is  impossible for any elected government  to

accept  a  change  of its policies once  it  has  been

joined  in political debate. We envisage this  Council

of  State  to  be  more  than  just  a  scrutineer  of

prospective  legislation, if it consists  of  men  who

have  had experience of our community - and there  are

very few such men. As my colleagues can testify, every

time  a  senior appointment has to be made,  which  in

other parts of the world will bring forth long screeds

of  highly  qualified and highly  able  men  in  semi-retirement, we are scraping the bottom of the  barrel,

and  the  reason  is  obvious. All  the  men  in  high

professional, administrative, judicial  or  any  other

positions were from abroad, and when they retired they

went  abroad.  There were very few men who  understand

the  texture  and  the flavour of our society,  having

looked  after it in some important sphere of activity,

who  are  around  to  give us that knowledge  of  what

happened  under  certain  given  conditions,  of   the

possible  reactions, modes of behaviour,  patterns  of

conduct  of  the various sectors of our population.  A

retired Permanent Secretary who does not have to speak

his mind in public, but can quietly tell the President

in  his presence, or through the Chairman who will  be

the  Speaker of this House, what his experiences  were

with  regard  to similar circumstances,  will  make  a

valuable  contribution.  A  retired  Commissioner   of

Police  who had lived through several riots, not  just

between  gangsters and warring bands of  robbers,  can

make  a  valuable addition to the data upon  which  an

administration must base its decisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are unable to accept the recommendation that those

with political affiliations should be excluded, for  I

think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1291</b></font><br><br>



it  is often those with political affiliations who can

make  the  biggest  contribution  to  discussion;   if

nothing  else, from the folly and error of their  past

ways.  There is a lot to be learned, not just by  what

was  done right, but by what was done wrong. Again,  I

think  it is more likely that we get honest advice  in

private than in public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings us to the second role which I think the

Council of State can provide. It means, in effect,  if

there is a wise and sufficiently broad-enough range of

talent and expertise, that there is no single group  -

either functional, racial, linguistic, or religious  -

that  has  not got some access to the top institutions

of  power.  This, in itself, has a deep  psychological

assurance.  It  acts  more  by  the  fears  it   makes

unnecessary, than by any actual evil that is remedied.

The  very fact that there is almost no minority  group

in   Singapore  that  can  say  that  they   are   not

represented   by   someone  in   this   Constitutional Commission who understands some part of their life and practices  makes  its  findings  all  that  much  more valuable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to believe that such a group of men

representing accumulated experience, representing  the

various  professional and technical  institutions  who

are  important digits in the functioning of  a  modern

society - they could provide the kind of ballast which

a  very young Legislature may not necessarily have. I would urge my Members opposite - all are really on the

Government  side  -  to  think  sometimes   of   these

criticisms which they take very sensitively as  really

an expression of tribute in a back-handed way to them.

It  is all right provided there are certain checks and

balances  which modulate the whole and  so  everything

can  work.  But there must come a time when  the  same

checks and balances may no longer apply, and it is our

duty   to  create  a  situation  where,  even   if   a

composition of this Chamber were different, there  are

still  enough  checks  and  balances  to  ensure   the

continuance of tolerant and permissive policies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1292</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in the drafting of the duties of the

Council  of  State, part of the functions which  might

have  been  done  by  an  Ombudsman  or  Parliamentary

Commissioner will be taken up through this  particular

Council of State. In rejecting for the time being  the

innovation of a Parliamentary Commissioner  -  let  me

say  that  we  have not written off this  proposition.

Legislation  for  such an institution  has  just  been

attempted  in Britain in a very limited sort  of  way.

There  is  no possibility of any member of the  public

asking for a writ to be issued by the Commissioner for

a  matter  to be investigated. It is very limited  not

only in the initiative of the inquiry but also in  the

fields  where the inquiries can take place.  If  after

five  years  it  is found that we have a  sufficiently

high  degree of administration to be able to  take  on

the   added  burden  of  having  every  administrative

decision  scrutinised by some overlord, then  I  think

the position should be reviewed. It must be a position

which  we  would  try to attain. But  faced  with  the

realities of what we have, and the knowledge that very

often the whole machinery of government depends on the

capacity  of  two  dozen really  good  digits  in  the

administration, to put upon them this load is bound to

slow up the whole process of decision-making. If every

Commissioner  of Lands, every Housing Board  executive

who  allocates flats has at the back of his mind  when

he makes a decision the thought that the wisdom of his

decision  will  be called into question  and  all  the

paraphernalia  -  secret minutes passed  between  each

other of the whys and wherefores and who and what  for

-  can  be  regurgitated, it  is  bound  to  make  him

hesitate. "I am refusing accommodation in the  Geylang

Serai block of flats to Malays who have just had their

attap  huts burnt in Lorong 3." It is a decision  made

partly  by  the  Board  and partly  by  an  unofficial

committee  of M.P.s who feel that this creation  of  a

ghetto  atmosphere would be bad and inimical  for  our

own  society. If every such decision can  be  reopened

and it is said, "You have refused me a flat in Geylang

Serai, although I am a Malay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1293</b></font><br><br>



and  that is a Malay area" - then it is bound to  slow

up the process of decision-making.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying this in wanting to protect or

perpetuate  this  state of affairs. I  would  like  to

believe  that in the next 5 or 10 years more and  more

able  administrators  will  be  trained  to  man   the

institutions of the State. A position may  be  reached

one day when there is no decision taken anywhere along

the line which would be any different if they were  to

sit  back  and think "What would happen to my career."

There  is no desire to hide the political hand. I  say

quite openly of what has happened in Geylang Serai and

I am quite prepared to justify it politically, that it

is  wrong. They should be offered cheaper rent and  be

made   to  live  in  Tanjong  Rhu  or  Queenstown   or

elsewhere.  But if the officer who often has  to  take

this decision on broad policy directives, finds he may

blot his copybook because somebody has complained, and

he  was  found to have exercised his judgment unwisely

and  erroneously, it is bound to slow up the  process.

He  is bound in the nature of things to pass it up for

a  decision and ask for a directive, even on  specific

issues.  Therefore, I would like to reiterate that  we

have  not  rejected this. We have only said,  "Let  us

wait  and see." First, how does it work in its limited

form  elsewhere?  Second, in five  years  let  us  see

whether we have more able digits in our administration

to  be  able to take on this stringent test of knowing

that every decision affecting every single citizen can

be reopened for scrutiny.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission made several other recommendations

which  were not strictly within the terms of reference

of  the Commission, but since they have made them,  it

is right and proper that I should express our views on

this.  First,  the question of the Judges.  They  have

suggested, in fact, that we revert back to the  system

which  existed  - I think nowhere else  in  the  world

other  than in Singapore before it went into Malaysia.

That  was a standstill arrangement and I knew  how  it

came about because I participated in the deliberations

in London which reached that compromise



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1294</b></font><br><br>



proposal.  There was grave danger that whoever  became

the   government,  particularly   in   view   of   the

Malayanisation  of all the Judges  then  and  a  large

number of vacancies to be filled, would then be  in  a

position   to  pack  the  judiciary.  After  strenuous

argument, the points of views, depending upon who  was

going  to  form the next government, a compromise  was

worked  out  whereby  we allowed  the  Judges  amongst

themselves  to  decide  how  these  large  numbers  of

vacancies were to be filled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that system has been perpetuated in any

constitution    anywhere   else   in    the    British

Commonwealth. It would be not only derogatory  of  the

capacity  of  the Government to do what is  right  and

proper, but even more important, there would be a very

serious  risk of a very inbred judiciary.  People  are

what  they are, Mr Speaker, Sir. They have their good

points; they have their bad points. But we should  not

have  a  small group of about six or seven  Judges  to

decide who is to join their ranks from people for whom

they  must  have  positive  reactions,  either  likes,

dislikes,  admiration, annoyance. It is a  very  small

group  from which you can appoint Judges. 170  or  200

practising members of whom only about 30 or 40 both in

and  outside  private practice and in and outside  the

Government  are possible candidates.  It  will  be  an

unfair  test of human infallibility to endow  a  small

group  of men with these powers. Having run this  very

Catholic  system of the cadres - you  know,  the  Pope

appoints the Cardinals, the Cardinals together appoint

the  Pope - we are fully aware not only of the virtues

but also the vices of the system. I think it would not

be  in  the  wider interests of the administration  of

justice  or in the public interest. I can only express

the  hope that faith in the judicial system will never

be  diminished, and I am sure it will not, so long  as

we allow a review of the judicial processes that takes

place  here  in  some other tribunal  where  obviously

undue influence cannot be brought to bear. As long  as

governments are wise enough to leave alone the  rights

of  appeal  to  some superior body outside  Singapore,

then there must be a higher



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1295</b></font><br><br>



degree  of confidence in the integrity of our judicial

process.  This  is  most  important  because  so  many

contracts of a maritime nature with parties from  many

parts of the world being involved often have to choose

the  venue of the litigation. I see no credit  in  our

trying  to run a close circuit judicial system on  our

own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other proposition concerns that of property

rights.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  here  again  it  is  not

strictly  relevant to the terms of  reference.  But  I

think  it  was a result of the lawyers' English  legal

training  -  the sanctity of property is  one  of  the

tenets  of  English  laws. The whole  of  the  British

judicial  system outside the criminal law  rests  upon

the  concept of private property. Sir, whether we like

it or not, we have to accept the fact that not only  a

large  portion  of  all  this thinking  but  also  the

mechanics  of our economy is based on the  concept  of

property.   But  land  is  a  special   situation   in

Singapore.  If  we  are  swayed by  considerations  of

private  property, had we been swayed in the  past  by

these  considerations,  I  venture  to  suggest   that

representative government in Singapore today would not

have  been possible. In this Chamber in 1961 we rushed

through  the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act for  the

acquisition  of  fire sites; the Bukit  Ho  Swee  fire

having  just taken place and some 30,000 people having

had   their  homes  destroyed.  It  would  have   been

uneconomic and impossible to develop if we have had to

acquire  the property under the ordinary machinery  of

the  Land Acquisition Ordinance with a right of appeal

in  the  case  of every award contested, to  the  High

Court,  with  two assessors who are both  trained  and

accept  as part of their ethos the right and  sanctity

of   private  property.  This  becomes  all  the  more

compelling when vast sums of public revenue  is  being

spent on developing huge areas like Jurong, Toa Payoh,

Bedok. The whole of the Bedok reclamation scheme, from

Bedok  right  up to Tanjong Rhu, would not  have  been

possible  if the concept of private property  and  all

the  rules  and regulations that have been  elaborated

over hundreds of years were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1296</b></font><br><br>



complied with, for it must mean that if you deprive  a

man of a sea frontage, some assessment of his loss  in

monetary  terms must be made. A man wakes up  and  has

awakened  for the last 50 years with the  sea  breezes

blowing  in  through the window.  He  goes  off  on  a

holiday, comes back from Europe and America and  wakes

up  one morning - assuming he arrives late at night at

Paya  Lebar Airport - opens his windows and finds half

a  mile  of  rolling brown laterite. We hope  in  five

years  there  will be grass lands, playing  fields,  a

motor  express highway into the city. The compensation

that  would have to be paid that man for the  loss  of

his foreshore amenities - the foreshore belongs to the

Government in any case - but the loss of the amenities

that  goes  with the piece of land - would  have  been

prohibitive. It is not possible to develop  it.  These

developments  having taken place  and  a  new  express

highway  at enormous public cost having been  put  in,

all  the land and all the surrounding areas which  are

fed  by  this  highway must go up in price  inevitably

because  the city centre becomes that much closer.  It

is  unconscionable  for us as a  Government  to  spend

these vast sums of public revenue and in the end allow

a  very  small percentage of the population to profit.

Nobody  expects  this  Government  or  any  subsequent

government  to expropriate. The question is,  what  is

just  compensation? And to accept the  formula  as  it

stands:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No law shall provide for the compulsory acquisition

or  use of property except for a public purpose  or  a

purpose useful or beneficial to the public and  except

upon just terms.'



<br><br>must  mean endless litigation. This Chamber would then

be  unable to say that where your property has gone up

in   value   on  account  of  public  expenditure   on

development  around it, you will not profit  from  it.

Therefore, we propose to adopt the provisions  of  the

Indian  Constitution, which I think is most democratic

and  sound,  and say, in effect, that the  legislative

chamber  shall decide the principles upon  which  such

compensation shall be paid. The principle will be  one

on which we have acted so constantly in the past, that

nobody



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1297</b></font><br><br>



will gain, nobody will get a windfall on account

of  public expenditure. A fire has just taken place  a

few  days  ago  in,  I think, Syed Alwi  Road.  A  few

hundred people have been displaced. We had to  make  a

decision  a  few  hours ago that the  place  shall  be

acquired.  For we have, as a Government, to carry  the

burden  of  rehabilitating these few  hundred  people.

This is a social burden, and for us to leave this land

vacant  to  the landowner is to give him a  fortuitous

gain  which he cannot expect unless he is prepared  to

commit arson. I am quite sure that the crime of  arson

has been at an all-time low, partly because landowners

have a vested interest in not having arson take place.

But  in  the  long run, Mr Speaker, Sir, we  have  to

understand our problem in some perspective. There  are

two  particular recommendations which I think show the

signs  of  wishful  thinking. Apart from  wanting  the

Judges  to  appoint  themselves, they  also  want  the

President in his discretion to appoint the Council  of

State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President is what he is and is accepted by all

groups  because  he does not have to  make  unpleasant

decisions  of  who  shall get what and  who  shall  be

denied. If there is one piece of cake and it is  given

to  two persons when five want it, then three must  in

the nature of things be unhappy at not having been the

recipients.  If  you have, by way of illustration,  to

choose a representative to this Council of State from,

say,  a  galaxy of five able exponents of the  art  of

accounting and you only really need one to ensure that

that  particular profession is adequately represented,

and  the committee had met and short-listed the  five,

four  must  necessarily be disappointed. I  think  the

political  participants are much  better  equipped  to

carry these unpleasant decisions than a constitutional

Head of State. What it means is that you cannot by the

Constitution  protect yourself against a  bad  elected

Government. There can be no such protection. Your only

protection   in  the  long  run  must  be   a   highly

sophisticated and educated electorate which  will  see

that  no bad government, bad in the sense that  it  is

unable  to  tend  to the needs of the community,  will

ever be allowed to take office constitutionally.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1298</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Prime Minister, I am afraid

we  have reached the time limit under Standing Orders.

May  I obtain the general assent of the House for  you

to  continue? Do I have the general assent of  Members

for  the  Prime  Minister to  speak  beyond  the  time

permitted by Standing Orders?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> We could have all the checks and

balances we want within the Constitution. But  if  you

have   a  bad  elected  government,  a  whole  cabinet

consisting  of people properly elected and  determined

to  wreck  the country, there is nothing that  can  be

done  other  than  to  get such a  government  out  as

quickly as possible, if possible constitutionally,  if

not  some  other means must be found by the community.

It is as simple as that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read with interest recently about the personal

fortunes  and activities and the political  future  of

some American Congressman, how his popularity seems to

increase  with every revelation of public  misconduct.

There  is very little you can do if that is the  given

situation.  If the things an elected leader  does  are

the  things  which the people who support  him  hanker

secretly  to  do, if only they were given the  chance,

then  every disclosure of every such fulfilment  of  a

secret  ambition must raise him in the  estimation  of

his  followers.  I  think  we  discovered  that  in  a

slightly  different sort of way in our  own  political

experience  in  Singapore and elsewhere in  South-east

Asia. We go back to the fundamental problem of one man

one  vote.  Is that one man sufficiently possessed  of

enough  sense to make the right decision for  his  own

interest?  In other words, is he able to identify  and

discern   where  his  personal  and  his   community's

interests lie? Hence the importance again of  teaching

values  and  educating our children in  attitudes  and

standards  of  conduct,  community  reactions,   group

reactions  in  order to ensure their  continued  well-being.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to end on this note, Mr Speaker, Sir.

Nobody  really  fears  any  racial  or  religious   or

linguistic  persecution or suppression  in  Singapore,

not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1299</b></font><br><br>



at least for a decade. For these things take some time

to wear off. Even assuming a major catastrophe were to

take place with the political structure of power here,

it  would still take some time for emotional attitudes

on  the  ground  to be soured up and  to  change.  Our

problem  really is how do we, within the  ten  perhaps

slightly more, perhaps less years at our disposal, (1)

institutionalise  these checks and balances;  and  (2)

ensure that the next generation is able to carry  this

process  one step further'? If 10 years from  now,  in

the late 1970, a new group of leaders have emerged and

we  are  still making pious exhortations to  religious

tolerance  and the virtues of a multi-racial  society,

just  paying  lip-service to it, then we have  failed.

For  once  the  controlling  hand  of  authority  that

believes  in  these things is weakened, then  all  the

extremist tendencies which have been inhibited  whilst

there  was a strong hand will again come to the  fore.

We have seen what happens in other parts of the world.

Nobody attempts to deny the fact that there are  these

extremist  potentials.  They were  there.  In  Ceylon,

before  Mr  Bandaranaike became Prime Minister,  they

were  there.  In India, before the present  government

faced  this awkward and difficult problem of the  holy

men  and the cows as an election issue. The difference

was  that the grip at the helm was not so strong.  Our

problem  is  how to institutionalise and to perpetuate

this  strong  hand at the helm. It is not possible  to

reduplicate ourselves in the next generation.  But  it

is possible to deepen and ingrain certain values until

they become instinctive reflexes of our people. And it

is  the  consolidation of these  values  in  the  next

generation which must occupy a large part of our time.

When  a  minority no longer is conscious of  the  fact

that  it  is  a minority, that is the final  state  of

success. When a man walks into a job or walks into  an

office,  he is cheered or abused and he does not  feel

that  he  has  received  an ovation  or  been  rebuked

because  of his ethnic qualities. A group of cleansing

workers  went  on strike and they had to  be  punished

because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1300</b></font><br><br>



they  were  acting foolishly. Because the majority  of

the leaders were Indians, it was possible for them  to

go back to the ground and cover up the misdeeds of the

leaders  by saying, "Oh, what can you expect? This  is

an  awful  government because it really does not  have

much  time for Indians." So you see we are in  such  a

mess as long as that situation prevails and people can

be  deluded into believing, as indeed for all I  know,

large  numbers of cleansing workers may believe,  that

their  poor  leaders lost because they  were  Indians.

Perhaps  my task might have been easier if,  in  fact,

the first group of unionists had challenged the policy

that  the  economy  of  Singapore  is  paramount   and

sectional  interests come second. It would  have  been

better  if there had been a group of majority  Chinese

leadership  to  put it to the test.  Then  the  lesson

would  have been learnt. But to be able to admit these

things  openly  and to face them, is a much  healthier

situation than to pretend that they do not exist,  and

to  refer  to  anybody raising these  issues  or  even

mentioning these issues as dangerous communalists.  We

face  them, Mr Speaker, because they do happen.  They

do,  in  fact,  take  place and people  do,  in  fact,

believe  them.  I  can only say this,  that  if  these

things  are  true, then this must be  a  very  strange

government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, in fact, the policy of this Government is based

on considerations of race or language or culture, then

it is impossible to have in certain key positions, key

institutions of the State, people who share other than

the  majority view because the policy and the  secrets

of  the  implementation of that policy must be  known.

There  are certain institutions of power in the State,

and it is impossible completely to seal off or isolate

or  prevent  knowledge  of policies  which  are  being

pursued  and the known raison d'etre of these policies

from  the  President. He gets a copy of every  Cabinet

agenda,  the  papers, the decisions  and  the  reasons

therefor. In the Cabinet itself are ten people of very

different  views on ordinary matters or  non-political

interests. It is impossible to make decisions inimical

to any single minority



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1301</b></font><br><br>



group without their being known to the persons who  do

not  share the majority view or the majority affinity.

There  is a Chief Justice with six Judges who have  to

execute   and   implement   the   administration   and

interpretation  of  the laws. I do not  think  anybody

can, by any stretch of the imagination, say that there

is  any  ethnic group there which intends to  dominate

the  situation, although by the very nature  of  their

education,  quite  a number of our Judges  are  people

with  the  qualities  for  bisecting,  disecting   and

trisecting  words  and  phrases.  Then  there  is  the

Speaker   who   presides  over  so  many   pieces   of

legislation and there is the Attorney-General  in  his

Chambers  who  has  to  draft  them.  There   is   the

Commissioner of Police who has to implement the  laws.

There  are key officials in the Ministries of  Foreign

Affairs  and Finance who must know the basic policies.

What  we  want to do is to try to establish, until  we

reach  the point where we accept each other, the point

where  we are not conscious of the fact that  you  are

different, certain conventions whereby we ensure  that

everybody, no matter whether he be of a majority or  a

minority group, feels that he has some access  to  his

own  little community, some access to someone  in  the

seat of power where decisions have to be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the real contribution which can be made by a

Council  of  State.  It  is not something  which  will

window-dress  the  legislation  of  this  Chamber.  To

succeed  it  must be a real means of consultation  and

participation  in  the mechanics of  management  of  a

community  by  itself. So long as  there  are  certain

conventions  practised whereby there is always  enough

majority  and minority representation in the  exercise

of these positions of power, we should be able to ride

the  transition to a more consolidated and to  a  more

secure position in the next 10 or 15 years. But in the

long  term, let us be honest enough and admit that  if

either  because our policies are not effective  enough

internally  to  generate  and inculcate  these  multi-racial values, or because external forces have  had  a

deleterious  effect  on our own  community,  then  new

forms



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1302</b></font><br><br>



will  have  to  be  found to keep  this  very  diverse

community together.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, in urging the House to endorse the

Motion  in the name of the Minister for Law,  to  urge

our representatives here to bring this message down to

the people in the kampongs, in the crowded streets  of

the  town,  community centres or in  the  consultative

committees,  that whilst we operate on  the  basis  of

exhortation,  tolerance,  understanding,  forbearance,

and whilst we keep these sometimes competing interests

relatively  accommodated  one  to  the  other  through

constant  consultation at all the levels of  decision-making,  eventually  there is no way  other  than  the

inculcation  of loyalty to the country  which  we  all

consider our home. Either we believe that what we have

inherited  after 150 years of British commercialism  -

very  successful commercialism -- is worth  preserving

in  some  of  its  forms, or we do  not.  The  British

succeeded  in  holding this because they had  superior

power.  Anybody  who  acted contrary  to  the  general

interests of somebody else other than the British  was

held in line. And if you acted against the interest of

the British, then you would he smartly dealt with. But

here   is  a  situation  where  the  Government   must

remember,  as any such elected government  must,  that

its capacity to deal with a particular problem depends

upon  its capacity to carry its majority with it. This

is  a  slightly different kind of power  structure.  A

Governor can order that a highly popular mass movement

he  destroyed  and its leaders incarcerated,  and  his

career prospects are brightened by the expeditious way

in which he dealt with the dangerous situation. But  a

popularly  elected Cabinet that deals with a situation

in such a way that it has alienated the following, the

sympathy  and the support of the majority on whom  its

power rests, must either he a very bold or a foolhardy

government. And so the process of constant  repetition

on  the ground of where their long-term interests lie,

why  a  multi-racial  society.  This  process  may  he

unnecessary  for those who are capable of doing  their

own  thinking, but is very necessary for  those  whose

instincts  are to do what comes most comfortably.  And

to give way to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1303</b></font><br><br>



the  things  which the ground wants us  to  do,  often

foolishly, will be disastrous. Not to give way without

educating them may be equally disastrous to us. And so

the  fearful responsibility in this decade  to  ensure

that  the  next generation will not be faced with  the

same  arduous task that confronts us at every  turn  -

the  constant explanation and persuasion - because  of

which  alone  we  are able to do what  we  do;  sane,,

effective and sensible policies, and with the  support

of the population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge Members to remember this. Never mind all

the jibes about one-party government and dictatorship.

They  are not just necessarily jibes because they  can

be very real probabilities if we allow ourselves to be

lulled  into  a sense of complacency and  assume  that

this  could be the order of things for all  time.  But

the very fact that we are able consistently to carry a

large  section of the population with us despite  this

criticism,   surely  is  the  answer  that  democratic

government is possible provided at each step you carry

the  majority  of the people with you. It  is  not  by

accident  that  we  introduced  the  National  Service

(Amendment) Bill at the time a by-election  was  about

to take place. We gave the Opposition an issue to join

issue with us - certain basic fundamental premises. It

was  an  issue which barely 15 years ago caused little

young  boys and girls to riot. The police had then  to

use   considerable  force  with  a   great   deal   of

unhappiness  all round. A colonial government  had  no

intention  whatsoever other than to pass  the  law  to

teach  the  boys  and  girls,  particularly  from  the

Chinese  schools, how to handle weapons  in  order  to

make  life more miserable for that government  and  it

brought  about  that conflict. But now  a  by-election

took place, and this was not an issue. So long as  the

base  of our authority is one man one vote, it is  not

possible to go against the grain of the whole of  your

community   in  policies  which  do  not   win   their

acceptance.  As long as we remember this  and  we  are

courageous enough not only to do the right thing which

is  acceptable, but to do the right thing which is not

acceptable



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1304</b></font><br><br>



just yet, but to make sure that  the  ground

begins  to understand us when we take the next  phase,

then   we  will  be  able  to  bequeath  to  the  next

generation   of  leaders  a  healthier   and   sounder

situation.  By then it will not really matter  whether

or   not   we  have  this  symbolic  sharing  of   the

institutions of the State. As long as we are conscious

of  that  -  as indeed people are, particularly  after

their experiences in the last few years; how could you

be otherwise when you can be smacked down or killed in

a  riot  on the basis of your race? - then it  is  our

duty  to  take  note  of  that  and  to  provide  some

mechanism whereby an assurance is given and  felt  and

believed   that  they  are  consulted  and  they   are

participating in the management of their own society.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,    the   Government   has   accepted   the   main

recommendations of the Constitutional  Commission  for

the  sake  of establishing a multi-racial society  and

providing equality among all our citizens irrespective

of their racial and other differences.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>

<br><br>4.21 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government appointed a Commission to study the

constitutional provisions and to consider  what  basic

rights   should   be  entrenched  in   the   Singapore

Constitution. The Government's attitude  is  laudable.

Members  of the Constitutional Commission are  learned

and  eminent  personalities. As a  result,  they  have

produced this historic and weighty Report. Many of the

recommendations in this Report are very practical  and

very  much in keeping with our present situation.  The

Government intends to accept most of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore has a multi-lingual, multi-racial and

multi-religious  society  as  one  of   its   national

foundations.  The  success and  existence  of  such  a

country  depend  on the peaceful co-existence  of  the

various  races.  We can see many countries  around  us

experiencing riots and disturbances because  of  their

narrow communalistic outlook. We have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1305</b></font><br><br>



seen  how  minority  races  have  been  oppressed   by

majority  races,  as a result of which  the  countries

concerned  have  been split up. This aspect  has  also

been  pointed  out in the Report of the Constitutional

Commission.  It  has  recommended  that   no   special

privilege  should be accorded to any group  of  people

and  that  equal rights and basic rights, irrespective

of  race, colour or creed, should be written into  the

Constitution.  All people will have  the  same  rights

under  the  Constitution. For  instance,  everyone  is

equal  in  the  eyes of the law. There will  be  basic

rights  of  equality, rights of personal  liberty  and

equal  protection and other rights. Thus the  interest

and  rights of the minorities will be safeguarded.  In

addition,  the  right of education and  other  matters

will be safeguarded, as a result of which the minority

races will feel that they are not minorities but  part

and  parcel of one whole community. When we reach such

a  state - as the Prime Minister has said just  now  -

then  our  country  can be said to have  achieved  its

objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, democracy and the independence of the judiciary

are  the  outstanding  features  of  the  Republic  of

Singapore,  and  these  should  be  reflected  in  all

Government  and  independent institutions.  This  will

instil a sense of confidence in the people and it will

also  make them more determined to advocate democracy.

If they lose heart in the democratic system, they will

react unfavourably against the Government and this may

lead to the collapse of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitutional Commission has also advanced

constructive recommendations such as those relating to

provisions which will ensure the Constitution  as  the

supreme  law  in  the Republic of Singapore,  and  any

other  law which contradicts the Constitution will  be

invalid.  There  is also a provision relating  to  the

safeguards  to  be entrenched in the  Constitution  to

ensure   that   the  Constitution,  as   the   highest

authority,  is  not  altered at  random.  There  is  a

recommendation   setting   out   three   methods    of

entrenchment  by which amendments to the  Constitution

can be effected. The first method is that any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1306</b></font><br><br>



Bill   seeking   to  alter  the  Constitution   should

specifically  state so in the Bill. The second  method

is  that the Bill altering the Constitution should  be

approved  by a two-thirds majority of the  House.  The

Government has already accepted this second method  of

entrenchment.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta):</b> On a point of order.

Is there a quorum in the House?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In fact, there is a quorum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The third recommended

method  relates  to the operation of  a  machinery  to

enable the electorate to take part in decisions on any

important  and  urgent  matters  of  State.  This   is

characteristic  of  a democratic system.  I  urge  the

Government  also to accept the recommendation  of  the

third  method in the light of the reasons set  out  in

paragraph 78 of the Report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three new provisions recommended by the

Commission.  One is that the electorate  of  Singapore

should  be  given the opportunity to elect  their  own

government  by secret ballot periodically. The  serial

numbers  appearing  on  the ballot  papers  and  their

counter-foils and the law which relates to the form of

and  writing  on  the ballot paper, in  my  view,  are

incompatible  with the secrecy of the  vote.  So  such

legal  provisions  should be  abolished  so  that  the

electorate will not harbour any suspicion  or  have  a

wrong concept about the secrecy of the vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me touch on one very

outstanding recommendation of the Commission,  namely,

the  setting up of an Ombudsman. He is to shoulder the

responsibilities   of   checking   the    Government's

administration and to safeguard the interests  of  the

public,  to  see that their interests will not  suffer

because  of  any  faulty administration.  Though  this

system  originated  in Sweden,  it  is  still  in  its

experimental stage in some Commonwealth countries,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1307</b></font><br><br>



I feel that the Government should set up such a system

because   it   will  raise  the  efficiency   of   the

administration  of various Government departments  and

will also safeguard the interests of the common people

so  that such people need not have to seek redress  at

the  courts,  which is very expensive. At present  our

civil  service is a heritage of the British system.  I

am not criticising our present civil service. However,

in  actual fact, there are certain officials who still

have  the  colonial attitude and have still  not  been

inculcated with the new sense of duties and values and

the   correct  attitude  in  keeping  with   our   new

independent country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, if members of the public have any

complaints,   they  can  make  them  to  the   Central

Complaints Bureau. But this Bureau does not have  wide

powers.  Therefore,  if  any  complaint  against   any

department is brought before it, it is normally handed

over to the head of that very department to deal with.

Thus,  in the end, the complaints of the common people

will lead to no solution, and are of no avail. For all

these  reasons I feel that it is necessary to  set  up

the office of Ombudsman.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in principle, I support the

Government's views on this Report.



<br><br>4.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Constitutional  Commission was appointed  in  December

1965  with terms of reference the aim of which was  to

safeguard  the  rights and interests of minorities  in

the  Republic  of Singapore. After some eight  months'

study,  the  Commission presented its  Report  to  the

President  in August 1966, and this Report was  tabled

before Parliament on 21st December, 1966.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report is a unanimous Report. In it the

Commission  makes  three main recommendations,  and  I

shall today concern myself mainly with them. They  are

(1)  the  creation  of a Council  of  State;  (2)  the

establishment   of   the  office  of   Ombudsman   (or

Parliamentary Commissioner



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1308</b></font><br><br>



for   Administration);   and    (3)    the

entrenchment in the Constitution of certain provisions

affecting the fundamental rights of the citizen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall take the last recommendation first. This

relates  to  the  manner  of entrenchment  of  certain

provisions  in  the Constitution. The  Commission  has

recommended three methods of entrenchment,  and  these

three methods are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That any Bill altering the Constitution shall not

be  passed by Parliament until it is expressed  to  be

one for amendment of the Constitution and contains  no

other provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That any Bill altering certain provisions of the

Constitution shall not be passed by Parliament  unless

supported by a two-thirds majority vote in Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That any alteration to certain fundamental

provisions of the Constitution, notably those relating

to the right to elect the Government by secret ballot,

shall not be passed unless by a two-thirds majority of

all  elected Members of Parliament and by a two-thirds

majority  of all the people qualified to vote  at  the

referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the three methods recommended, the Government has

accepted the second method of entrenchment. No reasons

were given by the Government for the rejection of  the

first  and  third  methods of  entrenchment.  All  the

provisions  of  the  Constitution  recommended  to  he

entrenched   by  the  Commission  will  be  entrenched

according  to  the  second  method  -  the  Minister's

Statement  of  the  21st December,  1966.  The  second

method is legally effective and any provisions when so

entrenched  will  not be alterable except  by  a  two-thirds majority vote in Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first method recommended by the Commission is not

effective.  Its only function is to draw attention  to

any   Bill  seeking  to  alter  the  Constitution   by

labelling it as such.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third method is, in fact, the most effective

method of entrenchment. Any provision entrenched under

this    method    is    almost    irremovable.    This

irremovability, however, applies only to those who are

prepared to observe the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1309</b></font><br><br>



provisions  of the Constitution. It would not  prevent

those who are not prepared to operate the Constitution

within  the  democratic framework, from  resorting  to

extra-constitutional   means   and    scrapping    the

Constitution altogether.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now come to the first recommendation of the

Commission?  That  is the creation  of  a  non-elected

advisory  body to be called the Council of State.  The

Commission gave three reasons for this recommendation.

These reasons are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To focus the attention of the public on any

matters   originating   from  Parliament   which   may

adversely affect the interests of any minority group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To serve as an additional check on new

legislation, and this would be particularly useful  on

matters  of  great public importance  and  on  matters

which might affect the minority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To put forward, where it considers necessary in

the  public interest to do so, constructive and  well-informed  criticisms or amendment of measures proposed

in Parliament especially where there is no responsible

or effective Opposition in Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has accepted, in principle, the

creation of this body, but it does not agree with  the

Commission on the suggested composition and  functions

of  the  Council. Further, the Government has rejected

the  Commission's recommendation that debates  in  the

Council should be in public. The Government is of  the

view  that the Council's sittings should, instead, be

in  private  and the reason for this is - I  quote  the

Minister  (Vol. 25, No. 14 of Hansard, 21st  December,

1966, col. 1055) - the reason is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to ensure that discussions taking place are frank

and constructive and not held with an eye on the Press

or  publicity  or with a view to scoring  a  political

point.'



<br><br>The   first   point  I  want  to  make   about   this

recommendation for the creation of a Council of  State

is  that it is not legally effective in protecting the

minority rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rationale of this recommendation is that the

Council  should be able in its debates  to  focus  the

attention of the public on any matter originating from

Parliament which may adversely affect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1310</b></font><br><br>



the  interests of the minority group. The  reason  for

this  is  found  in  paragraph 16 of  the  Report.  By

rejecting  the  suggestion that the Council's  debates

should be in public, the Government has taken away the

very basis for the creation of such a body. The second

and  third reasons advanced by the Commission  in  the

creation  of the Council of State are, in my  opinion,

wrong   reasons.   The  second   reason   is   against

established democratic principles. The third reason is

based  on  factors  that  can only  be  considered  as

transient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take the third reason first. This is that we

have at present no responsible or effective Opposition

in  Parliament.  It is true that we have  not  had  an

Opposition for the last year and a half. But in  terms

of  a nation's constitutional development, a period of

a  year  and  a  half,  nay, 15  years,  can  only  be

considered as a transient phase. This is, therefore, a

transient phase in our political development.  Yet  it

is  on  this  very transient phase of our  development

that the Commission has now made recommendations which

will have lasting effects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next general elections are just round the corner.

They  must  he  held by September  1968.  No  one  can

predict  what will be the position after  the  general

elections. Are we to abolish the Council of  State  on

an Opposition Party being returned to Parliament then?

Or  are  we to leave it to carry on with the functions

now  prescribed  for  it  by the  Commission,  thereby

usurping  the  functions of the Opposition?  The  very

process of the Council discharging any function  which

should  be  within  the  exclusive  province   of   an

Opposition   in  Parliament  renders  the   Opposition

ineffective;  the  very  thing  which  the  Commission

assiduously seeks to overcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason prescribed by the Commission for

the  creation  of  the Council  of  State  is,  in  my

opinion,  against  established democratic  principles.

The  Commission envisages that the Council  should  be

able  -  and  I  quote  this from  paragraph  16,  Mr

Speaker, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to serve as an additional check on new legislation

and this would be particularly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1311</b></font><br><br>



useful  on matters of great public importance  and  on

matters which might affect the minorities.'



<br><br>Sir,  it  is  the  basic  principle  of  parliamentary

democracy   that   Parliament   should   be   supreme.

Parliament, it is said, can do anything except  change

a man into a woman and a woman into a man.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tang, I think this is a very

convenient point at which to suspend the sitting. I am

taking  the suspension a little earlier today. I  will

suspend the sitting now and resume the Chair at  half-past Five.



<br><br><div align="right"><i>Sitting accordingly suspended at</i></div>

<div align="right"><i>4.44 p.m, until 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<br><br><div align="center"><i>Sitting resumed at 5.30 p.m.</i></div>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just before the

suspension, I was saying that it is a basic  principle

of  parliamentary democracy that Parliament should  be

supreme  and  that  Parliament, it  is  said,  can  do

anything except change a man into a woman and a  woman

into  a  man.  So  it  ought  to  be.  Parliament   is

responsible  to  none but the electorate.  But  it  is

always  sensitive to public opinion, the influence  of

public  opinion  being exercised through  the  elected

Members   of  Parliament.  Any  check  on  Parliament,

therefore, should come from within Parliament and  not

from  outside  it. In proposing the setting  up  of  a

Council  of  State outside the framework of Parliament

to  check  on  any legislation proposed in Parliament,

the  Commission  is  recommending something  which  is

against   the   basic   principle   of   parliamentary

democracy. If it is said that the proposed Council  is

only  an  advisory body and is not meant to be legally

effective in checking the will of Parliament, then the

recommendation  of  the  Commission  becomes  a   huge

academic  exercise  from  which  nobody  benefits.  In

short,   this   particular   recommendation   of   the

Commission is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1312</b></font><br><br>



legally  effective  in  safeguarding  the  rights  and

interests  of  the  citizens. The  acceptance  by  the

Government of the principle of creating such  a  body,

in  my  opinion, is a mistake, a mistake  which  would

involve  the  spending of a tremendous amount  of  the

taxpayers'  money  without any  resultant  benefit  to

them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now say a few words on the composition of the

Council    of    State?    The   qualifications    and

disqualifications  for  membership  are  set  out   in

paragraph 59 of the Report. I want to comment only  on

paragraph  59, sub-paragraph (v) , item (a) . This  sub-paragraph reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(v) the disqualifications for membership shall be -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) membership of any political party at the time

of appointment;'.



<br><br>This  disqualification  will  discourage  people  from

joining  political parties and will act as a brake  on

the  recruitment  of  talent into  political  parties.

Members  of  Parliament are at our  present  political

development  necessarily members of political  parties

and  the  calibre of Members of Parliament depends  on

the  talent on which political parties can draw.  This

disqualification  will  put  a  dead   hand   on   the

recruitment  of  persons  and  will  not  improve  the

calibre  of  Members  of Parliament  about  which  the

Commission  seems  to complain. The Government's  idea

about  permanent membership, too, appears not to  have

been well thought out. With regard to this category of

membership, the Minister's Statement on 21st December,

1966, reads, and here again I quote. This is in Volume

25,  No. 14 of Hansard, col. 1055, towards the  bottom

of the page:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(i) Permanent members: This would consist of men of

distinction who will be chosen from those who  hold

or  have held high offices, e.g. Cabinet Ministers,

former  Chief  Ministers, the  Chief  Justice,  the

Speaker,   the  Chairman  of  the  Public   Service

Commission, Puisne Judges, the Attorney-General and

former Permanent Secretaries. There would be no age

limit;'.



<br><br>I cannot quarrel with former Cabinet Ministers or even

the  Chairman  of the Public Service Commission  being

members of the Council, but involving



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1313</b></font><br><br>



Judges   in  politics  may  be  something  which   any

democracy may want to avoid. I say this because it  is

not  quite  clear  whether only those  who  have  held

office  would be appointed to membership or those  who

are, in fact, currently holding these offices, because

reading  from the Report, it says here,"... from  those

who  hold or have held high offices". Furthermore,  it

is not clear from the Minister's Statement whether the

present   incumbents   of  the  posts   of   Permanent

Secretaries  or only retired ones are being  appointed

to   membership  of  the  Council.  If   the   present

incumbents  are  appointed, then  it  would  blur  the

distinction  between the Executive and the Legislature

and  will detract from the responsibility of the civil

servants   towards  the  Minister   and   weaken   the

Minister's  control  of the civil  servants.  If  only

retired   Permanent  Secretaries  are   appointed   to

membership,  then they may be too old  and  senile  to

discharge their responsibilities effectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, I have the feeling that the Commission

have  not  given  sufficiently  deep  thought  to  the

problem  of  the creation of a Council of State.  They

seem   to  be  influenced  by  a  basic  distrust   of

democratically elected representatives of the  people.

Hence, their recommendation of an appointed Council of

State without considering the wide implications of its

creation  in  the democratic framework. I  am  of  the

opinion  that the appointment of such a Council  would

not  remedy the particular political situation we  are

facing  at  present.  Its remedy lies,  in  the  final

analysis, in an educated and enlightened electorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a temporary measure to meet the situation, perhaps

the Government may consider the following proposals:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Appoint Ministerial committees composing of

experts to advise the Ministers in the initiating  and

framing of legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Refer as many Bills as possible to Select

Committees, thereby giving affected outside  interests

an opportunity to make representations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Lengthen the period between the First Reading and

Second Reading of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>



any Bill so as to give Members of Parliament more time

to  study  them. In this connection, to  refrain  from

introducing Bills on a Certificate of Urgency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I now come to the second

recommendation  of the Commission,  and  that  is  the

creation  of  the office of Ombudsman? The  Government

has  rejected the Commission's recommendation  without

giving  any  substantial reasons  for  doing  so.  The

Government's  only  reason is that  the  time  is  not

opportune and that the introduction of such an  office

should be deferred until the results of the experiment

in  New  Zealand and elsewhere are known. Here  may  I

refer  to  the reason given by the Prime  Minister  in

this Chamber this very afternoon? The Prime Minister's

reason appears to disclose a lack of confidence in our

civil service. The Prime Minister, having said what he

did  say  in this Chamber, I think the efficiency  and

fairness  of our civil service can only be  vindicated

by the establishment of such an office. I am afraid  I

do  not consider the reason given by the Minister  for

Law  and National Development and the reason given  by

the  Prime Minister good reasons. New Zealand has  had

an Ombudsman since 1962 and by all accounts the office

is  a  great  success. Here, Mr Speaker, Sir,  may  I

quote  part  of  a  speech by  the  Honourable  J.  R.

Marshall,  the Deputy Prime Minister and  Minister  of

Industry and Commerce and Minister of Oversea Trade of

New  Zealand,  to the 11th Commonwealth  Parliamentary

Conference, at page 213 in the Conference  Report?  He

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On the basis of three years' operation of the office

[meaning  the office of Ombudsman], we in New  Zealand

can   commend   the   institution   to   the   serious

consideration  of  other members of the  Commonwealth.

But this commendation is subject to some reservations.

In  the  first place, we do not recommend  our  system

except  in  our  own  circumstances.  For  others   we

recommend    only   the   idea   of   an    Ombudsman.

Constitutional development of this kind must grow  out

of the needs and experiences of each country.'



<br><br>I  am  of  the  opinion that we  are  in  a  stage  of

constitutional  and  political  development  when  the

establishment  of  such an office  would  benefit  our

administration. The office of Ombudsman



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>



safeguards the citizens against two ills which are the

result  of the growth of modern government. These  two

ills are, to put them shortly, (1) misguided decisions

by  authorities  in the exercise of their  discretion;

(2)  maladministration.  As Dicey,  one  of  Britain's

great  constitutional lawyers, has said, and I  quote:

"Wherever  there  is discretion,  there  is  room  for

arbitrariness." It is quite possible nowadays  for  an

individual's rights to be accidentally crushed by  the

vast government administrative machinery. Hundreds and

thousands of administrative decisions are made by  our

Government departments each year affecting the life of

every citizen. Some of these decisions are bound to be

arbitrary   and   unjustified.   Under   our   present

institution  of government, there is no easy  way  for

the  ordinary citizen to gain redress. Courts are  not

quite  an  appropriate forum for the investigation  of

these complaints. Quite apart from the fact that  they

are expensive and slow, the courts cannot go behind  a

Minister's  decision and exercise their discretion  on

his  behalf. Members of Parliament are ineffective  in

that  they  cannot have access to departmental  files.

The  same reason goes for the Press. The advantage  of

the Ombudsman is that, unlike M.P.s and the Press,  he

is  politically neutral and has the power to call  for

departmental  files to get at the full  facts  of  the

case. Unlike the courts, he does not require elaborate

court  procedure and no fee, or at most only  a  small

fee,  is charged for his services, so that his  action

is cheaper and faster when compared with the review by

the  courts.  The creation of the office of  Ombudsman

not   only  would  safeguard  our  citizens  from  the

arbitrary  decisions of those in  authority  and  from

maladministration,  but  would   also   serve   as   a

protective  shield  for  the civil  service.  It  will

protect   them   from   unfounded   allegations    and

accusations. This will further increase the confidence

of  the  public in our administration. The  fact  that

there  is a difference in the development of Singapore

and the development of the countries at present having

an Ombudsman is, as I see it,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>



no  argument. All studies so far show the desirability

of   introducing  such  an  institution  and   it   is

significant  that almost all the countries  that  have

conducted  studies  into this office  now  accept  the

principle of having such an office. The latest example

is the United Kingdom. We have an efficient and honest

civil  service. We are rightly proud of it. We  should

not,  however, be content. The creation of the  office

of  Ombudsman will be a step forward. It  would  be  a

step  towards  greater efficiency and incorruptibility

of  our  civil service. Its introduction will  be  the

first  in  this  region and it will be  the  pride  of

Singapore.



<br><br>5.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the

first place, I wish to congratulate the Government  on

appointing  a  Commission to look into the  rights  of

minorities  in our Republic. The impartial  Commission

has done a wonderful job, as a result of which we have

the Report of the Constitutional Commission, 1966,  in

front  of  us now. The Government, in accordance  with

its declared policy of multi-racial, multi-lingual and

multi-religious Singapore, has, in fact, accepted most

of   the  recommendations  of  the  Commission.  While

agreeing in principle with other recommendations, only

a few of the recommendations are not acceptable to the

Government.  It  is  heartening  to  note   that   the

Government  is  willing  to accept  in  principle  the

provisions regarding equal treatment of every  citizen

in   the  eyes  of  the  law  as  recommended  by  the

Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I need a clarification from the Minister

for  Law  and National Development on one point  only,

i.e, land acquisition. We are a Republic with an area

of about 225 square miles, and not all the land in our

island  can be used for development. With the increase

of  population and social amenities, we need more land

for  housing,  roads,  recreational  facilities,  etc.

Because   of   shortage  of  land,  we  are   building

underground  and multi-storey car parks. But,  at  the

same  time,  we  see quite a number of plots  of  land

belonging to private



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>



individuals not being put to proper use. In  order  to

make  use  of  such lands, the Government  has  to  do

something;  and for that I agree it should  have  some

sort  of constitutional power. Having this in mind,  I

welcome  the  Government's intention  to  include  the

terms of Article 13 of the Constitution of Malaysia in

a  modified form. The Commission has recommended  that

no  property will be acquired except upon just  terms.

The  Government  has stated that it would  accept  the

recommendation  but  without  the  words  "upon   just

terms". As a layman who does not know much about  law,

I  fear  that  the  removal  of  these  words  may  be

construed  by some people to mean that no compensation

will  be  paid  at  all  for  land  acquired  by   the

Government. But I am sure that it is not the intention

of   the  Government  not  to  pay  any  compensation.

Definitely  the Government will pay compensation.  But

whether  the affected party thinks the amount paid  by

the  Government  is  adequate or not  is  a  different

matter. Sir, I shall be thankful to the Minister if he

can  make it clear, in the article in the Constitution

dealing with land acquisition, that compensation  will

be  paid.  Such  a modification will ensure  that  the

Government will pay compensation for land acquired and

that  the property owner will not be made to give  his

land free.



<br><br>5.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Members

will  recall  that  once Sir Winston  Churchill  said,

"Democracy is the worst system of government,  but  it

is  the  only  one that works." We are  gathered  here

today to examine the basic principles and also to come

to  some form of compromise on which to work out a new

Constitution for our young Republic. This  reminds  us

of  what  John  Russell said about  constitutions.  He

said, "Every political constitution in which different

bodies share political power is only enabled to  exist

by  the forbearance of those among whom this power  is

distributed." One of the conscious fears of the people

of  Singapore is the question of whether  or  not  the

basic rights



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>



of  the minority - in short, the basic rights of  human

beings  -  can  be  entrenched in the Constitution  in

order  to  provide a form of safeguard for  them.  And

among  the  suggestions  and  recommendations  of  the

Constitutional  Commission  were  the  office  of  the

Ombudsman and the Council of State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in as much as we understand and appreciate the

functions  and  the good work that an Ombudsman  or  a

Parliamentary  Commissioner can do and can  contribute

to  this new Republic, I think one cannot, at the same

time,  automatically conclude that that  is  the  best

form,  having regard to the existing social  structure

and  the  population  at  large.  The  office  of  the

Ombudsman automatically presupposes a very high degree

of  public administration and, of course, a highly and

extremely sophisticated population. It is not  for  us

to say that our population is not sophisticated or our

public  administration is not up to the standard  that

would  have  been expected perhaps by the  Member  for

Choa Chu Kang. But it would be naive for us to believe

that  we  have  come  to that kind  of  standard  when

compared  to the Western world for the adoption  of  a

Parliamentary  Commissioner.  Parliamentary  democracy

and  franchise  in voting is indeed new  in  Singapore

and, in fact, in Asia. I do not believe that ten years

or  maybe even 20 years of education on voting and the

value  of representative government can really  defeat

the  prejudice of the people of Asia, who in the known

history  of  4,000  years, have  not  known  a  single

instance  in  which a government was  put  into  power

through  voting.  Sir,  we  are  not  dismissing   the

recommendation for the establishment or creation of an

Ombudsman  for  Singapore. But if you are  to  examine

this  office, I would say it came into being only very

recently.  I  mean  the  known parliamentary  history,

particularly  after  the  industrial  revolution.  The

first  known  case of the appointment of an  Ombudsman

was in 1809. Is that correct, Mr Tang?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> That is correct, but that is not

recent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Well, when you compare human

history  of so many thousands of years. 200 years  can

be  regarded  as very recent. In 1809,  in  Sweden,  a

Parliamentary Commissioner of Justice - and  in  their

term,  it  was  known as the Justitieombudsman  -  was

appointed.  It  is only in 1915 that Sweden  appointed

another  form of Parliamentary Commissioner  known  as

the  Commissioner of Military Administration --and  in

their term, they call it the Militieombudsman. Denmark

first thought of the idea after the war in 1946.  That

can  be very recent and it was not until 1953 that the

recommendation of the Constitutional Committee of 1946

was  incorporated in the Constitution for Denmark.  It

was   not   until  1955  in  March  when   the   first

Parliamentary Commissioner for Denmark was  appointed.

Finland had its Parliamentary Commissioner in 1919. In

New  Zealand,  the  National  Party  put  forward  the

establishment of a Parliamentary Commissioner  in  its

election campaign in 1960. It was only two years later

that  the  Parliamentary Commissioner  was  appointed.

Sir, I have listed out all these just to show that not

only  the  office  of the Ombudsman is  novel  in  the

Commonwealth, but in general it is still  a  very  new

idea  provided the Member for Choa Chu Kang can accept

that 1809 is recent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Ombudsman is a man of high integrity and

high administrative ability, and as the Prime Minister

had said earlier, you almost have to scrape the bottom

of the barrel to look for a suitable candidate to fill

a  high position Indeed it is difficult to secure  the

services  of a man of that calibre for the  office  of

Ombudsman.  The  Member for Choa  Chu  Kang  - I  must

congratulate him on doing considerable research -  has

said  that recently the British Government has adopted

the  idea of a Parliamentary Commissioner. But he  has

deliberately or otherwise omitted to inform the  House

of   the  recommendation  of  the  committee  on  this

particular question. Mr Speaker. Sir, I am  referring

to  the  Report  by  Justice,  "The  Citizen  and  the

Administration" - you have got it there?  [Asking  Mr

Tang See Chim]



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I do not have it, Mr Fong. When you

ask,  "You have got it there?", you mean, have  I  got

it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I was referring to the Member for

Choa Chu Kang, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Committee comprised Sir John Whyatt - he was the

Director  of  Research and formerly Chief  Justice  of

Singapore - the Chairman was Mr Norman S. Marsch; the

members  were Sir Sydney Caine and Dr H. W. R.  Wade.

All of them are men of eminence. In the recommendation

of this Committee contained in page 79 of this Report,

I  quote - Sir, it is a fairly long one but I hope the

House will bear with me on this - paragraph 166:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Our conclusion regarding complaints of

maladministration  is  that  Parliament  is  and  must

remain   the   most   important  channel   by   making

representations to the Executive about grievances.'



<br><br>It  did  not  say  the Parliamentary Commissioner  but

Parliament must remain the most important channel.  It

goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We think the existing Parliamentary procedures, in

particular  the Parliamentary Question  procedure  and

the  Adjournment Debates, provide a valuable means for

dealing with complaints of maladministration raised by

Members  of  Parliament but that they  would  be  more

effective if they were supplemented by machinery which

would enable such complaints to be investigated by  an

impartial  authority if the Member  requested  it.  We

have  therefore proposed that an officer, to be called

the  Parliamentary  Commissioner  (or  by  some  other

suitable title), with a status similar to that of  the

Comptroller and Auditor-General, should be  appointed,

and  subject to certain conditions, should investigate

complaints  of  maladministration  against  Government

Departments received from Members of Parliament.'.



<br><br>Sir,  if we carry the argument of the Member for  Choa

Chu  Kang further, then this recommendation itself  is

not conclusive, because it states that only complaints

received   from  Members  of  Parliament   should   be

investigated  and,  of course, it  suggests  that  the

complaints  should be supplemented by other  machinery

if  and  when  a  Member  of  Parliament  requests  an

investigation into a certain matter. We  already  have

that machinery in Singapore which has been referred to

so often.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> It is a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Parliamentary Secretary prepared

to give way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> May I thank the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Culture through you, Mr

Speaker?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has accused me of deliberately or otherwise not

quoting   to   this   House   the   conclusions    and

recommendations of A Report by Justice  which  I  have

here. I must thank him for his quotation to the House,

because  it does, in fact, support my contention  that

the  office  of  Ombudsman should  be  established  in

Singapore. May I clarify? He has said that ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Tang, I think you are going beyond

the bounds of a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I will clarify now.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point I am making is this. When any

quotation  is  made, selection is necessary,  and  for

every passage you select, I am sure that Mr Fong  and

other  Members who do not want an Ombudsman can  quote

passages of equal cogency. Please make your point very

short.  Anything  else will amount to  your  having  a

right to speak a second time. This, I am loath to give

you.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I am sorry, Mr Speaker, Sir,I

want  to  correct  the  Parliamentary  Secretary.  The

machinery recommended by Justice is the very office of

Ombudsman.   He  has  said  that  the   machinery   to

supplement  a  Member's right is  not  Ombudsman,  but

according  to  the  very passage he  has  quoted,  the

machinery that this Report recommends is, in fact, the

very establishment of the office of Ombudsman.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, I was coming to that before I

was interrupted by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>



Member for Choa Chu Kang. I said that we already  have

that  machinery in Singapore which has so  often  been

referred to by my colleagues, and that is the  Central

Complaints   Bureau.  But  we   do   not   require   a

Parliamentary   Commissioner  to  head   the   Central

Complaints Bureau. We have a Director there,  and  the

results  of investigations by this Bureau have  proved

to  be  effective  and  honest  without  any  fear  of

intimidation from any quarter. Sir, I am  inclined  to

think  that  the Central Complaints Bureau serves  the

same  purpose  as the Parliamentary Commissioner.  But

the difference is that A Report by Justice states that

the   machinery   can  "be  called  the  Parliamentary

Commissioner  (or by some other suitable title)",  but

we  call  it the Central Complaints Bureau.  Sir,  the

British Constitutional Commission was appointed  as  a

result of the Prime Minister's speech in November 1959

on  the question of looking into the appointment of an

Ombudsman. The period 1959 to 1967, by any stretch  of

the  imagination, can be regarded as recent.  Even  in

the  Report, they have not altogether recommended that

the   holder   of  the  office  of  the  Parliamentary

Commissioner must be appointed, and they have not made

any  firm  recommendation as to whether it  should  be

termed "Parliamentary Commissioner" or "Ombudsman". We

have  that  machinery. In fact, it is  operating  very

smoothly in Singapore. Sir, I do not believe that  any

citizen  in  Singapore  cannot  seek  redress  of  his

grievances. After all, a citizen can seek  redress  in

court,  and according to the Hierarchy of the judicial

system - the House of Lords, the Privy Council or  the

Judicial  Committee, the Court of Appeal, the  Supreme

Court  and the Magistrate's Court - he can go  through

all these channels.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> It is expensive.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> We can perhaps reduce the

expenses,  if  the Member for Choa  Chu  Kang  can  be

generous enough!



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Tang, the Parliamentary

Secretary  listened to you with courtesy. If  we  have

interruptions on a controversial issue like  this,  we

may take a very long time. Mr Fong.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> After all, any Minister in the

Cabinet  of the Republic of Singapore may  sue  or  be

sued.  If  any individual citizen thinks that  he  has

been  victimised, or any decision by the Cabinet or  a

Minister is contrary to the basic rights of a  citizen

which  the  Minister  for  Law  has  stated  will   be

entrenched in the Constitution, he can seek redress in

court.  As  the Prime Minister has said, we  have  not

dismissed the idea altogether. All he has said is that

the  Ombudsman is of very recent history and  that  we

had  better wait and see, and perhaps we could benefit

from the mistakes or the good work of the Ombudsman in

other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come to the Council of State, Mr Speaker. It has

been said that the Council of State is able to rectify

any   legislation  made  which  infringes   upon   the

individual rights of a citizen. Sir, as I see it, with

a  Council of State, Singapore will he bicameral. Sir,

in  a  small newly independent country like Singapore.

we  cannot afford the luxury of a two-House system. We

cannot  afford to have another Upper Chamber in  order

to  provide  a  kind of back-door for those  political

"rejects"  to  obtain admission to this  Upper  House.

Then again, if we have an Upper House, we will have to

consider  whether they are to he elected or appointed.

If  they  are  to be appointed or by virtue  of  their

position they may serve in the Upper Chamber, then any

legislation made in the Lower House can be defeated or

vetoed  by the Upper House. This is against  the  very

principle of representative government; that is,  they

cannot  veto  or defeat any legislation of  the  Lower

House  which  is  elected by popular  vote.  The  U.S.

Senate,  for example, is a very powerful body  because

all Senators are elected, but our Council of State  is

somewhere  between  the  two-House  system.  It   will

definitely serve a purpose. As the Prime Minister  has

said  earlier, the population of Singapore is  getting

younger  and  younger, and in the  next  five  or  ten

years, two-thirds of the population will be below  the

age   of  35.  Even  in  the  United  Kingdom,   where

considerable  doubts  have  been  raised   about   the

desirability and necessity of the continued  existence

of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>



House  of  Lords,  they  have found  it  difficult  to

dispense with it because a separate body, advisory  or

otherwise,  would  still  be required  to  assist  the

machinery of State. The Council of State is indeed the

very  appropriate  answer, having due  regard  to  the

situation  in  Singapore. I would rather  prefer  that

members  of the Council of State should have political

affiliations,  because  they will  be  able  to  judge

matters  in wider perspective, as they have  a  proper

understanding  of  the  social structure  of  society,

rather  than  those who represent  a  religious  or  a

minority group. I am not doubting the ability  of  the

prospective  members of the Council of State,  but  if

one  were to represent a religious or a racial  group,

he is bound to be pressurised and he would not be able

to  examine any legislation in all its aspects.  So  a

man   with   political  affiliations   and   political

sophistication  is  better  equipped  to  sit  in  the

Council  of  State than the man who  serves  only  the

purpose  of a small group of people and who  fails  to

weigh  the  implications  of any  legislation  to  the

society at large. But there is a fear that members  of

this  Council  may  misuse their  position  for  their

political  ends. I cannot agree that  the  Council  of

State  should  sit in public. After all,  its  members

will not be elected. Their comments will only be in an

advisory  capacity and we will, of course, take  their

advice  into account, but they should not be  made  so

powerful as to defeat the aims of the Government which

is  elected by popular vote. They will serve merely as

Elders in the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this connection, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

associate myself with the sentiments expressed by  the

Minister for Law. One compromise might appear to be -

I  hope perhaps to the satisfaction of the Member  for

Choa  Chu  Kang - for us to streamline or reconsider

the functions and portfolios of the Central Complaints

Bureau  and  to increase the responsibilities  of  the

Director so that he can have slightly more power  than

he now has.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I propose this to the Minister for Law, and I

hope he will consider seriously extending the scope of

the functions of the Central Complaints Bureau.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>



Perhaps  the  Member for Choa Chu  Kang  may  wish  to

contribute more ideas to the Minister when he  accepts

my proposal.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first I would like to deal

with   the   recommendations  of  the   Constitutional

Commission  on  minority rights that an  Ombudsman  be

appointed. I wish also later to deal with the question

of  the special position and rights of minorities with

particular reference to the Malays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier in the afternoon, in addition to the reasons

given by the Prime Minister for not appointing such  a

Parliamentary Commissioner today in Singapore, I would

like  to give two other reasons why the necessity  has

not really arisen for such appointment. Firstly, as  a

unitary  Republic,  we  do not  have  those  conflicts

between State and Federal Government authorities which

may exist in a Federation, which possibly exist in the

Federation  like  the Federation of Malaysia.  On  the

other hand, in a unitary State like Singapore, we have

a  central  forum where grievances can  be  aired  and

where  Ministers  have to answer for  all  matters  of

public  administration;  matters  going  down  to  the

minutest  detail, as you know, Sir, have been  brought

up  to  the  Legislature. Secondly, as a small  Island

Republic  with  only an area of 225 square  miles  and

where  road  transport, among other things,  is  good,

every  citizen has easy access to persons in authority

for the speedy redress of grievances. Unlike



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>



New Zealand, the United Kingdom, or even Malaysia,  we

are a small and concentrated community and traditional

methods  for  the  redress of grievances  in  a  small

island like our Island Republic have always been found

to  be  adequate  and,  in fact, are  still  adequate.

Perhaps in five years' time development may show  that

these  methods are not adequate. That we do  not  know

now.  If  so,  if  they prove to be inadequate  later,

changes  can and will be made and we can then  benefit

from  the full experience of New Zealand and the  more

recent experience of the United Kingdom and other such

countries  in the Commonwealth near or far  away  from

us,  who may appear to beat us to the gun and steal  a

march. Mr Speaker, Sir ---
