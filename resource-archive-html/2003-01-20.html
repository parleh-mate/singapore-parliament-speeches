<div align="center"><b>RSS COURAGEOUS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Collision with ANL Indonesia)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Ong Chit Chung</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister and Minister for Defence (a) what are the causes

of  the  collision  between RSS Courageous  and  merchant

vessel  ANL  Indonesia and (b) whether follow-up  actions

are being taken to prevent such incidents in the future.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

and  Minister for Defence (a) if he will provide a status

update of the recent collision between RSS Courageous and

ANL  Indonesia;  (b)  what measures are  being  taken  to

assist the family members of the deceased, especially  on

a  longer  term basis; and (c) how will the  Republic  of

Singapore Navy ensure that this accident will not leave a

psychological scar on existing navy personnel and  impact

the recruitment of potential navy recruits.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister and Minister for Defence if he will explain  how

the collision between the naval vessel RSS Courageous and

the  container vessel ANL Indonesia occurred in Singapore

<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence (Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your

permission,  I will take the three questions  by  Dr  Ong

together.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, the collision between the

RSS Courageous and the merchant ship ANL Indonesia was  a

most tragic event for the Navy, the SAF and Singapore. On

behalf  of the Singapore Government, I offer our  deepest

condolences to the families of 1SG Seah Ai Leng, 1SG Heng

Sock Ling, 2SG Chua Bee Lin and CPL Goh Hui Ling.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1997</b></font><br><br>



This  has  been a very difficult time for their  families

and we share in their grief and sorrow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be expected that Singaporeans want to know

what  happened  that night and what caused the  accident.

The  investigation by the Maritime and Port Authority  of

Singapore  is  ongoing.  MINDEF's  own  Higher  Board  of

Inquiry is still in the process of putting up its report.

It  would not be appropriate for me to give a full public

account at this point. But I will give Members some facts

of the situation leading up to the collision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RSS Courageous, an Anti-Submarine Warfare Patrol

Vessel,  was conducting a regular operational  patrol  in

Singapore territorial waters. This is part of the  Navy's

mission of safeguarding our territorial sovereignty.  RSS

Courageous was in the waters off Pedra Branca. There  has

been  a spate of violations of our territorial waters  at

Pedra  Branca  by foreign state vessels recently.   There

were  a number of violations in the two weeks before  the

incident, and there have been several since then.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the night of the collision, ANL Indonesia was

heading  out of the Singapore Straits towards  the  South

China  Sea.   RSS Courageous was sailing in the  opposite

direction.  The  two vessels were headed in  the  general

direction towards each other. RSS Courageous had detected

ANL  Indonesia on radar. ANL Indonesia was also  visually

sighted  by  the  duty  watch  personnel  on  board   RSS

Courageous.  The  two vessels subsequently  came  into  a

close  quarter situation, and both took action to try  to

avoid  a collision. But unfortunately the collision  took

place.  ANL Indonesia rammed into the right rear  section

of  RSS  Courageous and a portion of the tail end of  the

Patrol Vessel was sheared off. This portion included  the

aft  mess, where four servicewomen who were off  duty  at

the time were resting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA)

is  carrying  out an independent investigation  into  the

incident,  and  MINDEF  has given  MPA  our  fullest  cooperation in this investigation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1998</b></font><br><br>



The Commanding Officer and crew members of RSS Courageous

have been interviewed by MPA. MPA expects to complete its

full  investigation by the end of the month and will make

known its findings in due course. Separately, MINDEF  has

convened  a  Higher  Board of Inquiry to  determine  what

happened on the part of RSS Courageous. Until the various

investigations are completed, we do not have  a  complete

picture  of the events that happened that night. At  this

juncture, it would not be appropriate for us to speculate

on  how  and why the collision happened, or to  apportion

responsibility for the collision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reassure the House that MINDEF takes

a  very  serious view of this incident and we  will  take

close  heed of the findings of the inquiries and  rectify

any  problems  that are identified. In the meantime,  the

RSN  has  taken immediate steps to reinforce the existing

emphasis  on  safety  and professional  training.  It  is

increasing  checks on shipboard practices and operational

training,  and  conducting  a  thorough  review  of   its

procedures and processes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety has always been a matter of high priority for

the  SAF.  There are inherent risks involved in  military

activity,  and we take every precaution to mitigate  such

risks  with intensive and comprehensive training  of  our

people  and  a  thorough system for risk  management.  We

cannot  entirely rule out accidents no matter how  safety

conscious  we  may  be, because other  elements  such  as

errors  of  judgement and mechanical  failures  sometimes

come into play. Whatever the cause of the tragic accident

involving  RSS Courageous, the SAF will use the  findings

to  make  further improvements so that we further  reduce

the risk of another accident.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can be proud of the way the crew of RSS

Courageous  responded in the extreme circumstances  after

the  collision  and the way the whole Navy has  responded

since  then. It underscores the capability, resolve,  and

professionalism of the RSN, and its esprit de  corps.  In

the face of difficult sea conditions, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1999</b></font><br><br>



Commanding  Officer  and  crew of  Courageous  fought  to

stabilise  their severely damaged ship, while tending  to

injured  crewmates  and  searching  for  those  who  were

missing. They displayed their mettle in the face of grave

adversity  and professionally and resolutely carried  out

what they were trained to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A search and rescue operation was launched

immediately   after  the  collision.  In  the   immediate

aftermath  of  the  collision,  the  Police  Coast  Guard

provided critical assistance. Over a period of ten  days,

the  RSN  and  RSAF conducted an extensive and  intensive

search   and  rescue  operation.  We  received   valuable

assistance   from   the  Indonesian  armed   forces.   In

coordinating  the  search and rescue operation,  the  RSN

also  sought the assistance of the Malaysian armed forces

for the search of the Johor coastal areas as we wanted to

cover   every  possibility.  We  deeply  appreciate   the

assistance  and  co-operation our neighbouring  countries

extended  to  our Search and Rescue operation.  I  should

also  note here the dedicated efforts of the salvage crew

in  their attempts to recover the sheared-off portion  of

RSS Courageous under adverse monsoon conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know how difficult this must be for the families

who  have  lost their loved ones and we are deeply  sorry

for  their  loss. After the incident, the  RSN  has  been

keeping  in  close touch with the families to  give  them

support  and provide assistance. Professional counsellors

have  also  been  helping  them  through  this  difficult

period.  MINDEF  will continue to provide  the  necessary

support to the families of the four servicewomen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has certainly been a difficult period for the

RSN  and  the  SAF.  But it is also in  such  moments  of

adversity  that  the real quality and  character  of  the

organisation and its people shine through. The RSN  plays

a   vital   role   in  protecting  the  sovereignty   and

territorial  integrity of Singapore's waters.  We  cannot

shy away from our responsibilities in the face of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2000</b></font><br><br>



tragedy.  The  RSN  will continue to conduct  patrols  to

safeguard  Singapore's territorial waters. I  have  every

confidence that the RSN and SAF will overcome this tragic

event  and continue to discharge their mission with  even

greater determination.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong):</b> Sir, I want to express

our  deepest  sympathies and condolences to the  bereaved

families  and I am sure the RSN will put all this  behind

it,  and  learn and move forward.  I want to ask  whether

the  Deputy  Prime Minister could clarify  the  Malaysian

statement   that   Singapore  had  asked   Malaysia   for

permission to conduct search and rescue operation in  the

waters  off  Pedra Branca.  What is our response  to  the

Malaysian request for such joint patrols?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, could the Deputy Prime Minister clarify

what  he  mentioned earlier, ie, there  was  a  spate  of

violations of our territorial waters at Pedra  Branca  by

foreign  state vessels recently?  Could the Deputy  Prime

Minister please tell this House what actually happened?

<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b> Sir, the incident happened in

Singapore   territorial  waters  off  Pedra  Branca   and

Singapore did not ask permission from Malaysia to conduct

search  and rescue operation.  To put this in the  proper

context,     in    accordance    with    well-established

international search and rescue procedures, there  is  an

arrangement for aircraft to enter foreign airspace  in  a

search  area  to conduct search and rescue operation,  if

necessary.   This requires prior diplomatic clearance  to

enter  foreign airspace.  For this particular  operation,

both  Indonesia  and  Malaysia  granted  Singapore  prior

diplomatic  clearance to enter their airspace to  conduct

search and rescue operation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for joint patrols, there is no question of joint

patrols in Singapore's territorial waters.  Sir,  as  you

know, the Singapore and Malaysian governments have agreed

to  refer  the issue of Pedra Branca to the International

Court  of  Justice.  In fact, both sides have  agreed  to

proceed with the signing of the special agreement on  6th

February to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2001</b></font><br><br>



International Court of Justice.  Unfortunately, Malaysian

government vessels from both their navy and marine police

have  recently  stepped  up their intrusions  into  Pedra

Branca  waters  and  this  despite  the  fact  that   the

Malaysian  government  is  aware  that  after   the   two

countries agreed in 1994 to take the case to the ICJ what

happened  on  the  ground at Pedra Branca  will  have  no

bearing on the judgment by the ICJ.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were three violations by Malaysian state

vessels over the last week of December.  There were  five

more  violations  last  week.  In  these  incidents,  the

Malaysian   vessels  came  close  to  Pedra  Branca   and

conducted  various  activities.   As  Members  know,  the

Malaysian media reported extensively on the 24th December

2002  incident  where  a Malaysian marine  police  patrol

craft brought along a group of journalists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these violations, it is also regrettable

that  the  Malaysian government has seized on the  tragic

accident involving RSS Courageous to try to advance their

claim   to   Pedra  Branca.   The  Malaysian   government

presented  a Third Party Note to the Singapore Government

on   14th  January  2003  protesting  "the  violation  of

Malaysia's   territorial  waters  around  the   Malaysian

island  of Batu Putih" by RSS Courageous at the  time  of

the  collision.   The  TPN further  stated  that  as  the

collision   had  taken  place  in  Malaysian  territorial

waters,  the  Malaysian Marine Department  had  commenced

investigations  and  the  TPN  attached  forms  for   the

Commanding  Officer of RSS Courageous to  submit  to  the

Malaysian Marine Department.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is most unfortunate that the Malaysian government

has chosen to exploit this tragic accident which can only

serve  to stir up emotions and make it more difficult  to

have an amicable settlement of the issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Pedra Branca is Singapore's territory. The RSN

will  continue  to carry out its mission of  safeguarding

Singapore's  sovereignty and territorial integrity.   The

RSN  will  continue to patrol our territorial waters  off

Pedra Branca.

<div align="center"><b>(Security measures against terrorist attacks)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Minister for

Home  Affairs  (a)  whether  Singapore,  as  the  world's

largest  container trans-shipment hub, is a prime  target

for  acts  of  terror; and (b) what are the measures  his

Ministry  is  taking to enhance security and  harden  the

area   against  terrorist  attacks  for  vessels  passing

through the area.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore has the world's

busiest port.  The Singapore Straits is also one  of  the

world's  busiest  sealanes with about 140,000  vessels  a

year passing through it.  It is Government's top priority

to  ensure that incidents similar to the suicide  bombing

of  a  French  flagship, the Limburgh, off Yemen  on  6th

October last year do not happen here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although newspaper reports have highlighted the

likelihood  of terrorists seizing a ship and crashing  it

into another vessel or into a refinery or port, there  is

currently  no specific intelligence of such an attack  in

our ports and the sealanes around Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore waters have been free of sea robberies

inclusive of terrorism for the past 12 years as a  result

of  relentless  efforts put in by our security  agencies.

But  we  are conscious of evolving developments  and  are

constantly looking for ways to protect ourselves  against

the   terrorist  threat.   The  Singapore  Police  Force,

together  with other relevant agencies, has  audited  and

reviewed  the  security measures at our ports  and  other

landing  points.   We have introduced  enhanced  security

measures.   These measures include ensuring  security  of

our  ports'  perimeters, controlling access via  security

passes,  checking  of  personnel, baggage  and  vehicles,

closed-circuit monitoring of port facilities

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2003</b></font><br><br>

guards.  These are landward security measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the seaward side, the three lead agencies, ie,

the  Police  Coast Guard, the Republic of Singapore  Navy

and  the  Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore,  work

together and have introduced additional security measures

to safeguard vessels in our waters.  Sensitive areas such

as  the waters around petrochemical installations and the

approaches  to them used by tankers are declared  out  of

bounds  to  all  other traffic.  The Navy has  also  been

escorting certain high-value merchant vessels such as oil

and gas tankers, large container vessels and cruise ships

through  the  Singapore Straits.  The Police Coast  Guard

(PCG) has increased its deployment by 30% since September

11.   The  PCG  is also in the process of  upgrading  its

surveillance capabilities and acquiring newer and  better

patrol boats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore was among the first few countries to

sign  up  as  a  pilot port under the Container  Security

initiative  to screen sea containers exported  or  trans-shipped  to  the  US.   As  part of  the  initiative,  US

container   security  officers  would  be   deployed   in

Singapore to work together with our enforcement  officers

to  jointly target and prescreen containers bound for the

US.    In   addition,   Singapore   will   be   deploying

radiographic scanners at our ports from next month.   The

scanners  will  be used by our officers  to  boost  their

detecting  capability for containers  entering  Singapore

and  help  move containers in our ports in a more  secure

and expeditious fashion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen) (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Mr Speaker, with your

permission, I would like to take Questions 5 to 8 as they

cover related issues on unemployment.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2005</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> In December 2001, MOM established the

"Distributed  CareerLink  Network".   This  comprises  13

organisations  -  the five Community Development Councils

(CDCs),  the  five  self-help  groups  of  MENDAKI,   the

Eurasian Association, SINDA, CDAC and the Association  of

Muslim  Professionals  (AMP), as well  as  the  Singapore

National  Employers  Federation (SNEF),  National  Trades

Union  Congress  (NTUC), and the Singapore Professionals'

and  Executives'  Cooperative (SPEC).  This  network  was

formed  to improve employment assistance services to  the

unemployed.   This Government and community organisations

network  would be more responsive to the needs  of  those

looking for jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong and Dr Mohamad Maliki have both

asked for a detailed breakdown of individual performances

by  the various placement agencies.  I will provide  data

in   four  broad  groups  because  they  serve  different

communities: that of MOM itself, the CDCs, the  self-help

groups  and  others which are made up of SNEF,  SPEC  and

NTUC.   From December 2001 to November 2002, MOM provided

employment assistance services to 54,600 visits from  job

seekers.   62% of the job seekers were provided  with  at

least  one  job referral.  Approximately 15% of  all  job

seekers were placed in jobs within three months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that same period, the CDCs collectively provided

employment  assistance to 38,310 job requests and  placed

about  13% of these into jobs.  The corresponding  figure

for  the  self-help  groups was  15,961  persons  with  a

placement  rate  of 6.4%.  SNEF, SPEC and  NTUC  together

provided  assistance  to 8,206 job  requests  and  placed

about 19% of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, MOM and its DCN partners attended to

117,000 job requests and helped 15,701 get jobs.  This is

about   13%.     In  2002,  47,000  Skills  Redevelopment

Programme  training  places  were  taken  up  by   33,516

workers.  Given that the number of unemployed now  stands

at around 80,000, these figures suggest that the majority

of those looking for jobs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2006</b></font><br><br>



know  where  to  seek assistance and have  made  repeated

visits to our Distributed CareerLink Network.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at this juncture, let me correct the wrong

impression  that only 13% of those looking for  jobs  are

successful.   I  have  to clarify  that  the  Distributed

CareerLink Network caters to a select group of retrenched

Singaporeans  who find it harder to get jobs.   In  fact,

our reemployment data indicates that in 2001 and 2002, 60-65%  of  those retrenched are able to secure a job within

six  months of retrenchment.  The re-employment rate  for

the quarter ending September 2002 was 67%, the highest in

the last two years.  This indicates that the majority  of

Singaporeans  who  have lost their  jobs  are  realistic.

They know where to go for training and indeed are able by

themselves  to  secure new employment.   Government  will

continue to assist those with general enabling schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in response to Dr Maliki's request on one such

scheme   -  the People for Jobs Traineeship Programme   - I  am  pleased  to report that more than 3,000  companies

from  various  sectors  have  hired  approximately  8,000

workers  in 2002.  This particular programme provides  an

incentive  to encourage employers to recruit workers  who

are  40  years and above who may lack relevant experience

for the new jobs or work environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Members' questions also touch on a more

important  concern that other Members of this House  also

share:   "How  can  we  help  that  particular  group  of

Singaporeans like those which the DCN serves who  are  at

higher  risk  of  being structurally  unemployed  to  get

jobs?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the figures I have provided indicate that

access to services  -  dissemination of information about

jobs   and  provision  of  training  courses  -   appears

adequate, but the actual placement of jobs for this group

of workers  -  about 13%  -  could be improved.  In other

words,  we have told this group of people where the  fish

are,  we  taught them how to fish, but the actual  number

who are catching fishes could be better.  Why is this so?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2007</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now ask the Clerk of Parliament to distribute

a  fact sheet (Tables  (Cols. 2131-44) Nos. 1, 2, 3A,  3B

and  4), which contains the data on the unemployment  and

vacancy  situation sought by Mdm Ho Geok Choo.   She  has

asked for a detailed list.  I have provided it and  I  do

not propose to go through the detailed list.  Let me just

summarise and say that while there were 72,000 unemployed

residents  at the end of September last year, there  were

over  17,000 job vacancies in various sectors.   We  also

have  nearly  450,000 foreign workers here to  supplement

our  local  workforce; in other words, 450,000  potential

jobs held by foreign workers at this point of time.   So,

in that context, why should there be Singaporeans who are

unemployed?   Since  its inception in January  2002,  the

Jobs Task Force has posed this question to ourselves  and

to  our  members who comprise CEOs of various industries,

unionists, mayors, EDB, and as well as those looking  for

jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share with you some of the common reasons

given  to  the Jobs Task Force for this select  group  of

workers.   First  of all, the pool of jobs  available  is

relatively  smaller  compared to  the  past.   We  had  a

tremendous  run  -  15 years of above 7% GDP growth  that

created,  in essence, two jobs to every Singaporean.   In

that  climate for 15 years, even those with  less  skills

could  wait  for that `dream' job.  But as we  have  been

deliberately repeating, the world has changed.  No mature

economy,  which  we are, expects to achieve  such  growth

rates  and  job creation.  Instead, fewer  jobs  will  be

created  which will have higher value-add.  Lower skilled

jobs  will also be available but may be in more  vigorous

working  conditions.  It would be unrealistic and  indeed

frustrating to wait for the best job to come along.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the marine industry, 30,000 jobs were created in

the  last five years and even now, there are about  1,300

vacancies.  With overtime, the take-home pay is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2008</b></font><br><br>



substantial, with a median wage of $1,800 per month,  but

Singaporeans  shun  this industry.   In  the  retail  and

restaurant  sectors, there are 2,000  vacancies  now  but

these  jobs  are not attractive to locals.  Even  in  the

manufacturing  sector, there are about  3,000  vacancies.

However, some Singaporeans who qualify for these jobs  do

not  want  to  work  in wafer fabs because  they  dislike

donning  suits,  working in clean rooms  or  the  12-hour

shifts.    Others   have  practical  difficulties.    For

example, some, especially mothers with children, find  it

difficult  to  work  shifts because  the  hours  make  it

difficult  to  juggle  their  roles  as  caregivers   and

breadwinners.  Others still find travelling to  factories

in  certain  parts  of Singapore too far.   Companies  do

provide  transportation, but they have to wake up earlier

to   get   to   work  on  time.   These   are   practical

considerations  which I empathise with.  We  are  working

with  related  agencies  to  see  how  to  address  these

impediments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also had feedback that some Singaporeans

looked  at  wages and calculate the take home  pay  minus

CPF,  transport and meals.  If the wages are low compared

to what they used to earn, they may decide that it may be

better to wait for better times.  Perhaps some can afford

to  do  so since the average retrenchment benefit in  our

last survey was 5-6 months, and they have some savings to

live  on.   But we cannot count on the luxury of  waiting

for a better and higher paying jobs to appear soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM will continue to work with its partners at

Spring,  EDB and DCN agencies and the MPs to help workers

adjust  to the new environment to alleviate unemployment.

We  will  continue to upgrade job matching  and  referral

services,  market  training programmes,  and  disseminate

labour  market  information  to  job  seekers  and   also

residents  who  want  to retrain themselves  for  higher-skilled  jobs and help workers adjust to the new economic

conditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent survey conducted for full-time Skills

Redevelopment Programme

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2009</b></font><br><br>



graduates  who have completed their courses  between  May

and  August of last year showed that one in two of  those

who participated in the course secured a job within three

months.  These figures are encouraging and indicate  that

those   who   upgrade   themselves   do   enhance   their

employability and get meaningful jobs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, I was indeed

surprised  to learn that there are so many job  vacancies

available.   Could I ask the Minister to  enlighten  this

House  as to how he has arrived at these numbers and  the

specific reasons why Singaporeans reject these jobs which

are now available?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, I have provided detailed

figures,  in  terms of the job vacancies, and  these  are

data  collected from current job vacancies.  HR personnel

and  other  related streams of information tell  us  that

these  are  the  jobs  available.   So,  these  are  hard

figures.   As to how to make Singaporeans take  up  these

job vacancies, there are many factors why they do not  in

the first place, and you have to address them one by one.

Some  Members  may  have come across a  number  of  mind-changing  initiatives that we have tried to undertake  to

help them adjust to new job market conditions.  And as  I

have  said,  we will continue to tackle these  issues  by

working with industry and  our related partners to try to

increase their acceptability.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Sir, I

requested  detailed figures of the individual  breakdowns

of  the various organisations.  The Minister of State has

not  provided  the  detailed breakdown  yet.   Could  the

Minister  of State confirm that the Ministry of  Manpower

has the individual figures, and he would provide them  to

me, if not now, then in a separate note?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, I did not choose to nit-pick

and  give details of 13 agencies, not because we  do  not

have  the data, we do have the data.  But I wanted to  be

clear,  to  send the signal, which I think  the  question

implied  more  than what was asked.  I am sure  that  the

hon. Member is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2010</b></font><br><br>



not obsessed with details.  What I wanted to show was the

four  groups, which tend to different sectors of workers,

have  different results, and you can see from even within

the  four  groups  that there are different  measures  of

success, if you like.  I also wanted to emphasise that in

the  overall universe of those who were retrenched,  that

it was about 67%.  In other words, the majority of people

who   lose  their  jobs  know  where  to  look  for   the

information  and get it.  More importantly, I  wanted  to

emphasise  the point that it may be wrong, and  we  would

arrive  at  erroneous conclusions by comparing  different

members  in  different agencies, because the people  that

they  tend  to  are different - different  employability,

potential, different educational and training skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I also want to emphasise is that

while  it  is useful and, indeed, it should be commended,

that  there are efficiencies to be gained from  enhancing

our  job-matching  skills, we should not  exaggerate  the

potential of that impact.  The answer to job creation  is

to  make  our  economy more attractive  so  that  we  can

increase the overall pie.  MOM and its DCN partners must,

of  course, continue to work in this current climate,  to

make  sure that where there are jobs available, we should

help  people  to get them and, indeed, as  Mr  Sin  says,

there are jobs available, about 17,000 vacancies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I read about the initiatives of Mr Charles

Chong and Mr Ahmad Magad, and his Tampines GRC MPs, I was

cheered, because of their job programmes which have 1,500

vacancies.   I  think such measures are to be  commended.

MOM  is willing to work with MPs who would want to  serve

their  constituents better, and give them the information

that  they need.  But we should not exaggerate the impact

of  that  potential.  There are jobs available.  We  will

try  to increase our efficiency and where we can, we will

continue to work at that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Would the Ministry be prepared to

publish  specific  details  about  these  jobs  that  are

available to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2011</b></font><br><br>



CDCs  and  advisers on the ground, so that at least  they

will  know  where these vacancies are and  perhaps  write

directly  to those who are making the offer, rather  than

cite  statistics here of these jobs which are  available,

which to many Singaporeans are just as elusive as ever?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> I would strongly debate the point

with  Mr Sin that these figures are elusive.  He may  not

be  aware  of the conditions on the ground.  We  have  an

aggregated  job link, which means that the various  CDCs'

and MOM's pool of jobs is computerised on-line.  In other

words,  with  all the CDCs and the self-help groups,  and

the   DCN   is  an  aggregated  job  bank  on-line,   the

information is there.  It is not that the information  is

not there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that we have 117,000 visits to our DCN

partners  means  that access is not such a  big  problem.

Even  if you assume one person makes two visits, you have

50,000 unemployed who go there.  And as many MPs know  on

the  ground,  when they approach you for job  assistance,

the path to the DCN partners or the path to the Mayors is

not  strewn with impediments.  Most of them do get to DCN

quite  simply  and to the CDCs especially, and  they  are

very  responsive,  if I may say so.  Job  information  is

certainly one area.  But it is certainly more than  that.

As  I  have said, I have enumerated many reasons, and  we

will  continue  to  work at that.  But  where  there  are

efficiencies  to be derived, we will continue  to  update

the  job bank and specific aspects, in terms of matching.

We  are trying to enhance the matching capability, as  it

were,  and  this  is  another phase  of  our  job  career

development.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, a point of clarification,

first.  Mr Ahmad Magad and I are not in Tampines GRC,  we

are in Pasir-Ris-Punggol GRC.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> My apologies.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Would the Minister of State not

agree   that   we   should  find  out  which   particular

organisation has the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2012</b></font><br><br>



highest  successful placement rates and learn  from  them

and  level up, rather than level everybody down and  hide

behind one composite figure?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Absolutely. I agree completely with

the  MP that we should level up and not level down. There

was no intention ever to level down.  If Mr Charles Chong

and his Pasir Ris-Punggol MPs can level up the system, it

is  wonderful  for all of us!  We will  learn  from  him.

Among  the  various CDCs and self-help groups, there  are

varying  results.  Yes, we should share the  information.

I  have  already asked my Ministry's members  to  contact

those  agencies  which  have been  more  successful  than

others and, indeed, that will be the direction to go.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Can I ask the

Minister  of  State  why  did he not  answer  Mr  Chong's

question about the four self-help groups, because  it  is

useful to know how effective they are in job placements?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> I did answer, but not in detail as

he  wanted.   I  mentioned the result of 6.4%,  which  is

about   half   the  average  of  the  entire  Distributed

Careerlink  Network.   I did not  want  to  go  into  the

specifics  of each group because I think that they  would

detract  from  the  problem, and it  is  not  quite  fair

because they are dealing with different groups.  What  is

the  message  that you want to send to them?   They  will

know it internally.  What is the message that you want to

send to the public?  Don't go to this group?  So, I think

we  have to be careful in our nuancing, in terms of  what

efficiencies   there  are.   As  I  said,   the   overall

population  of retrenched workers (67%) gets jobs  within

six  months.  In other words, the personal responsibility

of  a  person  who gets retrenched must  continue  to  be

enhanced.  Government cannot replace that role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will provide the training opportunities. We will

provide where efficiencies are.  But the fact that nearly

70% do get jobs means that many people know how to do it.

There will be a select group which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2013</b></font><br><br>



will  be  harder,  and this group will  change  with  the

various characteristics.  That was the reason to  have  a

Distributed  Careerlink  Network  in  the  first   place,

because  we knew that there were differences in different

sectors of society.  Where there are efficiencies  to  be

enhanced,  as  Mr Charles Chong has said, we  will  learn

from those who have been more efficient.  But, even then,

we  will compare why they have been successful, and there

may   be  different  reasons.   Certain  CDCs  are   more

efficient  in that sense, because they are geographically

located nearer certain sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I do not think we want to micro-manage, but we

do  want  to make everybody more efficient.   But,  as  I

cautioned,  let us not exaggerate the potential  of  that

impact.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  has reference to my question regarding the  mindset

of   potential  employers,  especially  with  regard   to

retrenched employees who are above 45 years  of  age.   I

notice  from the handout that quite a big number  of  job

vacancies exist in the public sector, and these jobs  are

actually in the general administration area.  I  am  just

wondering  whether the public sector sets the example  of

encouraging  potential employers to look at the  above-45

more  favourably by starting to actually  open  up  these

jobs  to  those 45 years of age who have been  retrenched

from the private sector.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, the question implicitly implies

that  we  have not been open, and I do not think that  is

true.   We judge it on its merit.  Government will create

programmes  that  are general and enabling.   Under  this

particular People for Jobs Traineeship Programme, we have

said  that  for  the  first six months,  Government  will

provide $2,000 or 50% of your salary, whichever is lower,

and  that  is  a  very  strong  signal  that  Government,

including  the civil service, would like to  enhance  the

employability of those above 40.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2014</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> For those who

are successful in being placed in jobs, does the Ministry

monitor whether they are able to hold their jobs and,  if

not,  for  how long?  The reason why I ask is,  I  think,

this  figure  would  give  us a good  indication  on  the

quality of job-matching being offered.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Yes, we do. Sir, that is a very good

question.   We  have  particular schemes,  in  fact,  for

example,   the   Place,  Train  and  Incentivise   where,

especially in the hotel line, because that is one  sector

where  there  are  jobs which we think that  Singaporeans

should  fill in, but we have got anecdotes where they  go

for training, take up the training course and then go  on

the  job,  but after two days, they leave.   So  we  have

added another component that if you stay on, I think, for

three  to  six  months,  we will give  you  another  $500

incentive  for  you to stay on.  So we are  tweaking  the

system  to see how we can make it sustainable.   And  you

are  right, we need to find out not only in terms of  job

placements  for a day because that does not  make  sense,

but long-term sustainability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another part of our effort is to work with industry,

in  fact, to re-engineer certain of the jobs so that they

are  more attractive to the extent as possible.  But, you

know,  in wafer fabs, there is a limit.  It is a  12-hour

shift.   You  need  to don suits.  Mrs Yu-Foo  said  that

initially  there was a wrong impression that  you  donned

suits  to  protect yourselves, that there  was  something

wrong  in  the  environment.  So we have to  go  on  this

campaign  to  say,  "No, no, we are  actually  trying  to

protect  the  product from you."  Then, they  understood.

But  these  are little things that you find  out  on  the

ground and you adjust to it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, could the

Minister  of State confirm that the Ministry of  Manpower

is  providing sufficient funds to these self-help  groups

and  the  various  CDCs to help them in their  employment

assistance programmes, and MOM is satisfied

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2015</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, I am never satisfied with the

returns gained, if that means that I want improvement.  I

always  want improvement.  So that is the answer  to  the

second  question.  But in terms of resources, we  provide

about  $210,000 a year, including officers and  training,

and  we  are also now changing the system - that is  just

for  employment for the officers to beef it up.  We  have

to  realise  that structural unemployment,  what  we  are

seeing,  is a relatively new phenomenon.  Prior to  that,

we  never had that and job counselling capabilities  were

not  quite  there.  If Members think that trying  to  get

somebody  a  job  is  identifying a  job,  identifying  a

retrenched  worker  and  putting  it  together,  I  would

encourage them to visit the DCN.  Mayors will know that a

tremendous   amount   of   hand-holding,   building    up

confidence, telling the person that, "It's okay, you  can

take  this.",  is  required, matching  the  capabilities,

which  means  that  you have to spend  a  lot  of  effort

sometimes in each.  So, these would have to be built.  We

will  continue  to pour in resources so that  we  can  at

least get better results.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</b> Sir, I read with

alarm  the  very large number of unemployed  amongst  the

diploma (6,400) and degree (12,900) holders.  Can we help

the  polytechnics and universities, so that we do not add

to  new graduates among this field of unemployed?  Can we

have some idea of who these people are?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Sir, Mr Loh Meng See has crossed

into education now.  But I will answer that question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The employability of our polytechnic diploma holders

and  graduates, in terms of three months  or  six  months

after they graduate, is still around about 70-80% in this

time.   What was the reason that we have this?   And  you

are   right.   Previous  recessions  affected  more  line

operators  and  production operators.  But  this  current

recession  affects diploma holders and  graduates.   They

have  not  been spared.  It is the pace of globalisation,

in  other  words, sectors which are affected all  across,

and even foreign workers, for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2016</b></font><br><br>



example,  we had a 30% reduction in our employment  pass.

The  reason  is that there is uncertainty in  the  global

economic climate, there is less visibility and people are

not  hiring.   But  I  am less worried  for  this  group,

because once the economy picks up, they are the ones that

will be absorbed quite quickly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Does the Minister of State agree that one of the reasons

younger  persons generally experience higher unemployment

is  because  of  competition  from  the  employment  pass

holders?

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ng Eng Hen:</b> Mr Steve Chia's question, Sir,

implies a zero sum game, and that is not here at all.  We

have  very  strong  economic data  to  suggest  that  our

employment pass workers increase our overall pie.  If  we

did   not   have   them,  well,  you  might   have   more

representation  of  our  local workers  in  our  economic

sector, but of a much smaller pie.  So we cannot run away

from  the fact that, even though we have foreign  workers

within the midst of our industries, they do indeed create

more  jobs  on  the  whole  because  they  make  us  more

competitive.   And  we will continue  to  stick  to  that

strategy.   We should not allow short-term situations  to

skew or to mar our responses to what is a viable and very

reasonable and important long-term strategic drive.

<div align="center"><b>INVESTMENT AND JOB CREATION OUTLOOK</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr A. Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr A. Nithiah Nandan</b> asked the Minister for

Trade  and  Industry  what  is  the  investment  and  job

creation outlook for 2003.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> The global economic and political environment

this year remains clouded in uncertainty.  First, we face

the likelihood of a US-led war in Iraq and the continuing

threat of terrorism.  Second, growth in the EU and  Japan

is   likely   to  remain  below  par  due  to  structural

impediments in the two economies.   Third, there  remains

excess

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2017</b></font><br><br>



capacity    from   the   investment   bubble.    Capacity

utilisation  in  a  number  of  industries  remains  low.

Because  of these uncertainties, many companies  adopt  a

cautious approach in their investment decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, investors continued to show confidence

in  Singapore because of our strong fundamentals, prudent

fiscal    and    monetary   policies,    our    excellent

infrastructure   and   our  extensive   trade   linkages.

Investors have also taken note of our continuing  efforts

to upgrade our workforce and our R&D capability.  Despite

the difficult economic conditions last year, we attracted

commitments of S$9.0 billion in manufacturing fixed asset

investment and S$2.1 billion in services, total  business

spending.    For   this  year,  EDB  expects   investment

commitments  to  be  S$8.0 billion in  the  manufacturing

sector  and S$1.9 billion in services.  These investments

are  expected to create a total of 18,000 new  jobs  when

realised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall job market is expected to remain soft

this  year.   However, jobs are still being  created  and

there  are many unfilled vacancies in the job market,  as

Minister  of  State Dr Ng Eng Hen has just explained.   A

survey by MOM on private sector establishments shows that

there  were about 17,000 job vacancies in September  last

year.    These  jobs  are in both the  manufacturing  and

services  sectors.   Our economic  agencies  are  working

closely with MOM and industry to improve job matching and

the  training of our workforce.  We must continue to keep

our  labour  market  flexible  and  competitive,  and  to

encourage  our workers to continue to upgrade and  adapt.

Then  the employment outlook will improve as our  economy

recovers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a more positive note, once the uncertainties

surrounding  a possible US-Iraq war are out of  the  way,

global  growth is likely to pick up.  If the Middle  East

situation  clears  by  the middle of  the  year,  the  US

economy  may  see  good  recovery  in  the  second  half.

President  Bush is of course anxious that the US  economy

should pick up in the run-up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2018</b></font><br><br>



to  the  2004 presidential elections.  If the US  economy

improves, the Singapore economy should improve with it.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. Nithiah Nandan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. Nithiah Nandan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I

would  like to commend MTI and the economic agencies  for

all  the efforts taken in attracting investments and  for

the  creation  of  jobs  for Singaporeans.   But  as  the

Minister has indicated, there are great uncertainties  in

this current period.  What are the steps his Ministry has

taken  to keep investments which have come into Singapore

to  remain in Singapore?  At the same time, what  further

economic  stimulus packages can be introduced to  attract

investments, so that there will be greater job  creation?

And in this difficult period, what are the other measures

being taken to help workers who sincerely could not  find

a job?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank

the NMP for his question about the competitiveness of the

Singapore  economy.  There are really two sets of  issues

which  we  have  got  to address.  One  is  the  internal

factors    which    will   enhance   our    international

competitiveness   and,  second,  our  external   economic

linkages.   The  internal  factors  have  been  addressed

comprehensively  by the Economic Review  Committee  which

report will be coming out quite soon.  And I am sure when

the  report  comes out, there will be a major  debate  in

this Chamber.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic ideas are quite simple. We have got to

keep  costs  down,  reduce taxes, improve  labour  market

flexibility   so  that,  as  our  economy  becomes   more

sophisticated  and  variegated,  our  labour  market   is

diverse  and  sophisticated enough to  make  adjustments.

Just  a simple example.  Today, if you drive through  the

city  in the middle of the night, it is alive and buzzing

-  so  many lights are on, so many activities are  taking

place.   To  power  such an economy, our  overall  labour

market  situation must adapt.  So in the  factory,  there

are  mostly  foreign workers, in the financial  district,

there  are  our lawyers, they work around the clock,  and

there are restaurants to service them,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2019</b></font><br><br>



there  are buses, trains, taxis, to bring them from point

A to point B.  We must make all the internal adjustments,

where  necessary,  to  ensure that  our  economy  remains

competitive  in  the new world ahead  of  us  -  lowering

taxes,  CPF  restructuring,  labour  market  flexibility,

making sure that our infrastructure is tip-top, investing

in  education, in worker retraining, R&D.   So all  these

issues  will be addressed comprehensively by the Economic

Review Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Externally, we have got to position ourselves to

exploit  new growth potential in the region.  As  Members

are  aware,  we have been working very hard to  establish

free trade agreements with the major economies.   We  now

have  free  trade  agreements  with  Australia  and   New

Zealand,  with the European Free Trade Area, with  Japan,

and we recently concluded a free trade agreement with the

US which, hopefully, should become operational early next

year.  And we are not stopping there.  We are working  to

strengthen  economic integration in the  region,  enhance

our  links to China, to India and to other parts  of  the

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking ahead, there will be two big balloons

inflating  -  China, on the one hand, and India,  on  the

other.   And we must position ourselves so that  whatever

happens to the region around us, we will lift with  them,

in  other words, strengthen, build upon our strong  links

to the US, Europe, Japan, build up new links to India and

China,  and  then  work our guts out to  consolidate  the

region  so  that we will grow along with all the  others.

It  is a diversified strategy.  It does not depend on any

one  single link alone.  This is to maximise our  chances

for   the  future.   If  we  can  do  all  these  things,

internally and externally, then I believe that, when  the

global economic cycle turns up again, we will move  along

quickly.  The key is to be very alert to changing  trends

and  to  accept that the world in front of us  will  look

very different from the world behind us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can we make the adjustments? Can our workers make

the adjustments?  I believe

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2020</b></font><br><br>



that  our younger Singaporeans who are very well educated

can.   Yes, they may have to accept lower wages when they

enter  the  job  market, some of them  have  got  wealthy

parents, so they prefer to take a few months off  to  see

the  world  and to understand more things.   Well,  fine.

Our  big  worry is the older workers, particularly  those

who  are either used to much higher income, or those  who

never  had  the  education because  they  grew  up  in  a

different period of Singapore's history.  So we  must  do

everything  possible to help them.  They must  also  make

the  adjustment and accept that conditions  have  changed

and  the  things which they would not have considered  in

the  past, they should now consider for the future.   And

we  must  help  them,  if  they are  in  difficulty,  and

certainly help their children so that the next generation

will be as well equipped as possible.  If we do all these

things, then I think we are in good shape.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, I would like to ask the

Minister,  as  for  the  new jobs that  are  created  and

brought in by the new investments, I notice that they are

mostly  in  the  high-end types - the biotech,  the  life

sciences.  We still have a group of people who no  matter

how  we train them, they are not going to fit into  these

jobs.   So  what  jobs are there left for this  group  of

people?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we give a

lot  of  emphasis to high value-added investments because

these have got the most direct and indirect spin-offs for

the   Singapore   economy.    When   we   build   a   new

pharmaceutical  plant  or  a  new  cracker,  hundreds  of

millions of dollars of investments, but each only  hiring

maybe a few hundred direct workers.  So it appears as  if

we  are not generating the jobs.  But, in fact, for  each

of  these  investments, a lot of  other  jobs  are  being

created around them.  Take, for instance, each wafer  fab

requires   not  only  PhDs,  engineers  and   polytechnic

graduates,  but  easily 40%-60% are less skilled  workers

who  must still move things around, keep the place clean,

do the maintenance, do the gardening.  Then there are the

suppliers,  there  are  canteen  operators,   there   are

transport workers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2021</b></font><br><br>



who  help them; then in the financial district are  those

who do the legal documents, provide the loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most vivid illustration is Jurong Island. After

September  11, we tightened up security on Jurong  Island

and  issued  smart cards to those who need to  enter  the

island  regularly.  Initially, JTC expected 10,000  cards

should be more than enough because there were fewer  than

10,000  workers.   In the end, we had  to  issue  100,000

smart  cards because there are so many people living  off

Jurong  Island.   So do not disdain the high  value-added

investments because each such tip brings along with it  a

whole  pyramid of employment opportunities.  If we target

lower peaks, those lower peaks will be very quickly swept

away  by  more  competitive market conditions  in  China,

India  and elsewhere.  So our strategy is to go  for  the

areas  in  which  we have a competitive and  an  enduring

advantage  and  trusting  that  in  the  process,   other

opportunities  will be created.  If the  big  investments

are in, there will be a lot of feeding for SMEs.  But  it

is  not automatic.  We have got to readjust ourselves  to

meet  these  new  requirements, and not expect  that  the

opportunities  that we had in the past  must  necessarily

obtain in the future when the economy turns up again.  In

fact,  we can be quite sure that the needs in the  future

are  different and that many adjustments will have to  be

made.

<div align="center"><b>HDB RESALE FLATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Reasons for devaluation)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen</b> asked the Minister for

National Development (a) what are the reasons that caused

the   significant   devaluation  of   the   Housing   and

Development Board (HDB) resale flats in recent years; (b)

what  measures his Ministry could have taken  to  prevent

this  collapse; and (c) what measures will the Government

take  to ameliorate the negative equity suffered by these

HDB flat owners.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2022</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Mah Bow Tan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore's economy has been

going  through  a  difficult period following  the  Asian

financial  crisis in 1997.  This has affected almost  all

sectors  of  our economy and the property  market,  which

includes  both  private residential  properties  and  HDB

flats, has not been spared.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the prices of HDB resale flats have fallen

by  about 29% from their peak in 1996, the decline is not

as  much as that for private property prices, which  have

fallen  37%  from their peak.  There are several  reasons

for this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, HDB calibrates its building programme to

match the overall demand for HDB flats.  When the take-up

of new flats under the Registration for Flat System (RFS)

was  affected  by the economic slowdown in the  last  few

years,  HDB cut back sharply on the construction  of  new

HDB flats from 1998 onwards.  This helped to minimise the

build-up   of  unsold  stocks,  although  it  was   still

substantial  due  to  the  time lag  between  tender  and

completion  of building contracts.  To reduce the  unsold

stock,  HDB has focused on selling flats through  several

Walk-in  Selection  exercises.  HDB's efforts  have  been

quite   successful,  and  we  expect  to   be   able   to

substantially clear the surplus stock within the next two

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, HDB is mindful of the impact that new flat

prices  may  have on the resale market.  In  pricing  new

flats, affordability is the primary consideration.   But,

HDB   also   takes  into  consideration  the  prices   of

comparable  resale  flats, and  the  adjustments  to  the

prices  of new flats are done more gradually,  so  as  to

minimise  price fluctuations and any knock-on  effect  on

the resale market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB has in place several financial assistance

schemes  to  assist  existing  mortgagors  who  encounter

financial   difficulties  in  servicing  their   mortgage

instalments.  Through these measures, HDB homeowners with

negative equity at the moment are under less pressure  to

sell their flats.  In 2002, less than 100 HDB

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2023</b></font><br><br>

resale flat lessees sold their flat at a price lower than

their  outstanding mortgage loan.  This is only  a  small

fraction compared to the 39,000 resale transactions  that

were processed in the year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property prices go through cycles. After two years

of  decline in 2000 and 2001, HDB resale prices  remained

relatively  stable  last year.  As the economy  recovers,

property  prices  will also recover and  the  problem  of

negative equity will be minimised, if not fully resolved.

<br><br><!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> May I ask the

Minister whether he agrees that the HDB resale market  is

basically a very restricted market in the sense that  the

number  of  buyers  who  can buy is actually  restricted?

Does his Ministry forecast the number of buyers that  can

buy  in  the  resale flat market when it builds  the  new

flats?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> On the contrary, HDB resale flats

are  actually open to a very wide variety of people.  Let

me  go  through the various people who are  eligible  for

resale flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, of course, would be the first-timers,

who  can actually buy a resale flat with a housing grant.

The second-timers obviously are able to buy resale flats.

Permanent residents and private property owners  can  buy

resale  flats.   Singles can buy resale flats.   So,  the

market  for resale flats is actually very wide,  and  the

number   of  resale  flats  that  have  been  transacted,

particularly  during  the height of the  boom,  indicates

that,  in  fact, there is no shortage of people  who  are

able  to  buy resale flats, if the conditions are  right,

ie,  they  feel that prices are favourable or  they  feel

that there is good value to buy a HDB resale flat.  So  I

would not agree that the number of resale flat buyers  is

actually restricted, or that the market for resale  flats

is restricted.  It is actually a very large market.

<div align="center"><b>SALE OF HDB FLATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Advertisement)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National

Development (a) why is the Housing and Development  Board

(HDB) advertising for the sale of its flats; (b) how many

new  flats are unsold to date; and (c) whether  HDB  will

further  liberalise its rules to allow flat  owners  more

flexibility to sell, rent or use their flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, HDB introduced a

number  of  new sales programmes last year, such  as  the

Walk-in Selection for flats in the non-mature estates and

the  twice-yearly Balloting Exercise for flats in  mature

estates.   It  also suspended the Registration  for  Flat

System,  and  it  will switch over to the  Build-to-Order

system from next year.  There is therefore a greater need

for  HDB to publicise each new launch, to keep the public

informed  of the availability of flats and the  different

application procedures for each programme.  To do so more

effectively, HDB has adopted new publicity measures, such

as press advertisements and roadshows, in addition to the

Internet and Teletext.  This is to make information  more

accessible   to  prospective  buyers  and   to   minimise

confusion to the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new sales measures and increased marketing

efforts, HDB has been quite successful in its efforts  to

sell  its  unsold stock.  As at 31st December  2002,  HDB

managed to sell a total of 10,000 flats in the non-mature

estates  through the various exercises for applicants  on

the  RFS  queue and through the monthly Walk-in Selection

exercises.  Today, it has about 12,000 units in the  non-mature  as  well as the mature estates that are available

for  sale to the public.  HDB will continue to sell  them

through  Walk-in Selection and the twice-yearly balloting

exercises.   It will continue to assess the  response  to

its  on-going sales measures and monitor the  demand  for

flats   and  the  economic  conditions,  before  deciding

whether  additional  measures are necessary  as  well  as

finalising its building plans for 2003.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2025</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB flats are built to meet the housing needs of

Singaporean   households  and  are   highly   subsidised.

Therefore,  there is a need to have rules and  conditions

on  the  resale and subletting of these flats  to  ensure

that  they  are used for owner occupation,  and  not  for

income generation.  Nevertheless, we recognise that there

is room for HDB to exercise flexibility with flats bought

from  the open market without any housing grant and  with

either  a  bank  loan or no outstanding HDB  market  rate

loan.  Hence, with effect from 1st January this year, the

rules  governing the resale and subletting of such  flats

have  been partially relaxed.  This will give flat owners

greater flexibility and leeway in the use of their flats.

We  will monitor the impact of these changes on other HDB

residents  and  the social make-up of our public  housing

estates  carefully,  before reviewing  whether  there  is

scope for further liberalisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for restrictions on the use of HDB flats, they

are  necessary  to  ensure that residents  do  not  cause

disamenity to their neighbours.  Nevertheless,  HDB  does

allow  its  lessees  to  conduct  small-scale  home-based

businesses   from   their  flats,  subject   to   certain

guidelines.   In  addition, under the Technopreneur  Home

Office Scheme, aspiring technopreneurs can use their  HDB

flats  as  their registered business address  to  conduct

info-communication  technology-related  work.    We   are

reviewing  the restrictions on the use of  HDB  flats  to

ensure  that they remain relevant in the current economic

and social environment.  Even as we do so, we will ensure

that   the   residential  nature  and  the  good   living

environment of our HDB estates is preserved, and that HDB

residents  are  not  inadvertently  inconvenienced  as  a

result of businesses conducted by their neighbours.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Sir, can the Minister

explain why the HDB concessionary interest rate is higher

than  the private-sector bank interest rate, and  why  is

the  concessionary rate pegged above the minimum interest

rate  from  the  CPF Board at 2.5%, and  how  can  it  be

considered  concessionary when  it  is  higher  than  the

market rate?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2026</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> This has got nothing to do with the

use of HDB flats, but I will answer the question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, what is a HDB concessionary interest

rate?  It is an interest rate which is available to those

groups  of  HDB  flat lessees who are first-time  buyers,

those  who  are  not  private property  owners,  are  not

breaching the income ceiling and so on.  In other  words,

the  HDB  concessionary rate is a rate which  will  allow

such  buyers  to own their first HDB flat  or  to  own  a

second HDB flat as a result of upgrading, ie, it is meant

to facilitate their ownership of a HDB flat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years, the HDB concessionary rate has been

below the private-sector rate.  HDB's concessionary  rate

is  independent of what the private property charges, and

it  has  always been low.  Why?  Because it is pegged  to

the CPF rate.  The CPF rate, as the hon. Member may know,

is the average of the rates that the various banks charge

their customers, but with a floor.  In other words, if we

take  all the bank deposit rates and we average them out,

that is the rate which the Government promises to pay  to

CPF  account-holders, with one caveat: if the  rate  goes

below  2.5%, the CPF, will still pay 2.5%.   So,  if  the

bank  rates  go up, CPF will pay a higher interest  rate.

If  the  bank  rates go down, the CPF will  pay  a  lower

interest rate, but with a floor of 2.5%.  It is  an  all-win and no-lose kind of a game, if hon. Members know what

I  mean, because with the guarantee of 2.5%, the  CPF  is

paying  higher than what the banks are able to  pay.   In

this  way, we ensure that the CPF savings of our citizens

actually  yield a good return in order to allow  them  to

have sufficient funds for their retirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I explain all this? Because HDB borrows its

funds  for the concessionary rate from the CPF.  Whatever

it pays the CPF for this concessionary rate, it will then

pass on to flat lessees, plus a small margin of 0.1%  for

administrative cost.  So, if the CPF rate  is  2.5%,  HDB

will borrow from CPF at 2.5%, add 0.1% and charge the HDB

lessee 2.6%.  That is the reason

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2027</b></font><br><br>



why  HDB cannot lower its concessionary rate, unless  CPF

also  lowers the rate that it pays out to its depositors.

I  think  that  is not something that Singaporeans  would

like  to  see,  because  we want to  see  our  CPF  money

enjoying  a  good  rate of return.  And currently  it  is

enjoying  a  very good rate of return, much  higher  than

what we can get from the banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason, although the bank interest rates at

the  moment are lower than the concessionary rate,  I  am

afraid that HDB is not in a position to be able to  match

the  banks' rates.  Indeed, for many years, when the bank

rates  were  very  high, the HDB concessionary  rate  was

actually  a  very attractive rate, way below  the  banks'

interest  rate  at  that  time.   So  we  cannot  have  a

situation  when the HDB concessionary rates are  low  and

the bank rates are high, to enjoy that concessionary rate

and  then, when the reverse situation is true, to require

the  HDB  to  lower  its rates.   I  think  that  is  not

possible, because HDB is not in a position to do that for

the reasons that I have cited earlier.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Sir, may I

ask the Minister whether the HDB can consider adopting  a

daily  walk-in  selection system for  all  the  available

flats,  so  that  all those eligible flat applicants  can

have more options and are able to select flats faster?

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b> Sir, I will ask HDB to consider

that.   The  reason  why we have staged  various  walk-in

selection exercises for different estates is to make sure

that  the  sale of the flats in these various estates  is

conducted in a way which can be properly managed.  So, if

you notice, for each walk-in selection exercise, HDB will

conduct a publicity programme, put up proper tentage, put

up  all the proper administrative procedures in order  to

make  it  convenient  for residents to  apply  for  these

flats.   If we were to adopt the suggestion of the Member

that  we  open up all the estates at once, then  one  way

would be to just simply accept applications, say, in  HDB

hub.  I think we would

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2028</b></font><br><br>



lose something in that process, but I will ask the HDB to

consider that suggestion.  So it may be possible for  us,

at  a  certain point in time down the road, to adopt that

proposal.   At  this  stage,  where  there  are  still  a

significant number of flats available in various estates,

it  might  be  better  and  more  convenient  to  conduct

separate exercises.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo:</b> Sir, I would like to ask a

question, but it is not related to this question.  It  is

regarding HDB's policy for upgraders.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Can I suggest we leave it to some other

day because we have got some other questions that we have

to deal with?

<div align="center"><b>SUPREME COURT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Operating costs)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Law

(a)  whether  the  cost of operating  the  Supreme  Court

increased significantly in the 1990s; and (b) if so,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2029</b></font><br><br>



which  items  were responsible for the increase  and  the

amounts involved.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Law):</b> Sir, the cost

of  operating the Supreme Court is higher today  than  in

1990.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total operating costs increased from $12.8 million

in  FY 1990 to $46 million in FY 1997.  It has fluctuated

thereafter,  first falling to $37.5 million in  FY  1999,

then rising to $47.4 million in FY 2000, and then dipping

to $45 million in FY 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Expenditure on Manpower or EOM is the largest

component  of operating expenditure, fluctuating  between

70%  and  86%  of  annual operating  expenditure.   These

include    the   salaries   of   the   Judges,   Judicial

Commissioners and other judicial officers and staff.  EOM

increased  from $9.6 million in FY 1990 to $34.9  million

in  FY  1997, and has then fluctuated, first  falling  to

$27.4 million in FY 1999 and then rising to $34.9 million

in FY 2000, and then dipping to $31.5 million in FY 2001.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, I wonder why

there  was this cost increase which I understand was  the

reason  for  the recent increase in court fees.   Sir,  I

understand  that  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Subordinate

Courts has been increased from $100,000 to $250,000,  and

also  the divorce cases were moved from the Supreme Court

to  the  lower courts.  So, I guess the workload for  the

Supreme  Court would be lesser, but why the  increase  in

manpower cost?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Sir, with the implementation and usage of

IT  for  the  Supreme  Court, eg, the  Electronic  Filing

System,  I thought this system should have increased  the

efficiency and thereby lower the costs.  So why the  cost

increase in spite of all these improvements?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, the manpower

expenditure of the Supreme Court has increased over a 10-year  period.   It is important to see the  increases  in

perspective.  When the Chief Justice first

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2030</b></font><br><br>



became the Chief Justice in 1990, all of us know that  he

implemented, at the outset, not suddenly, but  gradually,

a  whole  array  of  reforms, which has  transformed  our

courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1990, there were 12 Judges and Judicial

Commissioners.   There was a big backlog of  cases,  some

going  back  to 5-10 years.  So in order to expedite  the

hearing of these cases, and to increase the efficiency of

the courts, and he has done that over these 10 years,  we

appointed more Judges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appointment of the Judges is also considered in

the  context of the case-load.  That is why you will  see

that  the  EOM actually fluctuates, going to  a  high  in

1997,  and then in fact dipping over the last 2-3  years.

That  is  because  the  number  of  Judges  and  Judicial

Commissioners  has also fluctuated.   So  when  the  vast

majority  of  the cases had been cleared, you  would  see

that  the  number  of  Judges and Judicial  Commissioners

peaked  at 21 in 1998 and today it is only 13.  So,  that

is  the  first  point.  We must not begrudge  the  courts

this  expenditure because, as Mr Low must well know,  our

courts  have  scored  very highly in  many  international

polls and surveys.  So the reputation of our courts is  a

key economic asset.  That, I think, is important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, EFS has been introduced. But that really has

to  do with how documents are filed.  In other words, the

efficiency  is  in  the  legal  process.   In  terms   of

efficiency  of  the courts, yes, that has also  increased

with technology.  But, ultimately, whatever technology is

introduced,   we  do  need  good  Judges   and   Judicial

Commissioners.   In other words, the manpower  cost  will

still  be  there.   We  should not  apologise  for  these

salaries which are well spent.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> The Minister of State says that

the   efficiency   of   the  legal   process,   ie,   the

implementation of EFS, should be differentiated from  the

efficiency  of the courts.  Can he explain  what  is  the

difference between them?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> When we talk about

efficiency of the courts, Sir, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2031</b></font><br><br>



are  looking at it from various angles.  EFS is only  one

component that was introduced in the last 4-5 years.   In

fact, we have just  completed  the phasing in of the EFS.

When the Chief Justice took over in 1991 and started  his

reforms, his reforms were more deep-seated, spanning, for

example,  case management, doing away with archaic  civil

procedure rules, and introducing a mindset change,  where

besides oral advocacy, there was more emphasis on written

advocacy, in other words, submissions, to ensure that the

lawyers do not waste court time unnecessarily.  All these

measures  enhanced  the  way in  which  cases  are  heard

through  the court system, and that is what is  meant  by

the  efficiency of the court system.  These are not  just

based on one system.  If Mr Low had been listening to the

Chief  Justice's Opening of the Legal Year  speech  every

year, he would have seen what we have talked about.  When

we  talk  about  the efficiency of the court,  it  really

straddles   many  of  these  fundamentals  and  important

changes  which, like I have said, have helped our  courts

gain widespread recognition and a good standing, not just

in Singapore, but also in the region and world-wide.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I understand that the

explanation for the recent increase in the Supreme  Court

fees  was  due to cost increases.  Does the  Minister  of

State  think that the increases are justified in view  of

the cost increases?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I think this

question  is  tied  in with the one that  I  will  answer

afterwards  -  Mdm Halimah's question - in terms  of  the

recent  court increases.  In fact, my answer will explain

it very clearly.  It is a very focused approach.  It will

not  affect many Singaporeans, and it has been done, many

years   after   the  court's  hearing   fees   had   been

implemented.   So  it  is not as  though  that  with  the

increased  operating costs of the courts, we  have  upped

these  hearing  fees  to  offset the  increases  per  se,

because   right  now,  despite  these  increases,   court

services are still

increases,  let  me  assure her and the  House  that  the

ability  of low income Singaporeans to pursue  claims  in

court hearing fees.

opened   the   Legal  Year,  allayed  the   concerns   of

Singaporeans  in  this  regard.   This  is  because   the

majority  of  civil cases involving ordinary Singaporeans

are  cases  involving actions for damages  for  death  or

personal  injuries,  family or matrimonial  cases,  cases

involving  adoption of children, guardianship of  infants

or  the maintenance of parents.  All these types of cases

are not subject to court hearing fees.  The Criminal

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2033</b></font><br><br>



Procedure Code does not impose hearing fees for  criminal

matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, and this is an important point, the recent

increase  in  court fees only affects  litigants  in  the

Supreme  Court, which constitutes a very small percentage

of  all our court users.  Only about 3.4% of writs  filed

in  2002  were filed in the High Court.  The  Subordinate

Courts handled an overwhelming majority of 96.6% of civil

cases   in   Singapore  in  2002.   Hence,  a  negligible

proportion of the population is actually affected by  the

fee  increases.  In addition, about 70% of the  litigants

in the High Court are corporations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further safeguard is that the Registrar has the

power  to waive or defer the payment of hearing  fees  in

genuine cases of hardship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Halimah also asked, Sir, in part 2 and part 3 of

her  question,  about legal aid, and how  the  legal  aid

impacts  the  Singaporeans,  particularly  lower   income

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Legal Aid Bureau extended assistance to

16,248 persons between April 1999 and March 2002.   Since

the  means test for legal aid was last revised  in  April

2001, there has been a substantial increase in the number

of  persons who have been granted legal aid.  In FY 2001,

6,571  persons  were granted legal aid,  as  compared  to

4,968 persons in FY 2000 and 4,709 persons in FY 1999, in

other words, an increase of 40% from 1991 to 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also a substantial increase in the

percentage  of applicants who successfully qualified  for

legal  aid.  In FY 1999, 66% of applicants qualified  for

legal  aid.  This increased to 70.7% in FY 2000 and 81.2%

in  FY  2001, in other words, less applicants were turned

away.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these improved statistics, it is too early to

further  revise the current income limit for  legal  aid,

which  was  last  revised only 21  months  ago.   But  as

Members  are well aware, the Ministry of Law reviews  the

means test continually and will adjust, when necessary.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2034</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the final part of her question, ie, on

mediation   and  other  alternative  dispute   resolution

processes,  in other words, litigants who  want  to  have

their  disputes settled have other viable means to settle

these disputes and need not necessarily just turn to  the

court  for  litigation, because over the past few  years,

both  the  Ministry of Law and the courts  have  actively

promoted mediation as an alternative to litigation  as  a

means  of settling commercial and relational disputes  in

the  community.  In addition, the Small Claims  processes

provide  a  speedy mechanism to settle a  wide  range  of

contractual claims of up to $10,000 in quantum,  at  very

low cost, and indeed up to $20,000 if the parties agree.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, of course, there is community mediation,

spearheaded  by  the Ministry of Law, since  1998,  where

community   mediators  have  mediated  more  than   1,000

mediation  sessions.   Of these,  75%  of  disputes  were

successfully resolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Supreme Court, during pre-trial conferences,

the   Registrar  discusses  with  parties   the   various

alternative  dispute  resolution  processes  and   refers

appropriate cases to mediation.  Since the setting up  of

the  Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC) in August 1997,  it

has  handled 910 cases.  Of these cases, about 770  cases

were commenced in the courts but the parties subsequently

turned to mediation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Subordinate Courts, mediation is an integral

part  of the justice system and is widely used to resolve

disputes.    Through  its  Multi-Door   Courthouse,   the

Subordinate Courts provide information to parties to help

them  decide  on the most appropriate dispute  resolution

forum  for their case.  And the Subordinate Courts indeed

has  introduced other innovative processes such  as  E@dr

where  disputing parties with email accounts can mutually

turn  to  for  mediation under the guidance  of  a  court

mediator, without filing a court action; or Court Dispute

Resolution or CDR, where a Judge helps parties to  arrive

at a mutually satisfactory solution to their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2035</b></font><br><br>



case by providing a neutral evaluation; and thirdly a pre-action  protocols pilot scheme covering non-injury  motor

accident  cases where parties are required  to  follow  a

procedure   to   disclose  all  relevant  documents   and

negotiate  to  settle  the case  before  filing  a  court

action.

<div align="center"><b>THREAT OF TERRORISM</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House (a) acknowledges that the terrorist

threat to Singapore is real and serious; (b) supports the

firm  actions the Government has taken against the threat

to   the  security  of  Singapore  posed  by  the  Jemaah

Islamiyah  group and other militant and extremist  groups

in  the region; and (c) endorses the recommendations  put

forth  in the White Paper on The Jemaah Islamiyah Arrests

and the Threat of Terrorism, contained in Paper Cmd. 2 of

2003,  to  counter the terrorist threat by (i)  enhancing

the  security  measures;  (ii)  policing  the  spread  of

terrorist and extremist ideology; and (iii) strengthening

our social cohesion and religious harmony.



<br><br><i>Why the White Paper?</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people wonder why the Government wants to issue

a  White  Paper  on the Jemaah Islamiyah  or  JI  and  on

terrorism.   They  felt  that so much  has  already  been

shared  and discussed publicly.  Leaders from the  Muslim

and   non-Muslim   groups  have  openly  declared   their

rejection  of terrorism and their commitment to  preserve

Singapore's social cohesion.  What else is there  to  say

and how many more times do we have to say it before the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2036</b></font><br><br>



issue can be laid to rest?  Some believe that if we  talk

about   the issue so often publicly, and now debating  it

in  Parliament, we will provoke more anxieties and fears,

especially among non-Muslims, and this will undermine the

social  cohesion instead of strengthening  it.    Foreign

investors  may also be frightened away.  There  are  also

those  who  feel that we should put the whole JI  episode

behind us and move on and not start the brand new year on

such a sober and serious note.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are all natural concerns. Right from the

start  of  the JI episode, the Government had to  grapple

with the issue of how much to say and to make public.  We

had to decide whether to give as much details as possible

to  the  public  or  to keep it to  a  minimum  to  avoid

possibly creating alarm and panic among our citizens.  We

chose  to  share  as much as we can without  compromising

investigations because the Government realised  that  the

JI  episode was not an isolated, once-off phenomenon but,

in  fact,  symptomatic  of the  terrorist  wave  that  is

confronting the world today.   To say little is  to  live

in denial of this reality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in January 2002, we decided that we must engage

our  people  openly but sensitively on  this  issue.   We

needed to ensure that the public revelations of the  case

did  not  lead to knee-jerk reactions by Muslims or  non-Muslims  which would impair our social cohesion  and,  at

the  same time, squarely confront the issue and not skirt

around it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior officers from the Internal Security

Department (ISD) met and briefed Muslim community leaders

about  the case before it went public.  This was to alert

them about the case.  They were even told some aspects of

the  case  which, at that time, could not be made  public

yet.   We  wanted to assure these leaders  that  the  ISD

investigation and security operation were focused against

a  group  of  extremists who had turned to terrorism  and

were not investigations against Islam

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2037</b></font><br><br>



or  our  Muslim  community.  The Prime  Minister  himself

chaired two sessions attended by over 1,700 community and

religious  leaders each time in January and October  last

year  to discuss the issues and to address some anxieties

and concerns which quite naturally surfaced after the two

groups of arrests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our religious and community leaders subsequently

played  a major part in addressing anxieties and concerns

on  the ground and ensuring that there was no mischievous

or  speculative misreading of the JI case.  I believe the

fact  that  we  have so far weathered this  threat  as  a

society  fairly well is due, to a significant extent,  to

their  efforts in holding the ground, helping to maintain

calm   and  facilitating  rational  responses   and   not

emotional or irrational reactions among our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are not out of the woods yet. The threat of

terrorism  is  the single most dangerous security  threat

Singapore  has faced since the threat of communism.   All

countries in the world face this terrorist threat  today;

no country is immune.  Singapore is no exception.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Government and as a people, we have always

taken the approach of facing our problems, be it economic

recession or terrorism, squarely and soberly. We need  to

de-sensitise  the awkward and difficult issues  and  talk

about  them openly and dispassionately so that we may  be

better  able then to grapple with and manage  them.   So,

although the JI and terrorism subject remains a difficult

one  even  now,  we must continue to be able  to  discuss

rationally  with our different communities in  Singapore,

the threat posed and its implications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, while I understand the concerns of those

who  feel that we should not discuss the JI issue in this

House,  I also strongly believe that there is no avoiding

us  taking  this  road of public discussion  because  the

threat  is  far  from over.  To believe otherwise  is  to

deceive  ourselves at our own peril.  For these  reasons,

the Government decided to release a White Paper.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2038</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope that the White Paper will not only give all

Singaporeans a comprehensive account of our experience so

far  in dealing with terrorism but also establish, across

our  various  communities, a common appreciation  of  the

complex nature of this threat.  It is complex because  it

rides   on  an  ideological  agenda  which  exploit   and

manipulate Islam.  It is not about Islam but about  those

terrorist  groups  and  individuals  who  distort  it  to

justify  their cause and terrorist acts.  It  is  complex

because its sources are not inside but outside Singapore.

Against  the  backdrop of a fuller understanding  of  the

threat,  the White Paper also seeks to explore practical,

even if difficult, directions we should consider in order

to deal with this threat as a society and as a people.

<br><br><i>The Nature of and Response to the Threat</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now spell out briefly the nature of the

threat  that we are facing and how we are addressing  it.

As  detailed in the White Paper, we believe that we  have

to  deal  with the threat from groups like  JI  on  three

levels.

<br><br><i>Threat to National Security</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the threat to National Security. The first

level  of threat is one of national security.  Since  the

discovery of JI in Singapore, ISD's priority has been  to

prevent  bombs  from going off here.  The  actions  since

December   2001   have  significantly   neutralised   the

terrorist  threat  locally.  By crippling  the  local  JI

network,   we   have  disrupted  their   operations   and

dismantled their local infrastructure.  Nevertheless, the

investigation  continues to focus on  ferreting  out  all

those  who  are  linked to the JI network and  preventing

them from re-grouping.  The investigation into the second

group of arrests in August last year revealed significant

links  between  the  JI network and other  terrorist  and

militant groups in the region.  These have to be  pursued

systematically and tenaciously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have stepped up the level of security protection

throughout Singapore.  We

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2039</b></font><br><br>



have   increased  defensive  security  measures  at   key

installations and buildings like the Changi Airport,  our

border  checkpoints, important Government and  commercial

buildings,  and  oil and water installations.   By  April

this year, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority will

be set up to ensure comprehensive and effective checks at

sea,  air  and  land  checkpoints  under  one  integrated

command.   Over  the next few months, we  will  begin  to

deploy  air  marshals  on  board Singapore  Airlines  and

SilkAir flights.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stringent measures are necessary to prevent the

entry of foreign terrorist elements and those who want to

help  them.  Singaporeans and tourists and other visitors

have   had  to  deal  with  some  inconvenience  at   the

checkpoints  but  I believe that Singaporeans  understand

the  need for these measures and are prepared to  put  up

with  some  inconvenience in return for better  security.

But,   as  far  as  possible,  we  want  to  ensure  that

Singaporeans  do  not  have to  change  their  lifestyles

drastically for fear of their safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has done and will continue to do

whatever  it  can  to  secure Singapore  and  to  protect

Singaporeans.  However, Singapore alone cannot  eliminate

terrorism or even the JI network in the region.  The JI's

regional   character  and  the  Al-Qaeda's  international

character   and   its  links  to  a   web   of   militant

organisations  world-wide mean that countries  must  work

together to defeat terrorism.  ISD has readily shared its

intelligence  on  the  JI and its investigation  findings

with  all its liaison partners in the region and  beyond.

This  included early leads on JI networks in the  various

mantiqis    (districts)   covering    Malaysia/Singapore,

Indonesia,  Mindanao/Sabah  and  Australia.   Our   early

detection of the identities used by "Mike", the JI  bomb-maker and "Sammy", the Al-Qaeda operative, in the plot to

mount truck-bomb attacks against targets in Singapore led

to the arrests of these terrorists in the Philippines and

in Oman.  We have given access to investigators

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2040</b></font><br><br>



from Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia  and

the  United  States to question relevant JI detainees  in

Singapore.   We are committed to continue to  assist  and

cooperate as best as we can with all foreign partners who

are serious in wanting to deal with this common threat.

<br><br><i>Threat to Muslim Community</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second level of threat of

terrorism  is  one directed at  our Muslim  Singaporeans.

The  actions  of the few in the JI have the potential  of

sowing  mistrust among non-Muslims towards  Muslims.   We

must  zealously  guard  against this.   Many  of  the  JI

detainees  regretted  that their actions  have  not  only

distressed their families but have also "disgraced" their

fellow Muslims and their religion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More fundamentally, the threat which the JI poses to

Muslim  Singaporeans  lies in the JI  members  portraying

themselves  as  having arrived at  the  "true  Islam"  as

opposed,  in  their  view, to the  religious  instruction

given  in  mainstream  Muslim society  in  Singapore.   A

consistent  finding  by the teams  of  psychologists  who

interviewed the JI detainees was that most of them joined

the  JI  organisation through religious classes in search

of  deeper  religious knowledge.  Through such  religious

classes,  the JI was able to talent-spot and recruit  its

followers.   These potential members were then  taught  a

doctrine of violent jihad (holy struggle) which persuaded

them  to  dedicate their lives to the  cause  of  God  in

support  of  or  in direct participation in  violent  and

terrorist activities against the enemies of Islam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, the "enemies of Islam", according to the

JI, was the Indonesian Government as the JI's concept  of

a   Daulah   Islamiyah   was   confined   to   Indonesia.

Subsequently,  with exposure to the Afghan  War  and  Al-Qaeda terrorist training both in ideological and material

terms, the JI leaders expanded their vision to a regional

one which included Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2041</b></font><br><br>



Mindanao.  If the aim of achieving such an agenda was  by

dakwah  (missionary work), there would  be  no  terrorist

problem  today.   However, their means  to  achieve  this

vision was by force of arms or violence rationalised as a

jihad   which  they  claim  Muslims  are  duty-bound   to

undertake.  This led groups like the JI to also subscribe

to  the  globalised  religious  war  which  the  Al-Qaeda

preached  against  the  United  States  and  its  Western

allies.  That was why the local JI was willing to be  Al-Qaeda  proxies  in October 2001 to prepare  to  mount  an

attack  against  American and other  foreign  targets  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore JI leader, Ibrahim

Maidin,  told  a  senior ISD officer  that  he  regretted

agreeing  to  assist in the Al-Qaeda plan to mount  truck

bomb attacks in Singapore in 2001.  The fact that the  JI

network  was  exposed  and the plot  thwarted,  he  felt,

reflected that God was not in favour of it.  However, the

second  group of arrests in August 2002, showed that  the

threat  posed  by the JI was not solely in  its  being  a

willing  proxy  of the Al-Qaeda.  The  JI's  plan  for  a

regional  Daulah Islamiyah to be achieved  by  force  and

terror  was  quietly and systematically pursued.   Dakwah

units  were converted into operation units.  Male members

were sent for military training; preparatory training was

conducted  in  Malaysia and armed training was  conducted

with  Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and with the  Moro  Islamic

Liberation  Front (MILF) in Mindanao.  Secret operational

cells were formed and were tasked by the JI leadership in

Johor  to conduct reconnaissance of targets suitable  for

attack  in  the  future.  This was not  in  some  distant

future;  they  were supposed to execute  their  plans  in

2004, which is next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JI's strategic blue-print for action is

contained  in  a secret document called the Pedoman  Umum

Perjuangan   Jemaah  Islamiyah,  which   means   "General

Guidelines  on  the  Struggle of the  Jemaah  Islamiyah".

Like its mentor, the Al-Qaeda, the JI is a determined and

highly organised body which systematically collected  and

documented  information and knowledge like  how  to  make

bombs,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2042</b></font><br><br>



how  to  conduct  training  and  assess  suitability   of

candidates, how to avoid detection by the authorities and

so  on.  The  JI  is in fact a knowledge-based,  learning

organisation.   Among the documents we have  obtained  so

far  are  several training manuals, including  a  35-page

bomb-making manual written in Malay.  Some of  the  other

documents are written in Malay, Bahasa Indonesia,  Arabic

and even English.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The degree of radicalisation of the JI organisation,

and the sophistication of its tradecraft derived from the

Al-Qaeda, was a surprise to many.  Indeed, no country was

aware  of  the JI as a terrorist organisation  until  the

exposure of the network in Singapore following the  first

group of arrests by ISD in December 2001.  However,  what

was  the  most  shocking and saddest  discovery  for  all

Singaporeans  must be the fact that the JI  was  able  to

recruit  some  Singaporeans who were  prepared  to  stage

terrorist actions inside Singapore which would injure and

kill other Singaporeans, Muslims as well as non-Muslims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did such Singaporeans who were by no means

marginalised or ignorant wind up this way?  Many  of  the

detainees  now regretted their actions and attributed  it

to  their  blind  loyalty  to  their  leaders  and  their

teachings.   They  were in search of religious  knowledge

but got sucked into a militant ideology and were infected

by  its hatred and radical and violent values.  A few had

some  doubts but they felt they were too deeply  involved

to   withdraw.   Moreover,  they  had  taken   oaths   of

allegiance,  or the bai'ah, to their leaders  which  were

sworn  in the name of God and feared retribution if  they

should betray their vows.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the rest of Southeast Asia, Singapore has also

been  touched  by  the  religious  revivalism,  including

Islamic  revivalism, seen in the world since  the  1970s.

In  the  Islamic  world, a few events have  been  key  in

defining the contours of political activism.  While  most

of its manifestations were non-violent even if assertive,

in some cases, political

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2043</b></font><br><br>



extremism  led  to terrorism.  The Middle  East  conflict

(1948  to  now)  has  spawned many radical  militant  and

terrorist  groups  and is likely to continue  to  sustain

them  so long as the political conflict remains unchanged

there.   The Iranian Revolution (1979) saw the successful

establishment  of a purist Islamic theocracy  and  was  a

source  of inspiration to many Muslim communities in  the

world.   However,  it  also  inspired  a  resurgence   of

competition by Saudi-based groups which promoted an Arab-based  culture  and  its interpretation  of  Islam.   The

Soviet-Afghan War (1979-1989) was another watershed event

which  saw a superior Soviet military succumbing  to  the

Muslim  mujahidin (warriors) who had come from all  parts

of  the  world.   The outcome gave hope that  they  could

stand  up  to the superpowers.  However, an aftermath  of

that  war  was the growth and development of the Al-Qaeda

and  its  links  through  the  Afghan  veterans  into  an

international  network  which  unified  and   radicalised

militant  groups broadly under its globalised  agenda  of

religious  war against the United States and its  Western

allies  while, at the same time, significantly  developed

their  operational terrorist capacities.  Our Singaporean

JI  members belonged to an organisation which was part of

this   broader  network  and  which  made  it   a   ready

operational instrument for the Al-Qaeda.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a backdrop which we cannot ignore. Our

Muslim  Singaporeans  cannot hope to  be  insulated  from

developments in the Muslim world any more than  Christian

or  Buddhist  or  Hindu Singaporeans  can  be  completely

untouched by developments among their religious  brethren

elsewhere.  However, while it is natural for us  to  feel

empathy  for the plight or sufferings of  fellow Muslims,

Christians,  Buddhists or Hindus,  it  is  quite  another

thing altogether to do so by crossing the line to support

extremist violence and terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me state here clearly and

without ambiguity for the record that this Government has

no problems with religious piety, whichever the religion.

But

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2044</b></font><br><br>



we  will  not tolerate the use of violence to  perpetrate

any  cause   -  be it religious or political or whatever.

While Muslim Singaporeans know where to draw the line and

know that their empathy should not translate into support

for or participation in violence, the JI episode tells us

not only that a few have strayed across the line, it also

points to the vulnerability of others like them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The core of the JI and current terrorist threat is

ideological  because its ability to recruit  members  and

get  them to participate in its terrorist agenda  resides

in  its  leaders' ability to manipulate Islamic doctrines

to rationalise such action.  The first real target of the

JI and the current terrorist threat is therefore actually

our  Muslim  community because this is  the  constituency

which  is  being targeted by the JI for its  recruitment.

There  is  a need for our Muslim religious and  community

leaders  to  explore how they can protect  the  community

against  such a threat.  The White Paper recommends  that

rather than the Government intervening in this arena,  it

is  best  that  the community devise ways  and  means  to

police  the  threat  and  prevent radical  and  extremist

teachings from subverting our mainstream religious  order

or  bodies.  This must be pursued in a manner which  does

not  impair the legitimate religious beliefs or  pursuits

of  the  community.  The approach should seek to  consult

and  involve  as  many  of  our religious  and  community

leaders  as  possible  to develop structures  or  schemes

which are practical, realistic and robust.  I believe  we

have  good  and  reputable religious scholars  among  our

people.  They should be encouraged to give clear and firm

guidance  to  the  community on the issue  of  terrorism.

While we may disagree on some issues, we cannot afford to

be divided on the issue of terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, all these measures, no matter how

comprehensive,  may not be fool-proof.  Nevertheless,  we

need  to  make the effort.  For instance, we embrace  the

knowledge that the Internet can provide but we also  have

to tolerate the smut and trivia that it contains.  So one

way we guard ourselves and our children is with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2045</b></font><br><br>



filters.  Similarly, while our Muslims absorb all that is

good  and  right in their faith, they will also  have  to

find a way to filter out the dangerous.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Muslim Singaporeans should not feel defensive.

Indeed, they have nothing to be defensive about.  I  know

this  is  sometimes easier said than done;  but  we  must

persevere.  In fact, this is a sentiment which our  older

Chinese-educated  Singaporeans can  well  identify  with.

Many   of  our  Chinese-educated  Singaporeans  did  feel

themselves  suspect  and  under  scrutiny,  or   in   the

spotlight, as they say, when the threat of communism  was

rife and communists were nearly all Chinese-educated.  To

combat  the  communist threat at the time, the Government

took  tough  measures. But we were able to show  that  we

were  not against the Chinese-educated that we wanted  to

win  over from the radicalised politics of revolution  by

violence.  And  we eventually succeeded  in  winning  the

overwhelming  of the Chinese-educated.  Most Singaporeans

would  recall  that  until  just  about  10  years   ago,

Singaporeans  faced severe restrictions in their  travels

to  the  People's Republic of China (PRC).  It  was  only

from  1972 that group tours to the PRC were allowed  but,

even  then,  Singaporeans under the age of  30  were  not

allowed to join these tours.  It was not until 1984  that

Singaporeans were allowed to individually visit  the  PRC

for  business  or  to visit relatives without  having  to

produce  documentary  proof.  The  documentary  proof  we

asked them was a letter, an introduction, and so on.   It

was   not  until  1987  that  Singaporeans  could  pursue

academic studies in the PRC.  Endorsements of Singaporean

passports for visits to the PRC were discontinued only in

1992, barely 11 years ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we learn from the past. In the

same  way  we will win over the overwhelming majority  of

our  Singapore Muslims to be an active part of a tolerant

multi-racial, multi-religious Singapore, by demonstrating

that  our  policies are directed against the deviant  few

who are distorting the tenets of Islam for their aims  of

converting Singapore to become a part of "Daulah  Islam",

an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2046</b></font><br><br>



Islamic  state  in  Southeast Asia.  In confronting  this

terrorist   threat,  the  Government  would  rather   not

intervene with measures directly but instead prefer  that

the  community's leadership together with  MUIS  (Islamic

Religious  Council of Singapore) be given the opportunity

to  take  the  lead.   The  Government  has  assured  the

community that it will give whatever support is  required

to facilitate their efforts in this endeavour.

<br><br><i>Threat to National Cohesion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third level of threat which terrorism poses

is a challenge to our national cohesion.  One of the most

critical  issues  that the White Paper wants  to  impress

upon  everyone  is that terrorism is a national  problem,

not  just  something which involves the Muslim community.

For  the non-Muslims, we have to convince them that Islam

is  not the problem and that they should continue to work

with  and befriend Muslims as they have previously.  They

must  also  guard  against irrational prejudices  arising

from anxieties related to the JI episode.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JI's aim is to cause ethnic strife in Singapore

and  divide us as a nation.  Hambali, the Al-Qaeda point-man  and JI operations commander, was certainly aware  of

the  likely  strains to ethnic relations if a  bomb  goes

off.   He understood well that race and religion are  our

natural  fault-lines and he thought that he could exploit

this  for  his  purposes.   He  was  planning  to  attack

Singapore  targets and make these attacks look like  they

were  carried out by Muslims in Malaysia.   He  hoped  to

create  hostility not just between Singapore and Malaysia

but  also  between Muslims and non-Muslims in  Singapore.

He  wanted to create an environment of hate and suspicion

so  that  Muslim and non-Muslim Singaporeans  would  turn

against one other.  If he had succeeded, Singapore  would

have imploded with communal violence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even without bombs going off, if we allow the

JI  episode  to  create discord, suspicion  and  distrust

among ourselves, we would have played right into the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2047</b></font><br><br>



terrorists'   hands.   Although  there  has   been   some

awkwardness between Muslims and non-Muslims in  Singapore

since  the JI arrests, especially in the initial periods,

Singaporeans  have generally reacted to  the  JI  arrests

rationally.    In  fact,  after  the  JI  arrests,   many

individual  Singaporeans instinctively  sympathised  with

Muslim Singaporeans whom they knew would be subjected  to

even  more stress and scrutiny through no fault of  their

own.   On  their  own and quietly with  no  publicity  or

fanfare,  some Singaporeans have tried to do their  part.

This has not been revealed before but that the very first

few Singaporeans who contributed money to the families of

the  JI  detainees  were four Chinese businessmen.   When

approached, they immediately donated a total  of  $20,000

to help these families.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has since 11 September 2001 and the

JI   arrests  intensified  efforts  to  increase   common

understanding between the different ethnic and  religious

groups.   One of the first concrete plans the  Government

put  in  place  was  the  establishment  of  Inter-Racial

Confidence  Circles  (IRCCs) to bring together  religious

and  community  leaders to build trust and  understanding

among  different groups.  Harmony Circles (HCs) are being

formed in schools, workplaces and local organisations  to

reach  out to more people.  All these are on top of  what

the  grassroots bodies have been doing on a regular basis

to promote inter-cultural activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has suggested that religious

groups  in  Singapore adopt a Code of Religious  Harmony.

This  code is not meant to bind individuals or groups  to

its strict prescriptions in an iron clad fashion.  It  is

more  a  code to remind ourselves that we are  relatively

free  to  practise our religions and beliefs  in  a  safe

environment.   This  precious freedom,  however,  is  not

absolute;  there  are  limits, and necessarily  so  in  a

secular  multi-ethnic  state like  Singapore.   If  every

community  pushes  for the maximum, then  inevitably  the

majority will overwhelm and subjugate the minorities.  It

is mutual restraint and tolerance and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2048</b></font><br><br>



strength of the bonds which unify the races in the common

spaces  which  would  determine the  extent  of  relative

freedom for each ethnic community which our society as  a

whole can accommodate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some critics have said that the activities of the

IRCCs  and  HCs  are  superficial  and  that  these   are

artificial constructs which cannot be expected to  really

foster understanding among Singaporeans.  It is true that

these    are   conscious   and   deliberately   developed

structures.   These  are vehicles  which  hopefully  will

steer  and mobilise participation over a sensitive social

area  in  an awkward time.  I agree that it will  all  be

ineffective  if  these efforts begin  and  end  with  the

Government.  What we hope to do is to set the tone and to

create the opportunities for Singaporeans to think  about

and   to   promote  interaction.   Ultimately,   however,

Singaporeans themselves must individually make the effort

to build meaningful relationships with each other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the terrorist attacks on the United States in

September 2001, the world has intensified its scrutiny of

Islam  because Osama Bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda professed

themselves  to be good Muslims who perpetrated  terrorism

for the good of Islam.  As a result, Muslims all over the

world have found themselves in the spotlight.  They  find

themselves in the position of having to demonstrate their

non-support of terrorist actions and, at the  same  time,

defend against prejudices which may see Islam as a  faith

of  the  violent rather than of the peaceful.  Our Muslim

Singaporeans have not been spared from this trauma.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fortunately for us, our Muslim leaders have

dealt   with   the   unwelcome   attention   firmly   and

courageously.   After 11 September, our  Muslim  leaders,

including  Members of Parliament, religious leaders,  and

other community leaders, stood up quickly to issue strong

statements  condemning the acts of  violence.   When  the

detention  of the JI members was made public, they  again

stood up to denounce the JI group's actions.  They

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2049</b></font><br><br>



clarified  that  Islam had nothing to do with  terrorism.

In  a strong show of solidarity and conviction, more than

<br><br>120&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslim  organisations led by Habib  Syed  Hassan  of

Ba'alwie  Mosque  issued in October  last  year  a  joint

statement to condemn terrorism unequivocally.  Our Muslim

leaders'  declaration, as well as our  Malay  Members  of

Parliament's  quick  response, that Islam  and  terrorism

should  not  be linked in any way is critical.   We  have

seen  how,  in  some  parts of the  world,  the  acts  of

terrorism,  whether by Osama or other  groups,  were  not

condemned  but  celebrated.  The JI  episode  could  have

caused  tensions  which  could  undermine  ethnic  trust.

Underlying  all  the reactions of Singaporeans,  whatever

they  have been, is a sense that we must strive to handle

the  problem  rationally and calmly and not  rupture  the

peace that we have invested so much over time in building

up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we recognise that Muslim

Singaporeans, like Muslims elsewhere, face the  difficult

task of debunking stereotypes and prejudices arising from

emotional  and  ill-informed reactions to  terrorism.   I

know  that  it must sometimes be a bit tiresome  for  our

Muslims   to   repeat  their  stand  against   terrorism.

Likewise, we know also that there are non-Muslim  leaders

who  feel the same way about having to reiterate the call

for openness, tolerance and trust.  Some may ask how many

times must we do this.  The answer, I believe, is for  as

long  as  there is a need for a countervailing  voice  to

ensure  that  the  last word heard is  not  that  of  the

extremist  or  the terrorist; for as long  as  there  are

anxieties still festering and prejudices still likely  to

brew  and  congeal  if not checked  and  countered.   The

alternative  is to keep silent and pretend there  are  no

problems  by  looking the other way.  What our  community

leaders  think  and what is percolating at the  emotional

level on the ground must not automatically be assumed  to

be  the  same;  we  must work at ensuring  that  what  is

subscribed  intellectually must also be supported  by  an

emotional  commitment to act accordingly.  The Government

on its part will and must continue to be vigilant against

signs  of  misperceptions of mistrust manifested  on  the

ground.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2050</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, let me summarise what I have just

said.  The Government  decided to issue a White Paper  on

JI  and  terrorism because we cannot afford  to  live  in

denial and delude ourselves that the problem is over.  As

Bali  has shown, the fight against terrorism is far  from

over  and  promises to be a long one.   This  is  largely

because  its  primary  sources  and  causes  lie  not  in

Singapore but elsewhere.  Eradicating them once  and  for

all is not something that we ourselves can do alone.  The

Government has done whatever it can to secure our borders

and  to enhance the security of our people but there  are

no  guarantees.  Nevertheless, in a more dangerous world,

Singapore still remains one of the safest places.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper describes the nature of the threat

in  detail  as  we  want Singaporeans to appreciate  that

global  terrorism in its current form is  a  layered  and

complex  one,  and  is,  at  its  heart,  an  ideological

challenge.   This is a much more difficult  challenge  to

confront  than  the task of trying to stop the  terrorist

acts  themselves.   We are heartened  that  many  of  our

Muslim  leaders have already issued statements to express

their  understanding and support of the White  Paper.   A

key strategy to overcome this challenge is to entrust our

Muslim  community leaders with the role  to  protect  and

guide  the more vulnerable members in the community  from

being misled or subverted by extremist teachings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, this White Paper urges all Singaporeans to

reject   terrorism,  whatever  the   cause.    It   urges

Singaporeans to appreciate that once they accept that, in

some  situations, it is all right to use violence and  to

perpetrate terrorist acts against the innocent  for  some

cause,  religious or political or otherwise,  they  would

have  crossed  the  dangerous line.  This  could  destroy

Singapore as a multi-racial, multi-religious society.  If

a  bomb explodes tomorrow, it would hurt Muslims as  well

as  non-Muslims.   And  the reactions  of  the  different

communities would be different.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2051</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just look at Bali where the terrorist attacks killed

about 200 people.  Immediately, there was tension between

the  majority  who  are Hindus and the minority  who  are

Muslims.   And  they  have  been  living  there  together

peacefully  for  years  without problems.   Take  another

example - Russia.  There are reports that as a result  of

the  hostage-taking  incident by the  Chechen  rebels  in

Moscow, there is now an "Islamophobia" in Russia, despite

the  fact  that Muslims have lived side by side with  the

other  Russians  even in the days of  the  Czars.   These

types  of  reactions were also seen in the United  States

after September 11 and in Australia after Bali.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to prevent fractures in our society of the

kind  that other societies have experienced.  We have  to

realise  that we cannot afford for a bomb to  explode  in

Singapore   before  we  start  asking   ourselves   tough

questions  and  taking measures to enhance  our  national

cohesion.  All Singaporeans must understand and do  their

part as our survival depends on it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the White Paper and this debate in

Parliament  will be scrutinised not only by  Singaporeans

but  also by the world outside.  They will watch  whether

we  are  united  across parties and communities  and  are

determined to deal with the threat or are we divided  and

in  denial, squabbling over secondary issues and  who  to

blame.   Whether our foreign investors will view us  with

confidence or with anxiety will be influenced by  how  we

respond as a Government and as a people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The support of this House for the White Paper and

the  Motion  will reassure our people of the Government's

commitment and firm actions in countering the  threat  of

terrorism and in encouraging our people to press on  with

the efforts of building national cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2052</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I rise

in  support  of the motion standing in the  name  of  the

Minister for Home Affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper contains chilling accounts of the

terrorist  brotherhood in Singapore and  Southeast  Asia.

It   details   how  the  detainees  were  recruited   and

motivated.  It speaks of links that are global.   Indeed,

the brotherhood may be better organised and financed than

the communist clandestine cells of the past.  There are a

few  elements in the Paper that are worth emphasising  so

that  we can see whether the proposed measures are indeed

sufficient to counter the threats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as the Minister has mentioned, we are not

only  dealing  with a local problem, but a  regional  and

indeed  a  global one.  The links that the JI brotherhood

has  with  other  groups in Malaysia, Indonesia  and  the

Philippines  are well developed, and may even  be  closer

than those existing among the law enforcement agencies in

those countries.  If we do not look beyond our shores  in

countering  this threat, we would not be  addressing  the

problem  convincingly.  Any counter-measure that we  take

should also have a regional dimension.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is a volatile and highly dangerous

mixture  of  religious obligation coupled with  political

objectives.   The  White Paper notes  that  the  ultimate

objective  of  the JI is to create a Daulah Islamiyah  in

the region through the use of violence.  There is no room

for  a  secular state in the region.  Indeed,  there  may

also  be  no room for religious toleration and the  like,

unlike,  for  example, the Pancasila of Indonesia,  which

does provide for belief in one supreme God, but which had

been interpreted rather liberally, to allow for religious

freedom.   The plan is therefore ambitious, as  it  would

include Indonesia, Malaysia, south Philippines, Singapore

and Brunei.  This is a scary thought, especially for non-Muslims.   If  such a belief were to take root,  it  will

cause  much misunderstanding and mistrust between Muslims

and   non-Muslims  or,  worse,  creating  a  culture   of

repudiation among

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2053</b></font><br><br>



the  various races and religions.  Again, we  should  see

what  regional initiatives there must be to counter  such

an objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there is the clear acceptance by the

detainees  that religion precedes every other value  they

have.   The  obligation to be law-abiding is subordinated

to  the religious obligation to perform the tasks set out

by  their leaders.  Spiritual compulsion is, as we  know,

more powerful than any other compulsion.  The promise  of

a  better afterlife or the threat of being regarded as an

infidel, have worked to convince the unsure and the faint-hearted  to  accept  the  tasks  that  are  illegal   and

dangerous.  It also allows those who follow this path  to

reconcile  their  having to kill or otherwise  disrupt  a

society  that  had  given  them  prosperity  and   peace.

Religious  fanaticism is really what we are dealing  with

and what we will have to deal with in the future.  Are we

ready to deal with this phenomenon?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, prior to the JI arrests in December 2001 and

August  2002,  the  likelihood of a terrorist  attack  in

Singapore was far from most Singaporeans' minds.  Indeed,

even  after  the  arrests  more recently,  several  young

people  I  spoke to, including university students,  said

they did not think that the terrorist threat here is real

and  serious.   Many felt that the police and  other  law

enforcement agencies are capable enough to nip such plans

in  the bud.  New York and Bali-type attacks, they  said,

were most unlikely to occur.  This is praise for the  law

enforcement  agencies,  but I do  not  think  that  their

attitude  is  one we want to encourage.  I  was  actually

really  taken  aback  when one even suggested  that  when

there  is actually an attack, they will then sit  up  and

take  notice.  Obviously, much more must be done to bring

the reality of the threat home to the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such indifference and complacency are real,

dangerous  and serious.  If we want public vigilance  and

support, we need to bring home to the general public  the

real and present danger of terrorism in Singapore and the

region.   What steps should be taken to ensure  that  the

people

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2054</b></font><br><br>



are more alert and vigilant?  I understand that a booklet

will be published in February to alert the public on  how

to  react  if they see suspicious packages or  the  like.

But  if  they are not conscious of this problem, it  does

not  help, even if we distribute the booklet to  all  the

households  in Singapore.  Of course, at the  same  time,

the  public  must not be unduly alarmed.  Otherwise,  the

drain on the security resources will be even more.  But I

think that the current situation requires some attention,

some  moves  by  the  Government and by  other  community

leaders  to make the general public much more aware  that

the threat is real and serious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper states that it is important to

check  divisive  misgivings and  suspicions  between  the

Muslims  and  the non-Muslims.  It refers to  the  recent

formation  of  Inter-Racial Confidence  Circles  and  the

proposed  Code  of  Religious  Harmony.   These  are,  of

course, good and necessary.  But I do not think that they

would  be enough.  The White Paper on the Maintenance  of

Religious  Harmony  published in 1989  pointed  out  that

there  are two fundamental conditions for social  harmony

in  Singapore.  First, that all practising religions must

exercise  moderation and tolerance,  and  do  nothing  to

cause religious enmity and hatred.  Second, religion  and

politics must be kept rigorously separate.  If we look at

what has been done so far, I think it has more to do with

the first condition than with the second.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the second condition is even more

important  and pertinent in the fight against  terrorism.

Bringing religion into the realm of politics has been the

cause  of  much civil strife and wars in the world  since

ancient  and  medieval  times.   There  are  many  modern

examples  in other countries, such as the IRA in Britain,

the  MILF  in  the  Philippines, and the  Chechen  rebels

mentioned by the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the separation of religion and state is

important in this current debate.  We need to take  steps

to develop a strong belief in the people - all the people

-

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2055</b></font><br><br>



that  a secular state is not just good but necessary  for

Singapore's survival.  How should this be done?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be clear guidance on the political

responsibility,  particularly of  Muslims  in  a  secular

society.  The separation of religion from politics has to

be emphasised.  In this regard, I refer especially to the

joint statement by the hon. Malay Muslim Members of  this

House where they emphasised the need for Muslims to stand

together  against  belligerent theology,  and  to  eschew

violence.  This statement, together with others  made  by

MUIS and other Muslim religious and community leaders, is

a  clear  signal  to the general Muslim  population  that

there must be a separation between religion and politics.

Mixing  the two is, in this context, like mixing  Molotov

cocktails in a multi-racial, multi-religious country like

ours.   It  is an extremely explosive mixture that  could

only  harm.   How do we ensure that there is this  strict

division between religion and politics?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been noted by many scholars that this is not

easy  in  Muslim communities, especially those living  in

the West.  The problem is that Islamic jurisprudence does

not recognise secular law as superior to that of the Holy

Law.  According to scholars, militant Islam also does not

recognise the state as an independent object of  loyalty.

This  is  evident  from the views  expressed  by  the  JI

detainees   as   to  why  they  see  that   violence   is

justifiable, even when they are living in a peaceful  and

prosperous  society.  They have a culture of repudiation,

fuelled  by  being  in  the minority  in  many  of  these

societies.    They   felt  isolated,   disenchanted   and

rejected.   We  should be aware that such feelings  among

the  young would provide a fertile recruitment ground for

the militant leaders intent on changing the status quo.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been mention in several public statements

by  MUIS  and other Muslim leaders that there must  be  a

monitoring and revision of religious

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2056</b></font><br><br>



education  in madrasahs and mosques, so that  belligerent

and deviant Islamic thought that detracts from Islam as a

pious and moderate religion is filtered out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to suggest, in addition, that there

must be a more concretised and centralised approach, such

as a code of political responsibility perhaps to be added

to the Code of Religious Harmony, and that this code must

state  and  maintain clearly the principle of  separation

between  state and religion.  I believe that reading  the

statement  by the Malay-Muslim Members of this House,  it

is  clear  that  their intention is  to  promote  such  a

distinction,  but  it  is  necessary  to  translate  this

statement of intention into something concrete  that  can

be a guide to the general public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And having such a code, I believe, we can inculcate

such  values, especially in the young, so that they  will

learn  to live harmoniously in a secular society, without

sacrificing or compromising their religious beliefs.   We

can  even  incorporate such principles in social  studies

programmes  in schools and colleges.  Here, I am  talking

not just about Muslims, but all people of all faiths.  We

have  to  live in a secular society in Singapore,  and  I

hope  that we can do so, recognising the clear separation

between state and religion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper describes many disturbing features

of  the extensive regional terrorist network in Southeast

Asia,  of  which the JI network in Singapore is but  one.

In  the ASEAN region, different elements of the terrorist

network  operate in countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia

and  the Philippines.  From all accounts, these are  more

developed,  bigger  and better-funded and  better-trained

than  Singapore's JI groups.  Some, like the Moro Islamic

Liberation  Front  in the Philippines, have  secessionist

aims,  and  claim to be fighting for independence.   They

have  fought against regular troops and managed  to  keep

them  at  bay.  Such well-established regional  terrorist

organisations  will have great influence,  if  given  the

opportunity.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2057</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very clear from the White Paper that a

regional  initiative is needed, not just for the security

forces  of  the  region to combine and  act  on  regional

terrorism,   but  also  for  governments  and  mainstream

theological  institutions  to  control  the   spread   of

militant  ideology among the millions of Muslims  in  the

region.  Not only must our chief Islamic leaders denounce

deviant  teachings  that  spread the  terrorist  message,

their  counterparts in Malaysia or Indonesia have  to  do

the same.  Controlling the influx of foreign preachers to

Singapore  is  just one of the ways mentioned.   However,

given  today's  easy accessibility to foreign  resources,

especially  from  the Internet, it is  very  likely  that

militant and deviant teachings could be obtained  without

much difficulty, if they were available elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, should the mainstream and moderate Islamic

leaders  in  the  region  act  in  concert  and  denounce

militant  interpretations of the religion, it will  be  a

powerful force to counter the spread of terrorism in this

region.   Should we therefore not work towards getting  a

declaration from the major Islamic leaders in  the  ASEAN

countries  to  condemn  belligerent  deviant   forms   or

interpretations of Islam?  That would send a clear signal

not  just to local Muslims, but also to everyone else  in

the  world that ASEAN, and Singapore, are keen to  combat

terrorism.  As the Minister has mentioned, this  will  no

doubt  help also improve the confidence not just  of  our

people,  but  of people visiting the region and  business

people.

The  White  Paper has also pointed out that there  was  a

sharing  of information among security agencies  in  each

country.   Of  course,  this must  be  strengthened.   If

terrorists know that there is a strong coordination among

ASEAN  governments to share information and intelligence,

of  course, it will make it much more difficult for  them

to infiltrate and create trouble.  But, perhaps we should

do  more than just sharing of information - there  should

be an attempt to set up joint operations to fight against

terrorism, if that has not already been done.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2058</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to conclude, we must strengthen our society to

stifle  the  threat of terrorism in Singapore.   It  will

take  all that the White Paper recommends, and more.   It

will  take  broader  measures, such  as  providing  equal

opportunities  for  all  in all  sectors,  educating  our

people,  especially the young, on the  correct  political

responsibility,  separation of state  and  religion,  and

pursuing   a  strong  regional  approach  to  fight   the

terrorists  on one united front.  In the final  analysis,

this  debate is not just really about terrorism or public

security,  it  is  a matter that deals  with  fundamental

questions  of  how we organise, grow, and survive,  as  a

multi-racial,  multi-religious society in  this  troubled

region and the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  October  1987,  whilst many others  were  financially

dislocated by the mighty Wall Street crash, my family and

I  had  an  experience  of the terrestrial  kind  in  Los

Angeles.  In a matter of days, we were shaken by a mighty

earthquake  that measured 6 on the Richter  scale,  along

with  several equally earth-shaking aftershocks.   I  can

still  recall  vividly  the  sight  of  the  refrigerator

swaying to and fro with each roll of the earth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earthquake experience left an indelible mark on

our   lives,  as  we  suddenly  realised  that  we   were

vulnerable  to  something that could  inflict  widespread

damage,  and  the  occurrence  of  which  could  not   be

accurately predicted nor prevented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every kid, down to my son who was in preschool

then, was taught what earthquakes were and what steps  to

take when the earth shook, such as getting underneath the

table, running out into open spaces.  I also marvelled at

how the local residents responded and rallied around each

other.   They were not intimidated by the damage  that  a

nasty  earthquake could wreak, but they carried on  their

lives,   fully  aware  that  they  could  face   personal

adversity when it happened.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2059</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, everyone saw the earthquake for what it

was,   paid  attention  to  the  possibilities   of   its

occurrences,  and  was  psychologically  prepared.    The

local  government obviously sprang into action  when  the

earthquake  did  strike,  but they  did  not  act  alone.

People were ready and responded without panic despite the

widespread damage to the highways and personal property.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have used the analogy of the earthquake to

urge all Singaporeans to take a personal interest in  the

terrorist threat, that is both real and serious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countering terrorism is every Singaporean's

responsibility.  We have built this nation from virtually

nothing.  We have achieved this precious level of  racial

and  religious  harmony with a lot of effort.   We  must,

therefore,  as  the Minister had urged,  jealously  guard

what we have as Singaporeans.  It is not enough that  the

Government  is  actively mounting efforts to  prevent  or

ensure preparedness because, like that for an earthquake,

no amount of preparation can insulate us from the effects

of terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the earthquake, terrorism is not a natural

disaster.   Terrorism  is  a  deliberate  act   of   man,

involving violent action for political purpose, according

to the Cambridge International English Dictionary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we may debate on whether we agree with this

definition.   Regardless  of the purpose  for  terrorism,

every  Singaporean must try to see terrorism for what  it

truly is.  We must not be taken in by what it purports to

be, for example, that it is the result or the ambition of

a  particular race or religion, which is being suppressed

or  oppressed.   Sir,  terrorism is terrorism,  pure  and

simple, and when undertaken in Singapore, attacks us as a

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, not only must every Member of this House

support  the motion, but also must every Singaporean  who

cares

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2060</b></font><br><br>



about  Singapore  and  who  treasures  the  cohesion  and

harmony  that  we have painstakingly built  up  over  all

these years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our greatest defence against terrorism is a

cohesive people.  Every Singaporean, regardless  of  age,

race  or  religion, has a responsibility  to  ensure  the

following:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, that we are not intimidated by terrorist

threats or acts, extensive or inhumane, though they  are.

We  will not allow ourselves to be cowed into living  our

lives in dread and fear;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, that we will not be misled by what these

acts  pretend  to be.  We must be clear and mindful  that

terrorism  proponents  frequently attempt  to  masquerade

themselves  as  champions for  a  religious  cause.   For

example, the Jemaah Islamiyah group portrays itself as an

Islamic organisation.  We must always ask ourselves  what

the true motive could be, differentiate carefully and not

jump  to conclusions, as in this case, to wrongly  assume

that all Muslims are somehow involved;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, that we will instead be vigilant and quick

to  dismiss any suggestion or speculation that  there  is

friction between the different racial or religious groups

which has given rise to acts of aggression; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, that we will act as one people, by

consciously  reaching  out to each other  towards  better

understanding  and  trust, and  by  rallying  behind  the

Government against terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to echo my colleagues' sentiments

and suggest that the Government pay special attention  to

educating  the  young on what terrorism is,  and  how  to

respond to threats or acts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I carried out a straw poll on the

recipients  of  the Edusave awards and saw many  clueless

faces  as  I  asked how many of them were  aware  of  the

terrorist threats.  Many have little association to,  nor

appreciation for, what terrorism can

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2061</b></font><br><br>



entail.   I  believe it is vital for them  to  have  some

perspective,  hard though it may be to  explain  some  of

these serious issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have witnessed in many countries how the

different  racial  and religious groups  barely  tolerate

each other and how palpable the lack of trust and harmony

is.   Singapore is truly different, but our current level

of social cohesion does not happen by chance.  We have to

work  at  it.   Whilst  the Government  clearly  has  the

responsibility   for   macro  planning   for   countering

terrorism,  it is in every Singaporean's interest  to  do

his  utmost  to  preserve the precious aspects  of  being

Singaporean.   In this regard, I would like  to  urge  my

fellow Chinese Singaporeans to reach out even more, so as

to  increase our appreciation for the other cultures  and

religions.  As the majority racial group in Singapore, we

have  the responsibility to ensure that we keep  out  any

divisive attempts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I register my full support for the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suspend the Sitting and will

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Othman Haron Eusofe -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Othman Haron Eusofe (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise  in  support of the  motion  moved  by  the

Minister for Home Affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper is helpful to our better

understanding of the terrorist threat to Singapore.   And

this  debate on the White Paper also provides us with  an

opportunity to discuss in a frank and open, yet

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2062</b></font><br><br>



sensitive   way,  our  inter-racial  and  inter-religious

relationship  and  especially  how  we  can  manage   the

realities  on  the ground so that, over the longer  term,

there  is  greater  mutual respect  and  more  trust  and

confidence in each other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the terrorist threat is not just a local

problem but a complex global problem with deep roots  and

driven by forces beyond Singapore.  We must deal with  it

quickly as one united people and in a careful way so that

we  can  strengthen  our  social cohesion  and  religious

harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the terrorist threat stems from the

extremist ideology of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI)  members,

the  contribution of each community  -  Muslim  and  non-Muslim   -   will  make  a  big difference  on  how  this

terrorist  threat  can be effectively  checked.   Let  me

first deal with the contribution of our Muslim community.

Our  Muslim religious and community leaders have and they

must  continue to lead the way and remain steadfast in  a

firm  and unequivocal condemnation of radicalism and  the

use  of  violence.  We have to show that we are  strongly

committed  to  a  moderate approach in the  way  that  we

practise Islam, which is a religion of peace and harmony.

It  must be clear that we are not in sympathy with groups

or individuals who advocate terror and violence.  We must

also show that we are committed to Singapore and be ready

to   reach   out  to  other  Singaporeans  to  strengthen

friendship and understanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on their part, non-Muslim Singaporeans have

also  a  crucial  part  to  play  by  not  allowing   any

misperceptions  arising from the  JI  episode  to  affect

their  attitude towards the Muslims.  We are also shocked

and  disappointed by the disclosure of the JI  operations

and  that  some  Muslim Singaporeans are  involved  in  a

foreign-led  terrorists plot which, if successful,  would

not  only seriously hurt our fellow Singaporeans but also

severely harm our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the JI, as the White Paper has pointed out, is

a small group of misguided

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2063</b></font><br><br>



individuals  and the arrests have severely  curbed  their

ability  to  do  damage,  but it is  imperative  that  we

continue  to remain alert and vigilant and certainly  not

be   complacent.   The  statement  made  by  the   Muslim

religious  and  community  leaders  representing  various

organisations  and mosques, which was issued  before  the

release  of  the White Paper, condemning the JI  and  its

violent   agenda,  should  provide  the  assurance   that

extremism and hatred have no place in Islam.  We must not

let  the JI episode divide us.  If we do so, we will,  by

default,  fall  into  their  trap  to  create  chaos  and

distrust.   Here, the concern is more on the relationship

at  the ground level.  The statements made by the leaders

of the various non-Muslim communities are positive.  Many

of them are in the Inter-Racial Confidence Circles (IRCC)

in  all  our  constituencies and their contribution  will

help  enhance  confidence-building  among  the  different

communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Malay MP colleagues have had many

discussions  with  the  leaders  of  the  various  Muslim

organisations  like the Muslim Religious Council  (MUIS),

the  Singapore  Islamic Scholars and  Religious  Teachers

Association  (Pergas),  MENDAKI,  AMP  and  many   others

including  the  mosque leaders on this issue.   They  had

issued   statements  condemning  JI  and  its   extremist

ideology.   We  have  now to move  beyond  the  issue  of

statements to concrete actions to ensure that our Muslims

will  not  be easily influenced by the ideology of  those

who preach radicalism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper has pointed out that for a

broad-based  approach  to  this problem,  the  Government

requires the cooperation of the Muslim community and also

the wider community of all Singaporeans.  The White Paper

has   proposed  that  the  Muslim  community  develop   a

comprehensive,   self-regulatory   system   to    monitor

religious  education. MUIS, Pergas and also Perdaus  have

issued  statements  on  proposals  to  improve  religious

education and they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2064</b></font><br><br>



want  to  ensure that Muslims are taught correct  Islamic

values  of  moderation, tolerance and mutual respect  and

are not easily misled into extremist teaching.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MUIS has pointed out in its statement that

there  is  the MUIS-Pergas Joint Committee to  facilitate

information sharing and to synergise activities  for  the

development  of  religious  teachers.   Pergas,  in   its

statement,  wants  to  "effectively prevent  the  general

masses   from   being   misled  into  following   deviant

ideologues".   However, in this age of the  Internet,  we

have  also  to  guard  against  extremist  ideology   and

thinking which can be imported into our homes and  living

rooms.   We cannot be insulated from the developments  in

the Middle East and the Muslim world.  While we empathise

with  the  sufferings  of Muslims  elsewhere,  we  cannot

condone  extremism  and the use of violence.   There  may

well  be  injustices against Muslims elsewhere  but  this

does  not mean that we should tolerate extremism and  the

use  of  violence.  Therefore, I would like to  reiterate

that in the fight against terrorism, the Muslim community

must take a clear and unequivocal stand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that there are some issues which the

community would like to see early resolution, but here we

are  facing a serious threat of terrorism and  to  combat

this  threat effectively, we must be united and  strongly

committed  to  Singapore.  There may be problems  but  we

must  make  Singaporeans feel secure  to  enhance  mutual

trust  and confidence.  We must understand that there  is

no  easy  solution  and certainly no quick-fix  solution.

The  JI  episode shows that the understanding and harmony

that we have built carefully over many years can suddenly

come  under  threat.   However, if Singaporeans  practise

mutual respect and moderation in their daily interactions

with   their   fellow  workers,  neighbours   and   other

residents,  we  can  look  forward  confidently  and   be

optimistic that we can, in the future, work on  good  and

appropriate solutions in terms of our social context,  to

solve any issue or problem that we encounter today.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2065</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also imperative that the Muslim religious

and  community leaders move forward together to  urgently

address  other pressing issues that plague the community,

like  improving  the  educational achievements  of  Malay

students and minimising the social ills in the community.

We  must move relentlessly forward to develop a community

of   excellence.    As   our   community   enhances   our

contribution to Singapore's progress in this increasingly

competitive  world, we will help make  Singapore  a  more

secure and happy place for all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in our discussions with the members of the

Malay  community, many of them have repeatedly  expressed

their  anxiety  that  they may  face  difficulty  at  the

workplaces,  especially as our businesses restructure  to

boost  their competitiveness.  They and especially  those

seeking  employment fear that their employment  prospects

will be adversely affected because of the JI episode  and

the  chilling account in the White Paper.  I  think  they

feel  stressed  and insecure.  They would  like  to  see,

therefore,  some form of assurance at the workplace  that

there  would  be  no  discrimination  based  on  race  or

religion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malay MPs have met leaders of the Chinese

Chamber  of Commerce and Industry and also other  leaders

of  the  Chinese  clans and organisations who  understand

these  concerns  and are ready to help  to  dispel  these

fears.  We must ensure that employability is always based

on merit, ability, skills and work attitudes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, we face a serious threat which can

destroy the peace and harmony that we now enjoy.  We  are

fortunate that our security agencies have been alert  and

decisive and the arrests have severely disrupted  the  JI

before  they can do any damage to our society.   But  the

danger is far from being over, and we must continue to be

alert and vigilant.  Above all, we must continue to  make

moderation  a part of our daily lives and strengthen  our

trust and confidence in one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2066</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>THREAT OF TERRORISM</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. Shanmugam (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to speak in support of the White Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of the past year have shown that we are

not immune from the phenomenon of radicalisation of parts

of Muslim societies throughout the world.  As I say that,

let me make one point absolutely clear.  We must not fall

into  the pattern of thinking that radicalisation  has  a

special  association with Islam.  All religions and  many

societies  have their extremists.  They all  abuse  their

religions and societies.  For us now, however, the  White

Paper raises the issue of threats to our society posed by

some  in the name of Islam.  How do we as a society react

to  this?   We consider that one has to bear in mind  the

realities, and those realities are that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) There is little we can do about the wave of

radicalisation  that  is sweeping through  parts  of  the

world, including Islamic societies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) We are not in a position to alter the policies of

larger  countries,  some of which  are  questionable  and

which  are understandably causing deep frustration and  a

sense  of  impotence  among many Muslims  throughout  the

world and catalysing them into reacting.  These reactions

are  being  tapped  into by some leaders  for  thoroughly

sickening ends.  There is little we can do about that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) These global forces and ideas will certainly

impact on our Muslim community.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2067</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what do we do? Do we sit back suspicious of our

Muslim Singaporeans and harbouring silent resentment?  Or

do  we  pretend that everything is all right, nothing  is

happening,  and that life can carry on as it always  has?

Neither  of these are sensible options.  The only  option

which   is  in  the  enlightened  self-interest  of   all

Singaporeans  is to reach across racial lines  and  build

ties  that  bind  us  more closely while  increasing  our

security measures.

There  is a need to build stronger ties because,  at  the

end of the day, the battle is for the mind.  Do we win or

do  the  terrorists win the ideological battle?    If  we

win,  we  cut  terrorism from its base.  One factor  that

will determine the fate of the ideological battle is  the

strength  of  our inter-racial ties.  And  while  I  talk

about  victory, we have to recognise that the  battle  is

not  easy  and there can probably be no complete victory.

It  is  not possible to always or easily triumph for  our

beliefs  based on fate, but we must try.  We have,  as  a

society,  always  tried to increase the strength  of  our

inter-racial ties.  But I think the circumstances are now

more  opportune than they have been for  a  while  to  do

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand that, we have to look at two periods,

pre-September 11, and post-September 11.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-September 11, I felt that the relationship

between the races was moving in the right direction,  but

the  movement  was  slow.  In particular,  there  were  a

number  of  psychological  barriers  between  our  Muslim

Singaporeans and the rest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were a number of reasons for this. I will

deal with two.  First, in our competitive society, by and

large, our Muslim Singaporeans have done less well.  That

built  in  some defensiveness.  Second, I think,  it  was

ingrained  in  the psyche of many, though not  all,  non-Muslim  Singaporeans that somehow our Muslim Singaporeans

were less competitive, and less able.  These feelings and

reactions  were reinforced by the relative insularity  of

the  lives which many Singaporeans lead.  Those who  were

involved

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2068</b></font><br><br>



in  community  work and had to reach across racial  lines

could  overcome such reactions.  But not  many  had  such

opportunities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Muslim Singaporeans, of course, picked up on

those  feelings.  And our Muslim Singapore society  stood

feeling  that it was not adequately respected by sections

of  Singaporean society.  I would add that these are only

my  personal  views, and others may  well  disagree.   We

cannot prove or disprove these things.  We can only  look

straight into our hearts and minds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that for these and other reasons, there

was  a degree of resentment among Muslim Singaporeans and

a reaffirmation of links within the Muslim society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say all this, I do accept that, in formal

terms,   we   have  done  most  things  correctly.    The

Constitution  provides  for  equality,  and  we  practise

meritocracy,  sometimes almost brutally.   But  societies

are   not  built  on  such  formal  institutions   alone.

Feelings and attitudes are also important.  And  at  that

level,  my  view is that many of our Muslim  Singaporeans

did  not  quite  feel that they were  being  accepted  as

equals.   I  believe that we have done better  than  many

countries which have a mixed racial composition.  But the

fault lines and differences are still there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe that these factors contributed to the

psychological barriers that I have referred to.  It  was,

for  example,  difficult  to get Malay  participation  in

community   activities   proportionate   to   our   Malay

population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since September 11th, and more particularly

since  the  JI arrests, there appears to be a  change  in

mood both among Muslim and non-Muslim Singaporeans.  Many

of  our  Muslim Singaporeans appear to have been  shocked

into reacting.  They want to make the point that they are

loyal  Singaporeans.  There is greater  openness.   Malay

organisations have come forward to denounce extremism and

terrorism.  Highly symbolic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2069</b></font><br><br>



visits are being made to places of worship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this context, what should non-Muslim Singaporeans

do?  We have a serious opportunity to rejig the attitudes

that  are  developing.  We have to show, with  sincerity,

that  we  respect  and value our Muslim Singaporeans  and

that  we want to build deep links.  Our own mindsets have

to  change.  We must treat our Muslim Singaporeans in our

heart  of hearts with respect.  We must show empathy  for

their problems but that must not mutate into disrespect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I talk about reaction here, I do not mean the

reaction  of  political leadership, both Malay  and  non-Malay.   At  the  level  of the community  and  political

leadership,  the  issues  have  been  understood.   I  am

referring  to  the  reaction of the Singaporeans  in  the

street.   And  the  situation arises because  unlike  the

leadership, for most Singaporeans, the opportunities  and

need  for  interacting closely and  with  empathy  across

racial  lines  are  limited.   We,  therefore,  need   an

attitudinal  change in all Singaporeans, both  Malay  and

non-Malay.    If  Singaporeans  react  to  Malay   under-performance by saying, "Well, the Malays are less clever,

and  it  is a Malay problem, which we will leave  to  the

Malays  to sort out,"  then we will quickly set into  old

patterns.  We will lose the opportunity that the  present

mood  has  created.  And we will increase  divisions  and

allow  the  ideologies sweeping the world now to  have  a

greater influence on Muslim Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslim Singaporeans also have a duty now to react in

a  way  which  will encourage closer ties.  For  example,

over  the years, practices have developed, which many  of

us  have observed, which differentiate rather than  bring

us  together,  and  these should be relooked  at  by  the

Muslim  Singapore  community.  And all Singaporeans  must

think about this carefully.  There has to be a whole  new

energy  in engaging across racial lines.  It is not  easy

for  a  deep-seated attitudinal change to take  place  in

society  as a whole.  But that change must be  an  ideal,

and leaders

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2070</b></font><br><br>



have a duty to try and make a change in that direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would make two other points. For too long now,

too  many  subjects have been taboo, if  they  appear  to

touch  upon religious practices.  But freedom to practise

a  religion should not mean a total ban on discussion  of

practices   which  may  hinder  a  healthy,  economically

productive life and active citizenry, particularly  where

these practices impact on others in society.  We need  to

move  towards accepting debate in areas which affect  our

social  togetherness, even if this touches on aspects  of

religious  behaviour.  The leaders of  all  religions  in

Singapore  should  encourage debates in  specific  areas,

albeit the debate has to be handled sensibly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it is a fact that our Malay Singaporeans

have  been  performing better and better in many  fields.

But we need to catalyse that progress in the interest  of

a  stable  and  inclusive society.   It  is  in  all  our

interest  that there are Malay icons of success, wherever

possible.  The official policy is meritocracy and  it  is

heresy  to  suggest anything else.  But I will be  mildly

heretical.    There   must   be  opportunities,   without

affecting the core principle of meritocracy, for there to

be some form of action which will see Malays in important

positions in greater numbers than they are now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this because while the improvements shown by

statistics are important, it is necessary to put a  human

touch to success.  Successful role models offer hope.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, initially, there could be a feeling that a

person  owes  his  position more to  his  race  than  his

ability.  But provided that he or she is, in fact,  able,

and   the  principle  of  meritocracy  is  not  seriously

prejudiced,   these   doubts  can  be   overcome.    More

importantly,  this  will give considerable  psychological

boost to the rest of the Malay society, and the way  non-Malays perceive Malays will also change faster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this does not mean that overnight, the issue

of the impact  -  both positive

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2071</b></font><br><br>



and  negative  -  of ideas fermenting in Muslim societies

across   the  world  on  our  Muslim  Singaporeans   will

disappear.  We are dealing with ideological issues  which

have  great power.  But I think these steps will help  in

ameliorating  the negative impact, at least  among  those

Muslim Singaporeans who have a moderate outlook.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I say this, I will also say this to our Malay

Singaporeans:  be  realistic.  Do not  push  beyond  what

society as a whole can accept.  For example, I think  the

whole  issue  of Malays in the SAF is a red herring.   Do

not  make that the litmus test for success.  It makes for

good  political sound bite but is otherwise  meaningless.

Look   at  successful  minority  communities  and   other

societies.   Their  success is  based  upon  educational,

cultural   and  economic  achievements,  not  how    many

Generals  they  have.  The issue of Malay performance  in

the  SAF is one which really the Malay society should put

on  the back burner.  The issue can be taken further only

at the rate at which the whole society feels comfortable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, terrorism in all its forms must be condemned.

In order to starve terrorists of their potential base, we

have to build a socially inclusive society.  And I end my

speech  by saying that we have, I think, a serious window

of  opportunity  to  move decisively  to  build  stronger

linkages among all Singaporeans.  For the sake of our and

our  children's future, I hope that we will  be  able  to

seize that opportunity.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I rise in

support  of  the motion in the name of the  Home  Affairs

Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scourge of terrorism affects every nation in the

world.   Even the superpower countries, like the USA  and

Russia, are not free from terrorist attacks.  There  were

terrible  terrorist attacks of the World Trade Center  in

the USA, the Moscow Theatre in Russia, the blowing up  of

the  American Embassy building in Nairobi, Kenya, and the

recent bombings in Bali.  Thousands of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2072</b></font><br><br>



innocent lives have been lost to those dastardly attacks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorist threats to Singapore are real and serious.

No  civilised  country in the world is  immune  from  the

attacks of terrorists.  Singapore is no exception.   With

the  infiltration of the militant Jemaah Islamiyah groups

into Singapore from Indonesia, Singapore shall always  be

in  danger  of  terrorist  attacks.   Singapore  must  do

everything it can to defend itself.  Although our present

situation  is not as serious as that of Israel,  we  must

learn  from Israel's example.  Every man, woman and child

in  Israel  is  taught to be alert  and  to  be  able  to

identify possible dangers posed by terrorists.  I have an

Israeli  friend who visited Singapore.  I took him  to  a

shopping   complex.   On  entering   the   building,   he

immediately  pointed out to me the plastic  shopping  bag

that was lying on the floor and the rubbish bin that  was

not emptied.  He said that those items carelessly left in

our shopping complex would not be allowed to be similarly

left  in a building in Israel for fear that bombs may  be

planted  in  them.  I hope that we too in  Singapore  can

really  be on such an alert situation.  I hope  that  all

terrorist  infiltrators that come  to  Singapore  can  be

nabbed  in  time and not be given a chance to  plant  any

bombs  in  our midst.  Should even a single  bomb,  which

escapes detection, go off is one too many.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1960s, a terrorist bomb went off. It was

during the time of confrontation with Indonesia.  At that

time,  I  was  purchasing a book at  a  bookstore  called

Marican  & Sons at Orchard Road.  The building  in  which

the  bookstore was situated had since been demolished  to

build  a hotel.  The bomb went off in the building  known

as  MacDonald House, about 400 yards from where I  stood.

Even  at that distance, I could hear the loud blast,  and

the  doors of the shop shook.  I believe a bank  employee

was killed in that explosion.  Of course, the planting of

that  bomb was utterly senseless.  There was no strategic

importance in that building which was mainly  used  as  a

bank at that time.  Then, that was the way the terrorists

operated.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2073</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other incident which I would like to recall was

also  in the 1960s, also during the Confrontation period.

Luckily  for me, that bomb planted by terrorists  at  the

beach  at Katong did not go off; otherwise, I may not  be

standing here today.  On that night, I was sleeping in  a

room in a block of flats situated about 10-15 metres from

where  the bomb was placed.  My room was facing the beach

where the bomb was planted.  I was told later that it was

a  25-pounder and that if it had gone off, the whole wall

of  the  building facing the beach would have been  blown

off.   I  think  I would have been killed by  the  blast.

Such  is the devastation that could be wrecked by  a  25-pounder.  I am just wondering what havoc would have  been

wrought   with   a  bomb  comprising  several   tons   of

explosives, which was reported that the Jemaah  Islamiyah

members were trying to purchase and make.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Singapore must be vigilant. We must not allow

even  one  bomb to go off in our country.  I support  the

Government's  firm action taken against  members  of  the

Jemaah  Islamiyah.   My  party, the Singapore  Democratic

Alliance  (SDA),  welcomes the Government's  decision  to

introduce  the  White Paper on the  JI  detentions.   The

White  Paper  provides  the  factual  background  to  the

detentions and show how appropriate the Internal Security

Act  is in dealing with threats to national security.   I

agree  with the Government that counter measures must  be

taken  against  the terrorist threats.   Terrorists  have

international  connections.   The  JI  in  Singapore  has

connections  with  outsiders which have an  international

character.   It  is therefore only right  that  Singapore

seeks  the  assistance  of other countries  in  combating

terrorism in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards promoting cohesion and religious harmony,

my party hopes that, with the discussion of the issues in

the   White  Paper,  Singaporeans  can  understand   that

increased  religiosity  need  not  necessarily  lead   to

religious  militancy.  The SDA urges  the  Government  to

develop  all  avenues  to increase religious  and  racial

tolerance so that Singaporeans can strengthen the  social

fabric.  In this way,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2074</b></font><br><br>



Singaporeans  can  achieve social cohesiveness  with  the

ability  to  identify and reject ideology  that  preaches

violence and extreme hatred.  The SDA also hopes that the

Government,  whilst taking care of the interests  of  the

majority, does not neglect the interests of the  minority

or  simply brush aside, especially the interests  of  the

minority that concern the practice of their religion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Chit Chung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Chit Chung:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the

motion  standing  in the name of the  Minister  for  Home

Affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 9/11 was a turning point in the history of the

world.   It  changed our lives.  It changed  the  world's

political  and  economic landscape.  Some  however  still

thought  that  New York was far, far away from  us.   And

Afghanistan  and Al-Qaeda were deemed to be distant  from

our shores.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Singaporeans had a rude awakening when the JI

network in Singapore was uncovered and 15 JI members were

arrested  in December 2001.  In the following  year,  any

lingering  doubts about JI network and terrorist  threats

evaporated with the Bali bomb blasts of October 2002.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to put it in perspective, the Al-Qaeda and JI

fanaticism and terrorism were brewing for quite a  while.

It  took  them many years of painstaking preparation  and

indoctrination.   Most striking was the  global  coverage

and  the  fanatical zeal of the terrorists.  But by  now,

all  know that this new wave of fanatical terrorism could

strike  anywhere, any time.  And the problem will not  go

away  overnight.   It is a severe and  long-term  problem

that  will  persist and trouble us over a long period  of

time.   To counter, therefore, and overcome this problem,

we  require  and must have clear vision, right  strategy,

unwavering   determination,   patience,   fortitude   and

internal cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the seeds of such religious fanaticism have

been sown in the Middle East and Afghanistan.  Funded and

fuelled by petrol dollars of the Middle East, it spread

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2075</b></font><br><br>



to  the  rest of the world.  Singapore, as a  small  city

state,  is  not immune from world currents and  terrorist

threats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may ask, in this context, why another JI

report,  bringing it up again and again.  There  is  some

unease  that  this is given another airing.   But  it  is

better  that we discuss and address this terrorist threat

openly, rather than sweep it under the carpet and pretend

that  all  is  well.  We should brainstorm,  find  common

ground and forge a united and effective counter strategy.

In  this way, I trust we will gain insights and a  better

understanding of the issues involved.  I am sure we  will

emerge  from  the debate stronger, as one united  people,

one united nation of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this context, we have to reassess and

manoeuvre  fast  to stay afloat in these troubled  times.

We must bear in mind that we face an elusive enemy who is

prepared  to die for a cause, including suicide  bombing,

if  necessary.  This is not conventional war but a battle

for  the  hearts and minds of the people.  Singapore  has

been fortunate so far in escaping from JI bomb blast.  We

have  managed  to  nip the problem in the  bud  with  the

timely  arrests of the JI members.  We must  commend  and

thank  the  ISD,  the  police and the  SAF  for  doing  a

wonderful   job   in   safeguarding  our   security   and

maintaining  our peace.  Bravo, and well  done!   We  are

thankful for your services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this does not mean that we are insulated

from terrorist threats or that no bombs will ever go  off

in  Singapore.   No  one can guarantee that  a  terrorist

attack will not occur.  All we can do is to take all  the

necessary preventive measures and prepare for the  worst,

while  hoping  for  the best.  If  you  think  about  it,

Singapore  could  well be very high on  the  list  of  JI

targets  in  the  region, given our  strong  support  for

counter-terrorism  and  our very  success  in  preventive

measures so far.  Indeed, the JI network is extensive  in

the region, spreading and straddling Singapore, Malaysia,

Indonesia and Philippines.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2076</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventive and counter measures must therefore also

be  regional  in scope.  This means that the  authorities

and  the security agencies in the region must pull  their

resources together, share intelligence and have a unified

and  integrated  counter strategy.  No  country  in  this

region  should  allow their territory to  be  used  as  a

training  ground, sanctuary, or breeding ground  for  the

terrorists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our neighbours should realise that the terrorists

are  our  common  enemy.  If we  do  not  deal  with  the

extremists in our midst, they will undermine and  destroy

the governments in the region, one by one.  Therefore,  I

appeal  to the governments in the region to sink whatever

differences  they have, to work in tandem and  deal  with

this clear and present terrorist threat.  There is indeed

no other way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this White Paper gives an interesting insight

into  the profile of the JI detainees.  They have average

and   above  average  intelligence,  and  received   good

education,  some  with polytechnic and college  diplomas.

Most  of  them have good jobs, including appointments  as

managers  and  technicians.  Clearly,  these  JI  members

embarked on their misadventures not out of deprivation or

social unrest.  Why then did they do all this?  They were

definitely manipulated by extremists out to make mischief

and out to capitalise on religious fanaticism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JI members were not the mainstream of our Muslim

community in Singapore.  Indeed, they isolated themselves

from  the  main  Muslim organisations  and  indoctrinated

their  members in cells with their own brand of militancy

and their own lingo, including what they call "JI-speak".

The JI tactics sought to drive a wedge between the Muslim

community  and  other Singaporeans.   From  the  national

perspective, therefore, one must ask: how can the JI  and

the larger Al-Qaeda threat be neutralised in ways that do

not alienate the Singaporean Muslim community?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my mind, first, there is a need to provide timely

information so as to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2077</b></font><br><br>



prevent unhealthy misconception from forming.  Certainly,

in  the  current  context  of  the  counter-terrorism  in

general, and the JI arrests in particular, the Government

has  been  forthcoming in explaining the issues  and  the

media  is  playing the role in educating members  of  the

public.   Information on arrests of the JI members  under

the ISA, for example, has been made readily available  so

as to prevent popular misconceptions developing about the

treatment  of  the  detainees.   Family  members  of  the

detainees  have  visited the detainees  to  inquire  into

their well-being and the ISA Advisory Board members  have

reviewed their cases individually.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the White Paper, there is the publication of

the  booklet on the Internal Security Act, giving  useful

information  on  the rationale of the  legislation,  past

instances in which terrorists or subversive elements have

threatened Singapore, and the conditions under which  the

Act may be used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, there is a need to anticipate and prevent

any   misconception  that  the  religious  faith   of   a

particular  community  is under attack.   There  must  be

trust  and confidence that the Government is even handed,

that  the  Government  treats all  racial  and  religious

groups in Singapore fairly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt that the

Government acts in the national interests, in a fair, non-discriminating  and consistent manner,  without  fear  or

favour.   But the promotion of trust and bonding  is  not

the  job  of the Government alone.  Singaporeans  of  all

walks of life must and should play their part in ensuring

that  all  communities live and work together in harmony.

Singaporeans should interact with their neighbours,  make

them  feel  at  ease  and  at  home.   In  this  context,

employers   should   not   consciously   or   unknowingly

discriminate  against  Muslims, and  ordinary  non-Muslim

Singaporeans   should  not  treat  their  Muslim   fellow

citizens  differently.  Otherwise, the  Muslim  community

may   feel   out  of  sync  with  the  rest  of  society.

Individual Muslims would then become vulnerable

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2078</b></font><br><br>



to those who whisper that their interests are best served

by throwing in their lot with the likes of JI.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, I believe we can do more to promote

understanding  and  bonding,  particularly  in  the   HDB

heartland.  If neighbours in the estates know each  other

personally and meet in block parties and other  community

events,  the  likelihood is, if there is a  flare  up  or

incident, we could talk to each other, we could call each

other, and goodwill, common sense and peace will prevail.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the formation of the IRCC is a step in the

right  direction.   We should do all things  possible  to

make all races feel that they are all part and parcel  of

the  community.  For example, we should ensure that halal

food is provided in community functions and some barbecue

pits are reserved for Muslim residents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there is a need for modern Muslim leaders to

proactively forestall attempts by fringe elements to shun

them  aside and radicalise the community.  We should  not

forget  that in early 2002, Zulfikar of Fateha.com sought

to  project  himself  as the true leader  of  Singapore's

Muslims by engaging in a publicity campaign, accusing the

Government  of  being  anti-Islamic.   Fortunately,   the

Muslim  community rejected Zulfikar's claims, and settled

the  issue.  However, other extremists will try again and

again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, against the wider backdrop of counter-terrorism, it is incumbent upon moderate Muslim

organisations    and   leaders   to    closely    monitor

developments,      anticipate     possible      political

contingencies, and resolutely act to forestall  extremist

attempts to exploit certain issues.  Moderate members  of

the  Muslim community should speak up.  Otherwise,  there

will be a vacuum, which would be exploited by extremists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I firmly believe that Singaporean

Muslims  are well aware of the dangers posed  by  the  JI

terrorists,  and  they  want  to  have  no  part  in  the

misplaced and misguided JI aims and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2079</b></font><br><br>



tactics.   We are encouraged that more and more  moderate

and  fair-minded Muslim leaders and members are  speaking

up   against  JI  and  terrorism,  and  standing  up  for

moderation and tolerance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Religious Harmony Code Committee has been

visiting  and  having  dialogues with  various  religious

groups.   What  struck me, as a member of the  committee,

was that though these various religious groups uphold and

practise  their own religions, there is a  common  desire

for  moderation,  tolerance and religious  harmony.   All

groups  know that we are better off together in  our  own

country than apart or adrift.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This moderation and tolerance work well for

Singapore.   We  should  continue  to  build  upon   this

foundation  and  further  enhance  religious  and  racial

harmony.   We must not forget that united we  stand,  and

divided we fall.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, terrorism can only be eliminated

if the ideological basis can be removed and their funding

through  petro-dollars is stopped.  The  road  ahead  for

counter-terrorism  is  going  to  be  long  and  arduous.

Singaporeans  have to be patient as we  wait  for  bigger

forces to work it out in the world at large.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, we should focus on the immediate

problem,  marshal our resources to deal with the problem,

summon our will as one united people, regardless of race,

language  or  religion,  marching  together  shoulder-to-shoulder  to overcome the threat.  We can do it together.

For it is only as one people that we can succeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Heng Chee How -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Heng Chee How (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise in support of the motion standing in the name of the

Minister for Home Affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the White Paper on the Jemaah Islamiyah arrests

described very clearly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2080</b></font><br><br>



the threat of terrorism to the security of Singapore.   I

want to highlight three priorities today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we must thoroughly expose their plot. Let us

shine  a  bright  light onto their dark methods  and  let

Singaporeans   see  through  their  ploy,  because   when

Singaporeans  see through their ploy,  it  will  be  much

harder for their schemes to work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we must tell Singaporeans how terrorism

costs them dearly, even if bombs have not gone off.  This

is  to  make  sure that Singaporeans are  not  complacent

about the threat or its impact, and are motivated to  act

against it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we must give our strongest support to efforts

by  the  Muslim  leadership to  fortify  their  community

against   spiritual  hijacking  by  deviant  groups   and

individuals.  Prevention is much better than cure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the JI is part of a conspiracy to overthrow the

governments of the region and to seize political control.

JI members who are Singaporeans have forgotten their duty

and  obligation to their country.  Instead, they connived

with  the  Al-Qaeda and other terrorist  groups  to  harm

Singapore  and Singaporeans.  They willingly operated  as

the  fifth column for international terrorism, being  the

internal spies and operatives for these external  groups.

They  planned  to  bomb places and kill innocent  people.

And we all know that they had plans to build those bombs,

and they almost succeeded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did they get people to join them? The JI

deliberately scouted for and systematically indoctrinated

unsuspecting   Muslim  believers  into  their   ways   of

thinking.  These perpetrators are particularly dangerous,

because they abuse the power and authority of religion to

deceive   the  faithful  into  sympathising  with   their

criminal  cause,  and  to  do  their  bidding.   This  is

spiritual manipulation of the most devious kind, and  for

the most heinous ends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a technique of exploitation reminds me of the

behaviour of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2081</b></font><br><br>



cuckoo  bird.  The female cuckoo purposely seeks out  the

nest  of another species of bird in which to lay her egg.

The cuckoo's egg resembles closely the look of the egg of

the  victim's species.  So, when the parent bird from the

victim's  species leaves its nest unattended, the  female

cuckoo  flies  in and removes one of the  victim's  eggs,

lays   one   of  its  own,  and  flies  off  before   the

unsuspecting victim returns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victim flies back to the nest - not knowing what

has  happened  - and incubates the cuckoo  egg,  thinking

that  it was one of its own.  That egg belonging  to  the

cuckoo usually hatches before the victim's own eggs,  and

once  that nestling hatches, it pushes out the other eggs

from  the  nest, so that it can get all the food  brought

back  by  the foster parents.  So, this young  cuckoo  is

fed, cared for, and protected by the victim, and actually

grows to be several times larger than the foster parents.

All  the  while, the foster parents never suspected  that

they  were  exhausting  themselves  harbouring,  feeding,

protecting  the  very  enemy that had  killed  all  their

young.  In due course, that cuckoo grows up, flies off to

find the next set of victims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I quoted this analogy because I want to point

out  the importance of exposing such spiritual hijacking.

The Muslim community in Singapore must not let the JI  or

any  other  group masquerade as one of  its  own,  to  be

sheltered and nurtured.  They must not let this JI cuckoo

succeed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Sir, we must tell Singaporeans

that  although  we  have prevented a  physical  terrorist

attack  so far, there is already a cost economically  and

socially.   And  Singaporeans are paying  for  that  with

their jobs and with their future prospects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economically, the plans and actions of the JI and

their  Al-Qaeda  masters have added more uncertainty  and

gloom  to  doing  business  in Southeast  Asia.   Foreign

direct investments and tourism revenues in the region are

two clear and big victims of that.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2082</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps when we talk about foreign direct

investments  and  tourism  revenues  and  the  impact  of

terrorism  on  them,  it  may  not  be  obvious  to  some

Singaporeans  that  we  are actually  talking  about  the

threat on jobs and livelihood of workers, their prospects

and  what  they bring home to their families.  Jobs  have

been  lost,  and  many  jobs  made  less  secure  because

terrorism   is  scaring  away  investors,  business   and

tourists  from  the region, and that includes  Singapore.

So,  thanks to groups like the JI, Singaporeans will have

an  even  harder  time looking for  jobs  in  an  already

difficult economic period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like the cuckoo nestling that pushes eggs out

of the nest, the JI's actions have pushed jobs out of the

economy - jobs that unemployed Singaporeans of all  races

and religions need and would treasure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Socially, the false claims by the JI that they are

acting according to the precepts of Islam have tarred the

image  of the Muslim community.  Those who are less aware

may  come  away having the wrong impressions about  Islam

and   about  Muslims.   Some  others,  whether  they  are

companies  or individuals, may start feeling uneasy,  and

become  cagey  in  their interaction  and  dealings  with

Muslims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we deal with these challenges wrongly, the strong

trust,  mutual  respect and tolerance that the  different

races  and  religions have so painstakingly  forged  over

many years will be undermined.  Social cohesion will then

suffer.   If  social cohesion suffers, who wins?   Nobody

wins,  except those who see the destruction of our multi-racial,  multi-religious  and  meritocratic  society   as

serving their purposes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But who loses? Every peace-loving, fair-minded,

level-headed, loyal Singaporean, regardless  of  race  or

religion.   For,  when  social  cohesion  and  trust  are

weakened,  order  is  hard to maintain.   Without  order,

there  cannot be development.  Without development, there

will  not  be  jobs.   Without  jobs,  Singaporeans  will

suffer.  The better life will become a pipe dream.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2083</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, if you are a Muslim worker applying for a

job, you will want fair consideration to be given to your

application  on  the basis of merit,  and  not  become  a

victim of possible stereotyping that might arise from the

JI's  claim  that it is Muslim.  And that  is  absolutely

right,  because what the JI did is not your  fault.   And

the  best  way  to  achieve this is by  actively  denying

groups like the JI the chance to misappropriate the  good

name of Islam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally clearly, if you are a non-Muslim Singaporean

looking  for  work,  you  will hope  that  investors  and

businesses  will base their operations  here.   You  will

hope  that  they expand their presence in  Singapore  and

offer more jobs.  You will not want your chances to  find

a  job undercut by worries that businesses may have  over

security.   You have nothing to do with the  JI,  so  why

should  you  allow  them to harm your  chances  and  your

prospects?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let us be practical. It is in the collective

interest  of  all Singaporeans, regardless  of  race  and

religion,  to  stand together and fight these  terrorists

and expose their lies.  If we do not, we will end up like

the eggs and nestling of the foster parent birds - pushed

out  of  the nest to die - even though it was  not  their

fault.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no matter how we look at the issue, it boils

down to one fact: terrorism in general, and the dangerous

motives and actions of the JI in particular, have  harmed

the  interests  of  Singapore  and  Singaporeans.   Their

actions  and lies must be exposed.  I applaud the efforts

of the Muslim community and its leaders to resolutely and

relentlessly  safeguard the good name of  their  religion

from the perverted beliefs and behaviour of the JI.  This

is absolutely critical for two reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it authoritatively clarifies in the minds of

Muslim believers that the JI's claims to being Islamic in

its  theology and practice are false.  This  removes  the

psychological  hook that the JI has  been  using  to  tap

sympathy from Muslim

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2084</b></font><br><br>



believers.   And  it makes it easier  for  all  to  focus

objectively  on considering the threat of  terrorism  and

its  implications, and not be deceived or swayed  by  the

JI's cunning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, through leadership by example, the Muslim

community  in  Singapore is sending  out  a  very  strong

signal that it has not been taken in by the wiles of  the

JI, and will stand united with all other Singaporeans  to

fight this common threat to national peace, security  and

interest.   The community is showing that it will  always

be vigilant and will never allow itself to be made use of

by  terrorism.   Such  signals are important  because  it

indicates  that  Singaporeans,  regardless  of  race  and

religion, are rational, practical and united.   In  other

words,  it  shows to the world that it is safe to  invest

and do business in Singapore, and to employ Singaporeans.

A  safe,  united  and prosperous Singapore  is  our  best

rebuff to terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as our Muslim countrymen take action to cut out

this  cancer,  I  call on all non-Muslim Singaporeans  to

give  them  our fullest support.  They are undertaking  a

critical  and onerous task not only for the sake  of  the

Muslim   community,  but  for  the   benefit   of   every

Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us stay united, encourage one another, work

shoulder-to-shoulder  with  one  another  and  with   the

Government, and rid our land of this threat of terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Sir,

some   Singaporeans  question  why  this  JI   issue   is

resurrected.  They feel that a constant reminder  of  the

issue  is bad for the morale of the Muslim community  and

would thwart inter-religious harmony.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the response to this is found in limb (a) of

today's  motion - that the terrorist threat is  real  and

serious.  When we first had the arrests in December  2001

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2085</b></font><br><br>



August 2002, the focus was on neutralising the JI itself.

The extent to which the JI could impact our peace was not

immediately known.  We needed to know more about the JI's

history,   ideology,   resources   and   network.     The

Government's  findings indicate the  seriousness  of  the

terrorist threat.  A debate allows all our people  to  be

more  aware of the nature of the threat.  It also enables

the  Government to have the benefit of public opinion  on

how to deal with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, Sir, that many Singaporeans would

rather   just  move  on  and  leave  this  issue  behind.

However,  the terrorism issue is bound to rear  its  head

again in future as much of it is beyond our control.   It

is  better for us to face the issue squarely, rather than

pretend it does not exist.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the three-prong approach

enunciated  in  the White Paper.  This approach  reflects

our  acknowledgement that the terrorism threat cannot  be

managed  as  a  security issue simpliciter.   The  multi-faceted  nature  of  the  threat  calls  for  an  equally

comprehensive response.  Sir, the security aspect of  the

matter cannot be over-emphasised but I would like just to

discuss the second and third limbs of the above approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper suggests that the Muslim community

develop a comprehensive self-regulatory system to monitor

religious  education.   Some  concerns  were  raised   by

members  of  the  public  in this  regard.   Some  people

question, Sir, whether the community would be up  to  its

task.  This question springs from two assumptions.   One,

that the Muslim community may not have the resources; and

two, that the Muslim community may not be firm enough  to

deal  with errant followers for fear of antagonising  the

greater Muslim community in Singapore and other parts  of

the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards resources, it is not the duty of the

Muslim community to deal with the whole terrorism threat.

Self-monitoring is only one of three pieces in  the  full

picture.  Seen in that perspective, the resources

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2086</b></font><br><br>



required of the community is not so formidable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am convinced, Sir, that the Muslim community would

be  resolute  in  its  task.  Since  the  first  arrests,

members  of  the  community  had  declared  openly  their

rejection of the JI and terrorism.  The most significant,

perhaps,  was the stand made by 127 Muslim organisations,

who  unequivocally rejected the JI and  terrorism  a  few

months  ago.   The  Muslim community finds  it  in  their

interest to safeguard itself against elements similar  to

the  JI,  cuckoo birds included.  If it has  to  do  with

stricter  self-monitoring, it would do  so  with  genuine

vigour.   Further, Sir, the Muslim community has received

the moral support of the other communities to act firmly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the committee to look into a proposed

Religious Harmony Code met leaders from various religious

groups,  as mentioned by my colleague, Dr Ong, just  now.

Generally,  all  groups agree that there  is  a  need  to

ensure that religious enthusiasm does not get out of hand

and  grow  into  bigotry or extremism.  This  concern  is

shared  by  all  religious groups and  not  just  by  the

Muslims.   As  such, the efforts by the Muslim  community

would  be  complemented by similar efforts made by  other

religious groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, pursuant to this White Paper, the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs had announced the prime role of

MUIS,  the  Islamic Religious Council  of  Singapore,  to

carry  out the self-monitoring effort.  Some people  have

raised  the  concern whether MUIS has the  capability  to

carry out the self-monitoring.  The issue here is whether

MUIS  has the credibility to ensure compliance.  A letter

published on 14th January 2003 in the Forum page  of  the

Straits  Times  stated "MUIS already faces a  credibility

problem".  The writer there stated that this was noted in

an  earlier  article by Mr Mafoot Simon  in  the  Straits

Times  on 12th January.  It was said that since  not  all

madrasahs follow the MUIS curriculum, it shows that  MUIS

lacks credibility.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2087</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, no institution can claim to have

complete  adherence from all its constituents.  The  real

issue  here is whether it has enough credibility to carry

out its task effectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3(2) of the Administration of Muslim Law Act

provides, among others, that it shall be the function and

duty  of  MUIS  to advise the President of  Singapore  in

matters relating to the Muslim religion in Singapore;  to

administer  matters relating to the Muslim  religion  and

Muslims  in Singapore; and to administer all mosques  and

Muslim religious schools in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, MUIS has the legitimacy and authority in law to

perform the duty to self-monitor religious teachings.  No

other  organisation has an equal status.  The appointment

to  the  MUIS  Council is through a  careful  process  as

stipulated  in  section 7 of the Act.  Efforts  are  also

made  to ensure wide representation of the Muslim public.

MUIS  Councils over the years usually comprise  respected

community leaders and organisation leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Sir, MUIS has over time grown in terms of

reputation   and   sophistication.   It  handles   mosque

development,  manage  wakaf properties,  deals  with  Haj

matters, administers halal certification, overseas  zakat

or  tithe  collection  and  distribution,  among  others.

Problems  that  arise in relation to madrasah  curriculum

should not, in one go, strip MUIS of all its credibility.

We  have to be fair in our judgement.  The madrasah issue

can be dealt with separately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding that, MUIS had announced that it

would form an Asatizah Group - asatizah is the plural  of

ustaz   or   religious  teachers  -  including  religious

teachers  outside  MUIS, to discuss  contemporary  issues

facing  Islam  and  to help the self-monitoring  process.

This  announcement was published in the Berita Harian  on

16th January 2003.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2088</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, Sir, I refer to a statement made by

Pergas,  referred to by my colleague, Mayor Othman,  just

now,  which  was published also in the Berita  Harian  of

16th  January.  The statement was in the Malay  language.

In  the  statement, Pergas reiterates its  commitment  to

maintain peace in our multi-religious country.  It states

that  monitoring  religious education  is  a  concern  of

Pergas and MUIS.  If further added at paragraph 17,  "our

efforts  -  "our" meaning Pergas' efforts - to strengthen

cooperation with MUIS shall continue."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Muslim community, either by itself, or

through  MUIS, Pergas or other organisations,  shows  the

resolve and resources to carry out this delicate task  of

self-monitoring.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is yet another concern, in spite of numerous

assurances to the contrary, whether the religion of Islam

itself is the cause of the problem.  This worry was given

prominent airing recently in the Straits Times dated 15th

January  in  a  commentary by Ms Chua  Lee  Hoong.   Some

points raised were:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The word "Islam" does not mean peace, but total

submission to God in order to obtain security, as held by

philosopher Roger Scruton;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Ayatollah Khomeini said in 1984 that war was a

blessing to the world, and men are commanded to wage  war

and to kill, and such perverse logic continues to inspire

young Muslims;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) There is a danger of the periphery moving into the

centre - so one Yazid Sufaat, who was supposed to  be  an

engineer    upon   receiving   a   Malaysian   Government

scholarship, instead returned as one who was involved  in

both September 11 and the Bali bombing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) The Islamic ideological framework, "taken to its

logical  conclusion denies any official compact with  the

state  and  regards secular authority by  definition,  as

being without legitimacy."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2089</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are extremely serious charges. My brief

response is as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Drs Imam Munawwir, "Islam" means both

peace and submission.  According to Dr Quraish Shihad, he

commented that by knowing the meaning of the word "Islam"

a  person  would  know that it is a  religion  of  peace.

World-renowned  scholar  Abdullah  Yusuf   Ali   in   his

commentary on the Quran elaborated on the six aspects  of

"peace" and stated that these are shades of "Islam".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second point, on killing - the statement made by

Ayatollah  Khomeini - there are verses in the Quran  that

say there is no compulsion in religion and the Prophet is

reported to have said, "He who is not merciful to  others

will   not  be  treated  mercifully",  and  these  values

continue  to  be  taught  in our  hundreds  of  religious

classes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Yazid Sufaat, I say, Sir, that thousands

of  graduates  proceed  on to  be  of  service  to  their

professions,  employers or governments.  Malaysia,  where

Yazid  stays,  may  have  its  own  peculiar  context  in

relation  to  radicalism; but in Singapore  the  radicals

remain in the periphery.  For instance, we noted from the

White  Paper that the JI believes that those  who  reject

their  campaign  are infidels.  This  is  not  the  Islam

understood by most Singapore Muslims.  Such ideas  remain

in the periphery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards (4), about the Islamic ideological

framework,  I  beg  to disagree.  For  instance,  in  the

Treaty  of Hudaibiya, which was signed by the Prophet  on

behalf  of the Muslims in Medina and the Meccan  Quraish,

contained   several  terms,  more  of  which   were   not

favourable  to  the Muslims, but necessary  in  order  to

secure  peace.   The  Prophet ensured  that  the  Muslims

honoured its terms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Events such as this and many others form the corpus

of  material  from  which Islamic  values  and  laws  are

extracted.  They show that it is perfectly acceptable

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2090</b></font><br><br>



for  Muslims  to  have  compacts, agreements,  with  non-Muslims,  be  they individuals, groups or  states.   Once

made,  these agreements are to be honoured even if it  is

to the detriment of the Muslim party.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the quotes from Scruton or Ayatollah Khomeini

do  not  reflect the kind of Islam we have in  Singapore.

But   we   cannot   deny   that   there   are   different

interpretations of Islam, as there are of  any  religion.

It  is not for us to determine which is the true version.

The  crucial question for us is what is the stand of  the

Muslim  Singaporeans on such issues.  It is incumbent  on

the Muslim community to clarify its position.  It is also

in  the  interest  of  all  of us,  all  communities,  to

appreciate the position of the Muslim community  and  act

on them wisely

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslims in Singapore, Sir, had come out clearly

against  JI and terrorism.  What about some of the  other

issues  raised  by Ms Chua Lee Hoong?  The  Muslims  will

continue to clarify them.  They have been grappling  with

issues  pertaining  to Islam since the  community  itself

existed.  In the late 19th century, for instance,  Munsyi

Abdullah  wrote about the issue of education  to  Muslims

and  pondered why Muslims were weak in that aspect.  That

issue  is still relevant today.  In some technical cases,

issues such as whether the first day of Ramadan ought  to

be determined by sight or by calculations, were gradually

resolved.  But not all issues are straightforward.   Some

issues  get  more complex as the world progresses.   Some

new  issues  are  born  with the passage  of  time.   The

emergence of radicalism, extremism and terrorism, as they

coincide  with religious revival, is a major  issue  that

confronts the Muslims today.  In this regard, the Muslims

in  Singapore  realise that it has  to  do  some  serious

introspection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Berita Harian of 16th January, the Mufti's

Office  issued  a  statement on Religious  Guidance.   It

stated among others:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) that Muslims have to objectively evaluate its

role in missionary work and religious education;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2091</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) missionaries must be keenly aware of current

thoughts in our society;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) the approach used to interact with society has to be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reviewed;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) when dealing with contemporary issues, missionaries

and  teachers  should use an approach that  is  open  and

comprehensive; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Muslims have to appreciate the universal values

in  Islam which is based on pristine faith, moral virtues

and dynamic laws.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the above reflects the kind of

critical  self-analysis that underscores the  community's

present  and  future  efforts.  It is  not  one  that  is

totally  inward-looking, but one  which  also  emphasises

active participation in the larger society.  Let us  give

the Muslim community some space to formulate its position

calmly and thoroughly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monitoring religious education, Sir, is a delicate

task.   It  is not quite completely a good idea  for  the

religious  education  of  a  certain  community   to   be

monitored by a group from a different religion or by  the

Government.  Self-regulation with an increased  awareness

of the issues at hand is, in principle, the best way out.

In  other words, if anyone is to regulate and monitor the

religious  education of the Muslim  community  so  as  to

detect  extremist elements, the best people to do so  are

the Muslims themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many Singaporeans are keen to have the

terrorist   threat   resolved   once   and    for    all.

Unfortunately, it is not always so simple.  As stated  in

the  White  Paper,  Singapore cannot eliminate  terrorism

completely  and  by  itself.  In  spite  of  measures  to

monitor religious classes and enhance security, it is not

possible, as stated earlier, to fully insulate ourselves.

On  the  contrary,  the flow of ideas and  people  across

borders will increase.  It is not advisable for Singapore

to cocoon itself from external influences.  The more

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2092</b></font><br><br>



open  we  become,  the  more  open  we  are  to  possible

terrorist  attacks,  ideologically  or  physically,  from

within or without.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper correctly points out that groups

like   JI   can   undermine  inter-ethnic  harmony.    If

unchecked,  inter-ethnic suspicions will breed  distrust,

hatred and, eventually, enmity.  Therefore, steps have to

be  taken  to  further strengthen inter-ethnic  cohesion.

The  establishment  of the IRCC and  the  drafting  of  a

Religious  Harmony Code are two concrete steps  mentioned

in the White Paper.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bearing in mind the nature of terrorism and

extremism, we must continuously promote social  cohesion.

Social cohesion is not a one-off exercise.  It has to  be

consciously  kept  alive and current.  Some  people  feel

that   enhancing  inter-religious  harmony   like   self-regulation  means  further restraints on  religion.   The

President  of  Pergas alluded to this  in  his  statement

which  was  published  in  the  Berita  Harian   on  16th

January.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reality is that our society has become more

assertive.  We want more political space and more freedom

of  expression.  Religious groups too are  becoming  more

aggressive  in their missionary work.  At the same  time,

our  island  has become more densely populated  and  more

cosmopolitan.    There  is much greater  interface  among

peoples  of various ethnic and religious persuasions  now

than  ever  before.  These trends are likely to continue.

In  such a scenario, heightening religious differences is

bound to occur unless the different religious groups have

developed   among  themselves  that  degree   of   mutual

confidence  which  allows them  to  air  their  different

positions  without  undermining the  common  peace.   So,

instead  of curbing religious expression, inter-religious

harmony  is  meant  to  facilitate  greater  freedom   of

religious  expression.   It is in  the  interest  of  all

religious  groups to enhance inter-religious  confidence.

The    majority   of   Singaporeans   understand    this.

Singaporeans  also understand that there  can  be  little

meaningful  community or religious life if  there  is  no

collective peace

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2093</b></font><br><br>



in  the first place.  Again, in the Berita Harian of 16th

January, the Deputy Mufti was reported to have said  that

the  Asatizah group which MUIS intends to set  up  shall,

among  others,  discuss  matters  to  enable  the  Muslim

community to enhance national integration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, I state that the terrorism

threat is real.  It has serious repercussions.  It cannot

be cured with a single operation.  Thus, acknowledging it

the  way  as  we  do now requires much courage  and  open

heartedness.   Handling it is a long  drawn  affair  that

demands patience, sensitivity and diligence, and we  must

do it together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you

for allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Mr Chiam before me, I would like to state our

party's  position on this matter.  We share the  nation's

concern  on  the  threat  to our security  posed  by  the

terrorist groups like the Jemaah Islamiyah.  We recognise

this  as a very serious threat to our social and economic

well  being,  and  support  the Government's  efforts  to

contain   them.   In  this  respect,  may  I   take   the

opportunity to applaud the ISD on a job well  done.   For

once,  I am beginning to feel a bit more confident  about

the ISD  -  that is not used as a political tool.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to see that the ISA is used in its proper

intent,  arresting those who are out to harm the security

and  stability of our beloved country, and those who  are

bent  on  using  violence  as a means  to  achieve  their

ideological objectives.  We recognise that, as long as we

take  the  constitutional approach to challenge  the  PAP

Government, there should be no fear of such arrests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to take this opportunity to express my

support  for the publication of this detailed and almost-comprehensive  White  Paper.  In future,  the  Government

should make it a practice to issue a White

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2094</b></font><br><br>



Paper  following every major arrest using  the  ISA.   My

only  regret is that, when reading through the Report,  I

find  missing were copies of the Detention Orders  issued

by the Home Affairs Minister.  They should be included in

the  White  Paper  to convince the more skeptical  people

around, the reasons for these arrests.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrests were of a very small group of extremist

and    malevolent   radicals.    Although    some    were

psychologically  pressured into participation,  they  are

not representative or symptomatic of the Muslim community

at  large.  Thus, it is wise of us to differentiate  this

JI  group  -  with  its  extremist ideology,  willing  to

espouse violence to achieve their desired ends - from the

friendly and peace-loving Muslim community that  we  have

come  to  know and regard.  It is unfortunate  that  such

threats are coming from deviant groups claiming to act in

the name of religion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also acknowledge the considerable

contributions  made  by the mainstream  Muslim  community

towards nation building and the sacrifices that they have

made -  living as a minority in our community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many Muslim religious and community leaders

coming  out  to denounce the JI and pledge allegiance  to

Singapore,  the  non-Muslim  community  cannot,  but   be

assured  that the JI is an extreme group  -  rejected  by

their  peers at large, and that Islam itself it  not  the

cause  of  these  problems.  It is the  extreme  radicals

behind this group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every Singaporean - whether Muslim or non-Muslim,

whether  pro-Government  or pro-Opposition  -  must  come

together  in  this  to  support the  Government  and  its

agencies in keeping peace, law and order.  In return, the

Government  should  start paying more  attention  to  the

wishes  and concerns of the various communities  and  not

dismiss their concerns as slight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To quote Pergas in their press release, "we (Pergas)

are  worried that side issues, important to a  particular

group because of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2095</b></font><br><br>



their  religion,  are not receiving due  attention."   In

particular,  the  Government should stop questioning  the

loyalty  of  the  Malays in Singapore.   It  should  move

beyond  race and help all citizens to focus and build  on

the   Singaporean  identity.   With  a  strong  Singapore

identity, there is less likelihood of our citizens  being

hijacked  to  cause harm to our society   -   by  people,

groups or governments with a hidden agenda.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another note, I would like to express three

concerns that I have learnt from the White Paper.  First,

page  26 of the Paper states that the first specific lead

came from a concerned Singaporean after the September  11

attacks,  after  which  the investigation  and  operation

against the JI started.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had that particular Singaporean been less

discerning,  less wise or less proactive, the Government,

the  ISD  and all Singaporeans would probably  have  been

none   the  wiser  until  after  an  actual  attack   had

materialised  at the Yishun MRT station.  On  that  note,

that  Singaporean should be rewarded for  providing  that

vital information.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, other than relying on concerned citizens to

provide  the leads, or information exchanges between  the

other security agencies, can the Minister assure us  that

there  are  other means in place to track the  plans  and

happenings   of   these  known  and  other   unidentified

terrorist groups.  And that such means are not used as  a

tool by "big brother" to watch its peace-loving citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Singapore is a very small and vulnerable

city  surrounded by water.  The Government  should  focus

more resources in making sure that external elements  are

not  able  to  create havoc in Singapore  by  staging  an

attack   from  countries  nearby.   As  we   stand   here

condemning  the terrorists, what assurance is there  from

the  Minister  that  there  is no  plane,  hijacked  from

airports nearby and flown towards this Parliament House?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2096</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I urge the Government not to jump to any

hasty conclusions if our installations overseas are under

attack  or destroyed, no matter the current state of  our

relationship.  There could be malicious elements  out  to

sour our ties with our neighbours and create unrest.   As

Minister Wong said earlier and quoted from page 11 of the

paper,  which states that "Hambali's plan was  to  attack

key Singapore installations and to represent them as acts

of  aggression by the Malaysian government."  We must not

fall into the trap of the terrorists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would now like to touch on the

recommendations put forth by the paper.  The three  broad

recommendations  are sensible and practical  approach  to

minimise  the  problems  of  terrorism  associated   with

religion.  It should be supported and endorsed.  However,

it  is not enough to will this problem away and there  is

more the Government can and should do to help.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Government should learn to listen to the

wishes and aspirations of the people.  Stop pretending to

listen  when  policy  decisions  are  already  made   and

justified.  It is time for the Government to drop the "We

know  better than you" kind of attitude.  Such Government

and  civil  service attitude results in frustrations  and

resentments,  and does not help to build a more  cohesive

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Government should encourage greater

transparency in its discourse.  Keeping the lid on public

discussion  of  any issues serves only  to  perpetuate  a

socially and politically immature populace.  What fear is

there  in  finding a can of worms if the  Government  has

been fair and vigilant in performing its duties?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, I am very happy that this whole episode is

brought into spotlight by the issuance of the White Paper

and  this thorough debate in this House.  We have a  very

fragile  society, bound together, not by acceptance,  but

by  tolerance.   Singaporeans  tolerate  each  other  not

because they want to, but because they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2097</b></font><br><br>



need to, and are required by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cannot want to, because they are not

communicating  and  not  understanding  each  other  well

enough.  Other than through the newly set up IRCC,  there

is  minimal  discussion  at the  inter-racial  or  inter-religious  levels.  The Government should not  be  afraid

that such discussions will lead to heightened tensions or

racial disharmony, because it would not.  If we dare  not

discuss  tough issues, we will be none the  poorer  as  a

society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no discussions, no opportunity to speak

up, heard and be heard, and not being able to raise one's

concerns  to  public consciousness, how can  Singaporeans

learn  of each other's aspirations and support each other

to build a more cohesive society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer towards greater social cohesion is not to

segregate the different communities, but to get  them  to

integrate  more  closely  and frequently.   I  hope  this

episode   is  the  beginning  of  more  dialogues,   more

discussions  and  more interactions to come  between  the

various communities at the constituency level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the Government should practise what it

preaches.   If  it  truly  believes  in  the  freedom  of

religion,  it  should  seriously  consider  allowing  the

practice of some religious obligations in schools and the

civil  service.   This  is  especially  relevant  as  our

society matures, and greater diversity and non-uniformity

results.  The Government must encourage and help to build

unity  in the midst of diversity and make it one  of  our

core strengths of our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a responsible Opposition, we do not want to be

seen  politicising national and internal security issues.

What  is needed is to instill trust in one and all, at  a

time that is most needed for nation building and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2098</b></font><br><br>



social  cohesion.  We would also urge the Government  not

to  exploit  the current situation to its own  advantage,

but to move on to tackle the equally important problem of

rising  unemployment.  We trust that the  Government  may

handle  this  economic problem with  the  same  zeal  and

efficiency,  because  a discontented  populace  may  also

disrupt peace and security within the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, with

the  end  of  the  Cold War and the expansion  of  global

capitalism,  the  advancement  in  technology   and   the

emergence  of a world-wide free market, the world  ushers

in the age of globalisation.  Singapore, like most of the

world,  looks  forward to a peaceful  21st  century  with

economic prosperity.  The Asian financial crisis in  1997

provided  the  first wake-up call, and its  repercussions

are still deeply felt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 11th September 2001, the world witnessed the

return  of  an  intractable  conflict  in  the  form   of

terrorism disguised in the name of Islam.  Tragic as  the

New  York  attacks  were, they seemed  remote  until  the

arrests  of  members of Jemaah Islamiyah in  December  of

that  year, and in August 2002.   We did not realise that

we  could  be  the victims of terrorism  as  well.   With

evidence  disclosed  after  the  arrests  and  the   Bali

bombings  in  October  2002,  we  have  to  accept   that

terrorism is now a real and serious threat to us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Workers' Party has considered these developments

in  the context of national and regional security and the

well-being of our people.  The Party has noted the change

in the global political environment and the shift in geo-political  landscape.  We are of the view that Singapore,

being  small  and  situated in a  sensitive  geographical

arena,  is vulnerable.  Terrorism poses a great challenge

to  our  future.   Although the Workers' Party  disagrees

with the PAP Government in many areas, including the ISA,

we  feel  it is time that the nation should be united  to

face the challenge of terrorism.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2099</b></font><br><br>



The  Workers' Party supports the Government's  action  in

the  arrest of the JI members and the recommendations put

forth  in  the White Paper.  Although the Government  has

responded  with  sensible recommendations  in  the  White

Paper, the problem of terrorism disguised in the name  of

Islam  involves  deep emotions, which the recommendations

may not be able to fully address.  The Workers' Party  is

concerned  about the predicament facing some sections  of

the  Muslim community, as a result of the JI arrests  and

the economic downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, we are aware that some Muslims feel

that the Muslim community in Singapore is now put in  the

spotlight  and Islam is portrayed in a bad light  by  the

media.  It is obvious that terrorism in the name of Islam

cannot  be  seen as Islam itself.  If the plan to  attack

Yishun  MRT station was successful, the victims could  be

Muslims  as  well.   We  are sure that  the  majority  of

Singaporeans   are able to distinguish between  terrorism

and Islam.  However, there are bound to be a small number

of  people  who will over-react and embarrass our  fellow

Muslims,   thereby   damaging  the  trust   between   the

communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We strongly urge the various ethnic communities, the

public,  the  employers  and  the  media,  and  even  the

Government itself, to be sensitive to the feelings of our

Muslim  community and exercise restraint in  putting  the

community under the spotlight, when there is a need to go

public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper describes the JI as a clandestine

organisation  in  its  method of  recruitment  and  which

features  Islam  in  a  misguided  way  to  achieve   the

organisation's ulterior motives.  However, we  also  need

to  examine and identify where there are factors  in  our

political,  social and economic setting  which  could  be

capitalised  on  in  the  recruitment  of  terrorists  in

Singapore.   For  example, we are aware  that  there  are

Muslims  who  feel  that  they  are  being  discriminated

against  by  employers in the current economic situation.

There are some who feel that they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2100</b></font><br><br>



are  suppressed in the practice of their religion.   Some

feel they are marginalised in our society.  Whether these

concerns are perceived or real, we believe that this  can

only  be resolved through continuous dialogue within  the

Muslim  community across different ethnic  and  religious

groups and between the community and the Government.  The

dialogue  should reach out to the wider community  to  be

able  to forge consensus.  The Government has to be  open

and  ensure  that  it  grasps the  real  feeling  of  the

majority  of  the  Muslim  community  and  reflects   its

sensitivity in the formulation of its policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, Singapore, being an open

economy,    is   facing   the   challenge   of   economic

restructuring  to  better  cope with  different  economic

landscape, characterised by intense competition and a new

economy.   Singaporeans,  being  subject  to  this   fast

changing, unpredictable and pressurising environment, are

increasingly   looking  to  religion  as  their   anchor.

Singapore is a multi-racial society and open global city.

The   communities  here  are  easily  subject  to  events

happening  in the region and the world.  This will  bring

strain  to our social and religious harmony from time  to

time.   This  is  the challenge faced by all  ethnic  and

religious  groups  in  Singapore, as  we  cannot  isolate

ourselves  from  the outside world.   We  have  no  other

alternative  but  to  take these  challenges  positively,

bearing  in mind our common destiny as Singaporeans.   We

should engage in continuous dialogue and deliberation  to

sort  out our differences and reach consensus.  We should

emerge  from  such threats and potential conflicts  as  a

stronger nation.  And all communities can then enjoy  the

fruits of our development and social harmony.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

thank  you for the opportunity to share my views on  this

subject.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 38 years ago, to be precise on 10th March 1965,

a  bomb  went  off  in MacDonald House  in  Orchard  Road

killing  three persons and injuring 37 others.  This  was

during the height of the Indonesian

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2101</b></font><br><br>



Confrontation.  It was the work of infiltrators  sent  by

the  Sukarno regime, and it was the first time an act  of

terrorism  of such a scale took place in Singapore.   The

two  Indonesian marines who masterminded the bombing were

caught, convicted and hanged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at that time, I was a young boy, but that

incident  and  two  racial riots  the  year  before  left

lasting impressions in my mind.  And my memory was jolted

again  when news first broke out that the Government  had

arrested 15 persons in December 2001 for planning attacks

on  several  targets in Singapore.  If these attacks  had

been  pulled  off,  the  damage  to  innocent  lives  and

property  would  have been of far greater magnitude  than

that  one single act that took place 38 years ago, as  we

have found out from the many revelations that came in the

ensuing months as well as from the White Paper.   But  of

even greater consequence to us would have been the damage

to  ethnic  relations in multi-racial and multi-religious

Singapore,  because  those who  were  thwarted  in  their

mission were Muslims, connected directly to Al Qaeda, and

were  prepared to carry out their mindless  acts  in  the

name   of  Islam.   The  Jemaah  Islamiyah,  if  it   had

succeeded, would have placed Muslim Singaporeans under  a

glaring but uncomfortable and unenviable spotlight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, immediately after the first arrests were made,

the Government made it clear that this was not a focus on

the  Muslim community but on the JI, that it  was  not  a

communal  threat  but  one concerning  national  security

affecting  all Singaporeans, underscores the  point  that

the  fabric of racial and religious harmony that we enjoy

in  Singapore  can  be  easily torn  apart  if  unfounded

suspicions  are  allowed to affect  the  way  non-Muslims

behave  towards  Muslims in Singapore.  For  decades,  we

have had the foresight to build a multi-racial and multi-religious society while giving recognition to the  unique

flavour  of each ethnic group and the values and heritage

of  each religious belief.  It would be benign of  me  to

simply put it that 37 years of nation building would have

been in vain if we have not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2102</b></font><br><br>



fortified our resolve to live as one nation, one  people,

regardless of race, language and religion, come what may.

But  the  reality  is that the harmony we  now  enjoy  is

fragile  enough to be unzipped right down the middle,  if

ignited  by  an  event such as the one  that  might  have

happened if the JI had its way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the White Paper serves as a wake-up call.

Its recommendations require us to be on the defensive  as

well  as  to be proactive in the fight against terrorism.

We  have enhanced our intelligence and tightened security

measures.   We have passed laws to criminalise  terrorist

funding,  and  we have joined the global  effort  through

steps,   such   as  the  signing  of  the   International

Convention  for  the  Suppression  of  the  Financing  of

Terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, what is equally important is the proactive

role  of  each citizen to strengthen social cohesion  and

racial  harmony.  Such a clarion call to  rally  everyone

is,  of  course,  easy to make, and I have  found  myself

grappling  with  the thought that if we  do  encounter  a

situation where a dastardly attack takes place,  will  we

find ourselves asking: have we done enough - and have  we

done  it fast enough - to maintain the integrity  of  the

relations between our various peoples?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To come back to the reality of the present, we know

we  have time, hopefully, to scrutinise what we must  do.

We  have  the  IRCCs,  and we are  shaping  the  Code  on

Religious  Harmony, and I think these  are  all  positive

moves.   But  we  must ask ourselves, in  all  frankness,

whether  it  is  enough just to make symbolic  visits  to

temples and mosques.  While we take heart that good sense

does  prevail  at  leadership levels, I find  myself,  at

times,  fearful  that if a group of  evil  and  desperate

persons  succeed  just  once  in  breaking  through   our

meticulous security cordon and explode their devices  and

cause  untold damage, what would be the reaction  of  our

own  heartlanders?   What would  be  the  effect  on  the

moderation and peace that we now enjoy?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2103</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We rightfully ask that there be more common space

for  the different races and that the social space  where

all  Singaporeans  can interact be expanded.   The  Prime

Minister  himself has pointed out that  the  downside  to

Muslims  feeling more at ease with social  activities  at

mosques than anywhere else is that Muslims will feel less

and less of a need to mingle with other races.  This is a

poignant truth that the Muslim community has to ponder.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while we ask our Muslim friends to move closer

to mainstream Singapore, at the same time, we who are the

majority, must not, unwittingly or otherwise, become more

vigilant towards them because of the militant ideology of

the  few  in their midst.  In as much as we want to  know

how the Muslim community reacts and we have asked them to

speak out against terrorism, the rest of us must also not

overreact,  because at the end of the day, if the  Muslim

community  feels  alienated, the JI would  have  won  the

psychological battle.  I am therefore heartened  to  note

that  the  Government recognises that, in its efforts  to

identify and neutralise radical Islamic religious leaders

and foreign terrorist operatives, it must not disrupt the

legitimate  and peaceful activities of the  local  Muslim

community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is not a fight over whose political

ideology  is  superior.   This is  about  a  war  against

fanaticism,  against those who want their militant  brand

of a religion to prevail.  How else can you make of their

declared position that those who defect from their cause,

or  who  do  not support their violent ways are  labelled

infidels?  What else can you make of an organisation that

thinks  nothing of killing thousands, including those  of

their own faith?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it therefore not significant to us that the plan

to  bomb Yishun MRT Station was foiled because of a  call

made by a Muslim Singaporean to the ISD?  Whoever it  was

must have been aware that what is at stake is not a fight

between Muslims and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2104</b></font><br><br>



non-Muslims, but one of a cult-like organisation bent  on

inflicting  senseless  attrition  versus  the   rest   of

humanity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This White Paper has sent the message that Singapore

is  no  pushover in this fight.  We will muster  all  our

resources and work closely with every peace loving nation

in the world.  Encountering the terrorist threat needs  a

global  effort  and it cannot be done spasmodically.   If

Southeast  Asia  is the next battleground  in  the  fight

against  terrorism,  then  regional  cooperation  becomes

vital in our efforts to take on an organisation that  has

cast  its tentacles across national boundaries.  It  took

the  bombings  in Bali for the Indonesian  government  to

move  from self-denial to the fact that they already have

the  enemy  within.   The rest of the world  watches  us.

Investors  will  not  make that fine distinction  between

Singapore  and  other Southeast Asian  countries,  if  an

attack  takes  place anywhere in the  region.   When  the

bombs  in  Bali  went off, some countries  issued  travel

advisories   on   several  Southeast   Asian   countries,

Singapore included.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Deputy Speaker, when our neighbours up north,

in  their own wisdom, utter the "W" word in their dispute

with  us  over water and Pedra Branca, and in the process

send their own people into a frenzy, I think it is timely

for us also to remind them that what we have at hand is a

real war against an enemy, playing a game far more deadly

than  the  hysteria  we  have  to  bear  with  from  them

occasionally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

thank  you for allowing me to join in the debate  on  the

motion which I rise in support of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, indeed the battle against terrorism and JI in

particular,  is not one that many, including  our  Muslim

compatriots  here  and  in the region,  will  deny.   The

recurring   bombings,  calculated  by   these   extremist

elements to bring fear and terror to our civilised world,

have once again brought

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2105</b></font><br><br>



this  region  into  a state of war; albeit  a  war  of  a

different  sort.  We are, today, faced with  one  of  the

toughest  challenges yet since the days when  we  had  to

fight against the Communist insurgency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the fight against the Communists, the war on

terror  cannot  be fought against known  elements  alone.

For  every  Hambali or Bashir that we  put  into  prison,

there  will  be  hundreds  or  even  thousands  of  other

similarly minded extremists who will be willing  to  rise

in  their place.  Let us not under-estimate the extremity

of  hatred  or feelings that these radicals have  against

others  and  its effect on their actions.  What  we  have

here  is  a  very potent mix of religious  and  political

convictions that so fill these terrorists that death, the

very  ultimate sacrifice of all, no longer  serves  as  a

sobering influence on conduct.  In fact, for them, it  is

a  glory to die.  And, obviously, neither will it make  a

difference  that innocent civilians, and we  are  talking

here  of children, and of loving fathers and mothers  who

feed  these  children,  suffer  from  their  harmful  and

despicable actions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, perhaps the challenge we are faced with now is

even  greater  than  the  challenge  we  faced  from  the

Communist terrorists.  Communism is a political ideology.

We  could deal with it in surgical fashion.  We could ban

Communism.   We  could  isolate  Communist  guerillas  by

confining people in new villages.  And we taught a  whole

generation  of Singaporeans to believe that Communism  is

bad  and  is  the very antithesis of freedom and  wealth.

Indeed,  Communism has proven to be a bankrupt  ideology.

However, in the current fight against terrorism,  we  are

faced  with a very different enemy - people who  practise

terrorism  in the name of religion.  Sir, they  are  like

cancers in our body that cannot be gotten rid of.  We can

only treat it.  It may go into remission and one day,  it

may just rear its ugly head again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem here is the political and religious mix

of Islam.  Radical Islam has its roots in the Middle East

conflict.   The  creation of the state of Israel  in  the

post-war period, and the subsequent flood

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2106</b></font><br><br>



of  predominantly Muslim Palestinian refugees into Jordan

and  elsewhere has been an underlying source of  conflict

and  tension  in  the  Middle East.  That  the  Americans

should  be  seen to cast their lot with the  Israelis  in

this   conflict  throughout  does  not  help   with   the

perception  that  the Palestinians  have  been  given  an

unfair  deck  of  cards.   Throughout  this  period,  the

Islamic  revolution in Iran, together with the successful

overthrow  of the Soviet-backed regime in Afghanistan  by

the  Talebans, served to provide new inspiration for  the

growth of fundamentalism in Islam.  This was, in no small

part,  helped by the growing influence of Wahabism, which

is another form of fundamentalist Islam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The over-arching reach of fundamentalist Islam worldwide cannot be ignored. In Southeast Asia, the force of

Islam in the political realm cannot be ignored.  For many

states,  particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, no  serious

political  contender can hope to gain national prominence

without paying close attention to the Muslim ground.   In

Malaysia,  PAS, as an Islamic-based political party,  has

been  gaining much political grounds in recent elections;

and  this  despite  their  open  espousal  of  eventually

transforming Malaysia into an Islamic state based on  the

Syariah  laws.   Similarly,  in Indonesia,  Islamic-based

political  organisations, such as the NU, can often  turn

the   political  tide  in  an  electoral  contest.    The

influence  of these organisations in Indonesia has  grown

quite  dramatically in recent years and is a force to  be

reckoned with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in Singapore, the force of Islamic

fundamentalism  has not avoided us.   That  we  see  some

Muslims in Singapore pushing their bounds with the  State

on  their dress code in schools is but a variant  of  the

mix  between  religion and politics.  It is  no  accident

that, in the last 20 years at least, we see more and more

Muslims  becoming more conservative in the  doctrine  and

the  practice of their faith.  I know of many  colleagues

in my office who, over the years, have insisted on taking

on  the  strict Islamic code of dressing.  We  also  note

that there is an increasing number of Muslim parents who

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2107</b></font><br><br>



are choosing to send their children to the madrasahs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in case I am misunderstood, I am not against

any  form  of fundamentalism or conservatism in religious

practice.   In fact, I support it as the purist  approach

helps  to  keep  a  perspective on the original  founding

principles  of  the  faith.  What I  am  against  is  the

insistence  on  one's right to practise and  observe  his

beliefs  even if it means the others may feel that  their

personal  or  common public spaces may be  encroached  or

imposed upon.  Additionally, I am against the practice of

a  faith  in a manner that passes judgment on all  others

that  they are infidels and are destined for the  eternal

hell.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason and for the sake of our social

cohesion  that we issue a call to our Muslim  compatriots

to  be moderate in their faith.  Sir, whilst nobody would

deny  the  unassailable logic of the need to be moderate,

there  are  several issues associated with the call  that

should perhaps be discussed further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the battle against terrorism is not confined

simply   to  just  arresting  a  few  key  suspects   and

dismantling  the  JI network.  It goes beyond  that.   As

with our battle against Communism, it is really about the

battle for the hearts and minds of the people.  A fertile

ground  for  the spread of extremist ideas  would  always

exist  where social conditions permit.  Communism thrives

and  spreads  against a backdrop of abject poverty.   The

need  for moderation is a function of the extent to which

the  affected  social  class perceives  itself  as  being

marginalised  and  disadvantaged.  In  other  words,  the

greater  the  perception and reality that  they  are  not

beneficiaries of any progress or trickle of  wealth  that

comes  through the system, the greater is the  likelihood

of  those  affected,  rejecting  the  legitimacy  of  the

established regime and its leadership, and the  need  for

moderation  in  their  conduct.   The  bombings  in   the

Philippines and Indonesia grew as much out of  conditions

of   social  desperation  as  it  did  of  political  and

religious convictions.  Let me put it another

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2108</b></font><br><br>



way.   If the Philippines and Indonesia were in the  same

economic  league as Australia and Japan, would  the  same

extent of bombing incidents have taken place?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we cannot say that our Muslim

compatriots  are  a  deprived group.  However,  the  same

cannot  be  said  at  the same time  that  there  are  no

disparities  in the socio-economic conditions  among  the

Malay  Muslims  that  there is no reason  for  us  to  be

concerned.  Over the years, we recognise that the  social

and  political stability in Singapore can only come about

if  all ethnic groups moved together in reaping from  the

benefits  of  the progress in this country.  Indeed,  one

underlying  objective  for  establishing  Mendaki  is  to

ensure  that the Malay Muslims in Singapore are not  left

behind as the country prospers.  After more than 35 years

of  independence, one can confidently say that  the  gaps

between the Malay Muslims and the other ethnic groups are

closing.  However, more can be done.  There is still  the

perception  that we are still some way off in all  ethnic

groups being on par on the economic terms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, unfortunately, the disparity among the various

ethnic groups tends to sharpen in focus in times when the

economy  moves  into prolonged recession as  our  economy

seems to be heading.  The next few years will prove to be

equally  challenging as we struggle to recover  from  our

present  round  of sluggish economic performance.   Until

then,  there  will be many who will be unemployed.   Such

conditions tend to reinforce the "them and us" mentality.

If we are not careful, this may serve to deepen the fault

lines  in our society.  Certainly, it does not help  that

some  irresponsible parents could not have chosen a worse

time  to  bring up the tudung issue.  When  the  economic

tide  is down, the jetsam and the flotsam suddenly become

all  the  more  obvious for all to see.  Such  conditions

provide  the  fodder  with which  to  fuel  the  fire  of

extremist exploitation.  If the people, by and large, are

led  to  believe that their present plight is due not  so

much to structural economic problems but to the result of

unfair Government policy, we have a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2109</b></font><br><br>



problem  on  hand that the arrest of a few  key  trouble-makers is not going to resolve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my second point. When we speak of

moderate Islam, one question which arises is: who defines

what  is  moderate Islam?  And will the people, on  whose

shoulders  lie  the  responsibility of defining  moderate

Islam,  enjoy  the  legitimacy of  authority  within  the

target audience, or are they seen as just an extension of

the   regime  that  does  not  enjoy  their   trust   and

confidence?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Muslims in Singapore, as indeed Muslims all over

the  world,  are  subject  to  competing  influences  and

doctrines.  Just the other day, we read in the papers  of

how  a fiery cleric was asked to leave London because  of

the  inflammatory  content of  his  sermon.   Charismatic

clerics,  like  this one, can pose a  danger  to  society

simply from their ability to influence masses through the

power of their oratorical skills.  If you have heard  one

of  these fiery clerics preach, you would have known  how

persuasive and influential these preachers can be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise, in Singapore, MUIS is concerned about the

type  of  preachers who get invited to address the  local

congregation.   We,  too, recognise  how  much  damage  a

radical  and  persuasive cleric  can  do  to  our  social

fabric.   In  the Internet age, we live in  a  borderless

world.   No amount of restriction and restraint is  going

to   prevent  radical  Islam  from  spreading  among  and

influencing  the local people.  Ultimately,  whether  the

people who preach moderation will prevail will depend  on

their  legitimacy  in the eyes of the faithful.   To  the

extent  that these moderate leaders command the following

and  respect  of  the Muslims, there should  not  be  any

problem  in  holding the radicals at bay.   However,  the

ability of the moderate leaders in a cosmopolitan society

in   holding   the  Muslims  together  will  come   under

increasing   pressure  as  the  wave  of   fundamentalism

continues to sweep across the Southeast Asian region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslim leaders in Singapore, whether they are

politicians or religious leaders,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2110</b></font><br><br>



operate within the constraints of a multi-racial society.

It may not be possible for them at all times to impose on

the  larger society the specific demands of their  faith.

The  issues  of  wearing the tudung in  schools  and  the

restriction  of  sale of alcohol are but  some  examples.

The perceived inability to advance their specific demands

arguably   may  compromise  their  moral  authority   and

legitimate  standing, in the eyes of  the  followers,  to

talk  about  matters of the faith.  If this happens,  the

message  from the moderate leaders to the Muslims  to  be

moderate  may not enjoy the same support and standing  as

one  would  have hoped for.  The feared outcome  is  that

despite  the  message for moderation, there may  well  be

Muslims  who will continue to nurse a silent respect  for

the  Muslim terrorists who are prepared to die for  their

cause,  thus  lending a fertile ground for  other  Muslim

teachers to teach otherwise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, in this battle, the State cannot be seen

to have an active part in defining what moderate Islam is

or  should be, and neither the religious teachers who are

expected  to  lead the way be seen to be  agents  of  the

State.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, social cohesion, even in the context of

moderate  Islam, cannot be strengthened if,  as  we  have

seen   in   recent   years,  the  mosques   continue   to

increasingly  serve as a focal point for the  Muslims  in

Singapore.   As  an MP on the ground, I cannot  help  but

notice that many Muslims are increasingly retreating into

the  comfort zones of the mosques for their religious and

other  needs as well.  I can only attribute this  to  the

recent  resurgence in Islam in Singapore,  and  this  has

inspired  many to turn to the mosques.  This has resulted

in  low  participation  rate  for  the  secular  communal

activities   among   the  Muslims   at   our   grassroots

organisations.  Just look at the participation rate among

the  Muslims  on  the activities organised  by  community

centres in Singapore today.  I dare say that, without the

benefit   of  a  proper  study,  the  number  of  Muslims

participating  in these activities can be  improved,  and

the low number certainly is not welcomed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2111</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This withdrawal, coupled with the recent events,

certainly provide much room for unhealthy prejudices  and

misgivings  among Singaporeans.  For social  cohesion  to

strengthen, Muslims in Singapore should not be seen to be

setting  themselves  apart  from  the  rest  of  society.

Instead, they should be seen to be actively engaging  the

wider  society  in various activities in order  to  build

more  bridges so that whatever prejudices the others  may

have will disappear.  Firm friendships and bonds must  be

engendered  that  go  beyond the  market  and  workplace.

Token  visits  to each other's places of  worship  as  an

outer sign of promoting racial harmony should be expanded

to  include active interaction and exchanges.   As  loyal

Singaporeans, we should make it a point to develop  long-lasting and deep friendships with people who are  not  of

the  same colour of skin or of the same creed.  Only then

will  we be able to disabuse ourselves and perhaps others

of  whatever prejudices that may have previously festered

in our minds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this debate is not only about combating

terrorism and the Jemaah Islamiyah in particular.   I  do

not deny that these issues are important.  This debate is

also  about  the larger context within which  the  battle

against terrorism is fought.  This battle goes beyond the

hunt  for  and  the  arrest of key JI  or  even  Al-Qaeda

suspects.  To succeed, we must be mindful that, as in our

fight  against the Communists, we have to win the  hearts

and minds of those involved.  For our Muslim compatriots,

moderation  in the practice of their faith must  continue

to  remain the cornerstone of their belief, if we want to

maintain racial and religious harmony in Singapore.   For

the   non-Muslims,  nursing  unfounded   prejudices   and

engaging  in  discriminatory practices is  a  recipe  for

disaster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that the flag which represents

this country uses the red colour to signify the universal

brotherhood  of man.  It should not matter  that  we  are

Muslims,  Christians,  Buddhists, Hindus  or  even  free-thinkers.  What matters most is that we are Singaporeans

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2112</b></font><br><br>



dedicated as a people towards building a country that  we

can  all  be proud of.  The day we forget this  principle

would  be  the day when we go down the slippery slope  of

strife  and  racial tension.  If that happens,  Singapore

will just be another sad statistic of a dream shattered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost is high, if we do not succeed in this

battle.  We must therefore strengthen our resolve  to  do

whatever  it  takes,  and  to take  whatever  to  do,  to

vanquish terrorism and all its attendant evil.   We  have

no choice on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion in the name

of the Minister for Home Affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I empathise with those who wish that the debate

on  this issue should not be prolonged, especially so for

one  who  is  the  13th speaker of the  day!   Enough  is

enough,  some might say, both by Muslims and  non-Muslims

in  Singapore.   Perhaps, a sentiment felt  more  by  the

Muslim Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for those who believe so, Mr Wong's remarks

earlier, I trust, would explain why this White Paper  had

to  be  presented  to  Parliament.   Muslim  Singaporeans

should  rest assured that this Paper is not about finding

fault  with the overwhelming majority of Muslims who  are

moderate and tolerant.  Indeed, these Muslim Singaporeans

themselves  feel that they are the victims of this  small

group of misled Singaporeans who tried to hijack Islam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It bears reiterating that the majority of Muslim

Singaporeans  believe in living peacefully  with  others,

especially  in  this  plural,  multi-racial  and   multi-religious  Singapore.  It will reassure the Muslims  that

this  debate  is not about finger-pointing Islam  as  the

cause  for  all  the ills brought about by  the  face  of

terror  today.  Yes, Muslims will be quick to  point  out

that  there is only one Islam, but they cannot deny  that

there are many faces of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2113</b></font><br><br>



Muslims and many ways how Islam is interpreted or, worse,

abused.    Even   here,   there  is   room   for   better

understanding among Muslims themselves, and also  by  the

non-Muslims.  There are many grey areas here, where black-and-white  pronouncements might not be the quick  answers

towards better understanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a long haul, and requires patience,

perseverance  and wisdom in handling it.   It  calls  for

continued  confidence-building.  It is not the form  that

matters.   Yes, visits to mosques, temples, churches  and

clan  associations  must continue, dialogues  on  how  to

handle differences made a staple programme for grassroots

organisations,  but the underlying foundation  to  better

understanding should be greater tolerance and  acceptance

in  diversity.   Race and religious relations  should  be

inclusive  rather  than exclusive.  Most  importantly,  a

total  rejection  of  terrorism,  no  matter  what  their

causes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The White Paper in front of us for debate has called

this  threat of JI-types and of terrorism as  a  national

one.   Do  enough Singaporeans know what that means?   Do

Singaporeans  really  know how  serious  the  threat  is?

Judging from the reaction of some of whom I have  met,  I

am  not  sure  they do.  For sure, not many  Singaporeans

have read the White Paper.  We hope many more will follow

the  Parliamentary debate on the White Paper,  as  it  is

critical that as many Singaporeans as possible understand

what holds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans better believe that this threat is

real.   JI is real, and the threat of terrorism, whatever

the  cause, is real.  Any sense of denial, as still  held

by  some,  will  not help.  However,  this  needs  to  be

addressed,  perhaps  through  more  dialogues,  even   at

grassroots   level,   as   some   generally   responsible

grassroots leaders do seem to still harbour such feelings

of scepticism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a recent Feedback Unit dialogue which I chaired,

for  example,  there are still those  who  are  sceptical

about  the  findings, even to the point of  doubting  the

integrity of the ISD.  "Was force used?",

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2114</b></font><br><br>



they asked.  "Why not charge them in open court, if there

are  already enough evidence?", they asked.  I  hope  the

booklet "Why the ISA", recently issued by the Ministry of

Home Affairs, will help to explain and convince more  why

Singapore has to tackle the issue this way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those not convinced, even the question of why no

public confession was yet raised, despite the explanation

given  why  such  an approach was stopped  following  the

experience of earlier ISA arrests.  All these add to  the

notion  how  complex  the issue is and  why  we  need  to

continue to educate and reach out to more Singaporeans to

make  them understand how national this issue is and  why

it needs more careful handling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslim Singaporeans who still feel uneasy about them

and  their  religion  Islam being in  the  spotlight  yet

again, rest assured that it is more of the effort on  the

part  of  the Government to throw more light  on  the  JI

arrests, the JI members' operations, their psyche,  their

regional   and   global  connections  and  their   deadly

dastardly  schemes.   For those who  openly  or  secretly

empathise  with  such  suicidal  terroristic  methods  of

furthering the JI cause, think how you would feel if your

own innocent flesh and blood fell victim to such bombings

or  attacks.  If you say it is still all right, then  the

problem is even more serious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some, although having accepted the threat of JI and

terrorism,  wondered  why  the Government  prolonged  the

debate.   "The  sooner we close the matter, the  better",

fearing  that the image of Muslim Singaporeans  would  be

affected, not only locally but all over the world.   They

question  the need to place the White Paper on  sale  and

made available freely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I feel otherwise, as I agree

with  the  need  for the White Paper  to  be  issued  and

debated.  However, I trust the Minister will explain  why

the  price was pegged at a high of $22 each when we would

like it to reach more citizens.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2115</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe there are many Singaporeans who feel, "Oh,

no,  not  another JI report!", or "Why place the  Muslims

under  the spotlight again?"  But I feel this White Paper

should be made essential reading for as many Singaporeans

as  possible, if we want to ensure that the challenge  of

terrorism  we face is understood as national.   Teachers,

community  leaders, including religious leaders,  need  a

good  understanding of the issue and the  role  they  can

play to bring about better social cohesion.  However, the

White  Paper needs to be reduced to simpler language  and

creative  graphic  representations  to  reach   as   many

Singaporeans as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslim Singaporeans should feel reassured that the

White  Paper  made  it clear that the large  majority  of

Singapore  Muslims and Islam were not at  fault.   It  is

this  small  group  of  misguided JI-type  Muslims  which

Muslim Singaporeans and non-Muslim Singaporeans alike are

concerned about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth reiterating that this is not a question

of  Muslims  and  Islam  yet again under  the  spotlight.

Thanks  to  ISD,  also the regional security  cooperation

with the relevant authorities in Malaysia, Indonesia, the

Philippines   and   many  other  international   players,

Singapore  was able to nip the problem in the  bud.   The

efficacy  and  good intentions of the  ISD  need  not  be

doubted.   Networks  of  terrorist  destruction  work  in

strange and most irresponsible ways.  They care not lives

of  innocents, and rationalise such dastardly  acts  even

with religious conveniences and mis-justifications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also noteworthy that the original tip-off that

led  to  the  JI arrests came from a Muslim  Singaporean,

just to emphasise that Muslims and non-Muslims alike will

have to fight this battle together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the JI is Muslim-connected, so is the Al-Qaeda,

but  Muslim  Singaporeans must be bold enough  to  reject

them  as their methods bring terror, not solution to  the

problems faced.  The collective

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2116</b></font><br><br>



rejection  of the JI and acts of terrorism  by  the  more

than  120  Muslim  groups  in Singapore  bodes  well  for

Singapore and our fight against extremism and terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-Muslim Singaporeans, on their part, should

remove  any  fear  of  Muslims or Islam  in  general  and

instead  work  hand-in-hand with the Muslim community  to

rid of this menace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about ISD, Sir, I remember their

professional work standards which Singapore can be  proud

of.   Back  in  1973,  when the University  of  Singapore

Muslim  Society was invited by President Moammar Ghaddafi

to  attend the International Youth Conference, they  knew

about  it.  I had to convince the ISD officers  that  the

University  of  Singapore Muslim Society representatives,

including  myself, were moderate Muslims, even though  we

were  going to Libya, and that they have nothing to worry

about.   We  were open and transparent about  the  matter

but,  despite  that,  both the USMS representatives  were

stopped  at  the  airport on their  return  and  all  the

publications were confiscated for checking.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was furious as they had doubted me and my loyalty,

I  thought,  but on hindsight, was happy that  they  were

thorough  and  professional in their  conduct  and  work.

During that two-week stay in Libya, many things happened.

Yes,  most of those who attended the conference  were  in

search of answers for their troubled situations back home

and  in  the Muslim world.  Where was the answer promised

by  Islam?   There  were  so many  double  standards  and

hypocracies felt in international relations.  It was true

then,  and  I  am  sure you will say the  same  for  now.

Ghaddafi  had  proposed Islam as the Third  International

Theory,  where he said that capitalism and Communism  had

failed,  and brought about the Green Book, as his  answer

to  the  world's  predicaments.  Most  of  the  delegates

rejected  the theory and the conference ended in failure,

much to the chagrin of the host.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delegates then participated in demonstrations,

peaceful though, on the streets

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2117</b></font><br><br>



of  Tripoli for the Palestinian cause and some were  even

approached  to  serve in the shadow cabinet-in-exile  for

the  Moros  of  the  Philippines.   There  were  lots  of

sympathies for many causes of the Muslim then world-wide,

but  that  did not make us, in fact, most delegates,  see

the need to go the JI way or to resort to terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The serious threat of misconceived "Jihad" or "Holy

War", is real, even till today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr M J Akbar, writing in his book, The Shade of

Swords,   Jihad  and  the  Conflict  between  Islam   and

Christianity,  concludes that "Defeat (of  Osama  and  Al

Qaeda  and  the Talebans) is only a setback in  the  holy

war.  The Jihad goes on".  However, that should not alarm

us,  as  it  is not new.  The power of jihad,  for  some,

pervades  the mind and soul of Islam.  The mind is  where

the  current battle will be fought, and this  is  why  it

will be a very long war.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muslim Singaporeans should realise that they should

not  be  pawns, nor proxy, to such battles.   The  lesson

from Pakistan is clear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a bloodbath separation from India to form its

own  country  of majority Muslims, it is now  seen  as  a

hotbed of this battle of the mind.  M J Akbar wrote  that

Pakistan  has  become  a  haven of  terrorists  who  have

created  "a state within a state".  He said that  no  one

said  this  more clearly than President Pervez Musharraf,

when in an address to the nation a year ago, asked for an

end  to  the  culture  of jihad.  He told  the  extremist

clergy that they must stop encouraging gullible young men

into martyrdom, as he would not want Pakistan to take the

responsibility for jihad across the world.  He would  not

allow  mosques  to  be misused and seminaries  to  become

schools for hatred.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Malaysia too, the ruling government has begun its

crackdown  on  rural religious schools  (SARs)  that  sow

hatred against the government by withdrawing funding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, for Singapore, the bad influence was

marginal and had been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2118</b></font><br><br>



nipped  in  the bud.  Nevertheless, it happened  and  can

happen  again.  It is therefore the duty of all to ensure

such tendencies do not repeat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUIS and local Muslim groups and leaders have done

well  in responding to the call to reject extremist views

and  acts  of  terrorism.   The  Malay  MPs  have  stated

unequivocally  their position to reject the  JI  and  its

extremist  agenda.   Together with the  Malay  community,

they   have  pledged  to  continue  to  work  with  other

Singaporeans to bring about a more cohesive, multi-racial

and  multi-religious society.  Realising that  the  fight

against  terrorism  and extremism will  be  a  long-drawn

affair,  the Malay MPs call on everyone, Malays and  non-Malays alike, to stand up and work together to strengthen

mutual trust and confidence and move on as a nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in Delhi in November, I learned that

further   bloodshed   was   avoided   when   the   Muslim

organisations  came out in force to condemn  the  violent

and  terrorist attacks by extremist Muslim groups on  the

Hindu community in Gujerat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, following a denial mode in Indonesia from

most  Muslim  groups, the Bali bomb blast of  October  12

jolted  them  to work alongside the Government  to  fight

terrorism.   This,  I was told, avoided  a  very  serious

backlash  between the majority Hindus  in  Bali  and  the

minority Muslims on the island.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore have this unique

opportunity  to  work together to remove  such  unhealthy

radicalism among fringe Muslim groups.  This is a  battle

we  do not have to, and cannot fight alone.  I would like

to urge the Government to enhance regional cooperation so

as  to  ensure  that no one group can  abuse  the  common

borders  for any terrorist attacks.  There are more  that

can  be  done  in terms of regional cooperation  in  this

fight against terrorism, and we certainly look forward to

our neighbours sharing this sense of urgency.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2119</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on a final note, we must do all we can to find

ways  to make both our Muslim Singaporeans and non-Muslim

Singaporeans to be at ease with each other.   Yes,  there

will be a certain amount of awkwardness, as mentioned  by

Mr  Wong  just now, but let that be just a passing  wind.

Let  us  look to the IRCC and Harmony Circles  to  bridge

better  relations and understanding at the HDB heartland.

More  Malays/Muslims  should  use  this  opportunity   to

improve  the  level  of participation at  the  grassroots

level.  There is now an unprecedented demand for a better

understanding about the Malay-Muslim way of life and  the

Malays/Muslims  should  not waste  this  opportunity  for

better bridging and better understanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a lighter note, Sir, although it is quite late,

it would not be long before Mr Rafi of Marine Parade will

be  comfortable again with his sarong, where and when  he

chooses  to  wear, although I personally  feel  that  the

sarong is best worn at home.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, when I read the White Paper on the  Jemaah

Islamiyah  Arrests  and The Threat of  Terrorism,  I  was

sobered by the realisation that we are in for a long-term

battle with terrorism, and that it is a difficult battle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a difficult battle for at least two reasons.

First,  it  is tied up with the shadowy force of  radical

and  militant Islam in the world and in the region.  And,

second, the outcome of the battle is not totally  in  our

hands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JI branch in Singapore is part of a larger JI

network with cells in the region, such as in Malaysia and

Indonesia.   It  is  part of the same  network  that  has

carried  out dozens of other deadly bombings in Indonesia

and the Philippines in the past few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a multi-national organisation, operating

across  borders.  This means that the problems cannot  be

wiped out, no

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2120</b></font><br><br>



matter   how  effective  our  security  and  intelligence

agencies are, because the key operatives are outside  the

country  and  beyond our control.  It is  instructive  to

note  that  the  Singapore  JI  branch  reported  to  the

Malaysian JI leadership.  This means that Singapore  will

always have to be on guard against its citizens not being

recruited  by  foreign radical Muslim  leaders  or  their

extreme  interpretations of the faith, and that they  are

not swayed by their militant causes and visions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the White Paper, one can glean that the

Singaporeans arrested for their JI activities  harbour  a

strong anti-US sentiment, coupled with a belief that they

should  wage  militant jihad against  the  oppressors  of

Muslims in the world, such as against Christians  in  the

Malukus  in  Indonesia.   Indeed,  while  some   of   the

Singaporeans  arrested  have  had  combat  experience  in

Afghanistan,  many  have  had  training  nearby,  in  the

Malukus  and  Batam  in Indonesia,  as  well  as  in  the

Philippines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These conflicts in the region not only served to

give concrete meaning to the concept of militant jihad, a

key  element  of JI's ideology, but also provided  easily

accessible  places  where recruits from  Singapore  could

gain practical combat experience.  While the Singaporeans

joined in the fight in what may seem to be local disputes

in  the region, they also believed in the ultimate aim of

their  struggle  -  for an Islamic state  empire  in  the

region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several were even willing to be suicide bombers, if

they  were  instructed to do so by the JI leaders  -  the

ultimate sacrifice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, against this backdrop, I would like to

highlight three points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, this is a regional problem which requires

regional cooperation and regional political will.  And at

all  levels,  not  just at the level of intelligence  and

security  agencies,  and not just exchanging  information

and acting on them.  Let me explain.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2121</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take one of the plans by Hambali, the JI point-main

with   Al-Qaeda,  who  wanted  to  attack  key  Singapore

installations,  and  to  represent  them   as   acts   of

aggression by the Malaysian government.  According to the

White  Paper, Hambali's aim was to create a situation  in

Malaysia  and  Singapore, which  would  be  conducive  to

overthrowing  the Malaysian government  and  provoking  a

revolution  that  would  turn Malaysia  into  an  Islamic

state.   Hambali wanted to provoke distrust and animosity

between a "Muslim" Malaysia and a "Chinese Singapore" and

cause  ethnic strife in both countries.  Hambali's  hope,

the White Paper added, was that Muslims in both countries

would  then respond to calls for jihad and turn  Malaysia

and Singapore into another Ambon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, just reading the newspapers, especially the

Malaysian  ones, over the last few months  or  so,  would

give  one the impression that it does not need a  Hambali

to   provoke  distrust  and  animosity  between  the  two

countries.   It  would  seem that  some  politicians  and

commentators  are quite capable of doing that  already  -

whipping  up anti-Singapore sentiments over any  possible

issue,  from  the  ownership of  Pedra  Branca,  to  land

reclamation and the supply of water.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is particularly disturbing is that the

discourse  in  Malaysia is not above evoking  anti-Muslim

images.   For  instance,  the  Malaysian  Berita   Harian

published  an  editorial  in December  titled  "Singapore

Behaving  Like  The Jews In Claiming Batu Putih  Island".

The Malay-language daily said that Singapore was behaving

like   the   Jews  who  stole  land  belonging   to   the

Palestinians.   I  quote, "So just like  Israel  that  is

surrounded by Arab countries, Singapore is like a  Jewish

state surrounded by Malay states."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, now, we know that Israel and

the  Palestine issues are explosive issues which  provoke

deep  resentment in most parts of the Muslim world.  Such

rhetoric  to  cast Singapore in such light is  dangerous.

It is dangerous not only because it may give radical

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2122</b></font><br><br>



Muslims  around  the  world another  reason  to  look  at

Singapore  as  a  target  for  militant  jihad.   It   is

dangerous   also  because  it  can  create  a   tinderbox

atmosphere  in  which the racial and religious  cleavages

between  the  two  countries can be easily  exploited  by

militant Muslims with just a strike of the match, at  the

right, or rather, the wrong time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such rhetoric is also grossly irresponsible.

Singapore  is  a multi-racial state, with  a  significant

Muslim minority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not oblivious to the vagaries of the

election  season in neighbouring countries, but  I  would

urge the politicians from across the Causeway to bear  in

mind the major challenge facing us together, and that  is

the threat of terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it may seem easy and almost cost-free to score

political  points  at home by whipping up  anti-Singapore

sentiments,  it  is  a high-risk game,  especially  given

these volatile times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like two next-door neighbours quarrelling

about  who owns the spot outside the doorway, when  there

are  ruthless murderers lurking along the corridors  with

bombs  that  will  not only blow up  the  contested  spot

outside  the  door  but all that they have  built  within

their homes as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember that our fates are intertwined. It

is  important  that  the countries in  this  region  work

together  to  present  a  united  front  in  curbing  the

influence of extremist groups in this region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards this effort, people-to-people relations

between  the  two  countries should be  strengthened  and

greater  understanding fostered.  Such  a  civil  society

project   cannot  move  forward  if  the  poisonous   and

fractious atmosphere between the two countries remain and

is allowed to escalate, stoked by one-sided media reports

which  demonise Singapore.  Once hatred is sowed  in  the

heart of the peoples, it can take on a dynamic of its

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2123</b></font><br><br>



own   and  be  beyond  the  control  of  their  political

masterminds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bilateral disputes, however vexing, should be seen

against  the bigger strategic picture.  We face a  common

challenge.  We share a common destiny, whether we like it

or not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are regarded by the international community as

a region that is plagued by disputes and instability, and

one  that  breeds Islamic radicals, this would  undermine

investor confidence and affect our future development  as

individual  countries and as a region.  Such  an  outcome

will make it all the harder for leaders in this region to

win  the support of their people against the more extreme

Islamic  political groups offering an alternative  vision

of a spiritual society, withdrawn from the secular modern

world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growing popularity of Islamic parties around the

world, such as in Turkey and Pakistan, in the face of the

US-led  war  on  terrorism  -  a  war  often  painted  by

Islamic  political opportunists as anti-Islam  -   points

to the challenge that this region faces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is another complication that we in

Singapore  have to watch out for, and that is the  latent

anti-American sentiment in some quarters in  the  region.

It  can  be easily whipped up and exploited by those  who

want  to play to their domestic Muslim gallery.   Add  to

this  the tensions created by a possible war on Iraq  and

the picture for the region looks even more uncertain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America has become the big issue in the war against

terrorism,  when  the issue should  be  rooting  out  the

terrorists  and halting the rise of militant Islam.   The

growing anti-Americanism, if not checked, will only  make

it  easier  to  recruit  young men for  suicide  missions

against   US  and  Western  targets  around  the   world,

including in this region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we have to make sure our own society

knows where its national

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2124</b></font><br><br>



interests  lie and protect it.  We may not  always  agree

with  the  US  and,  indeed, we have disagreed  with  the

superpower on several occasions in international forums.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International law and the legitimacy of the UN are

important  to Singapore, especially since it is  a  small

state.  But even as we discuss the merits or demerits, or

the  rightness  or  wrongness of a possible  war  against

Iraq, Singaporeans, as individuals and groups, must guard

against anti-US feelings taking hold.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's decision must be made on the basis

of  Singapore's  national interest, and  that  means  the

collective interest of all Singaporeans.  If a  war  does

indeed   take   place  against  Iraq,   there   will   be

repercussions  in  the Southeast Asian region,  which  is

predominantly  Muslim,  and we  should  prepare  for  the

various scenarios.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Singaporeans face a challenge from two

perspectives.   For Muslims, the ongoing debate  is  what

interpretation of Islam will dominate, how  to  reconcile

it  with modernity and a secular multi-racial state.  For

non-Muslims,  it is how to negotiate a common  space  and

how to accommodate the concerns of Muslims in building  a

national way of life, in which all are equal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to show that our pluralistic and tolerant

way  of  life is superior to the one offered  by  extreme

Islamic  groups.   That  our way of  life  is  not  about

reducing  everything to economic growth but is  a  humane

one, based on justice and equality.  That our way of life

makes room for a diversity of religions, but rejects  the

religion of oppression and violence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a positive thing that progressive debates

about  Islam are taking place in Singapore.  Such debates

are  also  ongoing  in  neighbouring  countries.   It  is

helpful  to observe the regional debate so as to be  able

to  counter over-simplified arguments of many Muslims and

critics  of  Islam, maintaining that the Quran prescribes

this or that.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2125</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, the discussion of Islam in modernity

should   not   be   restricted  only  to  religious   and

intellectual  circles.   It  is  worth  noting  that   in

neighbouring  countries, there is  an  active  discussion

among  different Muslim groups on human  rights  and  the

women's  role  in  Islam.  They include  groups  such  as

Malaysia's   Sisters  of  Islam,  a   group   of   Muslim

professional women committed to promoting the  rights  of

women within the framework of Islam, and also the women's

wing  of  the biggest moderate Muslim group in Indonesia,

Nahdlatul  Ulama.   The  women's  wing,  called  Muslimat

Nahdlatul Ulama, seeks to empower Muslim women.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have heard women leaders from these groups

speak.   Their underlying argument is that not  only  the

ulamas  have the right to codify the text of  the  Quran,

and  that  interpretations should not  be  isolated  from

historical   and   socio-cultural   context,   especially

regarding  women  and contemporary society.   They  argue

against the use of religion to justify cultural practices

and  values that regard women as inferior and subordinate

to  men.   They believe that this has been made  possible

because   men  have  had  exclusive  control   over   the

interpretation of the text of the Quran.   This  is  what

these Muslim women in these countries have been saying.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, it is imperative that the progressive

voices  of  Muslim  women be also heard  in  the  ongoing

debate on the interpretation of Islam.  Battling militant

Islam  is  not the only responsibility of the  State  but

also  of the civil society, both Islamic and non-Islamic,

involving both men and women.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, we are under threat from

terrorism,  and we must combat it; there  is  no  denying

that.   But we must avoid any generalisation so that  the

justified fear of specific threats does not turn into  an

undefined  fear  which makes an enemy of  anyone  who  is

overtly religious.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 2126</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of Singapore Muslims have shown, in

their  words and their actions, that Islam is a  religion

of  peace, openness and moderation.  They are well-placed

to show the world that Islam can be a modernising factor,

and  can  make  a positive contribution to  the  peaceful

development of this country and the region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is the moment for us to proceed against

terrorism  with all possible determination and  toughness

so  as  to weaken it and to deter sympathisers.   And  to

make  clear  that,  we, the citizens of Singapore,  stand

together  as  one united people, regardless  of  race  or

religion, against terrorism.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<div align="center"><b>YOUNG DRUG ABUSERS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul Ghani</b> asked the

Minister for Home Affairs (a) whether the Ministry has  a

profile  of  youths  at high risk of  becoming  new  drug

abusers;  (b) what has been done to prevent these  youths

from  becoming drug abusers; and (c) how successful  have

these measures been.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The typical young drug abuser used to be a male

heroin  abuser  below the age of 20.   In  recent  years,

however,  in  percentage  terms,  synthetic  drugs   have

displaced heroin as the main drug of abuse amongst  young

abusers  below  the age of 20. 61% of the young  arrested

last  year  were abusers of synthetic drugs, compared  to

37% of them being heroin abusers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to compile a profile of young drug

abusers. This is because youths from all backgrounds find

themselves  tempted to try synthetic  drugs.  Such  "club

drugs"  are  touted  as being hip and harmless  when,  in

fact, they are harmful and potentially even fatal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA)

spearheads   a   wide   range  of  preventive   education

programmes  to  spread the anti-drug message  to  a  wide

spectrum  of  our youths. Let me outline  some  of  these

measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the school front, CNB conducts talks to

students   on  the  dangers  of  drugs.  CNB   has   also

introduced anti-drug messages into the school curriculum.

Visits  are  conducted  to  Drug  Rehabilitation  Centres

(DRCs)  to  warn youths of the dangers and  penalties  of

drug  abuse. More recently, NCADA launched a  new  online

preventive drug education tool called David's Diary. This

has been well utilised and received by schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NCADA also supports the PAL programme under the

Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association which aims to  reach

out  to  out-of-school youths. In 2001, an estimated  600

youths  received  assistance  under  the  programme.  140

eventually  returned to school while  others  managed  to

find employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for synthetic drug abuse which is associated

with  the  nightlife and entertainment outlets frequented

by  youths, NCADA, over the past two years, has partnered

the  management  of  clubs to conduct  an  annual  "Clubs

Against  Drugs"  campaign  to communicate  the  anti-drug

message to club-goers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to report that these efforts have

been  successful.  The  number of  youths  below  age  20

arrested for drug abuse has declined from the peak of 679

in  1993 to 203 in 2002*, a significant drop of 70%.  The

problem   is  under  control.   Nevertheless,  MHA   will

continue  to work with the community and the  schools  to

instill an attitude of zero tolerance towards drug  abuse

amongst our youths.

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD RENTAL FLATS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong</b> asked the Minister for

National Development if he will  (a) give a breakdown  of

the  total  number of Housing and Development Board  one- and  two-room rental flats in Singapore;  (b) state  what

is  the trend in the demand for such flats over the  last

five  years; and (c) provide a profile of the tenants  in

terms of age, marital status, sex and occupation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB rental flats are meant for Singaporean

households  with monthly incomes not exceeding  $800  who

are  financially not ready or unable to afford their  own

flats. As at 31st December 2002, HDB had 19,869 (45%) one-room rental flats and 24,045 (55%) two-room rental flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demand for HDB rental flats has remained

stable over the last five years, with an average of about

2,500 Public Scheme applications per year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at 31st December 2002, 48% of the 35,800 rental

tenants  are elderly persons aged 61 and above,  and  12%

are  aged 40 and below.  In terms of marital status,  30%

of  them are singles, 34% are married and 36% are  either

widowed or divorced/separated persons. As for gender, 59%

are male and 41% are female.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB does not maintain ready information on the

occupations  of its rental tenants.  According  to  HDB's

Household Sample Survey conducted in 1998, 35% of tenants

were  not  working (eg, housewives, disabled,  retirees),

28%  were sales & services workers (eg, sales assistants,

labourers, cleaners) and 21% were production workers.

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL HEALTHCARE GROUP STAFF BONUSES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Health

whether  all  the staff of the National Healthcare  Group

were  given institution bonuses and how were the  bonuses

calculated.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since clustering, NHG and SingHealth have been

given  the autonomy to manage their resources to maximise

performance  and  minimise wastage.  In line  with  this,

they  now  have  autonomy to decide  on  salary  matters,

including   bonuses,   using   well-established    market

principles to reward performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NHG currently pays an institution bonus to

incentivise  all  round  performance  of  the  individual

institutions,   besides  paying  individual   performance

bonuses and a cluster bonus.   This is paid in the  month

of  July to staff of institutions that showed improvement

in  a  set  of  performance factors  covering  financial,

operational,   service,  quality,  care,   teaching   and

research. The decision on institution bonus is  taken  at

the  cluster management level, and approved  by  the  NHG

Board   Human  Resource  Committee.  Since  this   is   a

performance-based  bonus  and  not  an  entitlement,  the

actual  payout will depend on whether and the  extent  to

which  an  institution has improved in  its  performance.

Nonetheless, all staff in an institution will receive the

same quantum of payment when institution bonus is granted

to the institution.

for  occupations  is  determined  by  adding  the  number

employed   in  a  given  occupation  to  the  number   of

unemployed persons who have worked previously in the same

occupation.  The  number of unemployed  persons  is  then

divided by the labour force.
