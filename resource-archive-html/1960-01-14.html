<div align="center"><b>OFFENCES RELATING TO VEHICLES BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing law, persons who commit

theft of motor vehicles or bicycles, or parts of

these  vehicles,  are only charged  with  simple

theft  for  which  the maximum penalty  for  the

first offence is three years' imprisonment or  a

fine  or  both; but in practice,  such  a  heavy

penalty is seldom imposed. At the present  time,

thefts  of motor vehicles, including motorcycles

and  of  bicycles are quite common in Singapore.

Although action has been taken by the Police  to

endeavour  to reduce the number of such  thefts,

and  in  spite  of the number of arrests,  these

thefts  remain at a high level. It is considered

that the present penalties are inadequate to act

as   a   deterrent  in  these  rather   abnormal

conditions



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before the House, therefore,

seeks to enhance the punishment for the theft of

motor vehicles which include motorcycles, and of

bicycles or parts thereof, to a maximum of seven

years' imprisonment. It also prescribes that the

minimum  sentence  for  the  theft  of  a  motor

vehicle or motor vehicle part shall be one year,

and  for the theft of a bicycle or bicycle  part

shall  be  three  months' imprisonment.  In  all

cases, provision is made for the imposition of a

fine as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 (1) of the Bill enhances the penalty

for  those who are found guilty of receiving  or

retaining  motor  vehicles,  bicycles  or  parts

thereof, which are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



proved  to be stolen property, and prescribes  a

maximum term of imprisonment of five years  with

a  minimum  term of six months and provides  for

the imposition of a fine as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, clause 4 (2) of the Bill imposes

the  same penalty on those who are found  guilty

of   voluntarily  assisting  in  concealing   or

disposing of motor vehicles or bicycles or parts

thereof, which are proved to be stolen property.

The provisions of this section are necessary  to

ensure  that  not  only  the  thieves  shall  be

adequately  punished  when  detected,  but  also

those  who  encourage such thefts  by  providing

facilities for the disposal of stolen property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill empowers the District

Court  to  impose the full enhanced  punishments

for offences committed under this Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is of interest to note that similar

legislation was enacted in 1946 when  thefts  of

vehicles, bicycles and spare parts thereof  were

exceedingly   prevalent   in   Singapore.   This

legislation  had  a  salutary  effect,  but  was

allowed  to  lapse  in 1948 when  the  situation

became more normal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill is to be in force for one

year  in  the  first instance, but provision  is

made for its extension from time to time by  the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara. Such  extension  would

depend  on  whether circumstances prevailing  at

the time warrant it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, this Bill does not seek to create a new

offence in the sense that it will give the

Police something, new in respect of which they

could charge an offending person. There are

sufficient provisions, Mr Speaker, Sir, in, our

penal system whereby people who will contravene

the provisions of this Bill can be brought to

book. There is the Penal Code offence of theft,

receiving stolen property, and of assisting in

the concealing or disposing of stolen property

which meets the offences set out in this Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this Bill proposes to do, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  is to increase the punishment in the hope

that that increased punishment would reduce the

crimes.  There is a statement on page  3  which

says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This Bill will not involve the Government in

any extra financial expenditure."

<br><br>Might  I suggest to the Minister who is  moving

this  Bill  that  if  his Government  does  not

propose to incur extra financial expenditure in

enforcing this Bill, when it becomes law,  this

law  will  remain redundant and quite  useless.

Sir,  may  I  with respect again say  that  the

difficulty is not that our laws do not  provide

the  remedies - they do - but that the  Police  are

not  able  to arrest the thieves, however  much

the  punishment might be: for 10 years, for 15

years,  or  it  might be a sentence  for  life.

Before  the  sentences  can  be  imposed,   the

thieves  have to be caught! That is  where  our

system is about to break down. The Police think

that  if  the  punishments are increased,  they

have  half  solved  the  crime.  In  1947,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, it was necessary to bring  in  a

special   law   to  deal  with  this   peculiar

situation  then. In that year, Sir,  you  might

remember  there  was a very great  shortage  of

transport,  and it was a common occurrence  for

people  to  lose  their bicycles  or  motorcars

every day. As far as I know, this is not a very

prevalent  occurrence at the moment.  In  fact,

what the police are trying to do is to cut down

on  the number of vehicles on the roads as much

as possible. To suggest that it is necessary to

bring  in  this  Bill  because  the  theft   of

vehicles  is so prevalent, is not a proposition

which  I  can  accept. I would suggest  to  the

people  who  enforce the law  that  it  is  not

increased punishments that will stop the  theft

of  vehicles, but the catching of  the  thieves

that is going to stop it.



<br><br>2.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Labour and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in a situation where

there is evidence that there is an increase  in

offences   such  as  the  theft  of   bicycles,

motorcars   and   parts  belonging   to   these

vehicles,  and  also the offence  of  dishonest

retention  and purchase of such articles  which

are the subject of thefts, the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



Farrer  Park  will  appreciate  that  it  is

necessary for the Government to take determined

action to suppress this sort of crime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he will look at sub-clause (2) of clause 1

of  this  Bill, he will see that it is proposed

that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This Ordinance shall continue in operation

for  a  period  of one year from  the  date  of

commencement:"



<br><br>subject to extensions from time to time as  the

Yang   di-Pertuan  Negara  may  think  fit   by

notification in the Gazette. Clearly this  Bill

is designed to meet an emergency situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for

Farrer  Park  has also failed to  look  at  the

penal provisions of this Bill. He will see that

the punishment for theft of a motor vehicle has

been increased from three years to seven years,

and also that a minimum penalty is prescribed-a

penalty  of not less than one year in the  case

of  the  theft  of  motor vehicles,  a  minimum

penalty of not less than six months in the case

of  dishonest retention of a motor vehicle, and

a minimum penalty of not less than three months

in the case of the theft of a bicycle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think this is not the

first  time  that the Government has  found  it

necessary  to  have  such  powers.   You   will

remember that not so long ago, the Minister for

National  Development came to  this  House  and

asked for special powers to deal with the  case

of   attap  houses  which  had  been  appearing

everywhere  in our City. I am told  that  there

were  venturesome people who even attempted  to

build  homes on the public roads of  Singapore,

and  something  had to be done  to  stop  that.

Previous  Governments had tried  to  deal  with

that situation-nothing happened. They continued

to  build these homes. The moment we sought and

obtained  those  powers in this  Assembly,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  that situation  has  completely

stopped. It is because we have got the, powers

to  deal  with that situation. If we allow  the

situation to drift, then one day the Member for

Farrer  Park will come here and say, "Does  the

Government  not  know that the  situations  get

ting from bad to worse? What is the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



Government doing about it? I have also  lost  my

motorcar!  What is the Government  going  to  do

about it?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure the Member for

Farrer  Park that when this Bill is  passed,  he

will have the security of his motor vehicle  for

so  long  as  this Bill appears in  the  Statute

Book.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I have only a bicycle!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ong Pang Boon, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the most

important provision in this Bill, apart from the

enhanced penalty, is the imposition of a minimum

sentence  on the thieves concerned. It  is  only

too  common that when the Police arrest a person

who  has committed the theft of a motorcar or  a

bicycle, he is always allowed bail and  after  a

lapse of several months, he is only fined $25 or

$50  in  the end. That, I am sure, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  will not have any deterrent effect on  the

person who has committed such an offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, criminals could depend on pin-

tables and juke-boxes for their income, but with

the  closure of this form of activity, more  and

more  of  them have resorted to thefts of  motor

vehicles  or bicycles, and it is necessary  that

enhanced  punishment  be  introduced  and   also

provision for a minimum sentence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Ong Pang Boon].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br>2.48 p.m.

<div align="center"><b>SECOND-HAND DEALERS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House is already aware of the steps which

the  Government proposes to take to enhance  the

penalties  for  theft  of  motor  vehicles   and

bicycles  and  the  spare  parts  thereof.  Such

stolen   property  is  known  to  be  frequently

disposed  of by sale to second-hand dealers  who

may  or may not be aware that the property  they

buy has been unlawfully acquired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Second-Hand Dealers Ordinance already

makes  provision  in section 10 for  second-hand

dealers to record full particulars of all  goods

bought  by  them,  including  the  date  of  the

purchase  and, the  name  and  address  of  the

vendor,  and  all goods sold by  them.  Provided

that such particulars are properly recorded, the

task  of  the Police in tracing the disposal  of

stolen  property and the identity of the  person

disposing it is considerably eased. If, however,

there  is laxity or deliberate falsification  in

completing   these  records,  the   Police   are

severely handicapped in their task.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Bill is designed to enhance the

penalties  for  failing  to  comply   with   the

provisions  of  section 10  of  the  Second-Hand

Dealers  Ordinance in respect of motor vehicles,

motor vehicle parts, bicycles and bicycle parts.

The  present  penalties amount  to  a  fine  not

exceeding $100 for the first offence, and  to  a

fine  not exceeding $500 or to imprisonment  not

exceeding  three  months for a  second  and  any

subsequent offence. The new penalties introduced

by the present Bill provide for imprisonment for

a  term  not exceeding three years and not  less

than six months, together with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



liability to a fine whether it be for the first,

the second or any subsequent offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would stress that those second-hand dealers

who  conduct their business legally and  who  do

not  seek  to trade knowingly in stolen property

need have nothing to fear from the provisions of

this  Bill.  The  Police will, however,  proceed

with  the utmost vigour against any such persons

who  are found to be knowingly assisting thieves

by  disposing of the proceeds of their  criminal

activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is being taken also to increase

the  sentence  of  imprisonment  which  may   be

imposed for a second offence under section 10 in

respect  of  stolen property  other  than  motor

vehicles,  bicycles and spare parts thereof.  In

this  case, the maximum sentence of imprisonment

is  to  be  increased from three months  to  six

months,  which  is considered  a  more  adequate

deterrent to any person who shows signs of being

a habitual receiver of such property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<div align="center"><b>PRINTING PRESSES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the  Bill be now read a Second time." I have the

recommendation  of His Excellency  the  Yang  di

Pertuan  Negara  to  proceed with  the  Printing

Presses (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Printing Presses Ordinance, Chapter 226 of

the Revised Laws of Singapore, as it now stands,

provides for the regulation of printing  presses

and   of   the   printing  and  publication   of

newspapers   in   Singapore.   The   Undesirable

Publications  Ordinance, Chapter  124,  provides

for the examination and, if necessary, detention

or   prohibition   of   importation,   sale   or

circulation of publications published abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now before this House seeks, to

regulate   the  distribution  in  Singapore   of

newspapers printed in the Federation, of Malaya,

without invoking the machinery of detention  and

prohibition  used  to  prevent  the   sale   and

circulation   in   this  State  of   undesirable

publications  imported into Malaya from  abroad.

The Bill duplicates almost exactly the statutory

provisions  by  which  the  Government  of   the

Federation  of  Malaya regulates  the  sale  and

circulation  in  the  Federation  of  newspapers

printed  in  Singapore. When this  Bill  becomes

law,  therefore, the Government  will  have  the

means to control the printing and publication of

newspapers   in   Singapore,   the   sale    and

circulation  in Singapore of newspapers  printed

in the Federation, and the importation, sale and

circulation of all publications from abroad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill now before the House would

require  the  proprietor of  any  newspaper,  as

defined in the Printing Presses Ordinance, which

is  printed, in the Federation  of  Malaya  but

which  he wishes to distribute in Singapore,  to

obtain  annually  from  the  Ministry  of   Home

Affairs a permit before he may lawfully  do  so.

It  also  requires  that  every  such  newspaper

granted a permit should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



bear the names and addresses of the printer  and

publisher  and  an address within Singapore  for

the  service of any notice or legal process. The

provisions in the main Ordinance with regard  to

the  making of declarations before the Registrar

of the Supreme Court by printers, publishers and

proprietors of newspapers with regard  to  their

names and addresses and any changes thereof  are

also made applicable in respect of the grant  of

permits under this amending Bill. There is  also

provision  for  appeal to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara against the decision of the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill now makes it an offence to publish,

sell   or  circulate  in  Singapore,  newspapers

printed  in  the Federation of Malaya,  but  not

permitted to circulate in Singapore, and also to

possess  for  the purpose of their  publication,

sale  or  circulation copies of  any  newspaper,

printed either in Singapore or in the Federation

of  Malaya,  but  not  permitted  either  to  be

printed  and  published or to be distributed  in

Singapore.  In the Committee stage, I  shall  be

moving an amendment to the new section 7B (1) in

clause 3 of the Bill to make it an offence  also

to  publish, sell or circulate any paper printed

in  Singapore  but without a permit  under  this

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also taken to confer on the

Police, Customs and Postal authorities powers of

search  for  and detention of illegal newspapers

which  they have reason to believe are contained

in packages, articles or premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as can be seen, the main purpose of this

Bill  is  to  place  Federation  newspapers   in

exactly   the   same  position   as   newspapers

published  in Singapore. I am sure  nobody  will

quarrel  with that intention. The Bill does  not

threaten  the freedom of the Press,  which  this

Government  as  a  democratic  Government   will

respect and maintain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In page 3, lines 22 and 23, to leave out

"contrary to the provisions of subsection (1) of

section   7A"   and   insert   "the   printing,.

publication, sale or distribution  of  which  is

unlawful under any of the provisions".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained earlier, Mr Speaker, the

purpose  of  this amendment is  to  make  it  an

offence  also to publish, sell or circulate  any

paper  printed in Singapore but without a permit

under this Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan):</b>

<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I would like to know from the Minister whether

the newspaper -  which can be referred to as a

magazine - by the name of Malaya Merdeka, which is

the organ of U.M.N.O., printed in Malaya but is

on sale in Singapore, comes under the provisions

of clause 3 (1).



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is the Member referring to the

new section 7B (1)?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi:</b> I am referring to the new

section 7A on pages 1 and 2 of the Bill, "Permit

required for sale and distribution in Singapore

of newspapers printed or published in Malaya."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member is too previous.

He will have to wait until I propose the

Question on the clause. We

are now on an amendment in page 3, lines 22 and 23.

We will first deal with all the amendments, and

after they have all been disposed of, I will

propose the Question on the clause and then the

Member could raise his point.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

insert "this".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a drafting amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment agreed to.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would like to draw the attention

of the Minister to page 4, line 14. Ought not

"Custom Officer" to read "Customs Officer"?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is a typographical error. That

will be corrected. "Custom Officer" will now read

"Customs Officer".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 3, as amended,

stand part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

concerning the new section 7A, I would like to have

clarification from the Minister on the matter of

newspapers printed in the Federation of Malaya.

Does the U.M.N.O. organ printed in the Federation

come within the scope of the definition of

"newspaper"? Or will it be affected by this Bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer

is `Yes'. Even the official organ of the P.A.P.

"Petir" has to apply for a permit under this Bill

and when "Petir" goes across the Causeway into the

Federation, it has to get a permit from the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>3.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Societies Ordinance is an ancient and

venerable  piece  of  legislation,  but  like  many

ancient  and  venerable things, after 50  years  of

life,  it  has  become outdated and it  has  become

necessary  to eliminate its weaknesses  which  have

been  found  in  the  light of experience,  and  to

strengthen  the Ordinance to deal with  undesirable

and  shady  societies, especially those  which  are

used  as  haunts for secret society  gangsters,  or

gambling  clubs,  often  under  the  protection  of

secret  societies, or clubs run for other forms  of

vice  or  formed for the purpose of  subverting  or

swindling  the public. The House is  aware  of  the

action  taken  by my Ministry to dissolve  quite  a

number  of  societies  which were  being  used  for

unlawful  gaming purposes and contrary to the  aims

and  objects  of the societies. It is obvious  that

the  Societies Ordinance must be revised  and  made

more  effective as a weapon against the  corrupting

influence  of  social vice and  against  activities

which  are detrimental to the growth of a  new  and

healthy  society.  The opportunity  has  also  been

taken  in the Bill to tidy up a number of anomalies

in  the  old Ordinance, which would make it neater,

more  effective and more consistent in the  working

of  a  number of its provisions. There  is  nothing

suspicious or sinister in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill redefines "society", and the

principal effect of this change of definition is to

require Freemason Lodges and political associations

to  register, since there are no good  grounds  for

excluding   them  from  the  general   requirements

imposed  on  societies. Leaving the Masonic  Lodges

outside  the provisions of this Ordinance would  be

an  anomaly. The Government has no ulterior  motive

in  requiring  political associations to  register,

since  the  Government already  has  the  power  to

require  a  political association  to  register  by

declining  to advise the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  to

declare  it to be a political association. In  this

respect,  it  is  of  interest  to  note  that  the

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



Branch  of the Malayan Chinese Association,  the

Partai Rakyat, the Pan Malayan Islamic Party and

the  Katong  Residents' Association are  already

registered societies, whilst the Party I  belong

to, the People's Action Party, has been exempted

from  registration since its foundation. On  the

other  hand,  the  Singapore Labour  Front,  the

U.M.N.O.,   the  Liberal-Socialist  Party,   the

Malayan Indian Congress, the Workers' Party, the

Citizens'  Party,  the  Malay  Union,  and   the

Singapore  People's Alliance have been  declared

to   be  political  associations.  By  requiring

political parties to register, the Government is

only aiming at uniformity, and is doing what  is

already in force in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clause also removes the distinction,

unnecessary  in  the  view  of  the  Government,

between  "registered"  and "exempted"  societies

and  all  will now have to be registered.  There

is,  in  fact, very little practical  difference

between  registered and exempted societies.  The

Registrar  already  has  the  power  under   the

Ordinance  to  order  any  exempted  society  to

furnish him with such information as he sees fit

to require.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been the practice for the Registrar to

decline  to  register a society  if  he  is  not

satisfied  that  the  society's  rules   provide

properly  for  the running and  control  of  the

society.  Clause  3 of the Bill makes  statutory

provision  for this practice and also  makes  it

the  positive  duty of the Registrar  to  refuse

registration to a society which appears  to  him

to  be  likely to be used for unlawful purposes,

such  as  gaming or for any purposes prejudicial

to  or  incompatible with the peace, welfare  or

good order in Singapore, or that the application

for   registration  does  not  comply  with  the

provisions  of  the Ordinance,  or  that  it  is

contrary to the national or public interest that

it  should be registered. Refusal to register on

grounds   of   unlawful   purposes   or    those

prejudicial to peace, welfare and good order  is

already  provided for in the Ordinance.  Refusal

on  grounds of being contrary to the national or

public interest covers cases in which, although

there are good grounds



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



for refusal, it might  be undesirable (for instance, to protect sources of information) to have to show that the society in

question  is likely to be used specifically  for

unlawful purposes or for purposes prejudicial to

the  peace, welfare and good order in Singapore.

Then  again  in the process of nation  building,

the development of a Malayan consciousness and a

Malayan  culture,  the  formation  of  societies

which  cater  for purely sectional interests  or

which  have  a  narrow communal  bias  would  be

discouraged  as being contrary to  the  national

interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Committee stage, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

will  be  moving an amendment of  which  I  have

given  notice,  to  allow  for  appeal  to   the

Minister against the Registrar's decision.  Sir,

as  you  know, in most Ordinances where licences

or  permits are issued by the licensing  officer

or   licensing   authority,  there   is   always

provision  for  appeal to the  Minister  by  any

person  aggrieved by a decision of the licensing

authority.  However, due to an  oversight,  when

section  4 of the present Ordinance was  deleted

and redrafted in clause 3, the present provision

for  appeal was inadvertently left out. This  is

the only reason for its omission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 is a transitional provision to allow

existing    societies    now    exempted    from

registration a year's time in which to apply for

registration,  and such societies  will  not  be

deemed  to  be  unlawful  societies  until  such

period has elapsed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill makes it unlawful for

societies organised outside Malaya to  carry  on

activities in Singapore unless registered  under

the  Societies Ordinance. This same  clause  and

clause  11  make  unlawful  any  society   which

changes its address without permission or  which

has one or more of the same office-bearers, or a

similar   name  or  membership,  as  a   society

previously dissolved. These provisions are aimed

primarily  at fly-by-night gambling clubs,  many

of  which  have  been known from  experience  to

adopt  these tactics either to evade dissolution

or   nullify  the  effects  of  dissolution   as

unlawful societies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6, 7, 8 and 10 enhance the maximum

penalties  for offences connected with  unlawful

societies,  and clause 9 provides that  evidence

of repute shall be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



admissible to prove the existence of  a  society

or  that a person is a member of a society.  The

increased  penalties  should  act  as   a   more

effective   deterrent  to   would-be   offenders

against  the  provisions of this Ordinance,  and

the  admissibility of evidence of  repute  would

help   in   proving  the  existence  of  illegal

societies. The organisers of such societies  are

usually secretive about their activities and  it

is therefore difficult to obtain direct evidence

of the existence of such societies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in Singapore, secret societies have

deteriorated  from the old Triad societies  into

mercenary  gangs  of criminal hoodlums  and  the

Societies Ordinance has not been of much help to

the  Police  and the Criminal Courts in  dealing

with  them. The only provision in the  Ordinance

which  materially assists the Police and  Courts

to  deal with the criminal members of the secret

societies  is that which permits the  Registrar,

in certain circumstances, to order a man to have

his  fingerprints  recorded and  his  photograph

taken. And the wording of this part of the Bill,

having  been drafted to assist the Registrar  to

obtain  information  about the  Triad  societies

rather than to provide for the identification of

members of an organised criminal underworld,  is

unsatisfactory  for  Singapore's  present  need.

What  is  now needed is that the Police and  the

Courts  should be assisted in criminal cases  by

the  availability, as evidence that  an  accused

person  is  a member of an unlawful society,  of

the   opinion   of   an  independent   authority

inquiring    specially   into   the   existence,

membership  or  operations of secret  societies.

Clause  12  of  the Bill now before  the  House

therefore amends section 22 (4) of the Societies

Ordinance  to  make  it clear  that  any  person

ordered  to have his fingerprints and photograph

taken  by the Registrar of Societies is, in  his

opinion,  either  a  member  of,  or  intimately

connected with, an unlawful society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these then are the aims and objects of

this  Bill. As can be seen, it is not  aimed  at

any  legitimate,  respectable  or  lawful  body,

party  or  association, but against  undesirable

and  shady  societies and as  such  will,  I  am

confident, receive the support of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as the Minister

has  said, this Ordinance is hoary with age  and

it  is  time  certain  of  its  provisions  were

brought  out into the open and aired; but  while

doing it, one has also to consider the effect of

the  amendments  upon the  social  life  of  the

people of Singapore as they have been accustomed

to live it over the last 100 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure of the Societies Ordinance is

this. Firstly, it defines any association of ten

or  more  persons to be a society, and  then  it

goes   on   specifically   to   exempt   certain

categories  of  persons or  companies  from  the

operation  of  the Ordinance. And then  it  says

that such other societies as are not registrable

under  the provisions of the Ordinance shall  be

divided  into two categories, namely, registered

societies  and exempted societies. So that  then

we   have   three  categories:  one,  the   non-

registrable   society;   two,   the   registered

society; and, three, the exempted society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the non-registrable societies,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the majority of  persons  or

companies   exempted  are  either   persons   or

companies  who  are  already  registered   under

existing Ordinances; the two sub-sections  which

do  not come within that category of persons  or

companies   are  Freemasons  and  the  political

associations.  In respect of the Freemasons  and

the  political associations, this Bill seeks  to

make them come within its scope.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to exempted societies, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, it is also proposed to make  them

all registered societies and to give them a year

within which to register.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are a number of

societies particularly interested in sport,  and

most  of  them are exempted under the provisions

of  the  Societies Ordinance. The proposal  that

all  societies should be registered  and  should

have  a registered address and can only meet  at

their registered address would have very serious

repercussions  on  the  sport  of  the  country,

because  most of the societies would then  cease

to exist and all those who are now interested in

hockey  and football particularly will  find  it

very



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



difficult to carry on their sporting activities.

It is important that this should be encouraged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter, Mr Speaker, Sir, is that

new  provisions  with regard  to  registrability

have  been introduced into the Bill, mainly  the

point  whether it is in the national  or  public

interest.  I do not wish to speak very  much  on

this  Bill  at  this  stage, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

because I have given notice that I will  move  a

number  of amendments. My own view is that  this

Bill  is  sufficiently important, and will  have

sufficient repercussions on the society such  as

we are accustomed to in Singapore, that it needs

very  careful and serious consideration. At  the

appropriate time, it is hoped that a motion will

be made to refer this Bill to a Select Committee

and  that the Minister will find it possible  to

accede to that request.



<br><br>3.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> I wish

to  assure  Members of this House  that  careful

consideration  has been given to the  provisions

contained in the proposed amending Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first preface my

remarks  by drawing attention to this  one  very

important fact? That it is one thing to put  the

law  in  order,  but  it  is  another  thing  to

implement  and  administer its provisions  in  a

workmanlike and practical manner. There  is  one

cogent  point which the Member for  Farrer  Park

has  brought  out, namely, the difficulty  which

the  sporting  and athletic clubs will  find  in

executing   their  business  at  the  registered

address.  But  I  think he  overlooks  this  one

important  provision: that illegality  does  not

flow  simply  from the departure of  the  strict

wording  of  the Ordinance. Illegality  and  the

punishment of illegality by the State only comes

about  in  cases where the State  and,  in  this

case,  the  State Advocate-General,  who  is  an

independent   officer   in   respect   of    all

prosecutions,  is satisfied that there  was,  in

fact, a criminal act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, at present, 1,007 exempted

societies of which the People's Action Party  is

one. I would like briefly to categorise them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>

<pre>

   Racial and communal societies                11%



   Religious societies - churches,

     temples,  mosques, societies

     of Christians, Buddhists,

     Muslims		...	...	...	10%



   Cultural  societies - old boys'

     associations, alumni associations,

     literary  societies, art and dance

     clubs, music  and  dramatic

     societies, education societies	...	14%



   Trade associations	...	...	...     14%



   Sports and athletic clubs	...	...     31%



   Social clubs	...	...	...	...      9%



   Welfare associations - benevolent

     societies, tenant and dwellers'

     associations               	...      7%



   Youth organisations, including boys'

     and girls' clubs and youth clubs	...      2%



   Miscellaneous	...	...	...	 2%

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, in that diverse miscellany of

associations, certain groups in which  we  would

have no governmental interest whatsoever. But  I

think  the Members opposite, particularly  those

who  were  responsible for the last  Government,

would appreciate that cultural associations  and

sometimes  even  sporting associations  are  not

often  what they profess to be. It is one  thing

to  say  that one has formed an association  for

the  advancement of the playing of the flute  or

the banging of the brass gong; but it is another

thing  to want to boost members to rehearse  and

practise  these  arts. It is invidious  for  the

Registrar of Societies to have to pick  out  any

particular association for special scrutiny, and

to  require  that  association to  furnish  more

detailed  particulars to ensure that,  in  fact,

the   association  is  observing  the  aims  and

objects  with  which it has been formed  and  is

complying with the rules and regulations of  its

constitution.  If  we  are  to  go  through  the

rigmarole of scrutinising all the 1,007 exempted

societies,  and if we are to do it as thoroughly

as  it  is  required under the law  and  can  be

enforced  by  the  law, then  very  shortly  the

Minister for Home Affairs will have to ask for a

supplementary  vote  in order  to  increase  the

number  of  clerks - receiving clerks  and  filing

clerks - votes for cabinets, card index system and

so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



on.  But  if  we approach this in  a  relatively

practical  way  and  put them  all  through  the

ordinary  mill, then only those  which  we  have

reasons  to believe are not complying  with  the

lawful  objects with which they have been formed

are  more  easily  brought  under  scrutiny  and

brought to book.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has listed three

categories - those registrable under various other

Ordinances  like the Companies Ordinance;  those

that  will be registered or exempted; and  those

not   registrable  at  all.  As  for  the  first

category,   I  would  like  to  anticipate   the

Minister for Labour and Law in saying that he is

preparing  legislation to bring  the  benevolent

associations,  which form a very fruitful  field

for  all  kinds  of minor social swindles - mutual

aid associations, medical aid associations - under

Government control. They will shortly come under

very  special  legislation which will  stop  the

racketeering   that   takes   place   in   them.

Therefore,  quite a number of societies  now  on

the  exempted list will be moved into that  list

where special registration is required.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have explained the distinction between

exempted  and registered societies, and  why  we

have   felt   that,  in  view  of  the   changed

circumstances  in  which we have  to  deal  with

them, it is more practical to deal with them all

on  one basis, as registered societies. There is

left  only  this  very small and selected  group

called Freemasons and political societies  which

are   completely  outside  the  orbit   of   the

Societies  Ordinance. We  know  of  no  coherent

reason  why  the  Freemasons  should  have  been

singled  out for special treatment,  other  than

the  fact  that perhaps those who legislated  in

those  days belonged to the Freemasons. We  also

see no reason why political societies should  be

discriminated  by having them classified - as  the

Minister for Home Affairs has just indicated  to

the  House - into  three groups: those  registered

like   the  Katong  Rural  Dwellers  Association

(surely,  the Registrar considers  them  a  very dangerous  group  of  people),  those  that  are

exempted,  like  the  P.A.P. against  whom  the

Registrar  could from time to time  elicit  more

information, and those taken out of the pale  of

the Registrar, like the S.P.A.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, unless the Member for Farrer

Park can make out a compelling case and bring to

our   attention  considerations  which  we   had

overlooked in the preparation of this Bill,  we:

intend   to  go  through  with  it  today.   If,

subsequently,  in  administering  it  there  are

found  to  be  lacunae in the law, then  we  are

quite prepared to reopen for consideration those

provisions   which  have  been   found   to   be

inadequate.  But let us not forget this.  First,

we  have to put the law into coherent and proper

form.  Then  we  have  to remove  discriminatory

practices under the law. But above all, it is in

the  administration  of that  law  that  finally

decides whether we will have a free and flexible

society where freedom of association is  one  of

the hallmarks of a free and tolerant society, or

whether   we   will   have  a  dictatorial   and

intolerant system. I think Members in this House

will  agree with me that in the present  context

of  events  there  is  a  need  to  ensure  that

associations   are  formed   only   for   lawful

purposes,  or  if  they are not  beneficial,  at

least  ensure  that they are not detrimental  to

the  State. The ingenuity of man being  what  it

is, it is not unknown for societies to have been

formed  with  the most laudable  of  objectives,

whilst,   in  practice,  they  are  blinds   for

disreputable and sometimes positively  dangerous

conspiracies. I would like to add  that  Members

opposite  are  in no danger of being  classified

under  the  category of persons taking  part  in

dangerous  conspiracies,  because  we   do   not

attribute them with sufficient capacity to carry

out  their  evil intent. But I can  assure  them

that  before they are classified in the category

of  being  detrimental to  the  welfare  of  the

State,   there  will  have  to  be   much   more

buffoonery and stupidities than what  they  have

enacted  in the last seven months. In  fact,  if

from time to time they disintegrate - they started

with  five members, now they have got four - there

is no need for special legislation to look after

them.  We leave them alone and, by processes  of

nature, they disintegrate by themselves.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



Societies (Amendment) Bill. We also welcome  the

statement  that  the  Bill is  aimed  at  secret

societies, gangsters and gambling groups  trying

to   take   protection  under  innocent  looking

societies.  Unfortunately, Sir,  this  Bill  has

aroused  a  great  deal of  public  comment  and

apprehension. In some political quarters, not in

this  House,  there  have  been  expressions  of

opinion  to  the  effect that a Bill  like  this

would  lead to the killing of democracy and  the

extermination  of  a political Opposition.  Sir,

the Hon. Prime Minister did imply, however, that

the   moment   the  Opposition   should   become

dangerous,  then he would reconsider  the  whole

position. I hope that is only a joke. We believe

however,  Sir, that in a democracy, the pendulum

must  be  allowed to swing now one way, now  the

other. The pendulum must never be static and the

pendulum  can only be static if we have  a  one-party Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It will probably stop.



<br><br><!-- Mr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Because of that, Sir, and

because  the powers given by this amending  Bill

are  so  vast there may come a situation  where,

regardless  of  the  honest  intentions  stated,

those  powers  can  be wrongly used.  Therefore,

because  of that, there is this apprehension  in

the  public  mind.  For  that  reason,  Sir,  we

believe  that  this Bill is even more  important

and  more  controversial  than  the  Pawnbrokers

(Amendment)   Bill.  To  reassure  the   public,

therefore,  this  Bill should  go  to  a  Select

Committee.  Of course, Sir, the Government  side

has  the power to bulldoze it through today. But

we  hope,  as  in  the case of  the  Pawnbrokers

(Amendment) Bill and the Muslims (Amendment)

Bill, that they will agree to refer this Bill to

a Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding the abolition of exempted

societies, the plea is made that this is done to

tidy up things and to avoid discrimination. Sir,

you will remember that in the case of levying of

income  tax,  there  are  different  categories,

because   it  is  practical  to  have  different

categories.  We have those persons  who  pay  no

income  tax at all. We have those who pay  lower

rates  and those who pay higher rates.  Then  we

have those who are ex-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



empted from payment of income tax. So we see  no

reason  why  there should not be this  different

classification of societies for the  sake  of  a

more practical administration. For instance,  if

we  say  that, in the interests of equality  and

non-discrimination,  visitors  in  the   gallery

should  all sit here or they should all come  in

by the same entrance, it might be more difficult

for  the  attendants  to  distinguish  one  from

another.  But  we  allow  these  things  to   be

different because, from practical experience, we

find that they are expedient and useful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under some of the amendments, it will be

very  difficult and discouraging for people with

good  intentions to want to organise  societies.

Some  of  them  will  get frightened.  Supposing

before the societies are registered, it is known

that  these people have made a statement in  the

Press  that  they are forming a  society,  could

they  not be regarded under this Bill as  having

conducted  themselves illegally and be  regarded

as  members  of  an unlawful society?  Supposing

pioneers  in education were to come to Singapore

intending to start a school, and that project is

publicised,  if  their headquarters  were  in  a

foreign country, then under this Bill they would

be  regarded as members of an unlawful  society.

If  this were so, then the cause of education in

Singapore would have been held back by decades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the early pioneers of the different

churches  first came here to explore the  ground

to  see  if they could get support. It was  only

when  they had got support that they established

their  schools and their missions  here.  Now  I

hope   the   Home  Minister  will  clarify   the

situation   so   that  it   will   not   prevent

philanthropic and charitable people  from  being

able  to  come  here  from abroad  to  establish

charitable and educational institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, under the provisions here, if by

mistake  or through some oversight, the honorary

secretary  of  a society forgets to  inform  the

Registrar   that  the  society  has  moved   its

premises,  there will be trouble,  because  that

society  will then be an unlawful society.  When

it  comes to political societies, Sir, naturally

there is the fear that the moment the Opposition

threatens to disturb the balance of power, as it

were, then, for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



political  reasons,  the Government  may  decide

that a certain political party should not be  in

existence. We do not believe, however, that they

will  do  it  to those of us who are  here.  But

there are those outside who feel that that might

be  done  to  them. The public  therefore,  Sir,

being fair minded, have expressed their fear. So

if  there  is  a Select Committee  appointed  to

consider  this Bill, then it could  receive  the

views  of  those who have such fears and  ensure

that there will be safeguards in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, it could also be interpreted that

some  of  the  provisions of this Bill  will  go

against  certain Articles in the United  Nations

Universal Declaration of Human Rights.



Article 13 says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone has the right to freedom of movement

and residence within the borders of each state."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions here, the Registrar has

the  right not to allow a society to change  its

address.



<br><br>Article 18 says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone has the right to freedom of thought,

conscience  and  religion.  The  right  includes

freedom  to  change his religion of  belief  and

freedom either alone or in community with others

and   in  public  or  private  to  manifest  his

religion   or  belief  in  teaching,   practice,

worship and observance."



<br><br>And Article 20 reads:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful

assembly and association."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as people are not disloyal to this

country  or  engaged  in  criminal  pursuits,  I

believe  they should be encouraged  to  organise

themselves into societies that would benefit the

Singapore  community. But too many  restrictions

and   the   threat  of  severe  penalties   will

discourage   good   citizens   from   organising

themselves. I do suggest, therefore,  Sir,  that

in  addition to saying that they do not have any

sinister  or  evil intentions, but to  show  the

people  that  they do not have such  intentions,

the  Government  consider it  right  to  have  a

Select Committee appointed to consider the Bill.



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I would like to say that, on the whole, I am not

of  the  opinion that this Societies (Amendment)

Bill  is not of benefit to the people. But,  Mr

Speaker, as has been suggested by other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>



Members of the Opposition when recommending that

this   Bill  should  be  referred  to  a  Select

Committee for the purpose of receiving  opinions

and view-points, I know what the public feel.  I

myself  do not like societies which are communal

in  outlook, as in fact they are more  dangerous

than those which have a provincial outlook.  Mr

Speaker,  there may be associations or political

parties which have already been registered, as I

have  heard  just  now, based on  religion;  and

there  may  be  organisations  which  have  been

registered, organisations which, in my  opinion,

are  provincial  in outlook and which  are  more

dangerous  than associations which are religious

in outlook. So, Mr Speaker, we can say it would

be  wise  if the suggestion already put  forward

could  be accepted by the Government, that  this

Bill be referred to a Select Committee. Although

the  final  decision rests with the  Government,

we,  on  our part, do not hesitate to  recommend

reference of the Bill to a Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been emphasised just now by the

Government,  we  know  that  although   U.M.N.O.

particularly has been exempted from registration

as  it  has  been  declared a  political  party,

nevertheless, in accordance with the new  rules,

we  must apply for registration within a  period

of  one  year. Whether U.M.N.O. will be accepted

as  a  political party or otherwise, it will  be

left  to  the  persons  concerned.  However,   I

believe  our  request will be agreed  to.  As  a

political   body,  we  have  no   intention   of

upsetting  the  peace  or the  progress  of  the

State.  We  feel  confident  that  we  can,   in

conjunction  with  the present Government,  work

towards   resolving   many   major   issues   of

administration or of the constitution, or of any

other  relevant  matters which we  may  come  up

against  in  the future. Therefore, it  is  only

wise  that opportunities must be given for views

to  be  aired, and to investigate and  ascertain

which  are really the parties appearing under  a

cloak,  so  that we should not accuse at  random

any  organisations which have been running their

activities not in accordance with the law. In  a

democratic    institution,    we    must    give

opportunities to these associations  to  put  up

their views and reports



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



to  the  Select  Committee.  If  the  Government

agrees with our viewpoints, then I trust that at

a  later  date  we will be informed  not  merely

about the abolition of secret societies but also

about   many   matters  which  I  have   already

mentioned just now - matters concerning  the  true

identities  of political parties, or  any  other

associations,  as  to whether  certain  cultural

associations are truly so, or whether  they  are

in  fact  practising  undesirable  culture  from

within.  Such political associations or  parties

we  must  abolish, in accordance  with  the  law

which  we think is fit for our society. So,  Mr

Speaker, I would like to stress that, on my part

and  as  a  representative of U.M.N.O., U.M.N.O.

has  been  declared  a political  party  by  the

People's  Government. We are  not  unwilling  to

conduct  any  activities which will  be  to  ~he

benefit, peace and good order of the State,  but

let  opportunities  be given  not  only  to  the

Opposition in this House but also to the  public

of  Singapore who would like to take part in the

democratic practice of promulgating the  law  in

the true sense of the word.



<br><br>4.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir

we  do  not object to this Bill at all. In fact,

we  are at one with the Government in wanting to

bring  all  manner of societies and associations

within  the  scope of a comprehensive  Societies

Ordinance.  The present Ordinance, as  has  been

stated by the Minister for Home Affairs,  is  an

old  piece  of legislation. It was brought  into

force,  if I remember rightly, to control mainly

Triad  societies,  but certain  exemptions  were

given  and certain classes of associations  were

taken   out   of  the  scope  of  the  Societies

Ordinance. The Prime Minister has said  that  he

does not feel that it is necessary that the Bill

should  be  referred to a Select Committee,  but

that  if  the  Opposition could  advance  cogent

reasons,  he  would be prepared to consider  and

might  agree  to  refer the  Bill  to  a  Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this proposed legislation is of so

important  a character that all points  of  view

must be considered. While I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>



did say earlier, and I say it again, that it  is

desirable  that  all kinds of  associations  and

societies   should  be  brought  under   limited

control,  so  long as the freedom of association

is  not  jeopardised, one must not overlook  the

fact  that this proposed legislation intends  to

bring  in  all  the categories  of  associations

which have so far enjoyed exemption, as well  as

those  societies  which do not  come  under  the

operation  of this Ordinance. Therefore,  it  is

inevitable  that  such  societies  should   feel

considerably concerned that their activities are

now  going to be curtailed. As a result  of  the

proposed  amendment, they are going through  the

Bill with a view to informing the Government  if

there  are certain points that require deep  and

serious consideration. There is one which  comes

to my mind on the question of political parties.

Sir,  under  clause  4, exempted  societies  are

given   one  year's  time  in  which   to   make

application for registration under this proposed

amendment.   But  in  the  case   of   political

associations  which have been  declared  by  the

Governor-in-Council  as political  associations,

no   time  has  been  given  for  them  to  make

application for registration. So with the coming

into force of, this Bill, such political parties

will  be non-existent unless they apply and  get

registered on the same day. I do not think  that

can be done so quickly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is the question of meeting

places   of   registered   societies.   As   the

Government  knows  very well, political  parties

generally  hold  meetings  not  only  in   their

registered  premises but in almost every  little

spot in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Even in bank vaults.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Does it mean that if such

meetings  are  held in places other  than  their

registered    premises,   such    a    political

association  will  become art unlawful  society?

There are various other points which I need  not

go into in detail here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was listening quite attentively to the Prime

Minister and I did agree with him when  he  said

that   it   is  important  that  all  kinds   of

associations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>



should  be brought under one control. I  was  with

him  up  to  that point, and as he  was  going  to

resume   his   seat,  I  thought  of  getting   up

straightway  and  supporting  the  Government  and

saying  that  it was a good thing  and  should  be

done.  But on second thoughts he felt that it  was

necessary to run down the Opposition - that is  most

typical of the Prime Minister - that we are a spent

force,  we are this, we are that. Sir, we are  not

worried what the Government thinks of us. We  know

what  the public thinks of us [Laughter],  and  we

also  know what the public thinks of them. We  can

travel  quite freely and go into coffee shops  and

into markets with the masses. Sir, we do not claim

that  we are the people's representatives;  we  do

not  say that we are the people's government,  and

yet we dare go among the people without bodyguards

everywhere.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, although

the  Members of the Opposition have not  presented

their  case for committing this Bill to  a  Select

Cornmittee with compelling reasons other than that

mentioned  by the Member for Cairnhill  about  the

provision  of  time  for  political  societies  to

register, however, in order to satisfy the Members

of   the  Opposition,  I  have  no  objection   to

committing this Bill to a Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> But for the information of

the  Member  for  Cairnhill, it is,  in  fact,  my

intention  during the Committee stage to  move  an

amendment to the amendment proposed by the  Member

for  Farrer Park to allow the same period of grace

for  political  societies to register  under  this

Bill. As mentioned earlier in my speech, there  is

no intention to wipe out the Opposition parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of

Members to fill two vacancies in the Committee

of Selection : -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enche Baharuddin bin Mohd. Ariff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Chang Sam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the present Committee of Selection consists of you as Chairman and five other

Members. Of these five Members, two come from  the

Opposition  Benches and the other three  from  the

Government  Benches. It is stated in the  Standing

Order  that  representation in this  Committee  of

Selection  should  be such that  there  should  be

proportionate  representation from both  sides  of

the  House. I would like to remind the House  that

the  ratio  of  Opposition Members  to  Government

Members  is  approximately 1:8. With  this  motion

that  I  am moving, the Government will  now  have

five Members, and the Opposition two Members.  So,

I  am  quite  sure the House will agree  that  the

Government is generous and is acting in compliance

with Standing Orders.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

support the motion. While it is true that  in  the

present  Committee of Selection,  there  are  only

three Members representing the Government. I  must

say here that the number was agreed to by the Hon.

the  Deputy  Prime  Minister in  our  discussions.

There   is  no  intention  on  the  part  of   the

Opposition to see that Standing Orders should  not

be  observed. In fact, even if seven persons  were

wanted on the other side, we would also accept it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore Port Rules of 1957 regulate

the movements of vessels and their crews while they

are  within  the limits of our Port. It  is  to  be

expected that in a port which is as large as  ours,

circumstances alter from time to time  and  changes

have  to  be made to introduce alterations  in  the

provisions  of our Port Rules. The last  time  when

the  Rules  were  amended was in 1958.  Since  that

occasion,  there  has  been further  necessity  for

making  amendments to the Port Rules.  All  parties

concerned  have been consulted, and  these  further

amendments  have  been embodied  in  the  Amendment

Rules which are the subject of this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally and briefly, the Amendment Rules which

the  House  is now asked to approve remove  certain

existing, restrictions which have been found to  be

unnecessary  and provide for better regulation  and

control of vessels in port.
