<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Estimates of Expenditure of

Singapore for the year 1968 contained in Paper Cmd.

26 of 1967. For the convenience of hon. Members,  I

intend   taking  the  total  for   each   head   of

expenditure as it appears in the last column of the

Abstract of Estimated Expenditure on pages  53  and

54 of the Paper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 628</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing first with the heads of expenditure in

respect of which amendments stand on the Order

Paper Supplement -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0103 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0103 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is in regard to the production of

Hansard.  I wish to know why the sum is reduced  to

$4,100, when last year's allocation was $16,000.  I

wonder  whether this drastic reduction will  affect

its  efficiency. At present, I must  say  that  the

production of Hansard is very efficient and  I  can

give an example to this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Budget sitting on 5th December, the

Finance  Minister ended his Budget Speech sometime,

I  think, at 4.30 p.m. The next morning at 9.30 the

first  copy of his speech was ready for the use  of

Members of this House. I think this is a tribute to

the   efficiency  of  the  Reporting  and   Editing

Section,  and  I  would  like  to  know  why   this

reduction   is   made,  and   also   the   possible

consequences of such a reduction. Would it not lead

to inefficiency in the production of Hansard in the

future?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  this vote does  not  refer  to  the

production  of Hansard itself but is  a  vote  from

which  remuneration is paid to part-time  staff  to

assist the Parliamentary Reporters in the overnight

production  of the first copy. From our  experience

of  the sittings last year, we found that the  vote

was  excessive, as it was not necessary,  when  the

House was not in continuous session, to have copies

produced that very same night for Members  to  have

them  the  following day. Therefore, the  vote  has

been estimated at $4,100 for the following year. It

is  not the cost of production of Hansard. This  is

for  part-time  remuneration  paid  to  people  who

assist  the  Parliamentary Reporters  in  overnight

work when the House is in continuous session.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 629</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I am quite satisfied with the

explanation of the Prime Minister, and  I  wish  to

withdraw the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0103

be reduced by $l00*.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same amendment also stood in the name of Mr Tang See Chim.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the former Member for Joo Chiat (Dr

Fong  Kim Heng), who was the Deputy Speaker of this

Parliament,  resigned, the post of  Deputy  Speaker

has  been left vacant. Under subhead 1002 there  is

still  a  vote for Deputy Speaker. I wonder whether

this House would like to elect a new Deputy Speaker

to  fill  the  vacancy.  If there  is  no  suitable

candidate to fill it, perhaps we can elect a person

from  outside this Parliament as Deputy Speaker.  I

hope the Minister concerned can give a satisfactory

reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I am not moving, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> This vote stands and has

stood  in every Budget estimate over the last eight

years, and at an appropriate time, when there is an

obvious choice for the post of Deputy Speaker,  the

choice will be made. One of the cardinal principles

upon which we must exercise the authority which  is

vested in us by popular vote, is that it should not

be  exercised just because there is a  vote  to  be

spent. Unless duties require the appointment to  be

made, and there is a person obviously qualified not

only   in  the  opinion  of  the  Members  of  this

Parliament but, even more important, in the opinion

of  the  public  outside who are  watching  us,  no

appointment will be made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last appointment to the office of Deputy

Speaker  was you, Sir, and I am quite sure that  in

the  next Parliament, which must be elected  within

three  months  after the 21st of  September,  1968,

there  will  be  enough talent  amongst  the  Back-benchers.  As  Members know, no  person  who  is  a

Minister or holds



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



any other office of profit, namely, a Parliamentary

Secretary  or  any  other  such  position,  can  be

Speaker  or  Deputy Speaker. I am quite  optimistic

that  we will be able to justify an appointment  to

this high office in the not too distant future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am satisfied

with the reply given by the Prime Minister, and I

beg leave to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $664,130 for Head 0103 ordered to stand

part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 630</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0104 -



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0104 be

reduced by $10 in respect of item (2) of subhead

2004.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, holders of scholarships and bursaries are

lucky  to  receive  these awards.  I  believe  they

include  pocket expenses and expenses for books.  I

wonder  why  there  is  a  vote  for  Entertainment

Expenses.   Can   the  Minister  concerned   please

explain?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in December

1963,  at  the  suggestion of the Chairman  of  the

Public Service Commission, I held a dinner for  132

scholars who had completed their studies abroad  on

scholarships of various kinds. The purpose was  not

just to entertain them and to congratulate them  on

having  graduated,  but more important,  to  gather

them together in a congenial atmosphere and use the

occasion to underline the role for which they  were

groomed  to play. The reason why we have taken  the

trouble  to  acquire these scholarships  -sometimes

from foreign missions and donor foundations -is  to

give  them the kind of training in order that  they

will  fulfil their duties to the community of which

they form a part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having been successful with the first function,

we held a second one -a buffet dinner -on 23rd

April, 1966,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 631</b></font><br><br>



where  we  had 370 scholars and representatives  of

foreign  missions who had given these scholarships.

The  purpose  was  to express our  appreciation  to

these  foreign mission representatives  for  having

given the scholarships to our students for training

purposes. Similarly a dinner was held on the 1st of

July  last  year. After three successful occasions,

Sir,  I  think it is time that the procedure should

be  formalised  in a vote in the  Budget  for  this

purpose.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

will this be a tradition every year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am unable to predict what

my  successors in office will do. But in so far  as

we  are  concerned, we are satisfied  that  such  a

function  does serve a purpose. It does bring  home

to  these  scholars in a psychologically meaningful

way  the  fact  that  they  owe  something  to  the

community that has gone out of its way to  organise

itself   to  train  them,  educate  them  and   get

scholarships  for  them, and therefore  it  expects

them  to give something back to the community.  The

$3,000  in  the vote is hardly more than the  first

month's  salary of probably four or five  of  these

students.  I think it is worth the effort  that  is

put in. It is not so much the money; but it takes a

lot of effort. And Ministers and others who have to

attend these functions so frequently consider  this

a duty and not a pleasure.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0104 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2005.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much importance has been stressed on

industrial development not only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 632</b></font><br><br>



to  promote industrial growth but also to  maintain

the survival of our economy. I note that the sum of

$21,600  will  be  allocated  for  the  "Industrial

Development  Scholarships  Scheme"  next  year   as

against  $49,200  this  year.  Perhaps  the   Prime

Minister would care to elaborate on this. Sir, such

scholarships  will definitely help  the  industrial

development   of  our  young  Republic.   In   this

connection,  I  shall  be  grateful  if  the  Prime

Minister will state the number of scholarships that

will be available as against the number this year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, the reason for the

estimate being reduced to about 40 per cent of what

it   was  the  previous  year  is  that  from   our

experience last year we discovered, partly  through

the   resourcefulness   of   the   Public   Service

Commission, that quite a number of donor  countries

were  able  to  provide  us  with  facilities   for

industrial  training. For instance, last  year  the

Belgian Government gave 20 industrial scholarships,

and  similar awards were made available in  France,

the  United  States,  Japan,  Germany,  the  United

Kingdom and several other countries. This being so,

the  amount  required to be paid out of the  Budget

itself  is reduced by the amount which was extended

in scholarship aid. So we are not unoptimistic that

next  year  these  donor countries,  with  whom  we

maintain amicable and, we hope, mutually beneficial

relationships,  will find it in their  interest  as

well  as  ours  to  continue  to  offer  industrial

training facilities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the

Prime Minister for his reply and, on that note, may

I beg leave to withdraw my amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0104 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2009*.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The  same amendment also stood in the  name  of Mr Yeah Ghim Seng.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can well remember that the subject of the

President's   scholarships   was   raised   by   my

colleague, the hon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 633</b></font><br><br>



Member for Aljunied, in this Chamber on the 15th of

this  month  last year. The Prime Minister  in  his

reply  stated  that the recipients  -I  quote  from

Hansard, Volume 25, No. 10, column 694:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...are people who have won signal distinction for

themselves to merit special privileges for  further

education.'



The  Prime Minister further stressed, in  the  same

column, Sir, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...it is hoped to continue a supply of men not

only  well  qualified and competent  in  their  own

fields  of study but with all the social and  other

graces   which  make  for  the  difficult-to-define

quality called leadership.'



Sir,  I can imagine the fierce and keen competition

by  our  brilliant  students to  win  such  a  high

honour.  In this respect, Sir, I shall be  grateful

if  the  Prime Minister will explain the  reduction

made  in the vote next year, that is, from $143,000

this  year  to  $110,000 next year. Also,  will  he

inform  this  House of the number of recipients  of

the  President's  scholarships this  year  and  the

likely number next year?



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Joo Chiat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we   pride  ourselves  in  this  country   on   our

President's scholars, as they represent  the  cream

of  our  schools  and  thus of  our  youths.  These

scholars are sent abroad as junior ambassadors  and

are  therefore sent with a lot of fanfare and  with

the  country's blessings. For the past  few  years,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, the number of  school  children

enrolling    in   schools   must   have   increased

tremendously and, therefore, I would have  expected

a  wider  selection of first-class pupils  for  the

coveted  and  signal  honour of  being  President's

scholars.  At  least, Sir, one would have  expected

the  number of such scholarships to remain the same

annually. Yet I see that the 1968 vote has been cut

from the 1967 vote of $143,000 to $110,000. Surely,

the Public Service Commission or the Prime Minister

cannot   tell  this  House  that  our  pupils   are

deteriorating in their mental capacity. If not, why

has   there  been  such  a  drastic  cut   in   the

President's Scholarships vote? Surely such a cut is

not very encouraging to our students



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 634</b></font><br><br>



in the schools because they have been trying

their  best  to  gain  the  honour  of  being   the

President's scholars. So, Mr Speaker, Sir, I  hope

the  Prime  Minister will reconsider the  estimated

amount   for  the  vote  so  that  the  number   of

President's scholars for 1968 will remain at  least

the same as for 1967.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

assure  both  the  Members  who  have  raised  this

problem  that,  far  from the number  of  potential

talented young men and women reducing in numbers as

the  years  go  by,  they have, in  fact,  shown  a

capacity   not   only   to  win   the   President's

scholarships,  but  also  to  take  a   few   other

scholarships  by  the  way;  and  the   President's

scholar  is often a person who holds at  least  one

other  scholarship. The President's scholarship  is

given  on  the basis of merit, not on the basis  of

need, and inevitably the boy who wins it also  gets

some other scholarship. When he does that, then, if

he  is studying abroad, whether it is in the United

Kingdom, Australia or Canada, he does not  get  the

full  scholarship but he gets an allowance of œ250,

because  otherwise we will ruin him by  giving  him

too much money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also told Members of the House that last

year  there were seven President's scholars;  three

of  them  decided  to study in  the  University  of

Singapore, one at the Polytechnic, one in  Britain,

one  in  Australia, and one in Canada. They  had  a

free choice of where to go for higher studies. Four

out  of  seven chose to study here. That  has  also

saved us the cost of the passages going overseas. I

am  quite  sure that next year, as in the  case  of

this year, these scholars will also be able to  win

other awards whilst being the President's scholars.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one last

question.   According  to  the  Hansard   of   15th

December,  1966, there were nine winners for  these

scholarships  last year, but this  year  there  are

only seven. I wonder why.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I am afraid I must assume

that the Public Service Commission puts a very high

standard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 635</b></font><br><br>



for  the  attainment of the status of a President's

scholar, and if there are not more than seven  such

scholars,  then  not  more than  seven  President's

scholarships are awarded. It is a very  proper  way

of  maintaining standards. It does  not  mean  that

just  because you have in the Budget Estimates  ten

posts  for  Political  Secretaries,  therefore,  we

appoint  ten Political Secretaries. We do  not,  as

Members well know. We appoint Political Secretaries

as  and  when they are found necessary and  as  and

when there are suitable candidates. I am quite sure

the same principles must have applied in the Public

Service Commission in not awarding more than  seven

President's scholarships for this year.  They  must

vary from year to year. Sometimes you have a bumper

harvest.  In some particular year the  wine  is  of

special vintage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng:</b> Is it customary to give a

scholar more than one scholarship? Would it not  be

better  to  distribute the scholarships  around  so

that more students will benefit?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> When we instituted the

President's Scholarships, we had in mind what  used

to  prevail for many years before the war when  the

British awarded the Queen's scholarships which were

awarded  purely on the basis of merit. It does  not

matter  whether the President's scholars  need  the

money  or whether they deserve it or do not deserve

it  for purely financial or social reasons, as long

as they have the capacity, the excellence, to merit

the award. If they can win other scholarships, then

they will not get the full award; but they will get

when they go abroad a scholarship allowance of  œ50

Sterling  per  annum in addition to the  allowances

they  have obtained under the other awards, instead

of  the full cost being borne by Government. It  is

quite  common. The Member for Joo Chiat  will  know

that  if  he  turns up the preface of many  of  his

scholarly journals or books, even in his particular

field of surgery, there is great pride in referring

to the fact that the man was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 636</b></font><br><br>



holding  three different scholarships at  the  time

when  he  was an under-graduate in some college  or

university.  And  often because  they  are  holding

three  different scholarships for which  they  have

competed and won on merit, they do not get in  each

case  the full award of each scholarship. The award

is  then  given to somebody else on  the  basis  of

need, that he was not really good enough to get  it

but  because he was fortunate that the man who  was

good  enough to win it had already got another one.

He gets the consolation prize.

answers given by the Prime Minister and I beg leave

to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0104 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2012.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The subject of Malaya Hall -I think it is now

called Malaysia Hall -is dear to my heart and I was

interested to find that the sum allocated this year

was  doubled  to $300,000. I sought explanation  in

Appendix    H    which   says   that   Government's

contribution is "shared in proportion  of  students

from each territory including Sabah and Sarawak." I

wonder  whether the Prime Minister can inform  this

House  whether  the  number of our  students  using

Malaysia  Hall has, in fact, doubled in the  course

of the year. I was in Malaysia Hall sometime at the

beginning of this year and there was no evidence of

that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> First, may I explain that we

paid one-third of the capital cost of acquiring the

premises  of  Malaysia Hall.  In  other  words,  in

equity  we  own one of the three fairly substantial

houses  which were joined together to form Malaysia

Hall. This is the first point we want to establish,

that  we  own  one-third of the capital.  With  the

accretion of Sabah and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 637</b></font><br><br>



Sarawak,  we  deem that our share  of  the  running

expenses   should   be  reduced,   but   we   still

nevertheless own one-third of the capital. We  were

one-third   of   the  student  population   without

including Sabah and Sarawak. With Sabah and Sarawak

we  consider ourselves one-fourth. So  we  held  up

payments  for the years 1965 to 1966  and  1966  to

1967  pending  clarification  in  sorting  out  the

proportions. Now it has been agreed that if we take

Singapore and Malaysia together, not Singapore  and

just  Malaya, we will pay one-quarter. So  this  is

for two years' payment. Arrears have to be paid up.

But  in  making this point I want to make it  quite

clear that this does not mean we own one-quarter of

Malaysia Hall. We still own one of the three houses

in  Malaysia  Hall. It so happened that  we  bought

three houses and we paid one-third. We are happy to

have  all the students together even though we  are

now separate and different countries. But if people

should   ever  consider  our  students  should   be

excluded, then we will not be collecting one-fourth

of three houses but we will be collecting one-third

of three houses, which is exactly one house.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I understand it, the function of the

Public    Service   Commission   is   to   regulate

impartially  the  public service.  This  Commission

works  on an independent basis with wide powers  to

appoint and promote persons in the public service.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sim, may I just here warn you

that  we are five minutes short of guillotine  time

under this Head?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Yes, Sir. Not forgetting that

the  Commission  has  also powers  to  dismiss  any

public servant.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 638</b></font><br><br>



What  I wish to raise in this House today is  as  a

result  of  rumours being spread about  the  Public

Service  Commission.  These rumours  no  doubt  are

untrue  but  they have become quite persistent  and

are damaging to the good name of the Public Service

Commission, although I do not believe them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Then do not repeat them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> I am troubled by these rumours

and  that  is why I hope that by bringing  up  this

matter, these unfounded rumours will be killed once

and  for  all.  The talk in the town is  that  some

people   are   unhappy  with  the  Public   Service

Commission and that it is prejudiced and biased  in

selecting    candidates   for   appointments    and

promotions, to the extent of saying that the Public

Service  Commission is pro-Chinese. Sir, I  do  not

think this is so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You should not repeat rumours

if you do not believe them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, I think the Public Service

Commission is doing excellent work. I do hope  that

when   the   new   Constitution  is  presented   to

Parliament, there will be provision for  increasing

the membership to the Commission so that it will be

possible  to  give a more balanced and multi-racial

composition.   However,   Sir,   in   making   this

suggestion I am not casting any aspersions  on  the

office of the Chairman nor on any of the members of

the  Public  Service Commission. As I have  pointed

out, they are doing excellent work.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members have had occasion to hear of matters

pertaining to certain resignations being brought up

in   this   House   and   no   doubt   satisfactory

explanations have been given.

am afraid you will have to stop now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Sir, I hope the Prime Minister

will seriously consider my suggestion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 639</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, in view of the shortage

of  time,  I  just want to bring up one matter  and

that  is  the non-recognition by the Public Service

Commission  of certain American degrees.  Will  the

Prime Minister enlighten us?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I am very disturbed that

the   Member  for  Changi,  who  has  been  a  very

politically  active and alive individual  with  the

P.A.P, for  the last 13 years since its inception,

should  have  forgotten  the fundamental  principle

that  the best way to spread a rumour is to  repeat

it,  and the worst place to repeat it is in a place

which  has  got the authority which will  carry  it

over   the  radio,  into  the  newspapers  and   on

television.  I do not know if he has been  watching

how  other  people use their radio  and  television

stations.  I  heard  with  consternation  how  some

Ministers  in  some other countries  in  the  world

visited   riot  areas  and  then  told   of   their

experiences. Their saying these things at the wrong

time and giving wider credence and publicity to  it

caused  further  disorders to take place.  I  would

have thought that the simple and obvious axiom -not

to  give  the  lie  more credence by  repeating  it

-would  have  been the one decisive factor  in  not

having raised this matter at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are five members of the P.S.C. -three are

Chinese, one is an Indian and one is a Malay. There

are  80  per  cent Chinese citizens, 7.6  per  cent

Malay  citizens,  and  about 7.2  per  cent  Indian

citizens.  It  is  impossible to  have  the  Public

Service Commission enlarged to a number which  will

include   proportional  representation  from   each

community.   There  will  be  the  Eurasians,   the

Ceylonese,  the Burmese, the Malays  of  Indonesian

descent,  the Malays of Malaysian descent,  and  so

on.  I  would have thought that the surest  way  in

which  a matter such as this can be disposed of  is

by moral rectitude, that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 640</b></font><br><br>



is,  those people who work and get promoted in  the

public service get promoted on the basis of merit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no time to reply to the other question

about recognition of American degrees. It is a very

wide and complicated subject and neither the Member

for  Choa Chu Kang nor I am all that familiar  with

American  institutions. They are very numerous  and

very  varied in the quality of the products to whom

they give degrees.

be relevant to the other two subheads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In last year's debate in Committee of Supply, I

raised  the  question  of State  Counsel  or  Legal

Officers  being kept at one post for a considerable

length  of time, so much so that when they came  up

for  promotion before the Legal Service Commission,

they  were asked what experience they had  got.  Of

course, they had none because they were kept



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 641</b></font><br><br>



in  that  one  post  for a long time,  a  state  of

affairs  to which they themselves did not agree.  I

was then assured by the Acting Minister for Law -it

was the Minister for Health then replying on behalf

of  the  Minister for Law and National  Development

-who  said  this state of affairs would  be  looked

into and he assured the House that it would not  be

continued. With your permission, Sir, may  I  quote

from Hansard -



The  Chairman: Mr Tang, in view of our time-table,

quotation from Hansard is perhaps not necessary.  I

am   sure   the  Minister  would  have  read   that

particular passage in Hansard before he  came  here

for discussion of your amendment to this subhead.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Unfortunately, such a state of

explanation and an assurance from the Minister that

it would be remedied.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the matters

raised  by the Member for Choa Chu Kang are  wholly

within  the  province, as it  were,  of  the  Legal

Service  Commission.  This Commission  is,  by  the

provisions of the Constitution, independent of  the

Government. But there are six members of the  Legal

Service Commission.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It consists of the Chief Justice as Chairman, a

Judge,   the   Chairman  of  the   Public   Service

Commission  and  two other members  of  the  Public

Service  Commission, together  with  the  Attorney-General. I can only speak on behalf of one  member,

and  that  is the Attorney-General. He  assures  me

that  law  graduates fresh from the University  who

are   appointed  to  the  Bench  straightaway   are

normally  given  an opportunity  to  broaden  their

field  of  experience long before their  period  of

probation expires, so that by the time they come up

for  confirmation or entry into the  legal  service

proper, they would, in the majority of cases,  have

held appointments in his Chambers as well as in the

Courts.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Barker, I am afraid you must

shorten your remarks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> But shortly, Sir, it is the Legal

Service  Commission  which is responsible  for  the

transfers, appointments as well as confirmation  of

all  legal officers. These officers are not my men,

and  the  members of the Commission will  know  the

reasons why a certain officer is kept either in the

Courts  or in the Chambers or transferred from  one

Court   to   another.  I  am  afraid  I   have   no

jurisdiction over the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I beg leave to withdraw, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $932,880 for Head 0105 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 642</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0107 -



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0107 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1010.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am afraid the Minister for

Law  has  anticipated part of my  argument  in  his

reply  to  my  earlier  amendment  regarding  newly

qualified  persons being appointed  to  the  Bench.

However, my reason against this is that this is not

a  very  good  practice, because a newly  qualified

person  should  do a stint in the  A.G.'s  Chambers

first  rather  than being appointed  to  the  Bench

straightaway.   Also  a  newly   qualified   person

appointed  to the Bench is likely to be transferred

at  one  time  or another to the Attorney-General's

Chambers  where  his superior is  someone  who  had

appeared before him when he was on the Bench.  This

is an invidious position to place a newly qualified

person  as  a magistrate and it is unfair  to  him.

This could result in a perversion of the course  of

justice.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Selvadurai (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  if I may make a point quickly on the question

of  the  appointment of magistrates  to  the  Bench

straight from the university. Quite often, many  of

our magistrates today are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>



appointed  to  the Bench immediately after  getting

their  degrees  in  the university  here  or  after

returning  from the United Kingdom with  their  Bar

qualifications.  This is a matter  which  was  dis.

cussed  at great length in this very House on  16th

December,  1957,  when the Prime  Minister  himself

made  the point that it is always difficult to have

inexperienced   magistrates  listening   to   cases

dealing  with  involved facts as well  as  involved

laws.  The  position today seems to be  similar  to

that  which obtained in 1957 and we do not seem  to

have progressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I was really interested in what

the   Minister   said  about  the  Public   Service

Commission.  I get the impression that the  malaise

really rests in the way in which the Public Service

Commission itself is constituted. Section 6 (4) (f)

of  the  Republic  of Singapore  Independence  Act,

1965, reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'the powers of the Judicial and Legal Service

Commission shall be exercised by a Legal  Service

Commission  which shall consist of the  following

persons:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the Chief Justice, as President;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the Attorney-General;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the Chairman of the Public Service Commission;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) a Judge of the High Court nominated generally or specially by the Chief Justice; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) not more than two members of the Public

Service   Commission  nominated  generally   or

specially   by  the  Chairman  of  the   Public

Service Commission;'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the non-legal element in the constitution of the Public

Service  Commission is about half.  I  submit  that

this  should not be so, because I do not think that

people  who  are  not legally trained  and  legally

qualified or people who have not practised  at  the

law  will understand the special position faced  by

the  Judicial Service or the Legal Service  of  the

State of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would very much like the Minister to let us

know whether this position could be rectified. If I

had my way, I would like to have the Legal Service



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>



Commission composed of purely legal men without any

non-legal element in it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> On the first point of the appointment

of magistrates straight from the university -to put

it  that  way -I agree with both Members. There  is

much  merit  in  what they say. I myself  have  had

similar experience at the Bar when appearing before

magistrates who had no experience on the Bench.  My

clients  therefore suffered and we had to take  the

matter  up to High Court. But I think both  Members

know  -and I need not repeat at length what I  have

said just now -that these are matters for the Legal

Service Commission which is certainly not under  my

control.  The  only person I can speak  to  is  the

Attorney-General. I will present the Members' views

to   him  and  ask  him  to  present  them  to  the

Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the composition of the Legal Service

Commission, I also agree with the Member for  Bukit

Panjang  that,  as  far as legal  appointments  are

concerned,  there  should  be  more  men  on   that

Commission with legal experience than the  position

as  it  is today -three men from the Public Service

Commission,  the  Chief Justice, a  Judge  and  the

Attorney-General. If there is a split in the votes,

the  Chief Justice will have a casting vote, but  I

am sure he will not be very happy if he has to cast

his extra vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure the Member for Bukit Panjang that these

are  matters which will be considered seriously  by

the Government when the new Constitution is finally

drafted. In fact, it has been drafted and  will  be

circulated amongst the Ministers and Ministries for

their  comments, and this is a point that  we  will

consider  when the new Constitution is finally  put

before this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I wish to withdraw the

amendment, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0107

be reduced by $100.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Speaker, Sir, in the not very distant future,

two  of our Judges are about to retire and the time

has  come when the powers that be will have to look

around to fill the vacancies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes ago I did refer to the debate in

this House on the 16th of December, 1957, when  the

Prime  Minister himself talked at length about  the

problem  of  having  to appoint Judges  from  among

practitioners.  I think it is inevitable  that,  as

time  goes  on, we will not be able to  escape  the

need  to  appoint most of our Judges more and  more

from  amongst  practitioners than  from  the  Legal

Service. This is as it should be, because  most  of

the  talent and expertise must come from among  the

practitioners themselves, and as Singapore  is  the

commercial heart -I am sure that as time  goes  on,

the  intellectual heart too -of the whole of South-east Asia, it is incumbent that we have a Bench  in

Singapore that inspires the confidence of not  only

the  people of Singapore but also the international

commercial community. This means that we must  have

at  least  a  very strong commercial Bench.  If  we

accept  the  proposition that we must  appoint  our

Judges   progressively  from  among  practitioners,

then,  of  course,  we come up against  the  rather

sensitive   question  of  emoluments  and   pension

schemes  that  we  will have to formulate  for  the

purposes of paying them.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Selvadurai, I am afraid you

will have to shorten your remarks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Selvadurai:</b> I will wind up, Mr Speaker, Sir.

I  wonder  if  the  Minister  will  look  into  the

question of increasing the Judges' salaries and see

to  it  that the pension schemes themselves are  so

modified  that the Judges appointed from among  the

practitioners do not lose out in relation to  their

colleagues  who come from the Legal Service  itself

in so far as pension payments are concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, everyone wants a

rise  in salary, but one increase leads to another.

The Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>



says,  Increase the Judges' salaries,  because  the

practitioners outside get more money." I agree that

because of our present scales of salary, it is very

difficult  for  anyone at the Bar to  give  up  his

practice  to  become  even the Chief  Justice.  The

amount  of  income  tax  any  leading  lawyer  pays

exceeds the salary of any of the Judges. But if you

up  the  Judges' salaries, how far  do  you  go?  A

Minister gets $2,500 a month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Good enough!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>

Underpaid!



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> So perhaps the Ministers set the

level above which no one can go very far. But  when

we  tell the labourer in the street that we  cannot

increase  his  salary, certainly hon. Members  will

agree that we cannot increase our own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the commercial court -the point raised by

the  Member for Bukit Panjang I will just say a few

words, Sir. There already exist in the Rules of the

Supreme  Court  special rules and regulations  that

have   been  devised  solely  to  accommodate   the

commercial   community  in  Singapore.   Indeed   a

commercial  court  can be said  to  be  already  in

existence. But, unfortunately, those practising  at

the  Bar  have not seen fit to invoke  the  use  of

these  Rules  which  will  in  turn  establish  the

commercial  practice  at  the  Bar.  While  it   is

conceded  that there may be a need for a commercial

court  charged with the adjudication of  commercial

matters, it would appear, from the use made of  the

Commercial  Code Rules or rather the lack  of  such

use,  that the time is not ripe for the appointment

of Judges solely with the object of establishing  a

commercial court.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0301 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is in conection with the Elections

Office.  For  the  past  few elections  which  were

carried  out  successfully  and  smoothly,  I  must

praise  the  efficiency  of the  Elections  Office.

However,  there  is still room for  improvement.  I

would  like to suggest the following proposals  for

future reference by the Elections Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the boundary of each constituency should

be   delineated  clearly,  because  there  is  some

confusion  over  the  present electoral  divisions,

i.e., a voter in Sembawang will have to vote in Nee

Soon or in Bukit Panjang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the days for inspection of the electoral

registers should be extended because the number  of

voters has increased.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, in some rural constituencies such as

Sembawang,  Nee Soon, Bukit Panjang, and  Choa  Chu

Kang,  the  centres for inspection of the electoral

registers  should be increased for the  convenience

of the people.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, first, I would

like  to  answer  the second point  raised  by  the

Member  for Sembawang -that the period of 12  days,

which  is  now  mandatory in  the  legislation,  is

considered adequate. I do not think it is necessary

really  to  extend the period of inspection.  As  a

matter  of  fact, the argument put forward  by  the

Member  for  Sembawang that the  period  should  be

lengthened  because  there  are  more  electors  is

inaccurate, simply because the increased electorate

has  been  redistributed among more constituencies,

with  the  result that we have opened more  centres

for the inspection of registers. And the period  of

two weeks -I am sorry I mentioned 12 days just now;

I was wrong, it should be two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>



weeks -is considered quite sufficient. If there are

people who are genuinely interested in finding  out

whether  or  not their names are in  the  register,

they should do so the moment the books are open for

inspection, and not wait until the last two days or

the  closing day to rush to the centre to check the

registers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as for the point raised by the Member

for  Sembawang that some electors in Sembawang find

that  they  have  to  vote in  Nee  Soon  or  Bukit

Panjang, that, of course, is an indictment  against

the  elector  himself. A man who  has  changed  his

address   should  immediately  notify  the  nearest

police station or the National Registration Centre,

so that this change of address will be noted in the

registers. Consequently the anomaly that a man  who

lives  in  one constituency has to vote in  another

constituency  will  not arise. However,  I  presume

that  many  people who have changed their addresses

during  this  period have not bothered  at  all  to

notify  the  police  or  the National  Registration

Centre,  and  therefore  they  have  to  face   the

inconvenience.  Equally so, it  may  well  be  that

persons living in new constituencies will find that

they will have to go to some faraway centre to vote

for  the same reason. However, we shall try as best

we  can  to erect more polling stations so that  as

few  people  as possible will be inconvenienced  on

this account.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker,

concerning  the  inspection of electoral  registers

over a period of two weeks, I find that of the many

electors who live on the same road or street in  my

constituency,  half of them will have  to  vote  in

Kampong  Kembangan and the other  half  in  Kampong

Chai  Chee. Further, of the other electors who have

been  living at the same address for so many years,

some will have to vote in Kampong Chai Chee and the

rest in Kampong Kembangan. And if these people wish

to raise any objection, they have to fill up a form

and  pay a prescribed fee of $1 per person. Can the

Deputy  Prime  Minister  re-examine  the  electoral

registers with a view to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>



rectifying  the  errors, so that  proper  electoral

registers can be drawn up without paying any fees?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The first point, of course, is

not   uncommon  at  all.  The  Member  for  Kampong

Kembangan   refers   to  a  situation   where   his

constituency has been cut into two, with the result

that  it is inevitable that some electors who  live

on  one  side  of  the street will find  themselves

belonging to one constituency, and those living  on

the  other  side of the street will find themselves

located  in another new constituency. This  is  the

case,  too,  for those people who live  in  Orchard

Road. Half of the people who live on the left  side

of   Orchard  Road  belong  to  the  River   Valley

Constituency, and those who live on the right  side

of  Orchard  Road find themselves in the  Cairnhill

Constituency. The reason is that Orchard Road, like

the road which the Member for Kampong Kembangan has

mentioned  just now, has been used  as  a  boundary

line   for  partitioning  the  area  into  separate

constituencies. I am afraid this is a problem which

cannot be avoided at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, as far as the waiving of fees is

concerned, the idea of imposing a fee is to prevent

people  from  wasting  the  time  of  the  Election

Officers over frivolous claims. A fee is imposed so

that whoever is prepared to pay $1 will really  lay

a  claim  or  make  an objection to  the  Elections

Office because he has got serious reasons to do so.

However,  I will consider waiving the fee  in  some

cases, but at the moment I do not think that we can

completely   remove   this  regulation   from   the

Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, can

the Deputy Prime Minister explain whether in a bona

fide  case of an elector who should not really vote

in  Kampong Chai Chee as he still lives at the same

address,  will the Deputy Prime Minister waive  the

payment of a fee?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> If the objection is found to

be  genuine,  and  that the  error  lies  with  the

Elections Office, then I will instruct my  officers

to pass the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>



matter  up  to me and, as I have indicated  to  the

Member earlier, in such an instance we may consider

waiving the fee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0301 be

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0301

be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(In Mandarin)</i>: Sir, we all know that according  to

our  Constitution there will be an  election  every

five  years. In other words, Members of  Parliament

who have been elected in the 1963 elections will be

occupying  these  seats up to the  30th  September,

1968. In a review of past elections which began not

very  long  ago,  the first general elections  were

conducted  under a semi-colonial regime. Later  on,

the  general  elections  were  conducted  under  an

internally self-governing Singapore, and  the  last

elections  were  also conducted quite  differently.

And the general elections which will take place  in

1968  will  still  be different in  nature  because

Singapore has since become an independent Republic.

So  the people of Singapore are free. They have the

right to elect their own representatives into  this

House. Therefore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>



in  view  of  the  changed  circumstances  and  the

different  nature  and  importance  of  our  coming

general  elections, I would like  to  raise  a  few

points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to ask concerns the coming general

elections.  In  view of its different  meaning  and

nature, can certain citizens of Singapore who  have

become diplomats, or local citizens who have become

High   Commissioners,  ambassadors  or   diplomatic

personnel  of  foreign countries -in  other  words,

they  are  now  serving foreign  countries  -become

candidates in the general elections in 1968?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is the allocation of work

pertaining  to the election officers. According  to

our experience in the past, very often when it came

to the time of election many unhappy incidents took

place,  especially  in  a constituency  where  many

candidates  competed. Some of the candidates  would

not  abide by the regulations. They wanted to  play

foul. Some of them would canvass illegally or tease

election  officers  so that the  election  officers

could  not look after their jobs as efficiently  as

they would like to. All these malpractices are  not

very good and when elections -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. There are two minutes left

during  which  the  hon. Member must  complete  her

speech and for the Minister to reply.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> One minute more. <i>(In

Mandarin)</i>  So I hope the Deputy Prime Minister  can

enlighten us on how the future general election  is

going to be carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is about slogans and propaganda

posters. These things are normally related  to  the

different  constituencies. I think the  rule  about

the number of posters should be relaxed, because if

only  20  posters  are  allowed  in  a  very  large

constituency, they may not be sufficient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also ask the Deputy Prime Minister when

the next general elections will be held.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> In answer to question one

-anyone  who is a Singapore citizen and whose  name

is  in  the  electoral register  can  vote  in  any

election and can also stand as a candidate for  the

election. There is no law to stop him from doing so

at  all.  For all those who are serving abroad,  it

may  well  be unfortunate indeed that there  is  no

provision  in  the law by which they  can  vote  by

proxy  or  through the post. However,  that  is  no

handicap  at  all, because so long as such  persons

inform  the  Elections Office of  the  reasons  for

their  absence from the State during the  election,

their names will be retained in the register.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to question two -the Elections

Ordinance,   which   has  been  amended   recently,

provides  the  police  with powers  to  handle  any

disturbances which may occur during the  elections,

and  I  am quite sure that any foolish organisation

or  any  foolish group of persons who believe  that

they can intimidate, threaten or interfere with the

elections in 1968 will think twice before  they  do

this, because any such attempts to create confusion

during  the elections will be properly dealt  with,

and we will have no hesitation to clobber all those

who  seek  to  create  confusion  during  such   an

important event in the history of the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to the third question about increasing

the  number  of  posters -this is a  problem  which

arose some years ago when we discovered that during

the  elections it was a war of posters. Candidates'

posters  were plastered on top of other candidates'

posters, and because of this, it was agreed by  all

the  parties  concerned  that  there  should  be  a

restriction in the number of posters that could  be

pasted  up  so as to avoid complaints and incidents

over  the profusion of posters as a result of which

in some streets there was not enough wall space for

late comers to put their posters up at all. Whether

we can increase the number of posters for the rural

areas so that the electorate will at least know who

is standing for election or not is a point which we

may  well have to take into consideration when  the

time comes.

<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view

of the Deputy Prime Minister's reply, may I beg

leave to withdraw my amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,008,750 for Head 0301 ordered to

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0302 -

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0302

be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore is the fifth largest port in the

world.  As such, I think it is befitting its status

that  it  should  have its own registry.  This  was

established  some  time  ago.  I  would  now   like

information from the Deputy Prime Minister  on  the

tonnage   that  has  been  registered   since   its

establishment;  also, whether he is satisfied  with

the progress so far, and, if not, whether he thinks

that  this lack of progress is due to the very high

standard  that  we  require  for  a  ship   to   be

registered  here,  and  whether  he  will  consider

lowering  it.  For example, take a  leaf  from  the

Panamanian Registry or the Liberian Registry so  as

to encourage the registering of ships here. This, I

understand,  would  create  very  good   employment

opportunities for our unemployed here.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The answer to the first

question by the Member for Choa Chu Kang is that at

present  there  is  a total of  303  ships  in  the

Singapore Registry totalling about 125,785 tons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the second question is that I am

not  satisfied with the total tonnage or  with  the

total number of ships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the third question is that we are a

signatory to the International Convention  for  the

Safety  of  Life  at Sea, and it is necessary  that

whatever  regulations  we  promulgate  must  be  in

accordance with our adherence to this International

Convention.  It is true that at the present  moment

the Merchant Shipping Ordinance prescribes regulations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>



which follow the British Ordinance, and these

regulations  are  of  higher standards  than  those

required  by the International Convention.  I  have

already in draft form a piece of legislation  which

I  shall  put before Parliament sometime next  year

whereby  I  hope  to  revise the Merchant  Shipping

Ordinance and make the regulations such that  while

we   conform  to  the  standards  required  by  the

International  Convention, we do not  at  the  same

time  ask  for absurd standards which are too  high

for  local requirements or for the requirements  of

ships deployed in this area, so that in this way we

can  encourage  more  foreign vessels  to  fly  the

Singapore flag.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether it is wise to follow the

Panamanian model for registering ships, but I would

not  like  to make comparisons among the  Liberian,

the Panamanian, the Bermudan and any other flag  of

convenience. However, all I would say is that  what

we  will do is typically Singaporean, and it is the

intention of this legislation, of course, to assist

ship owners to register under our flag. At the same

time,  what we gain out of it will not be in income

tax  or  other forms of taxation. What  I  hope  to

achieve  by changing our Merchant Shiping Ordinance

is that by having more vessels registered under our

flag   we   can   create  more  opportunities   for

employment of Singapore seamen.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> I am satisfied, Mr Speaker,

and I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $1,741,990 for Head 0302 ordered to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0304 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1051.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a multi-racial and multi-lingual

society   in  Singapore  and  we  are  praised   by

foreigners  for this unique quality. An example  of

this quality is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>



seen  in  the signboards which are written  in  the

main  languages of our Republic. But, Sir,  I  note

with  regret that the signboards in certain  places

have  spelling mistakes, or the letters are written

wrongly in the vernacular languages. This mars  our

supreme  quality  of  which we  are  really  proud.

Recently  I  came  across such  a  mistake  in  the

Airport, the place where most of the foreigners  to

our  Republic step in first. Sir, I do  not  accuse

anyone of doing this mistake deliberately. This may

be  an  oversight or it may be due to the ignorance

of  the  signboard writer. I would like to  request

the  Minister to issue a directive to rectify  such

mistakes. Incidentally, I want to make use of  this

opportunity  also to request the other  departments

of the Government to pay more attention not only to

the  translations of the names, instructions, etc.,

but also to the writing of them.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, if the Member for

Aljunied  will  write  to  the  Director  of  Civil

Aviation  or  to me indicating which signboards  in

which  parts  of  the  Airport  have  mistakes   in

translation  or spelling on them, I am  quite  sure

the  errors can be rectified very easily.  I  would

only point out that, as far as the translation  and

spelling  of signboards is concerned,  there  is  a

standard  procedure by which the Director of  Civil

Aviation  refers  the matter  to  the  Ministry  of

Culture,  and  it is the Ministry of Culture  which

gives   the   purported  correct   version   of   a

translation or spelling of any name that we wish to

write  on  a sign-board. I would say that the  best

thing  that  the Member can do is to  let  us  know

specifically  which signboard is in  error  and  in

which  part of the Airport it is located.  We  will

rectify the mistake as soon as we can.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I assure the Deputy Prime Minister

that  I  will do that. Sir, I beg leave to withdraw

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The same  amendment also stood in the name of  MrP. Govindaswamy.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the formation of the Singapore Airport

Auxiliary Police Force, it is noted that the salary

scales  for  constables are very  much  lower  than

their   counterparts  in  the  Port  of   Singapore

Authority or even in the regular police. The police

at the Airport perform more or less the same duties

as those in the Port of Singapore Authority and the

regular  police. They were, however, left out  when

salary increases were granted to other units of the

Police  Force  in Singapore during Malaysia.  Apart

from not having been considered when a general  pay

revision  was  made,  they  were  not  granted  any

quarters nor any privileges that other units in the

Police  Force  are getting. If this is  allowed  to

carry on, I feel it will not be good for the morale

of the members of this force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can the Deputy Prime Minister inform this

House  whether any consideration is being given  to

bring the salaries and conditions of service of the

Airport  Police in line with those of  the  regular

police?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

understand  that with the expansion of our  tourist

trade  and  other commercial activities,  more  and

more aeroplanes are making use of our Airport. With

this   increase  in  traffic  both  in   terms   of

passengers and goods, one would expect an  increase

in   the  number  of  constables  in  the  Airport.

Instead. I notice there has been a reduction of  16

constables, while the number of lance corporals and

corporals  is  to  be  increased  by   12   and   4

respectively.  While  I am  not  objecting  to  the

promotion   of  deserving  officers,   I   do   not

understand why the number of constables  should  be

reduced   especially  in  the  face  of  increasing

traffic.  May I be informed of the reason for  this

reduction, please?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer

to the question by the Member for Serangoon Gardens

is  that  when Singapore was part of Malaysia,  the

claim by the Airport Police Force for a revision of

their salaries so that they would be considered  as

part  of  the regular Police Force was put in,  but

unfortunately the claim was turned down.  In  fact,

the  Airport  Police  Force is  distinct  from  the

regular  Police Force. It has been formed  under  a

different  Ordinance  which  permits  the   Airport

Police  Force  to  perform solely as  an  auxiliary

police force. However, their claim for revision  of

salaries   has   been  laid  before  the   Salaries

Commission  and  until the Report of  the  Salaries

Commission  has been published by the Minister  for

Finance, I cannot say anything more on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the point raised by the Member for Anson,

the answer is that the in-crease of traffic at Paya

Lebar  and  requirements for  car  parks  have  got

nothing  to  do with the police at all. The  police

look  after  the internal security of the  Airport,

and   car  parks  are  looked  after  by  car  park

attendants and not by the police force. So if  four

persons  have been promoted to corporals and  lance

corporals.   I   think   it   is   a   matter   for

congratulation. I really see no reason why  because

we have promoted four persons, therefore, we should

replace them with four constables. The same  number

of  bodies is required and certainly we do not want

to  follow Parkinson's law that, if you create  one

top  post,  you  have got to create  several  other

minor  post3  in  the  process.  However,  for  the

information  of the Member for Anson, I  would  say

that  this  is part of an economy exercise  by  the

Ministry  of Finance. They have been very stringent

for  1968.  As  Members are aware,  the  Budget  is

virtually  a standstill Budget, and the reason  why

it  Is  so is that we have clamped down on all  new

appointments. I myself would be very  happy  indeed

to ease the load from some of my officers as far as I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>



can, but, unfortunately, this is the general policy

and I do not think we can increase the number of

police constables at the Airport.

has  really  been  no increase  in  the  number  of

accountants in the Telecommunications



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>



Department. What has happened is that we have taken

over   Cable   and  Wireless  Limited   which   was

responsible for external telecommunications in  the

past, and in the process we have taken over members

of the staff as well. The three Accountants who are

budgetted  for in the Estimates are these:  one  is

held  against a post which is now shown in  subhead

1009;  the second one is held against the  post  of

Assistant  Controller, subhead 1010; and the  third

accountant comes over from Cable and Wireless.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add, for the information of the House,

that   the   essence   of  the   Telecommunications

Department  is to earn revenue, and  I  have  given

directives that the Department should be spruced up

so  that it operates as a business concern. As  the

most important part of any business concern is  the

accounting  side,  we  have authorised  that  three

accountants  be appointed in the Telecommunications

Department.  These accountants have  more  work  to

perform since we have got international as well  as

local accounting to look into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, on the question of telegraph

messengers,  there  has been some  misunderstanding

partly  because the number of telegraph  messengers

whom  we have taken over from the former Cable  and

Wireless is not indicated in the Budget. But if the

Member   for   Anson  looks  under  subhead   3009,

Telecommunications Department (External),  he  will

find  a block vote of $4,256,280. This sum of money

is  provided for payment of emoluments to all those

now  in  Cable and Wireless. At the moment, we  are

negotiating  with  Cable  and  Wireless  Union   on

transfer of the staff to Government salary  scales,

and  negotiations have not been completed for posts

relating  to  Division II and officers  below  this

Division.  The telegraph messenger boys' emoluments

in  Cable  and Wireless are included in this  block

vote. So there has really been no reduction at  all

in the total number of telegraph messengers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>



Incidentally, there are 63 telegraph messengers  in

Cable  and Wireless and this, together with the  55

budgetted  for  under the Telecommunications  Head,

brings  the  total to 121. So with that  number  of

telegraph messenger boys, I think we can  pool  our

resources and make the service as efficient  as  in

the past without increasing the number of bodies.

Sir,  here  I wish to get your consent to  move  my

amendment No. (4)* on subhead 2021 as well.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Amendment No. (4) reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0308 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2021.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There is no need to move it, Mr

Lingam, but you may range over that topic.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Yes. Sir, I am only seeking

clarification on the two sub-heads. I want to  know

what these payments are, to whom they are paid, and

why the wayleave payments are increased threefold?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Wayleave ac-counting is a form

of  accounting  which has been worked  out  amongst

Commonwealth countries who subscribe  to  a  common

telecommunications system. It is a very complicated

form  of  accounting which I myself, not  being  an

accountant, do not fully understand. But roughly it

means  this. If you want to send a message, let  us

say,  to Copenhagen or Moscow, you can send it  via

Seacom  cable across to Australia, then across  the

Pacific  to Canada, across the Atlantic to  London,

who  in  turn will transmit the message  either  by

radio  or  some other cable to Moscow or Copenhagen

or  whichever  place  you  want  to  despatch  your

message. Things being centralised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>



more   or  less  in  London  in  this  Commonwealth

network, it stands to reason that whatever  revenue

we  collect in Singapore, part of it has got to  be

paid  to  somebody else for helping you to transmit

your  message. This is the essence of the  wayleave

accounting  system. It means that  all  expenditure

incurred  by  partners  of the  Commonwealth  cable

system  or  telecommunications  system  pool  their

expenditure  together; this expenditure  being  the

amount  of  money  you spend on transmitting  other

people's  messages,  or  expenditure  incurred   in

maintaining  sections of the cable or  sections  of

the  telecommunications system for  which  you  are

responsible.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then towards the end of the financial year, the

revenues  collected by Commonwealth  countries  are

totalled up and each Commonwealth member country is

then  asked to pay up what it owes to other members

in  proportion  to the amount of  revenue  that  it

collects  in its own country. This roughly  is  the

essence of the wayleave scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why the wayleave payment has been

increased  is  again explained by our take-over  of

external  telecommunications from the former  Cable

and  Wireless Company. The wayleave payments  which

were  previously made by Cable and Wireless Company

are  now  included  in  the payments  made  by  the

Telecommunications Department.  That  explains  why

there  has been an increase. F o r m e r I  y,  the

Telecommunications  Department  paid   about   $2.2

million. Cable and Wireless Company paid about $1.1

million. So the total sum adds up to $3.3 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the second point, the interim



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>



allowance refers to an allowance that is being paid

to  clerks  of  the  Telecommunications  Department

under  an  award made by the Industrial Arbitration

Court  in 1965. The allowance amounts to about  $15

per   month  to  each  clerk.  The  clerks  of  the

Telecommunications  Department  had  asked  for  an

upward revision of their salaries, but this had not

been agreed to by the Treasury. It was referred  to

the Arbitration Court, and when no final settlement

was  forthcoming either from the Treasury  or  from

the Salaries Commission, the Arbitration Court made

a  judgment so that an interim payment of this  sum

would be made to these clerks. So this is, in fact,

an  allowance  payable to a clerk if  the  date  of

confirmation  of  his  appointment  is  later  than

January  1965. This explains why this  sum  is  now

being included in the Budget.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to bring to the

notice  of  the  House  the fact  that  the  Postal

Department  has  been working quite efficiently  in

past  years. In the 1965 Budget sittings, I pointed

out that the postal quarters at Radin Mas, Tanglin,

Wilkinson  Road, Geylang and Choon Guan Street  old

postal-drivers garage quarters were in  pretty  bad

condition  and  I urged that they be improved.  The

Minister of State promised to look into the matter,

but  I  regret to say, Sir, that nothing  has  been

done.  I  am  now  compelled to ask  him  the  same

question and I hope that some action will be  taken

to improve these postmen's quarters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would also like to draw the

attention  of  this House to the difficult  working

conditions of postmen. In my opinion, and  speaking

from experience, I think that the duties of postmen

are  among the toughest in the whole civil service.

I  am  sure that the public are also aware of this.

Outwardly,  they  seem  to  be  merrily  delivering

letters,  parcels and registered articles,  but  it

must  be appreciated that their duties are not that

simple. They are required to discharge them  within

a stipulated time. They have to cycle under the hot

sun or in heavy rain and sometimes with their heavy

loads up hilly slopes, which is most strenuous  and

exhausting, and they are penalised for any loss  of

letters  or articles. Above all, they have to  rush

through their daily deliveries within a very  short

time.  They also have to climb many storeys in  our

modern  multi-storeyed flats.  Under  these  trying

conditions of work, it is not unreasonable  to  ask

that  they be provided with decent quarters so that

they  may have a proper night's rest in order  that

they  can  be fit to undertake another day's  heavy

work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I notice in the Estimates that

a  number  of  higher  grade posts  in  the  Postal

Department  has been increased. I also notice  from

the Budget Statement of the Finance Minister of the

5th  of  December that there has been a substantial

increase in the number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>



houses  and factories, but that there is to  be  no

increase  in  the number of postmen  for  1968.  In

fact,  the Minister stated that the number  of  new

buildings commenced this year showed no less than a

66  per  cent increase over that of last  year  and

that private construction was, particularly active,

showing  a  94.5  per  cent  increase.  Yet  I   am

surprised to note that there is no provision for an

increase of even one postman but that there  is  an

increase  in the number of higher grade posts.  For

example,  the  number of senior officers  has  been

raised from 8 to 13 since 1963, but there has  been

no  increase  in the number of clerical  staff.  We

have now a Postmaster-General, a Deputy Postmaster-General,  two  Controllers of Posts,  13  Assistant

Controllers   of   Posts,   an   i   three    Chief

Superintendents.  This increase in  the  number  of

higher grade posts is hardly explainable. I do  not

know  what  work  they are doing, but  I  certainly

cannot imagine how increased deliveries due to  the

increase   in   population,   houses,   flats   and

factories, can be met by increasing the  number  of

senior  officers. I have, however, no objection  to

the  creation  of  the post of  Deputy  Postmaster-General,  but  I  cannot  see  the  need  for   two

Controllers  of  Posts. Will the Minister  consider

reducing the number to one Controller of Posts  and

three  Assistant Controllers of Posts? The  savings

in  salaries of these four posts will be sufficient

to  pay  for  30 postmen, which will mean  that  30

families will be looked after.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope the Minister will

appreciate  that  postmen are working  under  heavy

pressure.  When  one  postman goes  on  leave,  his

delivery  beat is shared by other postmen  who  are

already overloaded. But overtime is paid often  not

in  fair proportion to the overtime work performed.

In  short,  this  is  because of  the  shortage  of

postmen. To cite an example, on 14th November  this

year,  one assistant postman died shortly after  he

arrived  for  duty at the General Post Office.  The

pressure  of work was certainly one of  the  causes

that  contributed to his death. The office  is  not

well-ventilated   and   is   congested    by    the

accumulation of mail bags and parcels.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 665</b></font><br><br>



Indeed,  one wonders how many of them have T.B.-God

knows!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I respectfully request that the

Minister  take  effective  steps  to  improve   the

working  conditions of postmen by providing  better

quarters  for  them and by increasing their  number

rather  than  by  increasing the number  of  senior

officers.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Prime Minister's Department (Tuan Haji Yaacob bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,I fully sympathise with

the  Member  for Anson who spoke on  the  hardships

experienced by postmen who earn small wages. As  he

has  moved amendment (1) and ranged over amendments

(2) ,  (3) , (4) , (5) and (6) , I will reply  to  them

one by one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards postmen's quarters, last year -I have

been  the Minister of State since 1965 - I promised

that  I  would  look into the matter  when  it  was

raised in Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to explain that in 1963 at a meeting

of  the Postal Services Joint Committee, the  Staff

Side requested that the department take up with the

Government   the   desirability  of   repairs   and

alterations to the postmen's quarters at Lorong 27-A,  Geylang, Kampong Bahru, Tanglin Post Office and

Wilkinson Road. The Staff Side also requested  that

the  single-room quarters occupied  by  postmen  at

Choon Guan Street should he altered to provide  two

rooms  for each occupant. The matter was  taken  up

with   the  Public  Works  Department  and  limited

repairs  and  renovations were  undertaken  in  due

course.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Public Works Department reported

that  in  respect  of alterations to  provide  more

living   space,   the  Development  Planning   Sub-Committee   had   not   approved   any   structural

alterations   as  the  quarters   were   very   old

buildings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pertinent to point out to the Member for

Anson  that  postmen are not entitled  to  quarters

under   their  scheme  of  service,  and  therefore

Government should not spend public funds to enlarge



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>



existing old quarters. However, postmen,  as

members  of  the  public, are eligible  for  public

housing, and it is understood that there will be no

difficulty  in  obtaining Housing  Board  flats  if

applicants  are  not selective. This  will  provide

better   housing   facilities   for   the   postmen

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the Deputy Postmaster-General, subhead

1002,  because of the recent take-over of Singapore

functions  from Postal Headquarters, Kuala  Lumpur,

including the Singapore section of the Post  Office

Savings  Bank which operated at Petaling Jaya,  the

range of duties and responsibilities discharged  by

the  Postmaster-General, Singapore, has  increased,

in  order to avert the administrative burden at the

Postmaster-General level, it is necessary to create

the post of Deputy Postmaster-General.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On subhead 1004, in 1966 the posts of Assistant

Controller of Posts were increased from  9  to  13.

The  four  new  posts  are for  the  following  new

branches to be taken over from Postal Headquarters,

Kuala  Lumpur: -(a) Post Office Savings  Bank,  (b)

Finance  and  Checking Branch, (c)  Statistics  and

International Branch, and (d) Money Order,  Stamps,

and Services Branch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding subhead 1012, Postal Clerks, Timescale,

it  was proposed to increase the 1968 establishment

of  postal  clerks by 69, i.e., making a  total  of

508.  The  reasons for the increase are as follows:

(1) nine postal clerks to meet the normal growth of

work;  and (2) 60 postal clerks, currently employed

as  temporary clerks, to man the four new branches,

namely,  the Post Office Savings Bank, the  Finance

and    Checking   Branch,   the   Statistics    and

international  Branch, and the Money Order,  Stamps

and  Services  Branch, which  branches  are  to  be

transferred to the permanent establishment.



In  respect of the increase of nine postal clerks,

it   is  regretted  that  the  Permanent  Secretary

(Finance) did not support the proposal. In  respect

of  the  60  postal clerks, the Permanent Secretary

(Finance)  has  instead provided a  block  vote  of

$320,000 under O.C.S.E., appearing in page  109  of

the Estimates under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>



subhead   3005,   Expenses   relating   to   Postal

Headquarters Branches and Post Office Savings Bank,

Singapore.   This  vote  is  to  meet  payment   of

emoluments and C.P.F, contributions of the staff of

the  four  new  branches, pending a review  of  the

staffing position of the Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding subhead 1023, Postmen. Timescale, it

was  proposed to increase the establishment in  the 1968  Estimates by 15 postmen, making  a  total  of 462,  to  cope with the growth of delivery work  as

mentioned  by  the Member for Anson a little  while

ago. Unfortunately, the proposals submitted to  the

Ministry  of  Finance  were not  supported  by  the

Permanent Secretary (Finance).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding subhead 1024, the current establishment

of  assistant  postmen is 106. It was  proposed  to

increase the establishment by one, making  a  total

of 107. Unfortunately, too, the Ministry of Finance

did  not  support this proposal either. However,  I

sympathise with the hon. Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Regarding the Choon Guan Street

Postal  Garage  quarters,  I  understand  from  the

Minister of State that there are two rooms each  in

every  quarters. That is incorrect,  because  there

are  22 quarters; four with two rooms each, and the

rest -18 quarters -have one room each.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State has also mentioned just now

the  increase in the number of postmen and  others,

and  his reason is that the Ministry of Finance has

been  cutting  down the expenditure.  What  is  the

meaning  of cutting and further cutting  the  vote?

The   Minister  of  State  must  tell  the  Finance

Ministry  that this Department needs the  increase,

because the postmen are at present suffering.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>



He  must explain to the Minister for  Finance

the  reasons  for increasing the number  of  posts.

Just  ask  any  Assistant Controller  of  Posts  or

anybody  to  deliver letters in the Alexandra  area

for  one day. Just let them try, and they will  see

how  difficult is the postman's job. And if you  do

not  want to increase the number of posts, you  are

pressuring them. It is like hell. They want to  run

away from the Postal Department. That would be very

unfair to the Postal Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now ask the Minister to go and press this

matter  again and get the increase. But  since  the

Minister   for  State  has  already  replied,   and

although I am not satisfied, I have to withdraw  my

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

reduced  by  $10 in respect of item (5) of  subhead

3002.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, this item that I wish to discuss

concerns posting boxes and installation expenses in

housing estates. The sum allocated for next year is

only $150. From this meagre figure, it appears that

the  authorities  concerned are not  interested  in

setting  up more posting boxes in densely populated

areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many housing estates are coming up in Singapore.

Because  of poor planning in the old days  when  no

provision  was made for these posting boxes,  there

are now inadequate facilities for posting. This  is

similar  to the lack of planning of hawker pitches.

As a result of such poor planning, we often receive

many  complaints to the effect that it is extremely

difficult   to  post  a  letter  because   of   the

inadequate  number  of  posting  boxes  in  housing

estates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we all know that in some countries

some  people have to travel a long way by train  to

send  a  letter.  But  if  we  want  Singapore   to

progress, we must not compare ourselves with  these

countries, This is a poor comparison. We  must  not

look backward. So in so far as housing estates are

concerned,  we  can  see from the  many  complaints

coming from the residents -

proceeded with:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0307

be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of $16,101,610 for Head 0307 ordered to

stand part of the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Before we go on to the next Head,

it  may be appropriate if I, at this juncture, just

make  a  reference to time. I have based guillotine

times on the times requested by Members, and I have

tried to be as fair as possible. To accommodate all

hon. Members, it has been necessary to cut down  to

40 per cent the time each Member has requested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guillotine times as to when discussion of any

head  shall  end  have been circulated  to  Members

three  or  four  days ago. If Members  continue  to

speak  without an eye on the clock, they are merely

depriving  other  Members of their  opportunity  to

speak.  While I am not affected, I have to  enforce

the  rules.  This  will be to the  disadvantage  of

Members who have amendments in their names but  are

lower down the list in the notice of amendments, 1,

therefore, ask Members to keep an eye on the  clock

as they speak. From the list of times, Members will

know how many more Members want to speak on a Head,

For the next Head, Registry of Vehicles, discussion

must terminate at 5 o'clock.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>



There  are five Members who want to speak, and  the

Minister  must  reply. Members  must  adjust  their

speeches  to  fit in to the available time,  if  no

Member is to be cut out completely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 0309 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendments stood in the name of

Madam Chan Choy Siong -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0309 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1011.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0309 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1012.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0309 he

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3007.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see from the Estimates that a token sum of

$10   was   approved   in   1967   for   the   item

"Mechanization   of   licensing   and    collection

procedures". But there is no vote to be  found  for

1968. Has the idea of this system been shelved?  If

so, why?



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  department had, in fact, proposed that  there

should  be  a  computer  for the  mechanization  of

licensing and collection procedures, but it was not

considered  necessary to have this  provision  next

year because this job is being taken care of by the

Ministry of Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> I withdraw the amendment, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Gazette No. 5 183 dated 29th

August, 1962, does not permit vehicles of over five

tons  to  make use of Jalan Ubi from Jalan Mempelam

and  Changi Road, but not in the case of Jalan  Ubi

from Airport Road to Changi Road -i.e., Jalan Betek

between  Jalan Taugeh and Jalan Ubi. The length  of

Jalan  Betek is from Jalan Sayur to Jalan Ubi.  The

limitation,  therefore, is half. Why is  the  other

half  of  the road from Jalan Mempelam  to  Airport

Road  not  gazetted? Likewise Jalan  Betek  between

Jalan  Sayur and Jalan Taugeh. Why does  the  Prime

Minister's Department restrict half the portion  of

the   road  only?  I  would  also  like  the  Prime

Minister's  Department to restrict the use  of  all

the roads to light vehicles only.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> I am not moving.

Mr Speaker. Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, we

all  know that the Registry of Vehicles is  a  very

busy  department. This is because  Singapore  is  a

prosperous    city.   Business   flourishes,    the

population is increasing, and the car-owning  class

is expanding from year to year. For example, in the

case  of  private  cars,  in  1962,  according   to

statistics, there were only 77,379 cars;  but  five

years  later, that is, today, we have 115,283 cars.

That  means in five years' time there has  been  an

increase of 40,000 cars. The same increase is  also

seen  in  motor-cycles. There has  also  been  some

improvement in the efficiency and administration of

the  R.O.V, to cope with the increase of work.  But

undoubtedly   there  are  some  defects   in   this

department. As a result, I have received complaints

from  members of the public and I wish to take this

opportunity  to  convey  these  complaints  to  the

Minister  to enable him to take immediate steps  to

improve the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, some members of the staff in the R.O.V.

-I  stress some only -are very bad in their dealing

with the public. They are rather bureaucratic in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>



their  attitude and they do not receive the  public

well, They are not very courteous. This should  not

be so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I think the department should

constantly  review its administrative machinery  to

maintain  a  high  standard of efficiency.  I  have

received complaints from members of the public that

they  have to wait for as long as half an  hour  or

even  one  hour to pay their road tax.  That  is  a

waste  of  time  and a great inconvenience  to  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, I have to appeal on behalf of the taxi

drivers.  I have received complaints from  some  of

them  that  they  are reported  to  have  committed

traffic offences and were fined heavily as a result

of  the  lack of taxi stands in certain  places.  I

think  the Government derives thousands of  dollars

every  year  by  way  of taxi licence  fees.  So  I

suggest the R.O.V, should build enough taxi  stands

to   enable  the  taxi  drivers  to  operate  their

business  properly, because they  have  paid  their

road tax and they have a right to earn a living.



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, to

reply  to  the Member for Kampong Kembangan.  As  a

result of the Prime Minister's visit to the Geylang

Serai  Constituency, an appeal was sent to  him  to

impose  restriction  on heavy  vehicles  using  the

roads  in  question.  A decision  had  to  be  made

whether the roads should be made up or restrictions

imposed   on  vehicles.  As  a  result  of  careful

investigations by the traffic police, the  Director

of  P.W.D, and the Director of the Trade Division,

it  was  decided  to impose restrictions  on  heavy

vehicles,  especially  those carrying  logs,  using

Jalan  Ubi.  This involved 32 roads in addition  to

Jalan  Ubi  and the other roads mentioned.  Perhaps

the  road signs there are insufficient. I will  ask

the  traffic  police  to  increase  the  number  of

warning  notices regarding the restriction  on  the

use of the roads by heavy vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the matter raised by the Member

for  Sembawang, I shall be grateful  if  complaints

about  the  discourteous behaviour of some  of  the

staff can be addressed direct to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>



Registrar  of Vehicles or to me. We will  certainly

take appropriate measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the long wait to pay road tax, we

cannot put the blame on the R.O.V. We have launched

a   campaign  over  the  radio  and  on  television

advising licence holders to pay their road  tax  by

post, and thus do away with the necessity of having

to  wait  long if they pay at the R.O.V, counters.

But,  unfortunately, our campaign has gone unheeded

by certain quarters. Hence they have to wait for  a

considerable time. I hope the Member for  Sembawang

will  participate in this campaign and urge members

of  the public to pay their road tax by post and in

that way reduce the congestion at the R.O.V.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding taxi stands, actually this subject is

under  the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National

Development.  It  is  therefore  proper   for   the

Minister in charge of that Ministry to reply.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

thank the Minister of State who has considered  the

appeal  by  the  residents there.  But  what  I  am

surprised  is  that whilst Gazette S 138  restricts

the  use  of  Jalan Ubi between Jalan Mempelam  and

Changi  Road  which  are  not  passable  to   heavy

vehicles, there is no restriction to the use of the

other half from Jalan Mempelam to Airport Road. The

Gazette   only  states  Jalan  Ubi  between   Jalan

Mempelam  and  Changi  Road. Likewise  Jalan  Betek

between  Jalan Taugeh and Jalan Ubi. The length  of

Jalan  Betek stretches from Jalan Taugeh  to  Jalan

Sayur, which means that the other half can be used.

The  other  road  names are  not  included  in  the

Gazette.  It  is not because of the  lack  of  road

names but because they are not gazetted. As I  have

said just now, Jalan Ubi between Jalan Mempelam and

Airport Road, Jalan Betek between Jalan Taugeh  and

Jalan  Sayur, Jalan Ladang, Jalan Siput, Jalan  Ang

Teng  are  not included in the Gazette. I hope  the

Minister  of  State will look into the  matter  and

impose similar restrictions on the roads to which I

have referred.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Yaacob</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): I have explained

that,  as  a  result  of the  visit  of  the  Prime

Minister  to  that constituency, a  memorandum  was

sent. However, if there are new suggestions, I will

put  them  up to the authorities for consideration.

This  department  is  under  the  Prime  Minister's

Office.  The  administration of this  matter  comes

under  the  Ministry  of Defence  and  the  traffic

police,  and it is also connected with the Ministry

of  National Development, which is the Public Works

Department.

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to he allocated for Head 0401 he

reduced by $l0 in respect of subhead 1251.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this item concerns the National Service

Office,  under  the  subhead  "Executive  Officer".

National  service is supported by all the  citizens

of  Singapore.  It  is  for  the  security  of  our

country.   Therefore,  the  people   have   reacted

favourably  to  registration for national  service,

However,  some  of  the national service  personnel

have  been called for full-time training.  Some  of

them received a high salary in the past,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>



and  now  that they have been called for  full-time

service,  they  get only $60 allowance  per  month,

There  is  a  great gap between what they  received

before  and what they get now. They feel that  they

have suffered some losses. They are, therefore, not

able  to  maintain  their  families.  I  hope   the

Minister will consider increasing the allowances of

those  people who formerly had work to do  and  not

pay them just $60 allowance only.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, it was decided on the  6th  of  this

month  that  those  civil servants  who  have  been

called up to do full-time national service would be

paid  the  difference between the salary that  they

are  getting as national servicemen and the  salary

which they should get as civil servants. Therefore,

the problem does not now arise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock:</b> Sir, I would like to

withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to he allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1281.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I wish to raise here is of a technical

nature.   I   understand  that  the  Registrar   of

Societies has no powers to query the accounts of  a

registered society. It seems that the accounts of a

society is a matter to be settled among the members

of  the  society  concerned. Sir, in  reply  to  my

Motion   on   the   adjournment   on   "Undesirable

activities     of     certain    foreign-orientated

organisations  in  Singapore",  the   Minister   of

Defence  said -and I am quoting Hansard Volume  26,

No,  3  dated 8th September, 1967, col. 242,  third

paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'With regard to the other point that the hon.

Member has raised, the alleged misuse of funds will

have  to be left to the members of the organisation

themselves, .'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This being so, if a group in a society is able to

get the support of the majority



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>



of  the members, then that group may be able to  do

anything with the funds of the society. If  such  a

thing  happens, I think it would be of no  use  for

the  members in the minority to take up the  matter

with  the  relevant authorities. Can  the  Minister

look  into this matter with a view to amending  the

Societies  Act, and giving powers to the  Registrar

to  look  into the accounts of a society  at  least

when  he receives a complaint from a member of that

society?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

hon.   Member   for   Aljunied  has   misunderstood

completely the powers of the Registrar of Societies

and  also  misunderstood the passage which  he  has

quoted.  There are provisions in the Societies  Act

for  the  purpose  of  allowing  the  Registrar  of

Societies  to look into the accounts of  registered

societies.  Vide  section 19 (1) of  the  Societies

Act,  a  member of the society can file a complaint

in a District or Magistrate's Court when an officer

or  member of that society has unlawfully  withheld

any  money of the society or wilfully applied  such

money  for  purposes other than those expressed  or

directed  in  the rules of the society.  Therefore,

there  is enough provision under the Societies  Act

for  the  Registrar of Societies to  see  that  the

money of the society is legally used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the passage which he has quoted from Hansard,

I  did  use  the words "alleged misuse".  It  is  a

matter of opinion of members of the society whether

the  money of the society is being misused or  not.

There is always a difference of opinion, and if the

majority  of the members voted for the use  of  the

money  in  a  certain way, then  the  Registrar  of

Societies would rather not interfere in an internal

squabble  if the money is used legally  and  within

the confines of the objectives of the society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nowadays robbery in public places is a

common occurrence. Hooligans snatch gold chains and

other jewellery from helpless women and get away on

motor-cycles  and  bicycles. Markets,  streets  and

public parks are usually the scenes of such crimes.

Will the Minister of Defence consider strengthening

the  police  force  so as to keep such  disgraceful

crimes to a minimum?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, in the past, just as at present,

we  have  heard many hon. Members speaking  on  our

police  force. But most of the speakers have always

attacked them. But my views are different. One  may

say  that a police officer is a government  servant

and so he is expected to serve the public, like any

other civil servant. I do not deny that, but  I  am

of the opinion that a policeman runs more risk than

any other civil servant for the pay he receives.  A

policeman  on patrol duty may enjoy  a  ride  in  a

Holden  car or may be walking through the slums  in

the  early  hours of the morning. But whether  they

travel  in vehicles or go by foot, they are subject

to   risks  of  stone  throwing  and  attacks  from

gangsters  and anti-national elements. It  is  here

that  they  risk their lives. Sir, we in  Singapore

have faced many difficult periods during which  the

police  had  worked  round the  clock,  sacrificing

their off days and vacation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>



leave.  They  even had no time to look after  their

families. In many cases, they have prevented crimes

and  illegal activities instead of waiting for such

things  to  happen  and then stopping  them.  Their

motto is that prevention is better than cure.  When

there  were disturbances in some countries in  this

part  of  the  world  due  to  the  devaluation  of

Sterling which resulted in the devaluation  of  the

old  Malayan currency, there were rumours that  the

anti-national  elements  would  make  use  of  this

opportunity to create unrest here. But I think  due

to  the precautionary measures taken by the police,

nothing happened here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before criticising the police, we should

understand  the  difficult conditions  under  which

they work. One of their many problems is to get co-operation  from  the  public. During  the  colonial

days,  the police were treated with either contempt

or  fear. But after we took over the government  in

1959,  both the public and the police have realised

that  they  are friends. This has resulted  in  the

public  coming forward to give information  to  the

police and thus giving them their co-operation.  So

when  we  praise the police today, the civic-minded

public  also  have a share in it. Of  course,  Sir,

some  of  our hon. Members may have genuine grouses

against the police. But, as I have said earlier, if

we  think  of the difficult conditions under  which

they  work,  I am sure we will learn to  appreciate

them  instead  of condemning them. We should  offer

suggestions to help improve their lot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I have a remark to make under this

Head. I see on page 122 of the Estimates and at the

top  of  page  123, two headings,  namely,  "Gurkha

Contingent"   and   "Malay,  Indian   and   Chinese

Contingent".  I think these are left-overs  of  the

colonial  rule. Here I can see some  reason  for  a

separate  Gurkha  Contingent.  But  there   is   no

justification  for  a  Malay,  Indian  and  Chinese

Contingent.   When   we  say  "police"   they   are

Singaporeans.  At  this time when  we  are  talking

about abolishing associations under clan names, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>



Government  as  an  example,  should  abolish  such

headings.  Sir,  can the Minister  please  consider

this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I think it is still a

practice in the police for certain officers to have

the  services of some sort of a footman in the form

of  a constable. I think this is a left-over of the

colonial  system. In fact, wrong use is made  of  a

constable,  on  whom we have spent  a  considerable

amount of money training him to be a constable,  by

making  him  a footman. Will the Minister  consider

discontinuing  this practice and assure  the  House

that he will do so?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am really

glad  that  at  least one Member of the  House  has

noticed   the   improvement  in  the  police/public

relationship,  the  result  of  a  very   prolonged

campaign  carried  out  not  only  by  Members   of

Parliament  but  by leaders of this  Government  to

promote better police/public relationship. Also, he

has  noticed the good response from members of  the

public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reply to the Member for Anson, I think I must

dispel  the  false belief that crime is increasing.

Statistics  compiled by my Department  of  seizable

offences  have shown that they have riot increased,

and although we are pretty near the end of the year

when the New Year is about to be on us -it is usual

at  this season to expect an increase in crime -the

figure for November shows that it has dropped.  The

number  of  what is known as seizable offences  has

dropped  from  an  average of 1,250  per  month  to

1,143, and this is largely due to the police taking

preventive measures.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle against crime can be waged more

successfully  if  the public  are  alert  to  their

responsibilities  and adopt a certain  standard  of

public behaviour. I can assure the Member for Anson

that it is always in the minds of officers and  men

of  the police force to keep the crime rate down to

the minimum. It does not necessarily mean that,  by

having more officers and men, the crime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>



rate can be kept down. In this respect, I think the

attitude of the public is the most important factor

and  if  they respond, and continue to  respond  as

they are doing now, by giving more information  and

co-operation to the police, I am sure  we  will  be

able to keep down the crime rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunate that under the Budget heads we

have   names  which  connote  racial  and  communal

origins.  The Member for Aljunied is quite  correct

in  saying  that  this  is a legacy  from  colonial

times. Actually what the "Malay, Indian and Chinese

Contingent"  connotes is that  it  is  a  different

contingent  from  what  was  known  as   the   Sikh

Contingent before the war. The Sikh Contingent  was

disbanded  and  in  its place we  have  the  Gurkha

Contingent.  A  better name, of  course,  would  be

"Contingent other than the Gurkha Contingent".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I would like to thank the Member for

Aljunied  for his suggestion and I will see  to  it

that next year another name will be substituted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Choa Chu Kang, I would like

"batman".



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> It is not "Batman" of T.V.!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> No, not "Bat-man". This again is

a  condition  and  term of service  of  the  police

department and the Salaries Commission has  put  up

its  Report. So I cannot promise the Member that  I

will  deprive police officers of this condition  of

service  unless  and until I have  thoroughly  gone

into  it.  There must be a very good reason  why  a

batman  is attached to a gazetted officer,  because

he  does  relieve  the latter  from  doing  certain

things  which  will  otherwise  prevent  him   from

carrying out his work more efficiently. It  is  not

always   an  easy  thing  for  us  to  change   the

conditions and terms of service, especially when it

means  a  loss of certain privileges to the officer

concerned,  and  I would prefer  not  to  make  any

promise. I will look into the whole



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>



question thoroughly before we make any move in that

direction.

<br><br>5.19 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I seek information from the Minister as

to  the  number of posts in the Vigilante Corps  in

the  Republic, the present strength  of  Vigilante

Corps members in these posts, and how many national

servicemen  are now undergoing training  for  part-time services?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I also enquire how the Minister intends

to  make good use of the sum of $1,300,000 provided

in the 1968 Estimates for this vote?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, our Vigilante Corps is now

established  with  statutory  provisions  and   the

members  are now treated more or less like  regular

police  personnel in many respects. This is  to  be

appreciated,  Sir, but we should  not  forget  that

they  are  all volunteers except for those  members

who  are  required to do national service. When  we

consider  the  powers given to them,  I  think  the

facilities given to them are not enough if  we  are

to  be proud of their services. We should also  see

that  they are sufficiently compensated though they

are not benefited financially. For example, let  us

take  medical facilities. The Minister, in  winding

up  the  debate on the Vigilante Corps Bill, stated

that arrangements could be made to get free medical

services  for members of the Vigilante  Corps  from

private  doctors, I do not know how  far  this  has

materialised. If not, I do not think it will  be  a

burden  on  the  Government to  give  free  medical

attention  to  them  at  Government  hospitals  and

clinics.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point is that members of the Vigilante

Corps  do  not have sufficient uniforms.  Again,  I

wish  to stress that they are volunteers. They  are

civic-minded  and they want to serve their  country

during their spare time, So we should not tax them.

Connected with uniforms is the question of  laundry

expenses.  As  a uniformed service,  the  Vigilante

Corps  has  to  look smart. At least some  sort  of

allowance  should be given to cover such incidental

expenses.  I  wish to point out what  the  Minister

promised  during the debate on the  Bill.  He  said

that  he would look into the matter. So far nothing

has   happened   and  I  hope  he  will   give   an

explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in spite of many difficulties, the

management  committees  of  community  centres   in

various  constituencies are trying  their  best  to

provide  free tea, cigarettes, etc, to  members  of

the  Vigilante  Corps. But they have their  limits.

They  have  many other expenses. In  spite  of  all

these  difficulties in my constituency, I am  happy

to announce that the management committee has, with

the   help  of  MacPherson  South  C.C.C.   Section

Committee,  opened  a  Vigilante  Corps  Post  last

month. Sir, may I take this opportunity to say that

we   have  about  35  women  V.C, members  in  our

constituency? They all joined very recently and are

now undergoing training. In order to encourage more

men  and  women  to  join the  Vigilante  Corps,  I

request  the Minister to look into the question  of

providing them with the facilities I have mentioned

earlier.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The  Chairman  (Mr  Tang See  Chim)</b>:  Inche  Mohd, Ariff.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff:</b> I am not speaking, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I must congratulate the

Member  for Aljunied on helping to bring about  the

opening of a new V.C, station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vigilante Corps first started as a voluntary

organisation  during  the Indonesian  confrontation

and has done splendid work to prevent subversion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>



With the end of confrontation and the beginning  of

national service, we thought it a good idea to send

our  young  national  servicemen  to  fill  up  the

Vigilante Corps. In the Vigilante Corps itself,  as

the  spirit  of civic-consciousness and service  to

the  community is so strong, we felt that we should

not  dilute  it  by giving allowances  to  the  new

national   servicemen  in  the   Vigilante   corps.

However,  we  decided sometime last month  that  at

least  they should not be out of pocket  for  their

transport,  and now members of the Vigilante  Corps

are provided with a transport allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of the Vigilante Corps is that it should

be an organisation to help change the attitude that

has  been handed down by past generations  in  this

country,  that  is,  lack  of  civic-consciousness,

community service and standard of public behaviour.

We   hope   that  by  getting  the  young  national

servicemen into the Vigilante Corps and by training

them in discipline and service to the community, it

will  be  one of the means by which we  can  change

their  attitude to the community. As I  have  said,

since  the Vigilante Corps started with very  ideal

and unselfish motives, we do not like to dilute  it

by making it a mercenary concern,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for the information of the Member for

Mountbatten, there are 110 V.C, posts so far in the

Republic,   and  the  total  number   of   national

servicemen   undergoing  training   for   part-time

service  in  the Vigilante Corps is  2,396.  I  can

assure  him  that not only I but also the  Minister

for  Finance  will  see to  it  that  the  vote  of

$1,300,000 will be well spent and not misused.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Yeow Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Yeow Chong:</b> In view of the answer given by

the  Minister  to  this  House,  I  beg  leave   to

withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2018.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I spoke on this Head last year, I asked

for an explanation why certain Government buildings

such as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>



the  General  Post Office, etc, were not  decorated

during  National  Day.  The  previous  Minister  of

Defence  told this House that he saw  no  merit  in

decorating  Government offices on National  Day  as

the  day  would  be  a public holiday.  He  further

stated  that  the  policy of  the  Government  with

regard to last year's National Day was to move away

from  the decoration of Government offices  to  the

decoration of the town and to brighten up the  main

streets and thoroughfares where people live. Sir, I

am  still  unable to understand the logic  of  that

argument.  It is true that the public  may  not  be

visiting Government offices on business, but  I  am

sure  the  Minister will agree with me when  I  say

that  most of our citizens will be away from  their

homes  in holiday mood, and they may be around  the

Padang  and  Government offices at  Empress  Place.

Sir,  I say that it is necessary to decorate  these

buildings. These are sights which will impress  the

people  and  inculcate in them a sense of  national

pride  and  the children will find it difficult  to

forget  the  decorations and the reason  for  them.

Thus  the  young  and  old will  have  a  sense  of

national  pride  instilled in them. The  Government

normally  request  the public and organisations  to

decorate their homes and buildings. The Ministry of

Education  directs  all schools to  decorate  their

buildings. It is for the same reason that I request

the  Minister to direct all Government  departments

to  decorate  their buildings. Last  year,  Sir,  I

think  the boats in our waters were not dressed  up

as  expected.  I  hope in the  following  year  the

Marine Department will take the necessary steps  to

see  that  vessels are dressed up. In  addition,  I

would suggest that the department make arrangements

with masters of boats to have their sirens blown at

a particular time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have come across a certain Government

building flying our national flag at half-mast!  Of

course, no one would have done it deliberately, but

I  would request the Minister to issue circulars to

all  departments that they take care  to  see  that

their flags are properly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>



hoisted.  This may be a small matter but it  is  in

respect of such matters that we can instil a  sense

of national pride in our people.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are not spending a small amount on our

National  Day  celebration. With a  large  sum  and

careful planning we can succeed in two aims; first,

celebrating  our  National  Day  grandly;   second,

cultivating  a  sense of national pride  among  our

people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, if the Member for Aljunied

is  in charge of finance, he will see the logic  of

what  my predecessor has said. It is a question  of

priority,  whether we should decorate the buildings

at  the  expense of decorating the streets and  the

roads.  Therefore, with the limited  funds  at  our

disposal,  it is up to those who are in  charge  to

see  which is more preferable, whether to  decorate

the  buildings with lights and bunting, or to  have

the   streets,   including  the  fields   and   the

roundabouts, lined with flags.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as to the Member's other point. I will give

instructions to my Ministry to see that  the  flags

are  properly hoisted and not at half-mast, as  the

Member said he saw last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the proposal for sounding the

ships' sirens, here I beg to differ from him. I  do

not  think  that in the middle of the National  Day

celebration the public of Singapore would  like  to

hear  howling  sirens all around them,  because  it

might remind some of us of the unhappy days through

which we have come.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2103.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, will the Minister inform the House what is

the  use of this sum of money and who benefits from

it?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, this is a provision to meet

the  cost  of free education for the Commissioner's

rank and file cadets, a scheme which was started in

1953  to prepare suitably qualified members of  the

rank and file for promotion to the inspectorate  by

providing  a course of instruction leading  to  the

Cambridge School Certificate Examination after five

years'   study.   This  scheme  was   fundamentally

designed  to increase the number of Malay  officers

in the Force in order to maintain a fair balance in

the  inspectorate  in proportion  to  the  existing

racial ratio in the rank and file, The total annual

graduateship is not to exceed 50 and the Cadets are

entitled to free education, books and fees for  the

Cambridge   School  Certificate  Examination.   The

provision for the current year is $27,920  and  for

1968 the provision is $25,000.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>5.35 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this provision is for "Barrack Conservancy

and Maintenance of Compounds". I would like to draw

the  attention  of the Minister of Defence  to  the

police  barracks at Jalan Eunos -the black building

-which  appears  to  me  no  longer  suitable   for

habitation for the police. The Minister for  Social

Affairs  bore  witness  to  this  when  he  visited

Kampong  Kembangan. So I would request the Minister

of  Defence  to  give the policemen  more  suitable

accommodation, such as flats, or to  construct  new

barracks  in the area, because the present  barrack

at Kaki Bukit, which is called the "black barrack",

is no longer suitable for the policemen.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is

now  looking  into the question of  whether  it  is

feasible  and  worth  while  economically  to  make

structural  alterations to the  barracks  at  Jalan

Eunos. It is only after the result of that study is

made known that we will decide whether to carry  on

with  the  alterations or to pull down the barracks

and  build  new  ones elsewhere. I can  assure  the

Member that the welfare of the officers, especially

the police, is always uppermost in our minds and we

will  see to it that suitable quarters are provided

for officers and men of the police force as far  as

possible.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): With that

explanation, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can the Minister explain to whom these leave

passages  and  rail fares are given? Also,  why  is

there an increase of about $55,000?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I remember in

the  debate which took place a few days ago on  the

supplementary   budget,  the   Back-benchers   were

accusing   the   Ministry   of   Finance   of   not

anticipating expenditure that could be incurred and

of  not being exact in their forecast. Now in  this

respect  here, we have been able to  work  out  the

expenditure carefully and we find that  we  require

an increase of $55,000 for passages and rail fares,

because  there  is going to be an increase  in  the

number of officers and men of the Gurkha Contingent

who  will  be going on leave this year.  Therefore,

the provision is for the officers, men and families

of  the Gurkha Contingent to take their leave  that

is due to them.

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced  by  $10 in respect of item (2) of  subhead

2130.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, under this item we can see that next

year  the vote for prisoners in respect of  rations

will  be less than the vote for this year. Does  it

mean   that   the   treatment  of  prisoners   will

deteriorate next year, or does it mean  that  there

will  be  less  prisoners next year,  or  does  the

Minister  anticipate my reduction in the prices  of

rations? Or are there any other reasons?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I must explain

that  the  provision here is not for the supply  of

rations  to prisoners but the supply of rations  to

persons  who  are  being  detained  by  the  police

pending  investigation. I  assure  the  Member  for

Bukit  Merah  that  the  rations  for  people  held

pending  investigation and prisoners are prescribed

by medical as well as nutritional experts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): If that is so, why

call them prisoners?



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> If the Member for Bukit Merah

wants  to  be precise, he has got a point there.  I

agree that the correct interpretation of it is that

they  are  not  prisoners  but  just  people  under

detention.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Minister, if I may draw from my

own  knowledge?  This  is  rather  historical.   In

Victorian  times all persons arrested  were  called

"prisoners".  Today, of course,  we  use  the  word

"prisoner"  only  to  describe a  convicted  person

serving a term of imprisonment.

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 2133.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a few schools in my constituency need the

services  of  school  crossing  patrols.  Can   the

Minister   explain  the  procedure  to  get   these

services?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am quite

surprised  that  the Member for Aljunied  does  not

know   the  procedure  for  application  of  school

crossing patrols. For his information, normally  it

is  the  Principal  of  the school  who  makes  the

application  to the police who, if they  find  that

there is a case for a school crossing patrol,  will

give   approval  for  the  school  to  engage  such

patrols.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Speaker, Sir, with so many members

of   the   public  coming  forward  to  serve   the

community,  I  am  hoping that  the  teachers  will

follow suit and respond to the growing awareness of

community   service  and  civic  consciousness   by

offering themselves to guide school children across

the  road,  instead of expecting the Government  to

spend  money  on  providing these patrols.  I  look

forward to seeing some positive action taken by the

teachers in this direction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Sir, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, members of the People's Defence Force are

now  given  about 3« months' holiday. They  are  to

report  for  duty on or about 15th March,  1968.  I

understand that the reason for such a long vacation

is   that  arrangements  are  being  made   for   a

reorganisation of the P.D.F. Sir, I welcome such  a

reorganisation and I am sure that, like me, Members

of the House will be very happy to know the details

of the proposed reorganisation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>



Can the Minister give an elaborate account of

it?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sir, I understand that after the

reorganisation,  volunteers  will  be  called   for

training only twice a month and not twice a week as

at  present. At a time when the Government want our

people,  especially the young people, to be  rugged

and  tough,  does the Minister think that  training

given  twice  a  month will make them  acquire  the

quality  needed? Will training given twice a  month

make a man a good soldier? I hope the Minister will

give a satisfactory answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope that

the  Member  for  Aljunied, in  his  desire  to  be

trained  more than twice a month, is not  motivated

by the allowance provided for members of the P.D.F.

while under training! I can assure him that we will

not  deviate from our objective of making our young

people rugged. Therefore, in the training programme

that  we will be drawing up for the P.D.F., whether

it  be  two or three times a month or even  once  a

month,  we  will see to it that it will  tax  their

physical endurance to the utmost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the reorganisation of the P.D.F., the

intention  -and I think it is known to  members  of

the  P.D.F.  -is that national conscripts  are  now

being  transferred to the P.D.F. With  the  present

organisation in the P.D.F., it is not  possible  to

give  the  requisite  training  to  the  continuous

intake  of national servicemen. Therefore,  it  has

been  decided  to  give the  P.D.F, a  3«  months'

holiday, so that the full-time instructors  in  the

P.D.F, can now attend a course to enable  them  to

undertake the training of the P.D.F, which will now

include national servicemen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, the idea is that the P.D.F, will now be

reorganised  into  battalions  and  will  be  given

requisite training which we think will enable  them

to  better  assist in the defence of  the  country.

Beyond that, Mr Speaker, Sir, I will not go.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Boo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3091.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Work Brigade has been set up for

quite  some  time.  Normally  before  any  work  is

allotted  to them to carry out, it has to have  the

approval of the Urban and Rural Services Committee.

But  that  usually takes several years!  And  after

approval is given, it will take two or three  years

before  the  work  is  actually  carried  out.   So

efficiency is reduced. Generally speaking,  if  the

work projects are minor ones, they should have been

carried  out by the Member of Parliament  concerned

after  consultation with the relevant  authorities,

including the Singapore Work Brigade. But it is not

so.  So  I hope the Minister will pay attention  to

this and give an explanation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that the provision for 1968 has been

reduced  by more than $1 million. Can the  Minister

explain this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore

Work  Brigade was first set up to give those  young

school  leavers  who  could  not  find  work   some

training,  skill and discipline, so that once  they

get  any  work they would fit in more  easily.  But

with  national  service,  it  is  found  that   the

necessary training and discipline can be  given  in

the   various  bodies  into  which  these  national

servicemen  are directed. Therefore, the  Singapore

Work Brigade is being run down; hence the reduction

of more than $1 million this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of allowing the Work

Brigade  to  undertake certain work for Members  of

Parliament  to  improve the minor  works  in  their

constituencies, while this is desirable, it is also

important  for Members of Parliament to  understand

that  there must be centralised control. There must

also  be control of finances, because all this work

entails finances. And if work projects in the rural

areas  or  constituencies are  not  directed  by  a

single body, there would be duplication and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>



chaos,  and  certain  constituencies,  through  the

influence of their Members of Parliament, and  with

cajoling, persuasion and other means, would be able

to  get more than their just share. Where the  work

is  really  urgent, I think Members  of  Parliament

could  easily approach the U.R.S.C., and I am  sure

that the U.R.S.C, would approve the project and get

it done in double-quick time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Boo</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I beg leave

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following amendment stood in the name of Mr

S. V. Lingam -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(15) That the sum to be allocated for Head 0401

be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 3161.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (16)*. Mr Ho See Beng.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Amendment (16). which also stood in the names of Mr. Teong Eng Siong and Madam Chan Choy Siong, reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0401 be reduced by $100.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to seek

your  permission to speak on both the Heads, M.I.D.

and  Immigration. Since my name has been  put  down

for  this  amendment, together with  the  names  of

Madam  Chan Choy Siong (Member for Delta), and  Mr

Teong  Eng Siong (Member for Sembawang),  I  wonder

whether  you  will allow me to speak on Immigration

instead of the M.I.D, as a whole.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, I am afraid I cannot do

that.  But  I am sure the consideration  which  you

give  to  Mr Teong and Madam Chan under the  head,

Ministry of Interior and Defence, will in  turn  be

given  by  them to you when we come  to  the  head,

Immigration.  In  other words, if  you  treat  them

kindly now, they will treat you kindly later.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have, in

fact,  made this mutual arrangement with the Member

for Sembawang. But I do not know whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>



the  Member  for  Delta  will  agree  to  such   an

arrangement,  so that when we come  to  Head  0402,

Immigration, I will withdraw my amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The point now is this: under

amendment (16) you can direct your remarks  to  the

whole  of  the  Ministry  other  than  Immigration,

because that comes under a separate head. But if we

save  time now, we will have more time later.  That

is the point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I agree with your suggestion,

Mr Speaker. Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0401

be reduced by $100,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to speak in Mandarin,



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

last  year  in this House I spoke on the debate  on

the  Budget then presented. At that time  I  raised

the  question of immigration, namely,  citizens  of

Singapore  who  applied  for  the  entry  of  their

parents  into  Singapore. At that time  Immigration

was  under  the  jurisdiction of the  Deputy  Prime

Minister  and  I remember that he then  agreed  and

promised  that if citizens of Singapore  wanted  to

apply for their parents to come to Singapore -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, Mr Ho. Perhaps I did not

make  myself  clear.  If  you  want  to  speak   on

Immigration, I suggest you wait for the next  head.

I   will  call  Mr  Teong  and  Madam  Chan  under

amendment (16) .



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> In that case, Mr Speaker, Sir,

I am not speaking on my amendment on the M.I.D.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Teong, amendment (16) under

Head  0401.  Mr Teong, are you going to  speak  in

Tamil?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I hope in

future I will be able to speak in Tamil. Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head 0401

be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Defence in the past one year has

done  much to build up our armed forces and  expand

the   police  force.  The  sum  allotted  for  this

Ministry is about $100 million. It is quite a large

sum and is a great deal more than what was allotted

for  1967.  In the circumstances, I feel that  this

amount is necessary to match the present conditions

of  Singapore. I feel that the defence  forces  and

the  police are necessary for the protection of the

lives   and   property  of  the  people   and   the

maintenance  of law and order in our country,  Ours

is  a  very small country. Our population is  small

and  we  do  not have much money to  spend  on  the

building up of our armed forces. Therefore, we have

the  national service scheme to enable young people

to  join  these forces. On the one hand, this  will

lessen our economic burden. On the other hand, this

will   enable  our  youngsters  to  take  up  their

responsibility of national defence and  service  to

the  country. This scheme was implemented in  March

this  year. It is supported by people in all  walks

of life in spite of the opposition by anti-national

elements  to  whom nobody pays any attention,  This

move   to  take  up  national  service  is  a  very

patriotic act and should have our praise. Sir, ours

is  a non-Communist, democratic, socialist country.

Ours is a country which looks after the welfare  of

all  the people. So the aim of the armed forces  is

to  inculcate  in  the minds of their  members  the

spirit  and  consciousness to defend  the  country.

Therefore,  the  Defence Ministry  issued  sometime

this  year  a code of conduct to the armed  forces.

This  is  a  very good thing and I  hope  that  all

personnel will abide by this code.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have two suggestions to make to the

Minister  of  Defence.  I hope  he  will  pay  very

careful  attention to what I am going  to  say.  He

must not misunderstand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>



my suggestions and give me answers which  are

not  what  I have asked for, or to give me  answers

which  I  do  not expect. The first  suggestion  is

about  the spirit of unity of our people. Based  on

this  principle,  we must improve the  relationship

between  the police and the public. In the colonial

era  and  also under the Lim Yew Hock  regime,  the

police represented an instrument for suppression of

the  people.  But  now we are  an  independent  and

democratic country. Therefore, the police  must  in

their dealings with the people behave well in order

to  make  the  people  know  that  they  are  their

protectors. In the past, the police had to  conduct

certain  campaigns such as, "Be together  with  the

people". These campaigns were meant to improve  the

relationship between the police and the  public.  I

think  they  are  very  meaningful  and  should  be

encouraged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second suggestion is that women should also

take  up  national  service,  because  ours  is  an

egalitarian  society.  Therefore,  they  should  be

allowed to join the armed forces. They have put  up

a very good show in the People's Defence Force, the

police and the Vigilante Corps.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  we  have  heard  a lot from  the  Member  for

Sembawang  urging other people to  join  the  armed

forces but he himself has not volunteered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about defence, there is something which

we  should  recognise, i.e.,  the  independence  of

Singapore.  After the British military  withdrawal,

we  still cannot completely change the concept that

Singapore  is  a  military base.  The  position  of

Singapore  after  independence is  still  of  great

strategic   importance.  So   the   importance   of

Singapore,  other than in trade and commerce,  lies

in its ability to defend itself against any foreign

control  or  invasion. Some  people  say  that  the

progress  of  armament nowadays, the  technique  of

military strategy and form of military warfare have

undergone so great a revolution that the defence of

our  country has become unnecessary. But ever since

ancient times there has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>



been an immutable principle, i.e., people will have

to  defend their country and armaments are meant to

protect  the  country against  foreign  control  or

invasion.  Arms alone are not sufficient to  occupy

others'  territories, Our country is still suitable

as  a naval base, Without defence forces, we cannot

become  an independent country. We may not be  able

to  protect our people as an independent people, to

enjoy freedom and to exist as a people. The defence

programmes   have  been  aimed  at  our  protection

against foreign invasion and the protection of  our

sovereignty and territorial integrity. In  view  of

this,  it  is necessary to continue to develop  our

defence  preparedness.  Based  on  this  principle,

while we are developing our economy, we should also

develop   our  military  capacity.  This  is   also

important  at  the present juncture. Therefore,  to

develop our defence capacity, we must pay attention

to  the  study  of military armaments  of  advanced

countries,  coupled with science in the development

of  the economy, so that scientific development and

military  development can both be used  to  achieve

the  greatest benefit to the country.  These  three

kinds   of  development  -economic,  military   and

scientific  -will make a country strong. Therefore,

Singapore   should   also  develop   its   military

capacity. Although the British military forces will

be  withdrawn, we will have to consider whether our

military strength is able to protect us against any

foreign invasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Minister can give an assurance in

this  House  so as to ensure that we are  going  to

protect our people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, I can assure the hon.

Member for Delta that our teeth are growing!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the Member for Sembawang

was  in  the  Chamber when the Member for  Aljunied

spoke    on    the    question   of   police/public

relationship.  If  not,  I would  suggest  that  he

exchange notes with the Member for Aljunied and  he

will see the other side of the picture. He will  be

aware also that there has been a great improvement



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>



in  police/public relationship, due largely to  the

training that we are giving to our officers and men

in  the  Police  Training School.  The  public  has

responded readily to this change of attitude of the

police and has come forward with information  which

has greatly helped the police in maintaining peace,

order and the suppression of crime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our desire, of course, to have women

conscripted  and  directed  to  the  various  youth

movements that we have, Unfortunately, Mr Speaker,

Sir, it is just not a question of conscripting, but

having  conscripted such a large number of persons,

they must be trained, and that is where the bottle-neck  is.  We do not have sufficient men  or  women

instructors  to  train  them.  Therefore,  at   the

moment, except for those in the Vigilante Corps and

a  few  in  the Special Constabulary,  we  are  not

conscripting women. But later on perhaps,  when  we

have enough instructors, we will probably conscript

women into the services.

<hr size="2" noshade>

* The  same amendment also stood in the  name  of Madam Chan Choy Siong.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand many of our

citizens  who have applied for the entry  of  their

aged   parents   into  Singapore  have   not   been

successful.  I  also  understand  most   of   these

applicants   are  reasonably  well  off   and   the

supporting  of one or two over-aged parents  is  no

problem  to them. In fact, many of these applicants

have been and are still sending money regularly  to

their parents



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>



overseas. If their parents are allowed to come  in,

it will save us foreign exchange.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the Minister consider modifying the

immigration   regulations  to  allow   these   aged

parents,  who  will not jeopardise our  economy  or

security in any way, to enter Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong:</b> I am not speaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now I have

mentioned this item regarding immigration and I say

that formerly it came under the jurisdiction of the

Deputy Prime Minister. Last year, during the Budget

debate  in  which  I  took part,  I  was  given  an

assurance by him that the applications of Singapore

citizens  who  desire their parents  to  come  into

Singapore would be considered only if such  parents

are above 60 or 65 years old. At the same time,  he

also  said that the applicants must have sufficient

means  to  maintain their aged parents coming  into

Singapore  so  that  Singapore  will  not  have  an

additional social burden. These statements  by  the

Deputy Prime Minister appear in Hansard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year I have received certain complaints from

my  constituents, One person complained  about  his

application regarding his old mother in  Hong  Kong

whose  daughter  is married, According  to  Chinese

tradition,  the wife follows the husband.  In  this

instance,  the  daughter is unable to  support  her

mother.  But  this  old lady's  only  son,  who  is

running  a shop in Singapore, has enough  means  to

support her. Several applications have been made to

the  Immigration Department for the entry  of  this

old  lady  into Singapore, but I do  not  know  why

approval  has  not  been  granted.  In  fact,   the

application   was   rejected  by  the   Immigration

Department and no reason was given. This is  really

incomprehensible.  There  is  perhaps  a   lot   of

bureaucracy in the Immigration Department. This old

lady  in Hong Kong i5 now 83 years old. It is  rare

for  a person to live up to the age of 70, but this

old lady has already exceeded the age of 80. So  if

the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>



will allow her to enter Singapore. I think she

will have only a limited number of days in which to

enjoy  life in our country. It is my hope that  the

Government     will     consider     such     cases

sympathetically. The people elect us for their  own

interest,  They  do  not elect  us  to  cause  them

trouble  or  difficulties as a  result  of  passing

restrictive laws. We should not pass such  laws  on

the  people who elect us. We must be consistent  in

whatever  we do. Mr Speaker, Sir, if you  are,  or

any Minister is, in the applicant's shoes, I do not

know how you or the Minister will feel about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government will sympathetically

consider the case of this old lady and allow her to

enter  Singapore  so  that  her  son  here  can  be

reunited  with  her. I am sure they  will  be  very

grateful  -and  I  too  will be  grateful  -to  the

Minister,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(In English)</i>: If I may go on in English -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, there is a Standing Order

against  changing  languages  half-way  through   a

speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am quite

aware of the Standing Order that does not allow  me

to switch from one language to another. But in view

of  the  fact  that you have not been  very  strict

about  it, I crave your indulgence to allow  me  to

quote another instance in English.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> What about a Tamil translation?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Ho, I am afraid I cannot allow

that. Mr Ho, you cannot say I have not been strict

about this Standing Order because, in fact, this is

the  first  occasion an hon. Member has  sought  to

switch  from  one language to another midway  in  a

speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> In which case, I will continue

talking in Mandarin to the best of my ability.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Unrehearsed!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): This is the

behaviour of the Government. If the Government  can

allow  a strip-teaser to come into Singapore for  a

low-brow  type of performance, why is it  that  the

Government  cannot allow an old lady to  come  into

Singapore to be reunited with her son here? If this

is  the  policy of the Government, then I can  only

say  that the sooner it is given up, the better for

us.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> Sir, on a point of

clarification. The Member for Bras Basah  has  said

that  the Government allows entertainment of a  low

taste  amounting almost to vulgarity and  does  not

allow  an  old  man or an old woman  to  come  into

Singapore. May I clarify? Perhaps I can  take  this

up at a later stage when the Ministry of Culture is

involved?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I think that will be more

appropriate, Mr Fong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I heard with interest the speech made by  the

Member   for  Bras  Basah  and  I  have  the   same

sympathetic  feelings  for our  citizens  who  have

parents  in  China,  India or other  countries.  We

should consider their applications sympathetically.

If  the  parents of our citizens are over 65  years

old,  we  should give them a chance  to  come  into

Singapore.  I  do not want to dwell any  longer  on

this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to refer now to the complaints against the

staff  of  the  Immigration  Department  for  being

discourteous  to the public. They come  into  close

contact with people from all over the world. It  is

important that they should be courteous because the

tourists who come to Singapore will then be able to

tell the world at large about the courteous service

accorded  to  them in Singapore. So  if  they  give

courteous  and  efficient service to  tourists,  we

will  then  have  a good reputation.  If  they  are

indifferent   or   rude,  that  will   damage   our

international reputation. This courtesy accorded to

tourists  must also be extended to our own  people.

If the staff of the Immigration Department cannot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>



treat  the  people well, they cannot  treat  others

well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the next point is about the

strict  regulations on travellers. Many  travellers

from  abroad come to Singapore for a stay of  about

three   months  and  sometimes  they  ask  for   an

extension of stay of two or three months. They have

their sponsors in Singapore. So we should give them

every facility and grant them an extension of  stay

in  Singapore because they come here to spend money

and   this   benefits  our  country.  I  hope   the

Immigration Department will consider this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the two points I wish to bring to the

notice of the Minister.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, since the previous two Members have spoken  on

this  amendment,  I  am taking the  opportunity  of

joining  in  the debate so that I do  not  have  to

speak on Head 0402.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am in full agreement with the

points raised by the Member for Bras Basah. We know

that  in  the  past  immigration restrictions  were

imposed for sound reasons. The age limit was  fixed

with regard to factors prevailing in the past.  Now

that  Singapore is independent and there is a sense

of  loyalty  to the Republic among the  people,  we

should  not ignore the fact that our citizens  long

nostalgically for their parents in China or  India.

In   order  to  ensure  that  they  are   able   to

concentrate  their attention on their  business  in

Singapore,  I  feel we should change  the  outdated

regulations and restrictions particularly affecting

people  who are more than 65 years old.  This  will

strengthen the sentimental links of our people with

their old folks in foreign countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our citizens have parents abroad, they usually

remit   money  to  them  on  which  there   is   no

limitation.  If  they also have  relatives  abroad,

then  they  have  to remit more  money.  This  will

invariably affect and drain our national income. If

our  citizens can be reunited with their  families,

they  will  incur less expenditure as they  do  not

have to make large remittances abroad.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point of view is for humanitarian

reasons.  Filial  piety  is  something  we   should

consider and this is also a point of morality.  All

of  us  would  like  members of the  family  to  be

united. So if we try to separate the members of the

same  family by our strict laws, it will be  rather

inhuman. And if we stipulate that old folks must be

above  the  age of 65 before they can be considered

for  entry  into  our  country,  then  this  is  an

unreasonable  condition. Normally when  they  reach

the  age  of 65, they may not be healthy enough  to

come to Singapore, and even if they should come,  I

am afraid they may die soon after their arrival; in

which  case their families here will have to  spend

money on their coffins. The other question is  that

while  Singapore is now reclaiming land, the  space

taken up by these coffins meant for these old folks

from  abroad will give rise to a shortage of  land.

This ill be another drain on our limited resources,

which is land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So from these various points of view, I feel that

the present regulations controlling immigration are

not quite proper. We should reduce the age limit of

65  so as to enable more people to come in, so that

they  can have more years with their families here.

I   hope   the  Government  will  give  sympathetic

consideration to my suggestion. I hope all families

affected by these regulations will be comforted  by

the new Government policy on this subject.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chum:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

only  two points I wish to bring up in this debate.

The  first point has already been touched on by the

Member  for Sembawang, that is, tourism  and  visas

for  tourists.  The second point  is  about  travel

documents  for our residents holding blue  identity

cards,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of tourism, I think there is some

contradiction  between  the  Government  department

responsible   for   tourism  and  the   Immigration

Department, If it is our intention to attract



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



tourists, we cannot be too choosey about  them.  We

cannot ask them to wait for a long time for a  visa

before  we allow them to land in Singapore. But  it

would  appear  that our Immigration  Department  is

still  very  strict with regard to tourists  and  I

have heard of instances where a tourist had to wait

for  weeks,  if not months, before he could  get  a

tourist visa. As far as I can see, if a tourist has

the  proper travel documents with a return  air  or

sea  ticket, and the necessary travellers'  cheques

to  support him during his stay here, I think  that

should be good enough and he could be issued with a

tourist visa on the spot. But this does not seem to

be  the  policy here. I do not think we can  impose

very strict conditions on the one hand while trying

to attract tourists on the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second question, I think a lot of our

residents  with  blue  identity  cards  are  in   a

dilemma. They will not be issued with travel papers

by  the Immigration Department unless, according to

the   Immigration  Department,  these  people   can

produce  certificates to the effect that  they  are

stateless. Many of our residents who are holders of

blue  identity  cards are from West  Malaysia;  and

when  they go to the Malaysian High Commission  for

such  a certificate, they are issued with some sort

of  a cyclostyled letter stating that they are non-citizens  of  Malaysia  and  are,  therefore,   not

entitled  to  a  passport. But this  paper  is  not

accepted  by  the  Immigration  Department   as   a

certificate    of    their    statelessness,    and

consequently this Department refuse to  issue  them

with travel documents. There are many instances  of

a blue Singapore identity card holder wanting to go

back to West Malaysia to visit his aged mother  who

is  dying or very sick, and yet he could not do  so

simply  because  we  do  not  issue  him  with  the

necessary travel papers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is a rather difficult state of

affairs  for  the  blue identity card  holder,  and

should be corrected. As I see it, the travel paper,

i.e., the Certificate of Identity, has a very clear

note  saying  that it is issued for the convenience

of the holder to travel and in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



no  way prejudices his national status. And if  the

Immigration  Department want to be  satisfied  with

his   stateless-ness,   I   suppose   a   statutory

declaration  by  himself should  suffice.  Can  the

Minister look into this matter?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in the example

quoted by the Member for Bras Basah in Mandarin and

the  Member for Choa Chu Kang with respect  to  the

difficulty of getting a tourist visa, I would  like

to  say  only  this: one swallow does  not  make  a

summer.  These are exceptions to the  rule  and  we

have  certain rules and regulations which are  very

necessary for an orderly society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the applications for entry and

admission  of  aged  parents of Singapore  citizens

into Singapore, if they conform to these rules  and

regulations, I do not see any difficulty in  giving

them  permission to come in. It is  only  in  cases

where   they   do  not  conform  that   all   these

difficulties arise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as we know, there has been no difficulty

at  all  for tourists to obtain visas in Singapore.

In  fact,  we  have made it easier  by  making  the

following provision. We are extending the length of

time  that  air passengers can remain in  Singapore

without  a  visa  - from 48 to 96  hours.  In  other

words, anyone who visits Singapore by air can  stay

in Singapore for up to 96 hours without a visa.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the proposal of the Member for

Delta  to reduce the age is a problem which I think

has  been  considered. One must remember that  once

the  age limit is lowered, there may be a flood  of

people  coming  into  Singapore  on  this  pretext.

Though  our economy is improving and expanding,  we

are  not out of the woods yet, and it would not  do

for  us  at  this  moment to  carry  a  very  large

proportion of the population who bring no  economic

benefit  at  all  to  us. I think  Members  of  the

Government and also the civil service have the same

humanitarian    feeling   as   the   Back-benchers,

especially  the Member for Bras Basah  -we  are  as

touched  as  he is by the fate of these people  who

would like to be reunited with their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



parents. But there are certain considerations of  a

larger issue which we must have in mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One point here which I do not understand is all

this  talk  about filial piety and filial  duty  at

this time when during the last few years it was  so

easy for parents to come in, and suddenly there  is

now  talk of filial piety and filial duty. This  is

something  which  I cannot understand  at  all.  In

drawing  up our rules and regulations for admission

of   aged   parents  here,  we   have   taken   the

humanitarian aspect into consideration,  and  I  do

not  think  we  can further relax it without  undue

harm to our rate of progress in the economic field.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of certificates of

identity  for holders of blue identity  cards,  the

matter  is being looked into. I will not  make  any

commitment  just now. We understand  the  invidious

position  in  which these people are  put,  and  we

shall try to do our best to see that they are given

travel  facilities  without in any  way  committing

ourselves to being responsible for them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister

immigration regulations or not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this matter

was  carefully considered and some amendments  were

make it easier for people to come in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your permission, I wish in the course

of  my  debate  to  touch on Amendment  (2)*  which

stands  in  my name in respect of subhead  1201.  I

notice  that  several overseas missions  have  been

established  and  are headed by High  Commissioners

and Ambassadors, Against their designations are the

salary   codes  and  their  grades.  Sir,   it   is

interesting  to note that we have different  grades

of  High  Commissioners and  Ambassadors,  Just  to

quote,  Sir, the High Commissioner in Kuala  Lumpur

is  Grade  III, salary code 1-4. In New  York,  the

Ambassador    holds   the   rank   of    Ambassador

Extraordinary  and Plenipotentiary, Grade  II.  The

High  Commissioner in London is Grade II. I can  go

on  drawing examples of the same, and we then  come

to Hong Kong where the High Commissioner's grade is

IV.  Sir,  I  shall be extremely  grateful  if  the

Minister for Foreign Affairs will explain  this  to

the House.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Amendment (2) reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 0501 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1201.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also been informed that some of our

foreign  missions  are housed in  fiats.  In  other

words,  the fiat serves both as the office and  the

residence   of   the   Ambassador   or   the   High

Commissioner.  Sir,  in  this  respect,  will   the

Foreign Minister state the number of missions which

have proper offices and accommodation?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now come to Amendment (2) standing in my name

regarding  subhead  1201. Sir, under  this  subhead

"Locally-recruited Staff", I take it that the staff

have been recruited locally. In this case it is  in

London. If one goes down the list one comes  across

"Confidential Secretary". This is the post  I  wish

to  enquire  about. I take it that  the  office  of

Confidential  Secretary is  filled  by  a  locally-recruited  officer  in  the  U.K.  If  I   remember

correctly,   going  through  the   other   overseas

missions,  I do not see any Confidential  Secretary

who  has been recruited locally. There is none,  in

fact. I just want to know what sort of confidential

secretarial  work  this Confidential  Secretary  is

doing  and, if it is so confidential in  nature,  I

think  we  should  rather have our  own  home-based

staff than a person recruited locally.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, first, in regard to the

grading  of  Ambassadors  and  High  Commissioners.

There are in all three grades -I, II and III. Grade

I  is really the Permanent Secretary, and the other

two,  the Ambassadors and High Commissioners,  come

within  either  of these two grades  -Grade  II  or

Grade III. This grading is done partly on the basis

of the importance for us of the particular mission,

or  it may be on the basis of the person concerned,

because  some  of  the appointments  are  political

appointments.  So  it  is on this  basis  that  the

grading  of  the  respective  Ambassadors  or  High

Commissioners is done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to housing, finding houses and

chancelleries   for   our   respective    missions,

especially  by  a  government, is a  very  delicate

affair because when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



people know that the Singapore Government is  going

to  buy a house or a chancellery, prices tend to be

higher.    It    involves   long   and   protracted

negotiations.  But, by and large, in  most  of  our

missions we have managed to purchase residences and

chancelleries.  I  think  the  exception   is   the

particular  case the hon. Member has in mind,  that

is,  in London where the High Commissioner uses his

fiat  as  his office and residence. This is  partly

because  we  are  still considering an  appropriate

residence  for the High Commissioner. This  is  not

unusual, Sir, because I think, in Washington we are

doing the same. For example, in Washington we  took

over  from  another well-established mission  which

had  been conducting its business in a hotel suite.

If  you  want  to  go  for prestige  regardless  of

expense,  then,  of course, you can  buy  the  most

expensive house and the most expensive chancellery.

So  it is because of this that in one or two places

the  matter has not been resolved. But in the  case

of  London  we  have got a house in mind.  We  have

purchased  it  and we are considering  how  we  can

renovate  and  decorate it so that  the  Ambassador

will  have  a  house.  We  have  also  purchased  a

chancellery  which  is  in  the  process  of  being

renovated  for  him to move into, and  it  will  be

ready as soon as possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the third point -Confidential

Secretary  -yes,  she is a locally-recruited  staff

member  but  she  also happens to  be  a  Malaysian

citizen. I think she has had long connections  with

Singapore  too, and she has been in  this  job  for

quite  some time because this is part of our  trade

section.   As   far  as  I  know,  the  designation

"Confidential Secretary" is the old one for a grade

of  officer  higher than a stenographer  but  lower

than  a  Personal Assistant. So maybe next time  we

will take great care to change the name of the post

and  that might satisfy the hon. Member. It is true

that  like  all  secretarial  work,  this  post  of

"Confidential Secretary"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>



does  involve  certain confidential  correspondence

and  files.  But if it is very highly  confidential

and  is  of a nature which we do not want  to  pass

through  the  hands  of  a  non-citizen,  then,  of

course,  we  will  consider employing  a  Singapore

citizen.  But considering the kind of work  she  is

involved in, and the fact that she has been on  the

job  for  a long time, there is nothing unusual  in

her  continuing  with her present job  without  any

major  disaster to Singapore. In fact, I understand

that  the designation of this post might be changed

to Information Assistant, and I do not know whether

that would satisfy the hon. Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, taking one

point from the Hon. Minister's reply regarding  the

grades,  I would think that in the Estimates  there

is  always such a thing as probable un-expenditure.

Why  not have a proper uniform grade, and where  an

Ambassador has been appointed part-time I think  he

should draw a part-time salary? Is it correct? I am

not quite satisfied with the answer and I will take

a vote on that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this item refers to the Singapore High

Commission  in Johore Bahru. Johore Bahru  is  only

about  16  miles from our General Post Office.  And

there is one High Commission in the centre of  West

Malaysia.  In view of the proximity, I think  there

should  be  some  good reason for  establishing  an

office  at  a place which is only a few yards  away

from  our  border. Sir, I would like  to  know  the

special reasons for opening up an office at  Johore

Bahru  and any particular service this office would

such  a Commission set up in Johore Bahru which  is

by  the Causeway. I would like to believe that  the

primary purpose of setting up this Commission is to

iron  out  the  difficulties  encountered  by   our

citizens  who  travel  to  West  Malaysia  on   the

restricted  passports. I may be wrong, and  I  hope

the Hon. Foreign Minister will explain fully on the

setting  up  of such a small Commission  in  Johore

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Sir, I wish to seek

information  from the Minister as to the  functions

and  scope of this Commission and when it  will  be

set up in Johore Bahru.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first of all,

this diplomatic post is being considered for Johore

and it will be a Commission. The fact is that there

have   been   certain  difficulties  arising   from

applications  for  visas by Singapore  citizens  in

Malaysia who, if they are living in Johore or South

Malaya, have to go all the way to Kuala Lumpur.  We

have occasions when some of our citizens from right

across   the  other  side  of  the  Causeway   look

wistfully across to Singapore but they cannot  come

in  without proper travel papers. We feel, in  case

there  are such problems, this diplomatic  post  in

Johore Bahru will facilitate travel for some of our

own citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, it is also for tourists who might have

come  down to Johore Bahru or the Johore  area  who

have  to get visas from Kuala Lumpur. So if we have

an  office in Johore Bahru which will be under  the

control  of  the  Kuala Lumpur High  Commission,  I

think  it  might facilitate matters  both  for  the

tourists  and our citizens. Of course,  it  is  all

subject  to  our clearing these matters with  Kuala

Lumpur. In fact, the intention is not to set up  an

office immediately. It is intended to have an  E.O.

or  a Third Secretary who will be able to discharge

many  of  these rather small functions which  might

facilitate things for our citizens and for some  of

the tourists.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, what I want to say has been anticipated

by  the hon. Member for River Valley. What I wanted

to ask of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>



the  Foreign Minister was why an embassy  in  Japan

had not been established, although in the Estimates

for 1967 there was provision for the setting up  of

such  an embassy. In view of the fact that we  have

very  close  trading  relations  with  Japan,   and

especially in our industrialization efforts a great

deal  of  capital as well as technical  skill  have

come  from Japan, I think the establishment  of  an

embassy in Japan should have been given priority. I

notice from the establishment of the other missions

that  possibly the Foreign Ministry has given wrong

priorities  to  the  setting up of  these  overseas

missions,



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, this year

the  Estimates for the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs

has  reached the figure of $7,395,530. This  is  an

increase  of about $2 million over the  figure  for

last  year.  I  know  that  this  increase  in  the

estimates  has  been  due to the  increase  in  the

number of missions in various countries and because

of   additional  expenses  incurred  in   acquiring

accommodation. This has been necessary in order  to

strengthen  our relationship with other  countries,

especially in trade.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has also been necessary to increase our

national  income. Therefore, I support the increase

in  the expenditure of this Ministry. This increase

is meaningful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to admit that the Ministry of Foreign

Affairs, under the able leadership of our Minister,

Mr  Rajaratnam, has successfully carried  out  our

neutral  and non-aligned policy. We have seen  just

now  that  the Minister has the air of a  diplomat.

Our  policy  in  foreign affairs  is  to  have  the

maximum number of friends and the minimum number of

enemies -best of all, not to have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>



any enemies at all. This has won approval from many

countries in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have to mention that in October this year

our  Prime  Minister,  together  with  the  Foreign

Minister  and the Minister of State for  Education,

visited the United States of America and they  were

welcomed  by  the  American  Government  with   the

greatest cordiality. The speeches made by the Prime

Minister  were very well received by the people  in

America,  and  other countries too.  In  fact,  the

visit   of   our  Prime  Minister  has   not   only

strengthened our position in international affairs,

but  it  has also enhanced our reputation.  At  the

same  time, it has also facilitated our efforts  to

increase  foreign  investment  here.  According  to

observers   in   various   countries,   the   Prime

Minister's  visit  was a great  success.  From  our

point of view, his efforts are highly commendable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point to be mentioned is that the

Minister for Health represented our country at  the

United   Nations   22nd   General   Assembly.   His

performance was a most remarkable one.  He  brought

with  him the liveliness of our country. The points

of view he expressed won the recognition of all the

countries  there. Therefore, we should congratulate

him on his efforts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to raise three questions. First,

when  are  we  going  to establish  an  embassy  in

Indonesia?  Indonesia is very near to our  country,

and  it is our biggest customer in trade. Secondly,

what  is  the progress made after the establishment

of  ASEAN?  What  efforts  have  we  made  in  this

direction?  Thirdly, what sort of benefits  can  we

derive from ASEAN? I wish the Minister can give  me

a reply to these questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock (Chairman) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman (Mr Lim Cheng Lock):</b> Inche Mohd. Ariff is not here. Mr Chow Chiok Hock.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I only

wish  to  make  a suggestion. In the allocation  of

posts,  the  Minister for Foreign Affairs  and  his

officials should emphasise on economic development.

The reason is this. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>



Foreign Affairs Ministry is closely associated with

other  countries and, therefore, the  officials  of

this   Ministry   should  receive   very   vigorous

training,  especially in international affairs  and

politics.  They  should  pay  close  attention   to

international affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand an incident happened in the Foreign

Affairs  Ministry  in October  this  year  about  a

Japanese diplomat. A foreign correspondent  made  a

phone  call to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  and

asked  whether  it had anything to say  about  this

Japanese  diplomat.  An official  of  the  Ministry

asked. "Who is this Japanese diplomat?" He did  not

know anything about this diplomat.



<br><br>7.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was made a laughing stock. As he was an

official in the Ministry, he should have been  well

versed with diplomatic figures.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>7.16 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is that officials sent abroad

should thoroughly understand the foreign policy  of

our country and at the same time should be able  to

publicise   the  fact  that  our  country   has   a

harmonious  multi-racial  society  so   that   more

tourists  will  be attracted to our  country.  They

should also be upright and learned. Their selection

should be based on these qualities.



<br><br><!-- Madam Chan Choy Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Madam Chan Choy Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  have  two points to make  on  our  foreign

policy.  The  first  is that we  should  have  more

foreign markets to ensure our economic development.

On  the  whole, our non-aligned foreign policy  has

won  the  approval  of  many  countries.  This   is

something that we should be proud of. We have to be

alert   all   the   time  in   order   to   promote

international trade. I think this is very important

because   Singapore,  as  an  independent  country,

cannot   allow  itself  to  be  made  use   of   by

international  forces. The strength of  our  people

should  not  be made use of by other  countries.  I

hope  that our foreign policy will promote economic

co-operation  with  other countries  in  South-east

Asia in order to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>



raise  our standard of living. Some countries  make

use  of international forces to promote trade. This

is  a  short-term policy as finally these countries

in fact resort to economic invasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should promote regional co-operation

with  other  countries in South-east  Asia  on  the

basis  of mutual benefit, In this way, we can  stop

Communism  from spreading. The Ministry of  Foreign

Affairs can make efforts in this direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as far as I know, the majority

of  Ambassadors  abroad  are  males.  I  think  the

Minister for Foreign Affairs should look around for

suitable female candidates to become Ambassadresses

because I feel that they are more adept as  far  as

diplomacy  is concerned and perhaps they can  bring

more  benefits to our country. If at the moment  we

do  not  have  suitable  candidates,  I  think  the

Government  should  send some women  with  adequate

intelligence  to be trained overseas so  that  they

can  be  appointed  as  Ambassadresses  in  various

countries in future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, several

Members have spoken on foreign policy. I would like

to   take  up  one  point.  I  see  that  with  the

establishment  of  our so many  overseas  missions,

only  the  High Commission in London  has  a  Trade

Commissioner. As far as I can remember,  the  Trade

Commissioner's  Office in London was  set  up  long

before  the High Commission was set up. As  I  said

yesterday,   trade  may  not  be  a   provider   of

employment  in our economy. However, I  am  of  the

opinion that trade is still a vital factor  in  our

economy.  In this respect. I would like to  suggest

to  the  Minister  for Foreign Affairs  that  Trade

Secretaries  be appointed to overseas  missions  so

that   they  can  help  to  promote  trade  between

Singapore and the many countries in which  we  have

such missions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

disagree with most of what has been said except  to

clarify  some queries raised by some hon.  Members.

One  is with regard to Japan. One hon. Member  felt

that the system of priorities has not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>



been  as  it  should have been.  Perhaps  I  should

explain  that sometimes priorities are decided  not

by an objective standard of priorities but in terms

of  the  persons  available,  A  man  for  such  an

important  post as Commissioner in Japan will  have

to  be a man of high calibre. There were one or two

other places which were equally important, like New

York and London, and therefore we had to leave this

post  vacant  not  because  of  anything  else  but

because  we  could  not find a man  of  appropriate

calibre  to  be sent there, In fact, we  found  one

but, as I said earlier, unfortunately, he died.  We

could  not fill the post and we had to look around,

I quite agree that Japan is just as important to us

as any of the missions that we have established. It

is  a  matter  of waiting for the right  person,  a

person  appropriate to Japan. Obviously,  a  person

who  goes to Japan must be well versed in trade and

must  be  as  sharp as the Japanese in  matters  of

commerce,  trade and industry. If  there  are  such

people,  they  are  already  well  established   in

business  concerns of their own and  they  are  not

necessarily going to enter the diplomatic service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, Sir, I would just like to clarify that

sometimes  the systems of priorities are determined

more   by   other  factors  than  by  just   giving

importance to any particular mission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Indonesia -I think this point was

raised by the Member for Sembawang -we have a Trade

Liaison  Office there. Here again, we  are  looking

for   an   appropriate  man  to  head  this  rather

important mission which involves both economic  and

commercial   knowledge   as   well   as   political

perception in this part of the world. So we have to

wait  until such time as such a person is available

-the Indonesians themselves are equally anxious  to

find a suitable man -to take this job as Ambassador

in Indonesia. We are not definitely in the habit of

setting  up  missions for the sake  of  setting  up

missions.  We would rather not establish a  mission

if  we are satisfied that we have not got the right

personnel to go with it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to ASEAN, I do not want to launch

into a long lecture because I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>



have  already made a statement in Parliament as  to

what it is all about, except to say that since then

the  Standing  Committee which was established  has

met, I think, twice. At least, they are supposed to

have  met last month. I think it has been postponed

to  January to consider certain specific schemes -I

hope  seriously  -so  that by  the  time  the  next

ministerial  conference takes place, we  will  have

something very tangible to agree upon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with the Member for Punggol that we

should  set up Trade Secretaries, Trade Offices  or

Trade  Representatives. If he had listened  to  the

Minister for Finance, he would have heard that  the

Minister  did indicate that this year we intend  to

establish  a  number  of  Trade  Offices  or  Trade

Representatives. In fact, we already have  them  in

the  United States and Hong Kong and we  intend  to

establish  a  few such offices in  other  parts  of

Europe.  But here again, it is a matter of  finding

the  right  person, because a very good businessman

is  not  going to give up a very lucrative business

especially at this time in Singapore. If the Member

for  Punggol  has  any bright,  honest  or  upright

persons  in mind, we will certainly be prepared  to

consider  any suggestions with regard to  potential

Trade Representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the Member for Delta that it would

be  a  very  good  thing if we  could  have  female

diplomats. I think it will make my job much easier,

because  not only do I have difficulties with  male

diplomats but I think that male diplomats  do  have

difficulties  with  some of the  diplomats  in  the

countries  to which they are assigned. I  am  quite

sure  that  female diplomats will have  that  extra

touch  which may be able to influence countries  to

be  more favourably disposed toward us than if they

had   to  contend  with  male  diplomats  and  High

Commissioners. However, the difficulty is that very

few ladies in the Republic of Singapore seem to  be

attracted  by  foreign service, We  have  solicited

applications from potential lady diplomats  and  so

far  the response has been poor. There was one case

where the lady was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>



highly suitable for the diplomatic career. I  think

she was chosen, but after a while she wrote back to

say  that she had changed her mind. I am not  quite

sure  whether  other  interests  had  developed  in

between  her  being appointed and  her  being  sent

away.  But  as  far  as  our policy  is  concerned,

everybody  who has the capability and the necessary

qualities, regardless of whether he is a male or  a

female,  will  be  considered and accepted  by  the

Foreign Office.
