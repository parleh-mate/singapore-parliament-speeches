the purpose of his latest trip to Ipoh and the Cameron

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, as the Member for Queenstown

may have read in the newspapers, I went to Ipoh and the

Cameron Highlands for a holiday.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Since there was also

an  A.S.A. meeting  and since the Prime  Minister  was

there,  could the Prime Minister inform us whether  his

visit had any connection with A.S.A.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I had the privilege to be in

Cameron  Highlands  a  few days before  the  Federation

Prime  Minister and his party arrived. For that  reason

my  friends  and  I had acclimatised ourselves  to  the

Cameron  Highlands' climate and the grass there.  As  a

consequence, we won the golf match.

<div align="center"><b>ELECTRICITY SUPPLY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TO ZEHNDER ROAD IN PASIR PANJANG</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b> asked the Prime Minister when will

electricity supply reach the people of Zehnder Road  in

Pasir Panjang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, a scheme for the supply of

electricity  to  the  houses  at  Zehnder  Road,  Pasir

Panjang, was considered by the Urban and Rural Services

Consultative Committee in 1961. This was the  provision

of electricity supply to 58 houses at an estimated cost

of  $37,720. The monthly revenue from these houses  was

estimated  at $22,620 for a five-year period - in  fact,

amounting  to a subsidy of $15,100 or $260  per  house.

The  Urban  and  Rural Services Consultative  Committee

received  requests for the provision of such  amenities

from  all  over the island. As the funds available  are

limited,  the  Committee  has  to  afford  priority  to

schemes  which it considers would benefit the  greatest

number at the lowest cost. This scheme was not included

in   the  immediate  programme  for  the  provision  of

electricity  supply to kampongs because  of  the  small

number  of houses involved and the high rate of subsidy

per house. It will, with all other schemes that did not

get  priority last year, be considered again  later  in

the year to reassess its priority rating.

<div align="center"><b>FEMALE EMPLOYEES IN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT SERVICE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> asked the Minister for Finance (1)

what  is  the total number of female employees  in  the

Singapore Government Service; (ii) how many of them are

monthly rated; how many are daily rated; and (iii)  how

many of them have benefited from the recent decision of

Government  to  implement its policy of equal  pay  for

equal work.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The total number of female

employees  in  the  Singapore  Government  service   is

approximately 7,275. Of these, 105 are daily-rated  and

the rest are monthly-rated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practically everyone will benefit in one way or the

other  from  the policy of equal treatment  for  women.

There  are  a  small  number of women  in  professional

grades  and  in  certain other occupations  where  they

already  enjoy  equal  pay. Even they  will  get  other

benefits  such  as permanency of status after  marriage

and similar retirement benefits as men.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Would the Minister tell us how many

have actually benefited to date?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Treasury

circular  to  give  effect to this  proposal  has  been

drafted and at the present moment, it is being examined

by  me.  When it is passed, all these benefits will  be

made available to women employees with effect from  1st

March this year.

whether  he  has any information as to  the  amount  of

revenue collected by the Government in respect  of  the

duty  on  lottery  tickets sold to non-members  of  the

Singapore turf Club.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, this information is not

available as the sellers do not distinguish non-members

from members.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Would the Minister indicate what

is  the  revenue  collected on lottery tickets  of  the

Singapore Turf Club and what, in his view,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>



would  be the proportion between those sold within  the

Turf Club and those outside?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I cannot recollect the figures off-hand and I am not very familiar with Turf Club sales of

lottery tickets. I require notice of the question.

<div align="center"><b>COMMON MARKET WITH</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FEDERATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Progress)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether  he  will make a statement as to what  progress

has  been  made  with regard to the  achievement  of  a

proposed Common Market with the Federation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the two

Governments  have  submitted a request  to  the  United

Nations  to despatch a high-powered team to Malaya  and

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Governments propose that the mission should be

headed  by a certain distinguished international figure

who was one of the principal architects of the European

Economic  Community. This person,  however,  has  found

difficulty in accepting this invitation because of  his

other international commitments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya,

Tun  Abdul Razak, has written a personal letter to  the

Secretary-General  of  the  United  Nations,  U  Thant,

requesting  his  intercession  on  behalf  of  the  two

Governments.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Minister informed this House five

months ago on the 17th of November of this request. Are

we  to  understand  that in fact  there  have  been  no

developments in the past five months?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have already

indicated  that this international dignitary  had  been

approached  and  that  there  was  some  difficulty  in

arranging  a suitable timetable for him to  come  here.

Without  going  into details, the present  position  is

that the Deputy Prime Minister of the Federation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>



Government  has  himself  appealed  directly   to   the

Secretary-General  of the United  Nations  to  make  it

possible for this person to come here.

<div align="center"><b>EXPLORATORY TRADE MISSION TO NEW DELHI AND/OR PEKING</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether  he will consider sending an exploratory  Trade

Mission to New Delhi and/or Peking and whether he would

indicate  the probable cost of such mission  to  either

capital.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, if the Member for Anson will

set   Out  the  reasons  therefor  and  the  advantages

accruing  to the people of Singapore, I will  certainly

consider any exploratory Trade Mission whether  to  New

Delhi and/or Peking and/or Casablanca and or the centre

of any Western, Eastern or neutral bloc of nations.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Are we to understand from the Minister

that  he  sees  no  advantage in  such  an  exploratory

Mission?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, since the Member for Anson

last  raised  this subject sometime last year,  I  have

been waiting for a submission from him to inform me  of

the advantages to the people of Singapore of the course

of action he is suggesting.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Would the Minister indicate his reply to

the second part of the question?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The second part does not arise.

<div align="center"><b>MAGISTRATES ALLEGING</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CRIMINAL MISCONDUCT ON</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>THE PART OF POLICE OFFICERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Health

and   Law   (i)  what  is  the  procedure  adopted   by

Magistrates  when  a  complaint  is  laid  before  them

alleging  criminal  misconduct on  the  part  of  named

and/or  unnamed police officers; and (ii)  between  1st

June, 1959, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>



31st  March,  1962,  what is (a)  the  number  of  such

complaints  made,  (b) the number  of  such  complaints

referred   by  the  Magistrates  to  the   police   for

investigation, (c) the average length of  time  between

the date of the request by the Magistrate to the police

for  investigation and the date of reply by the  police

to  the  Magistrate,  and (d) the number  of  summonses

and/or  warrants  issued  by the  Magistrates  on  such

complaints.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. M. Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I will break it up

into parts. [Interruption] The first part -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know whether the Minister

is threatening us with a long statement. If he is, then

perhaps he can make a ministerial statement at the  end

of Question time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I shall make the statement brief.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes, it should be short. Mr Byrne.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the first part of the

question  asked:  what  is  the  procedure  adopted  by

Magistrates  when  a  complaint  is  laid  before  them

alleging  criminal  misconduct on  the  part  of  named

and/or  unnamed  police officers? The  answer  to  this

question is as follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure adopted is that laid down in section 133

of  the  Criminal Procedure Code which the  Member  for

Anson   knows  quite  well.  The  assistance   of   the

Commissioner   of  Police  sought  in   the   following

circumstances:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) when the identity of the police officer is not

known,  the Commissioner of Police is required  to

ascertain it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) when the allegation in the complaint is so

fantastic  on the face of it or for other  reasons

the  Magistrate  doubts the truth  of  the  matter

complained  of,  the  Commissioner  of  Police  is

requested  to  investigate  and  report   on   the

allegation:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) when the complaint discloses a seizable offence,

the Commissioner of Police is asked to explain why

the police have not effected an arrest: and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) when the complaint discloses a seizable offence

for  which  the  sanction  of  the  Deputy  Public

Prosecutor  is required under section 128  of  the

Criminal  Procedure  Code,  the  Commissioner   of

Police is requested to investigate and obtain  the

necessary   sanction  from   the   Deputy   Public

Prosecutor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in the next part of the question, I am asked to

state  the  number of such complaints made between  1st

June, 1959, and 31st March, 1962. The answer is 31.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I am asked to state the number of such complaints

referred   by  the  Magistrates  to  the   police   for

investigation. The answer is 19.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I am asked to state the average length of time

between  the  date of the request by the Magistrate  to

the  police for investigation and the date of reply  by

the  police  to  the  Magistrate. The  answer  is,  the

average length of time is 18 days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I am asked to state the number of summonses

and/or  warrants  issued  by the  Magistrates  on  such

complaints. No warrants were issued; 17 summonses  were

issued; nine notices were issued; three complaints were

withdrawn;   one  complaint  was  dismissed   and   one

complaint is still pending.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Would the Minister agree that referring

complaints   about  the  police  to  the   police   for

investigation  brings  about considerable  dilatoriness

and  has  he any suggestions for future legislation  on

that aspect?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the whole list of

names  of  complainants and matters which were referred

for  investigation. There were 19 complaints which were

referred to the police for investigation. There were 12

complaints  which were not referred to the  police  for

investigation.  The Magistrate has the  power  to  deal

with  such  complaints if the offence  disclosed  is  a

serious offence and needs investigation. In such cases,

the  Magistrate  always refers them to the  police  for

investigation. But where the complaints are trivial, he

deals with them himself.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Would the Minister be good enough to

direct his mind to the question which seeks to inquire

whether the Government is conscious of the frustrating

procedure  whereby  complaints about  the  police  are

referred to the police for investigation, and  whether

they  have  in mind any legislation to deal with  that

aspect?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Anson very

well  knows what the procedure is. It is true that some

complaints    are   referred   to   the   police    for

investigation.  Before any action  can  be  taken,  the

investigation papers go to the State Advocate-General's

Department,  and  it is the S.A.G. who  has  the  right

under  the Constitution to decide whether action should

be brought or not. The Member for Anson understands the

procedure quite well.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>CIGARETTE SMOKING</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Dangers to health)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Health

and  Law  whether  he  has any information  as  to  the

dangers to health of cigarette smoking, and what action

does the Government propose to take.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is yes. This

information  is  contained in  a  publication  entitled

"Smoking  and  Health" which is a report of  the  Royal

College  of Physicians of London on smoking in relation

to  cancer of the lung and other diseases, published by

Pitman Medical Publishing Co. Ltd. this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Anson is interested, I have the

publication here and will let him read it if he  likes

to.  But I would like to mention here that I know that

the  Member for Anson is a regular pipe smoker and  it

would  be  of  interest to him if I quote a  paragraph

from this report which was -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Minister is here to give information

on  the  question  of dangers to health  of  cigarette

smoking and not pipe smoking.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, this report deals with

pipe smoking as well as cigarette smoking.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot allow that, unless the

Minister  wishes  a  debate on  the  question  of  pipe

smoking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Pipe down!



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the following

figures of interest for Singapore. Of deaths from  lung

cancer  in 1959, there were 108 deaths. In 1960,  there

were  131  deaths from lung cancer, and in  1961  there

were  138.  All deaths from all cancers - in 1959,  there

were  1,055;  in 1960, 1,067; and I have  not  got  the

figure  for  1961 as it is too early to get  them.  The

total  of all deaths in Singapore for 1959 was  10,175;

in  1960,  10,210; and in 1961, 10,025. The death  rate

from lung cancer in Singapore is about ten per cent  of

the total cancer deaths, and the total of cancer deaths

is about one-tenth of all deaths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position in Singapore does not warrant any

immediate  action.  However, my  Ministry  is  watching

developments abroad on the investigation and prevention

of lung cancer and smoking and will take whatever steps

are proved necessary and beneficial.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> In the light of the gravity of the

effect  of cigarette smoking on health as indicated  by

the report which the Minister has referred to, would he

recommend  to  the  Ministry  of  Culture  that   Radio

Singapore   should   not   carry   advertisements    on

cigarettes?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it would be

advisable if the Member for Anson reads the book I have

referred to because it is stated there that it has been

proved  that  advertisements on tobacco do no  initiate

new  smokers.  They focus attention on  the  brands  of

smokes  and they cause smokers to switch their  smokes.

So  I  think before he asks these questions, he  should

first read this book.

<div align="center"><b>MOSQUITO NUISANCE IN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Request for statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Health and

Law  whether  he  would  make a  statement  as  to  the

mosquito nuisance in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should like to preface

my  remarks by informing the House that, in my opinion,

mosquitoes  are not the only nuisance that we  have  in

Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> What is the other

nuisance?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the complaints that we

have  received over the past three months of this  year

do  not  show any apparent increase compared  with  the

corresponding months last year. For example,  in  March

this year there were 62 complaints as compared with  72

in  March last year. These complaints are dealt with by

the  Department which has 16 checkers in the city  area

and  a  mobile  squad of 14 men in the rural  area.  As

mosquito  breeding  has  often been  caused  by  choked

drains - and it is known that hawkers are responsible for

this - field  officers  have  on  their  rounds   advised

hawkers not to throw rubbish indiscriminately into  the

drains, and have taken action to clear choked drains.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Are we to understand that the only

criterion of the Ministry of the extent of the nuisance

is  the  number  of complaints received?  Is  there  no

detailed  examination  by  staff  of  the  areas  where

mosquitoes breed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> That is regularly done, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

wonder whether the Minister is aware that complaints do

not  come in anymore, because the people are fed up  as

conditions  have  not improved. And  can  he  ascertain

whether  complaints  have  not  come  in  because   the

situation has improved?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the hon. Lady will

come  to  my  office I can show her piles of complaints

that I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>



received.  Every  month  I  receive  about  10  or   15

<div align="center"><b>MALAY AND CHINESE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PUBLICATIONS OF GOVERNMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>POLICY AS REGARDS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>HAWKERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr David Marshall</b> asked the Minister for Health

and  Law  whether  he  would  consider  publishing   in

pamphlet  form, in Malay and Chinese, the  Government's

policy  as  regards hawkers and the plan of alternative

sites being offered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The Government's hawker policy aims at

registering  and  licensing all  hawkers  who  are  not

itinerant with a view to accommodating them in suitable

pitches.  These  pitches  are  being  measured  out  in

selected  streets by the Hawkers Department. This  work

has  to  be  done street by street and will  take  some

time.  Before  the hawkers are re-sited  in  the  newly

marked  out  pitches.  The aims  and  objects  of  this

exercise  are clearly explained to them and  their  co-operation  is  sought.  Most of  the  hawkers  will  be

permitted  to carry on their trade in the places  where

they are at present. Some may have to be resited.  The

bases for resiting will be:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) where it is necessary for health reasons to

move   a   hawker, then  he  will  be  given   an

alternative pitch. For example, if a hawker has  a

stall  over  a  drain and this hampers  the  daily

cleansing  of the drain, then he may  be  resited

elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) hawkers may have to be resited if the through

passage  of  normal  traffic is  obstructed,  more

especially  in  the  case  of  an  emergency.  For

example, in the case of a fire a traffic lane must

be  available for the police and the fire  brigade

to reach the afflicted area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) in certain areas whole streets are used by

hawkers as markets for specified hours because  of

the  absence  of  sites for markets  in  congested

areas.  For example, in Sago Street and Syed  Alwi

Road. "No Entry" signs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>



are  put  up and general traffic is not  permitted

during the specified hours. However, a single lane

for  emergency  traffic  will  still  have  to  be

provided.



<br><br>Hawkers  will  be grouped in pitches according  to  the

type  of trade they carry on. For example, in the  case

of  food  hawkers - vegetable hawkers, meat  hawkers  and

fish  hawkers - they will be separately  grouped  in  the

same   street,  and  all  non-food  hawkers   will   be

separately  grouped together in the same  street.  Each

area must be studied separately.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No useful purpose can be served in issuing pamphlets

in  Malay  and  Chinese. The resiting policy  has  been

explained  to  the hawkers personally  when  action  is

taken  to resite them in new pitches street by  street.

The hawker population will continue to grow and so will

the   problem  increase  until  a  viable   basis   for

industrial expansion is established with merger  and  a

common  market, and our problems of unemployment become

solvable.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Does the Minister not consider that it

would  be  fair  for  the hawkers and  helpful  to  the

Government  if,  in fact, there were pamphlets  in  the

languages  which  the hawkers could understand  showing

plans of the sites and the exact policy and period  for

change, instead of depending on individual inspectors?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> I do not agree because there would have to

be a pamphlet for each street.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> On the question of when a street is to be

allocated  for  sites for hawkers, could  the  Minister

inform  the  House whether the traffic police  are  con

sulted before a particular street is allocated for such

use?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker, Sir. We have what is

known  as  the  Hawkers  Advisory  Committee.  We  have

Legislative   Assemblymen   and   Assemblywomen,    the

Commissioner of Police, the Fire Brigade and the P.W.D.

Road Department represented on that Committee.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng (Pasir Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, can the Minister tell us when is the time

to carry out the hawker policy and whether there is any

representative of the hawkers in that Committee?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member for Pasir Panjang repeat

that question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, can

the  Minister  tell  this House when  will  his  hawker

policy be carried out within a specific time? The other

question  is, can the Minister tell this House  whether

hawkers   are  represented  in  this  Hawkers  Advisory

Committee?



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The hawker policy is being carried out now

and  the work is done on the basis of street by street.

What was the next question?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The next question was whether the hawkers

are represented in the Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> No, Sir. There are so many hawkers'

associations  that we feel it would  not  be  right  to

invite,   say,   any  particular  association   to   be

represented in the Committee, if we did, we would  have

to include representatives of all associations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, if

there  are  no  representatives of the hawkers  in  the

Committee,  then  the Committee will  not  be  able  to

understand the hawkers well. This is disadvantageous to

the hawkers.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is a different question. Mr David

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Ministers of the

Government have already on their appointment declared a

return of all their assets and sources of income to the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara. Parliamentary Secretaries have

made  similar  returns to the Prime  Minister.  If  the

House desires, Government can introduce legislation to

require all Members of the Assembly to submit a  return

of their assets and sources of income to the C.P.I.B.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards civil servants, there are already in

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on appointment,

civil  servants will have to submit a return  of  their

more  particularly under sections 17, 18 and  19,  with

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the average

length  of  time that an applicant has to wait  at  the

Registry  of  Persons in order to obtain  a  change  of

entails a number of checks in order to ensure that  the

documentary evidence of the child's birth in  Singapore

if  it  is  supported  by a statutory  declaration  and

Leaving Certificate, Birth Certificates of brothers and

sisters or vaccination notice or certificate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statutory declaration, whether or not a photograph

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question

suggests  that persons are being detained on  suspicion

of  being secret society gangster. This is not correct.

Under  the  provisions of the Criminal  Law  (Temporary

Provisions)  Ordinance, 1955, the Minister  making  the

order has to be satisfied that the person against  whom

the  order  is made has been associated with activities

of  a criminal nature. In every case where an order has

been  made,  there is ample evidence  that  the  person

concerned  has  been associated with  activities  of  a

criminal   nature.  Although  there   is   a   definite

improvement  in  the crime situation  involving  secret

societies,  as  evidenced  by  the  drop  in  cases  of

attempted murder, acid throwing, abduction and  assault

and  stabbing  in  the  last  two  years,  the  danger,

however, is by no

means over. Members of the House will agree that if one

of  the  major  weapons  in the battle  against  secret

societies,  as  provided  for under  the  Criminal  Law

available,   a   large  section  of   the   population,

of  1962.  The number of such applications approved  by

of 1962, 63. The number of applications rejected by the

Government  in 1961 was 17 and in the first quarter  of

1962,   6.   In  the  majority  of  these  cases,   the

applications were refused because the persons concerned

were  not  considered  to  be proper  persons  to  whom

for refusal included contravention by the applicants of

the  conditions  of  previous permits  issued  and  the

unsuitability   of  the  contents   of   the   proposed

publications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications for renewal for 1962 of the permits for

the  following two publications have been refused:  The

Movies  Weekly  Press and the Sin Tao Pao.  Both  these

publications have the same proprietor who has  breached

the  conditions  of the permit issued to  him  for  the

publication of the Sin Tao Pao by hiring out the permit

to  two  other  persons with adverse security  records.

These  two  persons took over publication of the  paper

for   a  short  period,  during  which  time  political

articles  of  a  provocative  nature  appeared  in  the

publication,  although according to the  permit  issued

the  contents were to be confined to news, comments and

<div align="center"><b>VACANT HOUSING BOARD</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SHOP-HOUSES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. <b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development (i) how  many  Housing  Board

shop-houses are at present vacant; (ii) what is the

loss  of revenue to the Housing Board accruing from

the  non-occupancy of these vacant shop-houses; and

(iii)  what  is  the annual cost of maintenance  of

these vacant shop-houses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> There are 43 Housing and

Development  Board shop-houses vacant  at  present.

This represents 4.3 per cent of the total number of

shop premises under the Board's management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Housing and Development Board took over

from  the  Singapore Improvement Trust in  February

1960,  137 shop premises were vacant. This amounted

to  15.4 per cent of the shops under management  at

that time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the shops had not been let since the

completion of the buildings. The Housing Board took

positive   steps   to  bring  down   vacancies   by

introducing the "rising rent" principle. Under this

system, properties which remain vacant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>



for  more than four months are rented out at 70 per

cent of the minimum rent for the first year, 80 per

cent  for the second year and 90 per cent  for  the

third year. Thus, if the minimum rental for a shop-house  is  $200, the rentals payable in the  first,

second and third year would be $140, $160 and  $180

per  month; in the fourth year, the full rental  of

$200  is charged. This encourages shop-keepers  who

pay  lower rentals at the beginning when  they  are

establishing business and goodwill in the locality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the 43 shops vacant were built by the former

Singapore  Improvement  Trust.  No  vacancy  exists

among shops built by the Housing Board since it was

formed in February 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board has succeeded in reducing the

percentage of vacancies from 15.4 per cent  to  4.3

per  cent.  This is a reasonable figure considering

that the Board has 1,000 shop properties under  its

management. Casual vacancies are bound to  crop  up

from  time  to  time as some shop-keepers  give  up

their  tenancies and the properties have to be  let

again to new tenants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases where it was clear that there was little

hope  of letting out the shops, the Board has taken

action  to  convert such shop premises into  living

units.  Eight  such  units in  Stirling  Road  were

converted into living accommodation in August 1960.

Four  units  were  likewise converted  in  Winstedt

Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position is constantly reviewed and, as and

when necessary, conversion will take place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the planning and designing of shops, the

Board,  since  it  took over, has  paid  particular

attention  to  the locality in which shop  premises

are   placed   plus   the   provision   of   living

accommodation  so that the shops are attractive  to

shop-keepers  and the results are clearly  seen  in

that  none of the shop premises constructed by  the

Board are vacant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the second part of the question

is:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Under the former S.I.T., the loss of revenue

from  the  non-occupancy  of  the  137  vacant

shops



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>



was  approximately $24,000 per month  as  on  31st

January, 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Now the figure has been reduced to only $6,721 per

month for the 43 vacant shop units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the third part of the question is that

it  cost the Housing Board approximately $60 per  annum

to  maintain  a shop unit, so that for the  137  vacant

units  under the former S.I.T., the estimated  cost  of

maintaining these vacant premises was $8,220 per annum.

Now  the cost is approximately $2,580 per annum for the

43 vacant shop premises managed by the Housing Board.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tee Kim Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tee Kim Leng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

has  the Minister considered the question as to how  he

would  take  action  to enable the  shop-houses  to  be

occupied by the tenants?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Kia Gan:</b> The Board has been looking into

this question of either converting the shop-houses into

living units or applying the "rising rental" principle.

Up  to this moment, we have been able to let out 94  of

these  137 shops. I am sure in time we will be able  to

reduce this figure.

<div align="center"><b>RUBBER DEALERS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>3.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That on this Assembly proceeding to the Orders of the

Day, the Rubber Dealers (Amendment) Bill be ordered  to

be read a third time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that this Bill was read a Second

time  on  15th  January, 1962,  and  was  committed  to

Committee. Upon a division that clause 2 stand part  of

the  Bill,  the votes of Members were equally  divided.

The  motion was accordingly declared lost in accordance

with  the provisions of section 53 (1) of the Singapore

(Constitution)  Order in Council, 1958.  Clause  2  was

accordingly negatived.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this occurrence was without precedent in this

House  and  I am accordingly much obliged  to  you  for

having   given  advice  on  this  matter.   With   your

permission,  I  shall  now take the  liberty  to  quote

liberally  from your advice so that the  House  may  be

aware   of  the  procedural  principles  involved.   In

paragraph 5 of your note, you said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Bill was reported to the Assembly in the usual

way,  and on being reported the Bill was deemed to have

been  ordered  to  be read the Third time.  No  motion,

however,  was  made  for the Third Reading  nor  was  a

future  sitting  day named for the Third  Reading.  The

order  for  the  Third Reading of  the  Bill  therefore

became a dropped order.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order. Sir, the Minister

is  reading  from a document. Is that  document  to  be

tabled for use by other Members as well?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will certainly make copies of my ruling

available to all Members.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, you then went on to consider

what  effect this has on the Bill and your observations

were as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Committee, having negatived the only effective or

essential Clause, virtually destroyed the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the Committee is, of course, not

binding  on  the Assembly. The Bill itself,  therefore,

has  not, as a Bill, been negatived albeit it is now  a

mere  "shell".  A  Bill can only be  negatived  by  the

Assembly  at the Second Reading if the Assembly  agrees

to any of the two amendments to the question, "That the

Bill  he  now  read  a Second time",  as  described  in

paragraph (3) of Standing Order No. 67.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore open to the Assembly to take steps as

indicated... below to restore the provision of  law  which

was negatived by the Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before such a move is initiated, consideration would

no  doubt be given to the principle "that parliamentary

government requires the majority to abide by a decision

regularly come to, however unexpected, and that  it  is

unfair   to  resort  to  methods,  whether  direct   or

indirect,  to  reverse such a decision.  The  practice,

resulting from this feeling, is essentially a safeguard

for the rights of minority, and a contrary practice  is

normally  not  resorted to, unless in the circumstances

of  a  particular  case  those rights  are  in  no  way

threatened".'.



<br><br>You  were  then quoting from Erskine May, page 417.  You

went on to observe:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The principle is a principle applicable to decisions

of  the House, but the Assembly might consider that the

spirit  behind  the principle could  equally  apply  to

decisions of a Committee of the whole Assembly.'.



<br><br>You then went on to observe:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Nevertheless, the fact that the Clause was negatived

by  reason of the Committee being equally divided would

no  doubt  be borne in mind when arriving at a decision

as  to whether any further step should be taken in  the

matter.'.



<br><br>As  regards the steps which may be taken in the present

Session of the Assembly, your advice was as follows:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If thought fit, therefore, steps could be taken

firstly  to  replace the dropped order  for  the  third

reading of the Bill on the Order Paper and secondly, to

give  notice, before a Member rises to move  the  third

reading of the Bill, that it is proposed to introduce a

new  clause (i.e, a clause similar to the clause  which

was negatived by the Committee of the whole Assembly or

a  clause substantively the same) on recommittal of the

Bill  to  a  Committee of the whole Assembly under  the

provisions of Standing Order No. 73.'.



<br><br>You went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Committee of the whole Assembly in considering

the  new clause would of course be at liberty to ignore

the  decision  of  the former Committee  of  the  whole

Assembly  which negatived the clause - a decision  o  one

Committee is not binding on another Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the new clause is accepted, the Bill as amended by

the addition of the new clause is reported and read the

third time under the provisions of Standing Orders Nos.

73 (8) and 72.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have now dealt with the procedural aspect of

this  matter  as  advised by you. I  shall  reserve  my

arguments for reintroducing the negatived clause  at  a

later stage when this matter goes into Committee.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Question is, "That on this Assembly

proceeding to the Orders of the Day, the Rubber Dealers

(Amendment) Bill be ordered to be read a third time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might add, on a procedural note, that hon. Members

will  have noticed that item 6 on the Order Paper deals

with the Rubber Dealers (Amendment) Bill (Minister  for

Finance) - Third  Reading, but that item  is  printed  in

italics,  which indicates that it will  not  be  called

unless  and  until  the  motion now  being  debated  is

accepted by the House.



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, it is startling to those of

us who have strenuously sought for many years to spread

the  concept  of  democracy in this area  to  find  the

Government  treating the traditions of  democracy  with

such little respect as is indicated in this motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has quoted from an advice from you to him where May, the authority on parliamentary procedure, speaks of respect for the majority decision, however unexpected it may have been. The Minister has drawn your attention to the fact that on 15th January last the Bill was committed to Committee and clause 2, which is the whole body of the Bill, was negatived constitutionally. As you yourself

put it at that time - and I am grateful, Mr Speaker, for

the arrangement whereby you made available to us copies

of the verbatim proceedings of that day - the Bill became

meaningless  and was in fact a defeated  Bill.  I  say,

Sir,  rightly defeated. This was only three months ago;

23  votes  against this provision. Now the  Government,

with  complete disregard to a decision constitutionally

arrived  at though disadvantageous to itself, no  doubt

having made arrangements which it thinks will guarantee

it  a  majority, has brought in word for word the  same

clause which was defeated four months ago except, if my

memory  serves me right, Sir, there is an  explanation.

The  last time the Government said that this will  cost

the Government nothing; this time we are told that this

will cost the Government $39,000 a year, which will  be

a  loss of revenue on licences. If you remember, it was

pointed  out to them that it could not mean no loss  at

all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is, to my mind, not only an unhappy day

from the point of view of a Bill which I regret is legalising

gambling in a manner ruinous -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I suggest

to the Member for Anson  that those remarks would be applicable if and when the

Bill is debated. At the moment, we are on a procedural

point.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am touching incidentally on my

regrets, as I say not merely because it is a Bill which

was rightly defeated for good reason, but because it is

indicative of a completely Fascist approach.  The  idea

of   democracy   of  this  Government  is   a   Fascist

dictatorship  between elections. At election  time,  we

are all democrats. Once you are in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>



office, then the steamroller of the majority is  to  be

utilised irrespective of democratic traditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, am I to understand that on a motion for committal

of this Bill for a Third Reading the  objects and  the  merits of

the Bill are not to be  debated?  I seek your guidance, Sir,

so as to proceed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Does the Member mean on this particular

motion?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No. On this particular motion, the merits

of the Bill are not relevant.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> In those circumstances, I would urge

this House -   both those who voted in favour and those who

voted  against - respecting the traditions  of  democracy

and  a  decision constitutionally arrived at but  three

months  ago, should unite unanimously in condemning  an

effort,  however  legal in the technical  sense,  which

seeks to reopen that issue.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Government needs no

lecture on traditions of democracy from the Member  for

Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the most elementary principles of

parliamentary  democracy is  that  it  is  basically  a

debate  on  the two-party system - the party returned  as

the government in power and the party in opposition. It

is   fundamental   to  the  working  of   parliamentary

democracy that we must have a loyal Opposition. Sir, in

the Member for Anson we can see - I for one can see - there

is no trace of loyalty to the country, to democracy -

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Could the Minister indicate how

that  is  relevant to the motion? The motion  is  on  a

procedural  point. I do not think what the  Member  for

Anson has said has invited those personal remarks.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Anson has sought to

call  this Government a Fascist dictatorship and I  say

that that allegation needs rebuttal.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>



We  have seen the Member for Anson when he formed  the

Government.   It   was   a  lamentable   and   pathetic

performance. We had a Chief Minister who was constantly

- and in his own words - acting as a prima donna.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you want to raise respect for democratic

institutions  among  the ordinary masses  who  are  not

accustomed  to  them  and  who  have  never   had   the

opportunity to operate the system, it is necessary that

the  political leadership conducts itself with dignity.

I  say  that  the Member for Anson, in his  role  as  a

political  leader from a dismal beginning of his  Chief

Ministership to his present role as a supporter,  as  a

stooge of the Malayan Communist Party - I say, Sir,  that

a man of this description -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of privilege, Mr Speaker,

Sir.  A supporter of the Malayan Communist Party  is  a

criminal.  I  ask you to take notice  of  a  breach  of

privilege.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As Chairman of this particular Assembly,

I  have  heard allegations of supporters of  Communists

thrown  across this Chamber. I do not propose  to  take

any  action  on the question of privilege  as  Speaker.

But,  of course, the Member for Anson is at liberty  in

the usual way to file a notice of motion, should he  so

choose. Dr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I do not intend to waste the

valuable   time   of  this  House  in   answering   the

contemptible  allegations of the Member  for  Anson.  I

have  already explained, and I have quoted  you  as  an

authority, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the procedure adopted

by  the  Government  is  quite  constitutional  and  in

keeping with the traditions of parliamentary democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put. "That on this Assembly proceeding to the

Orders of the Day, the Rubber Dealers (Amendment)  Bill

he ordered to be read a third time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the law relating to the

limitation of actions in respect of causes of action

which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>



survive  against  the  estate  of  a  deceased  person.

Section  7  (3) of the Civil Law Ordinance  at  present

provides as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(3) No proceedings shall be maintainable in respect

of  a  cause of action in tort which by virtue of  this

section  has survived against the estate of a  deceased

person unless either -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a proceedings against him in respect of that

cause  of  action were pending at the  date  of  his

in  respect  thereof not later  than  six  months

after   his  personal  representative  took   out

representation.'.



<br><br>Where  proceedings are pending against the deceased  at

the  date  of his death, such proceedings will  survive

against his estate. In this case the ordinary period of

limitation will apply and this, by virtue of section  6

of the Limitations Ordinance, 1959, is six years in the

case  of an action founded on a tort. Where proceedings

are not pending against the deceased at the time of his

death,  the  present  law  in  Singapore  is  that  the

proceedings  will  survive against the  estate  of  the

deceased only if -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the cause of action arose not earlier than six

months before the death of the deceased, and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) proceedings in respect thereof are taken not

later than six months after his personal representative

took out representation.



<br><br>The  first  provision, in effect, sets out the  special

period of limitation and therefore by virtue of section

3  of  the  Limitations Ordinance, 1959, that Ordinance

will not be applicable. The effect of the provision  is

that  if the tortfeasor dies more than six months after

committing  the  tort and proceedings are  not  pending

against  him  at  the  date of his  death,  the  person

injured will not be able to bring an action against the

estate of the deceased tortfeasor because the cause  of

action arose earlier than six months before .his death.

If,  however, the tortfeasor dies four months  or  five

months  after  committing the tort, the person  injured

can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>



bring  the  action against the estate of  the  deceased

tortfeasor at any time, because in this case the  cause

of  action did not arise earlier than six months before

the  death of the tortfeasor. This provision  has  been

removed  in  England by the Law Reform  (Limitation  of

Actions  etc.)  Act of 1954, and in the  Federation  of

Malaya  the Civil Law Ordinance, 1956, does not include

this   provision.  The  Singapore  Bar  Committee   has

considered  the  matter and they have recommended  that

the  law in Singapore be amended to bring it into  line

with  that in England and the Federation of Malaya.  It

is not proposed to amend the other requirement-that the

proceedings in respect of the cause of action  must  be

taken  not  later  than six months after  the  personal

representative   of   the  deceased   has   taken   out

representation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The effect of the repeal of this provision will be

that  the  general period of limitation  of  six  years

relating  to  actions  in tort  will  apply,  and  that

proceedings  in  respect of a cause of action  in  tort

will   survive  against  the  estate  of  the  deceased

tortfeasor if either:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the cause of action was pending at the time of the

death of the tortfeasor; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the proceedings in respect thereof are taken not

later than six months after his personal representative

took out representation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I appreciate the desire of the Minister

to maintain conformity in matters of general principles

both of the Federation and the United Kingdom. But what

exercises my mind, Sir, is the difficulty of the estate

of  the  deceased to defend an action in respect  of  a

tort which may be four or five or six years old, at the

time they receive notice of it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not aware, Sir - it may well be because I have not

assiduously perused the newspapers - that there had  been

any important number of cases where there is indication

of injustice in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>



protection  of  the  estate  of  a  dead  man   against

proceedings  not in contract, Sir, as has been  pointed

out,  but  in tort for misconduct alleged to have  been

committed more than six months before his death.  I  am

sure  the  Minister and all of us certainly  appreciate

that  when  a  man is alive, he can defend  himself  in

respect of these matters to a degree that possibly  his

representatives cannot. And I would ask the Minister to

indicate, apart from the perfectly legitimate desire to

keep in line with the Federation and the United Kingdom -have there, in fact, been any cases of hardship  and,

if  so,  to  what extent have they been caused  by  the

existing  law?  And  whether the  Minister  has  really

directed  his mind to the dangers which would arise  to

the  dead  man's estate if his name could be  maligned?

The  point  is, it is impossible to prevent  fraudulent

and  false claims being made. It is extremely difficult

for  his estate to defend him if the allegation is five

or  six years ago he did something in respect of  which

no  action  has been taken until six months  after  his

death.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are matters of some importance on which I would

appreciate clarification from the Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read

a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 8 of the Motor Vehicles (Third-party

Risks and Compensation) Ordinance, 1960, it is provided

that  Where  judgment is obtained  in  respect  of  any

liability  which  is required to be  covered  by  third

party   insurance,  insurers  shall,  subject  to   the

provisions  of the section, pay the Public Trustee,  as

trustee  for  the  persons entitled  thereto,  any  sum

payable in respect of such liability. Where the insurer

admits the liability, there is no problem, as then  the

money is paid to the Public Trustee who will administer

it  for  the  benefit of the persons entitled  thereto.

Whenever,   however,  the  insurer   does   not   admit

liability,  it  is necessary to sue the insurer.  Under

the present provisions, the proper person to sue is the

Public Trustee, but the Public Trustee is unwilling  to

run  the risk of losing the action and therefore having

to pay the cost. The persons entitled to the benefit of

the  award would naturally want to bring action against

the  insurer but they have to do so in the name of  the

Public Trustee. The Public Trustee has, however, to ask

for  indemnity  for  costs and it  may  not  always  be

possible  for the parties to give this undertaking  and

it  is  doubtful whether the solicitors for the parties

can  give such an undertaking. It is therefore proposed

to  amend the Ordinance to provide that notwithstanding

the  provisions of subsection (1) of section 8  of  the

Ordinance, the right of action under the judgment shall

vest  with the persons entitled to the benefit  of  the

judgment. This will enable the persons entitled to take

action  without  joining  the  Public  Trustee  in  the

action. The Bill has been referred to the Singapore Bar

Committee which supports the proposed amendment.

<div align="center"><b>BILL</b></div>



<br><br>4.09 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I have His Excellency's  recommendation

that  the Bill be proceeded with. I beg to move,  "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our entrepot trade has brought prosperity to

Singapore and will continue to do so. But the expansion

of  this  sector of the economy is not expected  to  be

large enough to give jobs for all our unemployed. There

arises, therefore, an urgent need for industrialisation

in Singapore to create employment opportunities for our

rapidly  growing  population. This  need  is  generally

accepted. In



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>



order  to industrialise, sufficient incentives have  to

be  made available to induce local and overseas capital

to  flow  into manufacturing industries. The Government

have  done much to provide these incentives: first,  in

the development of adequate public utilities, roads and

other  facilities  to  make possible  rapid  industrial

expansion; second, in the establishment of the Economic

Development   Board   which  will  actively   encourage

industries   and  assist  businessmen  with  technical,

industrial   and   financial  assistance;   third,   in

providing industrial estates and sites for factories to

be  constructed  and purchased on an  extended  payment

basis  and at reasonable rates of interest; fourth,  in

providing  tax exemption on profit for five  years  for

new   industries   through   the   Pioneer   Industries

Ordinance,  1959; fifth, through technical  advice  and

assistance;  sixth,  through  an  expanded   vocational

training  in the Polytechnic, trade schools,  secondary

technical  schools  to  create  sufficient  numbers  of

skilled workmen needed in industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one other field which has not up

till now been fully exploited. This is the levelling of

tariff duties on a selective basis on imported goods to

protect  the  local industries in order  to  allow  for

their  expansion and to encourage the establishment  of

new  ones  in  Singapore. The reason for the  agitation

against the use of tariff protection is mainly that  of

the  possible  unfavourable effects they  have  on  our

entrepot  trade.  However,  our  brief  experience   in

protective tariff has shown that the effects  could  be

reduced  to a minimum or even be eliminated  if  tariff

duties  are  imposed  with due  care  on  selected  com

modities only. There should not be an indiscriminate or

general imposition of tariff duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the Government have accorded tariff protection

to  two imported articles, namely, soap and paint,  and

this  action has not caused any unfavourable effect  on

our   commercial  interest,  nor  has  it  reduced   or

adversely affected our entrepot trade, The decision  to

impose  tariff duties on soap and paint was made  after

considering  the  reports of the respective  committees

appointed  under  section 11 of the Customs  Ordinance.

However,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>



both  committees encountered difficulties in  obtaining

information,  and  it was clear that the  machinery  as

provided   in   the  Customs  Ordinance   has   serious

weaknesses.  One  over-riding difficulty  was  that  of

obtaining   accurate  and  reliable  information.   The

committee  did not have the power to compel  interested

parties  to  divulge  such information.  The  delay  in

submitting  their findings has been  due,  in  a  large

measure,  to this, and in particular to the  difficulty

encountered  in  ascertaining specific  information  on

prices of imported goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is essential, if the development of manufacturing

industries  is  not to be delayed, for a proper  Tariff

Advisory  Commission to be set up  with  the  necessary

authority  to obtain whatever information it  needs  to

assess  whether any particular industry requires tariff

protection. Without this authority, the Commission will

not be able to function quickly and effectively and the

Government will not have the necessary data on which to

reach  a  proper evaluation. The purpose of the  Tariff

Advisory  Commission Bill now before the  House  is  to

overcome  the  weaknesses that now exist  in  operating

section  11 of the Customs Ordinance, and to  vest  the

required  statutory  powers  to  obtain  the  necessary

information  in  the Tariff Advisory Commission  to  be

established  under this Bill. When such information  is

available,  the  Government  would  be  able  to   make

decisions on the basis of properly ascertained facts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the Tariff Advisory Commission Bill

are  mainly  procedural and can be  briefly  stated  as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Tariff Advisory Commission will consist of a

Chairman  and  between two and four other members.  The

Commission  can also co-opt on an ad hoc basis  one  or

more persons with special knowledge of the matter under

inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Minister may refer to the Commission to inquire

and report on any of the following matters relating to:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The granting of protection for the encouragement

of any industry in Singapore, including any industry

which has not commenced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>



production but which is likely  to  do  so  if

granted equitable protection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The modification or abolition of any prevailing

customs  or other duties levied for the protection

of any industry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The action to be taken where the industry is

taking  undue  advantage of the tariff  protection

granted to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The effect of protection of the general level of

prices in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Any anomalies that may result from the working of

protective duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) The manner in which protection in relation to any

industry has, been working.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission may, inter alia., require any person to

produce  documents and provide information under  oath.

The    Tariff    Advisory   Commission   will,    after

investigation, make its recommendations in a report  to

the  Minister and he will take whatever action he deems

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b> will note that the intention of the Bill

goes   beyond  merely  the  imposition  of   protective

tariffs.  The Bill empowers the Government to  initiate

inquiries   on  protected  industries  &  should,   for

instance,   any  of  these  take  undue  advantage   of

protection by failing to reduce costs and prices  where

they can do so. It is not the purpose of protection  to

bring  about high costs and inefficient producers,  and

the Tariff Advisory Commission will be charged with the

duty  of  keeping constant surveillance on the workings

of protected industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the Bill affects the interests one way or

another  of many sections of our economy, I  intend  to

commit  this  Bill  to  Select Committee  so  that  all

concerned  may have an opportunity of submitting  their

views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.19 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we

support the principle of the Bill, but we must point

out to the Government that while it is a good thing to

consider the imposition of a protective tariff to help

the industrialisation programme of the Government, they

must not lose sight of the fact that the biggest factor

to encourage the inflow of foreign capital for

industrialisation is the political climate and the

industrial atmosphere. The political climate in

Singapore today is most unhealthy. We have a Government

which is so fond and so proud of telling the world that

it is -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are now on the general merits

and principle of the Bill. I cannot see how what the

Member for Cairnhill is saying has anything to do with

the general merits and principle of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in moving the

motion, the Minister did give an account of the various

factors   which  he  considered  would  induce  foreign

capital to flow into Singapore for industrialisation. I

was  just  trying  to  point out to  him  that  he  had

overlooked one most important factor, and that  is  the

political climate and the industrial relations climate,

both of which are most unhealthy and very discouraging,

so much so that no matter what plans the Government may

have  to encourage the inflow of foreign capital,  they

have failed miserably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is one point on which I would like to

congratulate the Government. For the first  time  since

they  came to power in 1959, they have come to  realise

that  the members of a board or a commission shall  not

be  Members of the Assembly. Previously, when they  had 43 Members on their side, they insisted that Members of

the  Assembly should have a right to sit on a board  or

commission,  and every time it was a P.A.P. Assemblyman

and  nobody else. While it is a good thing,  Sir,  that

Members  of  the Assembly are now not permitted  to  be

appointed to the Tariff Advisory Commission, may I  ask

the  Government to remember this too; that they  should

not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>



continue   with   their   evil  practice   of   loading

commissions  with  men who will only  play  the  P.A.P.

game?  In order to make this Tariff Advisory Commission

a  success,  I  hope the Minister will appoint  men  of

integrity, men who will work with the interests of  the

country  at heart, and not men who will only  work  for

the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in clause 6, the Commission has powers to co-opt

one or more members who possesses special knowledge  of

any matter relevant to any inquiry. But if a person  is

so  appointed because of his special knowledge, he will

come  up against clause 8. He will have either a direct

or an indirect pecuniary interest. How is that going to

operate?  To  appoint on an ad hoc basis a person  with

special  knowledge of a particular subject and  yet  to

say  that  if  he  has  a direct or indirect  pecuniary

interest  he should not be present - perhaps the Minister

can  explain that. Perhaps the Government will, in full

realisation  of their past mistakes and the  folly  of

their industrialisation programme, come to an awakening

that the only way to solve the unemployment problem  is

to  see that their industrialisation plan succeed;  and

the  only  way  to make it succeed is to see  that  the

political  climate is healthy and that  the  industrial

relations  field is conducive to the inflow of  foreign

capital.



<br><br>4.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is

a  Bill  to  assist in nibbling away at the  free  port

status  of  Singapore. If we can accept  the  principle

that individual Ministers can have vast powers to place

tariffs  on articles, then, of course, we can say  that

the Bill is helpful in that they have the assistance of

a Commission, though itself appointed by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I rise to sound a note of warning on, Sir, is

that there does not seem to be adequate appreciation of

the  long-term danger of nibbling away at our free port

traditions. The Minister for Finance has told you  that

for the past few months, we have had a duty on soap and

a  duty on paint. The one on soap, Sir, I think,  is  a

matter of one month,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>



and  he  says there has been no adverse effect  on  our

economy.  He shows very little regard, Sir, either  for

the  intelligence of this House or he himself has  very

little understanding of the factors to imagine that one

or  two'  duties  over an extremely limited  period  of

weeks   could   affect  the  picture  sufficiently   to

prejudice  more  than a, century of tradition  of  free

port  for Singapore. But the matter of these individual

tariffs  is cumulative in effect, Sir, and  as  we  add

tariffs, then the information will seep through and the

knowledge  will expand that Singapore is  no  longer  a

free  port.  It  is that, Sir, that can  and  seriously

adversely  affect  our entrepot economy.  The  Minister

pays passing tribute to our entrepot economy, but seems

to  think  of  it  as  no more than  secondary  to  his

industrialisation baby.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I accept that industrialisation can become an

important element in this State's economy. But I do say

that  it cannot replace our entrepot economy which must

at  all  times  be  the cornerstone  of  any  financial

policy. An economy so little understood by the Minister

that  he  seeks with derision to inquire  what  purpose

there  could be in an exploratory mission to such  vast

areas  of  potential commercial activity as  India  and

China. With that attitude, Sir, one can destroy, not in

the  next two years, but one can lay the basis for  the

destruction  of  our economy. I am not unaware  of  the

possible importance of what the Minister calls selected

cases  of tariffs. Those selected cases must  be  of  a

character  which really bring in a considerable  amount

of    employment    and   have   little   international

repercussions   or  at  least  repercussions   on   our

international  trade. I would be far happier,  Sir,  if

the   provisions  which  seek  to  amend  the   Customs

Ordinance, which are coming after this Bill, were of  a

character  which  would  permit  this  House  to   pass

judgment  on  the  tariffs recommended  by  the  Tariff

Advisory Commission. But that is not to be, and I  rise

in opposition to the general principle of nibbling away

by  individual Ministers at the free port reputation of

this island.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> No one from our side,

Sir,  can  quarrel with the intention of  the  Bill  to

provide an edifice for an industrial complex unless  he

believes  that Singapore can survive on entrepot  trade

alone.  The  need for necessary tariff  protection  for

Singapore's  industries is obvious.  Industries  cannot

grow  in  the  teeth  of  formidable  competition  with

foreign  goods  that  come into  the  Singapore  market

through  the free port and across the Johore  Causeway.

What  appears  to be undesirable in this  Bill  is  the

absence of any provision that makes it incumbent on the

proposed Tariff Advisory Commission to keep the  people

informed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 (2) of the Bill confers on the Commission

unwarrantable  powers of secrecy  with  regard  to  the

proceedings of the Commission. Furthermore, there is no

provision to publish the reports of the Commission upon

which  the  Government's  decision  of  protection  for

industry is based. The people therefore are deprived of

the  right  of access to the necessary information  and

documents  without  which sound  judgment  may  not  be

possible.  We do not like to see a repetition  of  what

happened  recently when the Government took a  decision

to  give protection to the paint manufacturing industry

in Singapore. The Government did not publish the report

of the Advisory Committee although action was taken. We

are not unaware of the necessity for the maintenance of

trading  secrets in individual firms in  the  industry,

but  we  are  of the view that the proceedings  of  the

Commission should, as far as possible, be open  to  the

public   unless   and  until  the  Commission   decides

otherwise. We would like the people to have free access

to the findings and recommendations of the Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also puzzled, Sir, over the timing of this

Bill.  It is common knowledge that an early realisation

of  the  common commodity market is out of the question

whatever  the  Outcome of the political  schemings  and

machinations as regards Malaysia and the P.A.P. merger.

The last time we heard about the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>



common   commodity  market  was  the  joint  communique

announcing  the plan to appoint a team of international

experts  to  study  the  problem.  We  would  like  the

Minister  to  inform  the people of  Singapore  whether

such  a  team has been appointed. If not, is there  any

likelihood of one being appointed, and when?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> To the question from the Member for

Queenstown,  I  have  already  explained   the   latest

developments  with regard to the appointment  of  these

experts.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister can amplify, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is not a question of

amplification.  I think the Minister  has  pointed  out

that  he  has made a statement, and if the  Member  for

Queenstown is not satisfied, he can say how he  is  not

satisfied.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is possible that I did not hear

him  when  he gave the explanation, but he  can  always

repeat it for the benefit of all of us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, we would like to know whether the government-to-government talks on the common commodity market

between  Singapore and the Federation are  still  going

on.  What we cannot understand is, how does the  P.A.P.

Government reconcile its contention that Singapore will

not  be able to survive without a larger economic  unit

with  what  is implied in the present Bill  which  pre-supposes   the  viability  of  Singapore's   industrial

development?  We believe that the economy of  Singapore

is  viable  and,  as such, any measure that  Government

wants  to  take  to strengthen this viability  will  be

welcome.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Minister, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, three Members of

the  Opposition from three different Parties have given

three different versions of the intention .of this Bill

and of what it hopes to achieve.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sense, of course, their criticisms have cancelled

out  one another, as I will shortly explain. First, the

Member for Cairnhill says that the political climate is

unhealthy  and  that industrial relations  are  at  the

present  moment not conducive to investment of  capital

in  industries. Now, Sir, I would agree with the second

proposition, but certainly not with the first. I  would

have  thought  that the political climate is  eminently

healthy  to attract capital. The Government is carrying

on with its long-term plans for merger and Malaysia. We

see the Barisan Sosialis, who only a year ago predicted

the  October Revolution, now in despair sending  troops

of  little  kids down the desolate streets of Singapore

each  Sunday.  I would have thought that the  political

situation  is extremely healthy other than, of  course,

for  the  Communists and their stooges in  the  Barisan

Sosialis.  We  have  debated the matter  of  industrial

relations in this Assembly, and I do not think  I  want

to  say  much  more about it except that this  Bill  is

intended  as  a long-term measure and we  must  not  be

dissuaded by temporary inconveniences. We are certainly

not  going  to wait until the industrial  scene  is  as

peaceful  as  it can be. I suggest, Mr  Speaker,  Sir,

that will come about after merger and Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now one nagging criticism which the Member for

Cairnhill always brings up in this Assembly is that the

P.A.P. always appoint P.A.P. men to P.A.P. Boards,  as

if  this is a thoroughly reprehensible practice. May  I

suggest  that  this practice is carried  out  in  every

democratic  country? When Mr Churchill was  the  Prime

Minister  and  the  Conservative  Government  was   the

government of the day, they appointed Conservatives  to

important  posts in the Boards. There is nothing  wrong

with  that. The Member for Cairnhill can hardly  expect

the   P.A.P. to  appoint  `his  cronies  to  important

positions. May I suggest, Sir, that the persons that we

have  appointed to important positions are doing a very

good job of work? For example, Mr Lim Kim San, who  is

the  Chairman of the Housing Board, has really  done  a

magnificent piece of work, building low-cost houses at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>



all-time  record in Singapore. He does it for free.  He

is not taking any money.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Is he P.A.P.?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He is not P.A.P. But unlike the

Member  for Anson, he can see a good Party and  he  can

respect good men when he sees them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think I will dwell at length on what the

Member for Cairnhill says on the conflict between a man

with special knowledge and the same man having a direct

interest in the industry concerned. The sort of special

knowledge  which  the Tariff Advisory Commission  might

want  would be purely on account of technical knowledge

of   some   kind  or  other.  For  instance,   in   the

investigation into qualities of toothpaste and  so  on,

they  may find that they need the services of a chemist

or  they  may  want the services of a special  type  of

accountant  for analysing the import prices of  certain

things.   Insofar  as  a  general  knowledge   of   any

particular  industry is concerned, the Tariff  Advisory

Commission  will  have men who have some  knowledge  of

such  an  industry.  But  as I say,  in  assessing  and

evaluating data, they often do require experts  of  one

sort - chemists,   physicists,   accountants   or    even

mathematicians, for all I know. That is the purpose  of

this  particular clause. The reason is  that  when  the

Minister  is making the initial appointment, he  cannot

foresee the types of problems which the Tariff Advisory

Commission may encounter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will recall that the Member for Anson started

his  ministerial career as Singapore's  first  Minister

for  Trade. Therefore, one would have thought  that  he

had   benefited  from  his  experience  in  his   first

ministerial post. But his speech has given me  quite  a

contrary  impression. He says that one of the  damaging

long-term  effects  of the Bill would  be  that  people

would  know - that knowledge would seep through,  in  his

own  words - that Singapore is no longer a free port, and

that  this would eventually, if not immediately, affect

our entrepot trade adversely. With due respect, Sir,  I

suggest   that  it  is  utter  and  complete  nonsense.

Singapore's entrepot trade is done



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>



by businessmen. There is no mystic about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I had better explain the simple economic

fundamentals of this so-called entrepot trade. It looks

very   nice  if  you  talk  about  entrepot  trade   or

international  trade, but the basic  element  is  quite

simple. Singapore is in the centre of South-East  Asia.

It has sea communications with hundreds of little ports

along  the coast of central and south Sumatra,  Borneo,

the  east  coast of the Malay Peninsula, good rail  and

road communications with southern Malaya. It is because

of  these  excellent sea, road and rail  communications

that  we are best equipped to supply these people  with

goods  that  they  want  at the lowest  possible  cost.

Secondly,  because of a highly developed transportation

system, we are best equipped to buy from them the goods

that they produce. It is as simple as that. It does not

depend  on  subjective or psychological attitudes..  It

does  not depend on whether knowledge seeps upwards  or

downwards  or  backwards.  So  long  as  our  port   is

sufficient and so long as steamship lines and  railways

operate  sufficiently, it will continue to serve  as  a

supply  base  and  as  a  market for  our  neighbouring

territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must congratulate the Member for Queenstown on

some  of  his  words. He shows a spark of understanding

which  I  never suspected existed in his mind. He  puts

the  position very, nicely when he says this:  that  we

must  support tariffs unless we believe that  Singapore

can  live  on  trade  alone. The Member  for  Anson  is

opposed to tariffs because he thinks it will damage the

entrepot trade. Quite unlike the Member for Queenstown,

he  believes that we can live on tirade alone. Any  man

who  can  believe  in such an absurd  proposition.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, is beyond convincing by rational methods,

so I will not attempt that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown says the secrecy provisions

of  this Bill are regrettable, although he acknowledges

that there are instances where trade secrets have to be

preserved.  But  he  thinks that the  sittings  of  the

Commission  should be in public, unless the  Commission

decides



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>



otherwise. Sir, clause 15 (2) of the  Bill  says

that the sittings of the Commission shall be in private

unless  the Commission decides otherwise. So I  do  not

see  any  real issue between the Member for  Queenstown

and  myself. There may be a subtle difference, but  it

is beyond my mind to comprehend it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Member for Queenstown winds up with a

discourse  on the viability of Singapore's  economy  to

flourish  in isolation. I have no doubt that in  saying

these words he has in mind what Tunku Abdul Rahman said

recently about closing the Causeway.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You encouraged the Tunku.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I encouraged the Tunku, Mr

Speaker, Sir? On the one hand, they say, "Why don't  we

have  a  common commodity market?" If I could encourage

Tunku  Abdul Rahman to such an extent, may  I  suggest,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that we would have  got  a  common

commodity market. No, Sir. These people have been doing

things  and  frightening everybody. They do  not  know.

They  may  not  know it. And they have already  brought

upon  themselves  a foretaste of what  will  happen  to

Singapore  should there be no merger.  Then  they  will

bring upon themselves far greater misfortunes which  we

will not dwell upon at this stage.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> False hopes of the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, they always accuse us of

hoping  that retribution or disaster will befall  them,

and  we keep on saying that our only purpose in drawing

their  attention to a future disaster is to tell  them,

"Please  don't do these foolish things. You only  bring

disaster  upon  yourselves." Sir, all  our  admonitions

have always been greeted with scepticism perhaps, but I

suspect  that inwardly they are becoming more and  more

convinced  that what we say will happen  and  is  truer

than they would like to admit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, viability of Singapore's economy in

isolation - to me this question is a purely academic one,

because if you were to deliver a lecture on this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>



subject to, say, a group of professional economists you

must  define  various  things:  what  do  you  mean  by

isolation?  Do  you mean that the people  of  Singapore

(1,700,000 of them) should live in isolation  as,  say,

Robinson  Crusoe  did  in  the  past?  That   sort   of

isolation,  I say, is not possible because  you  cannot

grow  enough food to feed 1,700,000 people.  Therefore,

what   degree  of  isolation  do  you  mean?  And  this

presupposes  all  kinds of political relationship  with

our  neighbours.  A  friendly Federation  would  be  of

immense  economic benefit to Singapore. They  can  even

help  us  to  bring  about  a common  commodity  market

without  any  further trouble. On  the  other  hand,  a

hostile  Federation can not only cause acute discomfort

to  Singapore but tremendous loss. This proposition  is

so obvious that I do not think any sane main will argue

the  case out. But I raise this point because  I  think

there  may  be  an impression among some Members  that

with  merger and Malaysia, why have this?  Will  it  no

longer  be  necessary? When you have a common commodity

market,  why  do  you want a separate  Tariff  Advisory

Commission? I would say that whether there is a  common

commodity market or not, there is need for this  Tariff

Advisory  Commission. If there is no  common  commodity

market,  then we have, of course, a tariff against  the

rest  of the world, including the Federation of Malaya,

since  the  Federation are not prepared  to  co-operate

with  us  and have a joint industrialisation programme.

Then  we  go  it  alone and must  impose  a  tariff  on

products  manufactured in the Federation of Malaya  and

exported to Singapore. But even if there were a  common

commodity  market, obviously from time  to  time  there

would  be  instances when the Government would consider

whether this industry should be established and, if so,

would  the  imposition of a protective duty assist  the

position of the industry? If you have a tariff duty and

you  have this industry, how do you gauge the value  of

the  new  industry  and  employment  against  consumers

having  to pay slightly higher prices? As I have  said,

the  same problem will confront the Government  whether

we have a common



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>



commodity  market  with  the Federation  of  Malaya  or

within Greater Malaysia or whether we go it alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have said, this is a basic

departure  from the laissez-faire policy of the  State.

It  is for this reason that we are committing this Bill

to  a  Select Committee so that all interested  parties

can   ventilate  their  opinions  before   the   Select

Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I have His Excellency's  recommendation

that  the  Customs (Amendment) Bill be proceeded  with.

Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tariff Advisory Commission Bill has been read a

Second time a little while ago. The setting up of  this

Commission under the Bill will require an amendment  to

section  11  of  the  Customs  Ordinance,  1960.   This

amendment  is  necessary because  the  Tariff  Advisory

Commission  will  replace the Committee  consisting  of

three  persons appointed by the Minister. The Bill  now

before  the  House  is  to  effect  this  consequential

amendment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has not

seen  fit to draw attention to a major aspect  of  this

Bill,  and that is the transfer of the power  from  the

Cabinet  to  the individual Minister; that is  to  say,

deleting  the  name of the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara  and

substituting  therefor  the  Minister  as  the   person

authorised  to impose these duties and, to  vary  them.

Mr Speaker, I think you will find somewhere in Chaucer

a  rather delightful story of a young man who seeks  to

bang  his  head  against  the wall  of  ignorance.  The

curious  thing  is that Chaucer never  recognised  that

perhaps  the greatest bar to recognition of  logic  and

reason is personal malice. I sought, in speaking on the

previous Bill, to draw attention to the fact that there

was  a  danger  in  these  tariffs  nibbling  away  and

nullifying  our tradition as an entrepot port,  a  free

port.  I  made the point, Sir, that I recognised  there

would  be cases where individual industries could  have

the  potential for employment of a considerable  number

of  people,  and in those individual cases  it  may  be

appropriate  to grant tariff protection; but  that  any

such  breach  in  the tradition of  the  free  port  of

Singapore  should be made by this Assembly  after  full

debate.  I  was  represented by the Minister  as  being against  all tariffs. I also pointed out, Mr  Speaker, Sir, that an entrepot port does live on its reputation. There  is  mystique  in  reputation.  The  point,   Mr Speaker,  is  that where a country needs  supplies,  it comes  to Singapore now because it knows it can  obtain

its supplies duty free. But if the time comes when some

of  the goods will be duty free and some will not,  and

it  is  a  question  of differentiation  and  different

ordering,  then such countries may find  it  much  more

convenient to go to an alternative port. There  is  one

very  handy  as a centre of supply, and  that  is  Hong

Kong. Sir, my point is this. I do not like the idea  of

an  individual  having the power to bring  about  grave

breaches  in our tradition as a free port,  and  it  is

that aspect of the Bill to which I take exception.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Gob, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member for Anson considers,

that   before  import  duties  are  to  be  levied   in

Singapore, they must be approved by the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not by the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member for Anson was

Singapore's  first Minister of Trade, and I  am  really

aghast that a ludicrous proposition such as this should

come  from  him. Sir, the decision to impose an  import

duty  has  many  and serious implications.  First,  the

timing.  Second,  the  amount of  such  duties.  It  is

obvious  that  if  you want to have  duties  levied  on

goods,  it  must  be done quickly and with  the  utmost

secrecy.  Otherwise,  before  duties  are  raised,  the

market  will  be  brought to disorder  by  hoarding  by

speculators  and  by  all sorts of  malpractices.  This

point should be obvious to the Member for Anson. And  I

cannot  understand  how  so obvious  a  point  has  not

occurred to him. When you want to impose a duty, it  is

not possible to have a debate in the Assembly. You have

to give notice of such debate, by which time there will

be  hoarding.  Goods  will have  disappeared  from  the

market,  and the entrepot trade which the Member  seeks

to  safeguard will be reduced to utter chaos the moment

people know that Government is contemplating imposing a

tariff  On  a  particular day. If this is left  to  the

decision  of  the Government to do so,  the  scope  for

speculative  activity and manipulation  in  the  market

will be considerably reduced, although I grant that  it

cannot be eliminated in all cases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the change, the amendment to delegate the

powers  which are now exercised by the Cabinet  to  the

Minister, I do not know why this should cause  so  much

concern to the Member for Anson. This amendment  is  in

accordance  with  the practice in the  Federation,  and

there  are excellent reasons for so doing, one of which

is  security of information, security of the secret, or

the  timing  or  the  amount of such  duty.  These  are

important  considerations. I do not think I need  reply

to the other points raised by him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>

consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and five Members.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As the two Bills are related, I do not

                   by description by means of a

                   forward contract;".'.

                   -[Dr Goh Keng Swee].

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought up, and read the First time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, I move, "That the clause

be read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This clause is substantially the same clause which was

negatived  by  the Committee of the whole  Assembly  on

15th January, 1962, and it is the only single clause of

the  Rubber Dealers (Amendment) Bill. Hon. Members will

recall  that this Bill seeks to amend section 2 of  the

Rubber  Dealers Ordinance by providing a definition  of

the  word  "purchase",  for  the  purpose  of  removing

uncertainty prevailing in the rubber market as  to  the

validity  of  rubber contracts. This uncertainty  arose

from the decision of the Court of Appeal in the case of

Mizrahie versus Stanton Nelson Company Ltd., details of

which were given in the speech of the Second Reading of

the  Bill.  The  Government considers it  necessary  to

restore  this clause in view of a recent Federation  of

Malaya appeal allowed by the Judicial Committee of  the

Privy  Council on the ground that the currency was  not

licensed under the Rubber Dealers Ordinance to purchase

rubber. Singapore's economy is largely founded  on  the

rubber  trade. Today she is the world's largest  rubber

market.  Forward dealings are carried out in all  major

commodity  markets of the world. It is  absurd  in  the

world's  largest rubber market that there should  be  a

legal  ambiguity whether or not forward  contracts  are

enforceable  in  law. Yet this is  the  effect  of  the

Rubber  Dealers Ordinance as it stands, and the  effect

is  clearly  not the intention. The proposed definition

makes  it clear that only purchases of specific  rubber

completed by delivery need be covered by a licence  and

that  all contracts in purchase of unascertained rubber

by  description do not require a licence on the part of

the  purchaser.  Thus it would ensure  that  legitimate

hedging  operations could be carried out  without  fear

that  such  contracts would be declared  void  and  the

gambling - reckless speculation - would be  curbed  as  the

contract  becomes  enforceable  in  law.  I  understand

corresponding amending legislation is being



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>



considered in the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Question is, "That the clause be

read a Second time." We debate now on the principle  of

the clause.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister has told

you  that this clause is necessary in order to  protect

legitimate hedging operations. Sir, what is  a  hedging

operation?  A  genuine dealer in rubber  undertakes  to

deliver,  let  us say, a hundred tons of  rubber  to  a

consignee in Germany. The delivery is in June. Then  he

goes round purchasing that physical rubber and projects

himself  against a fall by making some  purchases  now,

some  purchases in May and the final purchases in  time

for  delivery in Germany. These are the genuine dealers

in  rubber. These are the backbone of the rubber trade.

These  are the people who, irrespective of whether  the

amendment is passed or not, must take out licences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the obnoxious part of this Bill is that it seeks

not  to  protect hedging as is alleged, but to  protect

pure   gamblers - those  who  have  not  the   slightest

intention   or  interest  in  receiving  or   supplying

physical rubber. The Minister himself in the debate  on

the 15th of January spoke of paper rubber dealings.  He

wants  to  legalise paper rubber dealings  without  the

requirement  of  a licence. It is not the  question  of

hedging  purchases or hedging sales. Those  people  who

make deliveries must take out licences under the Rubber

Dealers  Ordinance. It is not they  whom  he  seeks  to

protect.  What is sought, in the words of the  Minister

for  Finance, is to legalise dealings in paper  rubber.

Mr  Speaker, Sir, these are gambling deals. I  say  to

you  the  approach  of this House  should  be  that  we

deplore  gambling.  We recognise  that  stock  exchange

gambling is one of the diseases which seem inherent  in

a  free  economy and we will interfere  insofar  as  is

necessary  to  minimise  the vicious  effects  of  such

gambling upon the small man. In this case, a ruling  of

the Court of Appeal has indicated that in order to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>



gamble  in rubber, the person who makes those purchases

should  take out a licence. It is no more serious  than

that, Sir. All you have to do is to take out a licence.

The Minister must admit that there is not the slightest

impediment  to  anybody  taking  out  a  licence.   His

character  is  not investigated. He is  not  asked  his

political affiliations. There is no enquiry as to  what

publications he has been associated with. You put  down

$600 a year; you put down a deposit of $1,000; you take

out  your  licence to deal in rubber; you go ahead  and

gamble to your heart's content.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is alleged that this amendment is vital to the

economy  of  Singapore. But, Mr  Speaker,  have  those

people  who  deal in a manner that is material  to  the

economy of Singapore in matters of rubber not got $600

a  year  for a licence or a $1,000 refundable  deposit?

That  is  all.  What I say is that anyone  whom  it  is

sought  to inveigle into buying or selling paper rubber

should be sufficiently conscious of the gravity of  his

action  and that this mild impediment of a $600 licence

plus a deposit would be at least some deterrent. It  is

no more than that. I ask this House to consider what is

wrong  with  this very minimal protection that  is  now

available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you are not unconscious that there is in times of boom or depression a large flux in prices of commodities like tin and rubber in this island when hopes of golden fortunes are held out to small men if they would come in and gamble on the stock exchange. It is to this silent voice of temptation to large-scale and ruinous gambling that I urge we leave the existing protection which says that if you, Mr Clerk, who earns

only  $400 a month, are going to lend yourself to  this

plan  to  make vast fortunes or incur great losses,  at

least  you  must  first of all  put  down  $600  for  a

licence.  In  Monte  Carlo  you  need  no  licence.  In

Singapore we do not ban large-scale gambling.  We  only

ban  gambling for the small man. The Chee Fah  and  the

Fantan participants are criminals. The gentlemen of the

rubber  exchange who gamble in vast sums are  essential

for our economy. But all we ask is that they pay $600 a

month  for  a  licence. Paper rubber  gambling  is  not

essential



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>



and  is  no  part  of  the healthy development  of  our

economy.  The  anxiety  indicated  by  this  Government

behind this move is a recognition by the rubber brokers

that the small man in Singapore and in Malaya who has a

little  money  and  who is beginning  to  understand  a

little about investing can be tempted to participate in

a gamble to buy and sell future paper rubber - to indulge

in paper transactions in which he can make money, it is

true, and he can also lose sums beyond his capacity  to

meet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for a licence that exists today checks these

small investors from entering too freely and too rashly

on  the  road to ruin. I ask, Sir, why in the  name  of

sanity, if not of decency, do we have to encourage  the

little  man  with little money to lend himself - and  his

family  - to being a victim of rubber brokers and  paper

rubber gambling?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is our interest? Is it the protection of the

people  of  Singapore, or is it the protection  of  the

capitalists  and  the  greater  glory  of  the   rubber

brokers?  What  is  this  P.A.P. Government - a  gambling

society?  Or  has the Minister so much imbibed  of  the

heavy  wine of capitalist hospitality that  he  has  no

more  feeling  for the little man and the little  man's

needs?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is stated in the Explanatory Note to this Bill that we will be losing $39,000 a year in licence fees. That means $39,000 from persons who should be taking out licences today to gamble in paper rubber. But these are definitely persons who do not engage in the honest sale or honest purchase of physical rubber because, if they did, they would still have to obtain licences. There are therefore these

gamblers  who even now take out licences.  But  if  you

divide  $39,000  by  600, Mr Speaker,  you  will  find

fortunately that the number today of those  who  gamble

in  paper rubber is not great, not great enough to meet

the  insatiate greed of the capitalist friends of  this

capitalist  Government.  I  do  plead  for  a  rational

answer.  What  is the objection to the existing  system

whereby  those who want to indulge in this roulette  in

the  golden  El Dorado should be required to  pay  $600

entrance fee a year?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, listening to the Member

for Anson speaking on this particular section, it seems

to  me that if the point to his objection is one  of  a

permit  to  gamble,  then he has missed  the  boat.  He

should  have taken objection when the amendment to  the

Civil  Law  Ordinance was moved and that was  the  time

when the objection should have been taken. As far as  I

can  remember, the Member for Anson was present in  the

House on that occasion when the amendment was moved  to

the  Civil  Law  Ordinance which at that  time  forbade

gambling  contracts to be entered into. But  subsequent

to  that amendment, gambling contracts which have  been

declared  illegal or unenforceable under the Civil  Law

Ordinance  now can be enforced in a court  of  law.  If

that  is  the correct position and if it was the  Civil

Law  Ordinance that dealt with the gambling  aspect  of

any  particular  contract, why then is the  Member  for

Anson raising that particular problem which should have

been  discussed on that particular amendment in respect

of  the  Rubber Dealers Ordinance, which does not  deal

with the gambling side of a rubber transaction?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, so far as I am concerned, this

clause  which  seeks to define the word "purchase"  has

become  necessary as a result of the amendment  to  the

Civil Law Ordinance. We on this side of the House voted

for  the  amendment to the Civil Law Ordinance  and  we

would  have voted with the Government on this.  I  will

now  inform  the  Minister for  Finance  why  we  voted

against  it.  On  that  occasion,  when  a  number   of

questions were being asked by Members of the Opposition

with  regard to the operation of this clause, they were

treated  cavalierly; no proper answers were  given.  It

was  for  that  reason that we did not  vote  with  the

Government  on  that occasion. I mention this  because,

having  voted  with the Government  on  the  Civil  Law

Ordinance,  we  could not object to this  amendment  in

principle.



<br><br>6.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we voted against the Government on that occasion

to show our displeasure at the manner in which the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>



Government was treating the Opposition when it was

raising what we thought were legitimate queries on how

this particular section would operate. Now if the

Government is prepared to give all the proper

explanations on this particular section in a manner

which it did not think fit to give on the last

occasion, we will certainly vote for the Bill on this

occasion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one would have

thought that the subject of a rubber market is a

serious one. It is not a subject which one can embark

on with wild fanciful oratory. Yet we have been treated

by the Member for Anson to another prima donna

exhibition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have explained to Members that Singapore is the

world's largest rubber market. It has achieved its

unique position not by the gambling propensities of

rubber brokers. A rubber market of such eminence takes

many decades to build up, and to dismiss all dealings

in paper rubber as sheer gambling, roulette gambling,

is fantastic nonsense which I do not think any sane man

with knowledge of affairs would waste time to rebut.

But to give the Member for Anson his fair chance, I am

unable to swallow the logic of his submission. First he

says, "It is all right if they pay $600 a year." That

is the admission charge to the "casino", as he calls

the rubber market. But he wants to protect the class of

small men who he thinks go in the rubber market for an

occasional flutter. Then he castigates the group of

people who would be contributing some $39,000 a year to

Government revenue by taking up licences for dealings

in paper rubber. I cannot reconcile his two objections

and I will not try to swallow his arguments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only want to say something about the purposes for

which the Rubber Dealers Ordinance was introduced in

this country and in the Federation. The Bill goes back

to 1910, soon after the development of the rubber

industry. In its original form, it was just for the

purposes of administration. But after the First World

War, in 1921, the Federation of Malaya and Singapore

considered it necessary to restrict the production of

rubber in order to raise its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>



price. This was the first scheme. Then after the  great

depression in 1930, an international restriction scheme

was   established  between  the  Governments   of   the

Federation  and  Singapore, the then  Netherlands  East

Indies,   Thailand,  Ceylon  and  other  major   rubber

producing  countries. Therefore,  this  Rubber  Dealers

Ordinance  provides in the Federation and in  Singapore

for various administrative measures which are necessary

to  operate  a  restriction scheme to provide  for  the

inspection of licensed places, the proper and  accurate

accounting of purchases, dealers' stocks, and so on. We

had  no connection whatsoever with the operation of the

rubber  market as such. If it is the intention  of  the

Member for Anson that stock exchange hedging operations

are  legitimate  provided a fee is  paid,  then  may  I

suggest  that he has missed the point? He  himself  has

admitted  that under the existing Ordinance anyone  can

get  a  licence by paying a $1,000 deposit and  a  $600

annual  fee.  That is no way to ensure that  those  who

operate  the  rubber market are men of  some  financial

worth.   To   ensure  that  the  market   consists   of

businessmen  of repute, the Stock Exchange itself  will

have  to  make  rules  regulating the  conduct  of  its

members. This is what is being done by the rubber trade

associations  and  the Singapore Chamber  of  Commerce.

They  are  there to ensure that a certain  standard  of

integrity is maintained in the rubber industry  without

which it would not have been possible for Singapore  to

achieve  the  distinction of being the world's  largest

rubber market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained at some length, one handicap which

the rubber business suffers from today is the ambiguity

of the law in regard to the enforceability of contracts

and  it  is  this ambiguity which the Bill  before  the

House seeks to remove.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, can I speak again?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, we are in Committee. The Member can

speak as many times as he wishes.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged, Mr Speaker. The

Minister speaks of an ambiguity in the law that  it  is

necessary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>



for the welfare of our economy to clarify. Mr Speaker,

he  has not told you that the ambiguity is nothing more

serious than should you have a licence or need you have

a licence? That is all the ambiguity which he considers

so  vital  to remove for the enforcement of  contracts.

But  a  much  easier way and a healthier  way  for  the

people  is  that  the ambiguity should be  resolved  by

saying that all purchases whether in paper rubber or in

physical  rubber require a licence, and  let  them  pay

their  $600  a  month. What is the  difficulty  of  the

ambiguity that exists today? The people who are  paying

$39,000  a  year  are people who have  resolved  it  by

making sure and taking out licences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Farrer Park has made a speech that does him least credit of all the speeches I have ever heard from him. It was based on inaccuracies to justify a change of stand - awkward and embarrassing! I would not wish to turn the knife in the wound. He is sufficiently sensitive to know what he is doing. But I must draw attention to two major inaccuracies. His whole thesis is, "I do not like

you  as  I am on the Opposition side. We voted  against

you  because  you  were rude to the Opposition  in  the

questions  that  were  asked  about  this  Bill."   Mr

Speaker,  earlier,  I  expressed appreciation  of  your

foresight  in making available to Members the unrevised

transcript  of  the proceedings of 15th January,  1962,

which  dealt with this Bill and nowhere were there  any

questions   at   all.  There  were  speeches   by   the

Parliamentary Secretary, followed by me,  the  Minister

for  Finance and the Parliamentary Secretary. That  was

all  in  Committee. I spoke and nobody  even  cared  to

reply;  and  a  division was called.  Though  I  am  in

complete  accord with the Member for Farrer  Park  that

the  arrogance  of the Government side  is  of  such  a

character that it will sometimes provoke the Opposition

to  deal out of fashion with their proposals, I do  not

think  we should accept that in fact the S.P.A. negated

a  provision  which they considered essential  for  the

welfare  of  this country because they  considered  the

Government was rude about mythical



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>



questions which did not exist in respect o rude answers

that for a change had not materialised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other inaccuracy is: the Member is wrong in

thinking  that  I was in the Chamber at  the  time  the

Civil  Law  Ordinance  was  passed.  But  that  is  not

material as I trust I can point out to him. My interest

is  this. I have sought, I thought in my speech on  the

Second  Reading,  to point out that we  must  recognise

that in a free economy a certain amount of gambling  of

a   large-scale   character  by   big   financiers   is

inevitable. It was not gambling contracts in rubber  as

a whole that I sought to make illegal. My desire is the

protection not of the large financier but of the  small

man.  The  Civil  Law  Ordinance  made  these  gambling

contracts  legal. That is so. I feel, Sir,  much  as  I

dislike that provision. I am not sufficiently satisfied

that  to  make  those contracts illegal would  not,  in

fact,  in some measure prejudice the rubber trade which

we  have.  What I sought and what I seek  in  resisting

this  present proposal is to leave the mild  impediment

that exists today in requiring the small man to take  a

very  big  hurdle  in that $600 licence.  That  is  the

simple  logic. The Minister says I castigate those  who

pay  that  revenue to the State. Not at all.  They  are

gamblers and those who pay that $600 are gamblers  too.

The transaction is legitimate. I know it is legitimate.

I  do  not  like  it, Mr Speaker. I am  not,  however,

adequately satisfied that one can safely eliminate  all

that  gambling, but I am satisfied that it is essential

one should protect the small man from gambling and that

the  existing  law which requires him to  take  a  $600

licence   before  he  can  indulge  in   paper   rubber

transactions  is  some  impediment,  some   protection,

thought not complete.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I am not so naive that I can believe speeches in this House in the context of today have any material effect in changing minds. I am somewhat reminded of a biblical passage, "And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh." It is so true these days. But I do ask the S.P.A., who valiantly supported a reasonable resistance to the removal of a mild protection of the small man from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>



indulging in paper gambling, to reconsider their stand.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember, Mr Speaker, I was almost prophetic

when  I  rose on the motion to commit this Bill  for  a

Third Reading earlier this afternoon and suggested that

obviously  the  Government had  behind  the  scenes  so

manoeuvred  that  it was now satisfied  that  it  could

obtain a majority. I did not know then what we know now

of  the arrangement for voting which has transpired  in

the  speech of the Member for Farrer Park. But I  would

urge  that  the reason and the justice of the  position

should  prevail  against  any political  consideration,

association and undertaking.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> I fully realise, Mr Speaker, that on that

last  occasion when there was an equality of votes and,

therefore, the provision was negatived, the Member  for

Anson  was  the only speaker. So far as the Members  of

the  Front Bench of the Opposition were concerned, they

did  not  partake  in that opposition.  Then  when  the

Member for Anson was getting such a rough time from the

Government Benches, and he was not given proper replies

to  what  we  thought  were  legitimate  questions,  we

decided   to  vote  against  the  Government   because,

although  it was the Member for Anson who  was  at  the

wrong  end  of the stick, we thought that the questions

raised  by  him  were  legitimate  questions  to  which

reasonable answers should have been given. But as  they

were  not  provided and as from the Assembly  point  of

view  satisfactory  answers were not  given,  we  voted

against the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only question I raised on this matter was this.

The  Member  for Anson made his speech on  this  clause

which he should have made on the amendment to the Civil

Law  Ordinance.  The main part of his  speech  on  this

particular  section  of this clause  was  that  it  had

something to do with gambling. Now, if it was  gambling

that  the Member for Anson was against, then he  should

have  opposed  it  on the amendment to  the  Civil  Law

Ordinance.  It was the Civil Law Ordinance that  opened

the  gates  to  gambling. Having willingly  opened  the

gates to gambling, then the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>



for Anson says, "By all means, let us open the gates to

gambling.  But  if the poor man wants to  gamble  as  a

result of my having opened the gates, I will charge him

$600 a year."



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the Member in his question

asks, "Why not let these chaps pay $600 per year?" Sir,

I  have  explained  the origins of the  Rubber  Dealers

Ordinance and its connections with the physical control

over rubber movements that are necessary to enforce the

two  rubber  restriction schemes - one in  1921  and  the

other  one in the 1930's. There the Ordinance was never

intended to apply to rubber brokers and those who dealt

in paper rubber. It was only after this case before the

Court of Appeal that rubber brokers thought they should

attempt to regularise the position by taking out  these

licences.  That is the position. It is absurd  to  fall

back  on an unintended levy on the rubber market  in  a

state  which  the  Member for  Anson  thinks  would  be

healthy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all produce markets have some sections on paper

commodities. There is not a single commodity market  in

which  the  vast  majority of  such  sections  are  not

covered  by the physical product. That is so in rubber,

copper,  tin,  or any other commodity.  And  before  we

start fiddling around and imposing restrictions on  the

commodity  exchange,  particularly  on  one  in   which

Singapore is the world's largest, i would say we have a

duty  to make a proper and thorough examination of  the

system  of produce marketing. I suggest that the Member

for  Anson  has  made no such study.  He  is  blatantly

trying  to  appeal  to  people's  emotions  on  a  very

technical  matter. I say this is completely  wrong  for

any Member of the House to do



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put. "That the clause be read a Second time."

<br><br>6.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, I rise to

move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly solemnly assures the citizens of

Singapore that before arrangements are finalised for  a

closer  relationship  with  the  Federation  of  Malaya

and/or  the Borneo territories, and before any  request

is  made  by the Government of Singapore to the British

Government for transfer of territorial sovereignty over

Singapore to the Federation of Malaya or Malaysia,  the

wishes  of  the voters of Singapore will be ascertained

by referendum and the Government will act in accordance

with the views of our citizens so expressed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the last seven years our efforts to bring about an understanding of the value of the democratic process has had far more effect than is generally recognised. Although at times our efforts seem to be like water that disappears from the earth leaving no trace, nevertheless, Sir, that water has

irrigated the subsoil and there is to those of  us  who

seek to keep in touch with the common man of Singapore.

of the different communities, the realisation of a very

real  feeling by the people that there is  strength  in

the  democratic process and in the power to  appoint  a

government  and  to reject a Party.  It  is  true  that

recently our citizens have been increasingly puzzled by

the  capacity  of the democratic process to  produce  a

dictatorship  government between general elections.  It

is  true that there is at the moment, Sir, an incipient

sense  of  frustration and fear that the  people's  own

representatives whom the people trusted and  whom  they

elected  will seek to destroy it. It is principally  to

allay  this fear, a genuine fear in many circles,  that

this motion is brought in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said, Mr Speaker, that there is no need

for this motion, that the Prime Minister and the Deputy

Prime Minister, in their addresses to this Assembly  on

the  Referendum  Bill, have given assurances  that  the

people  will  be consulted before the proposals  for  a

closer  relationship  with the Federation,  which  they

call  a merger, are put into effect. I would draw  your

attention,  Mr Speaker, to the unhappy nature  of  the

statement of the Prime Minister which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>



itself gave impetus to the misgivings of our people.  I

do  not  know, Mr Speaker, whether your memory can  go

that   far  to  the  16th  of  March - it  is  only  last

month - when  the  Prime Minister in his address  on  the

Referendum  Bill  said.  "The question  of  winning  or

losing  a referendum does not arise. If there  was  the

slightest  risk  of  merger being  frustrated  and  the

country plunged into disaster by the activities of  the

Communists, let me say that it would be criminal  folly

on  the part of Government to hold a referendum and  to

allow   the  future  of  Malaya  and  Malaysia  to   be

imperilled.  If  that  were the  position, if  a  risk

existed;  then it is the duty of the Government  to  go

through with it to ensure that the peace, security  and

happiness  of the people not just of Singapore  but  of

Malaya and Malaysia are not jeopardised."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shorn of its frills, this statement of the Prime

Minister  means  two things. One;  all  those  who  are

against  the  White Paper proposals  are,  by  official

definition, Communists. Two, if there is any risk  that

those  against the White Paper proposals could negative

a  referendum, no referendum will be held. That is  the

democracy   of  the  Prime  Minister:  "I  believe   in

democracy as long as it is advantageous to me. But when

democracy  does  not support me, then  democracy  is  a

criminal  activity,  a criminal  folly  which  must  be

suppressed. My will is the will of the people,  but  if

the will of the people differs from my will, the people

are  criminals and I shall do what I think is good  for

them, not what they think is good for them."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is a couplet by Matthew Arnold:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Thoughts in hours of insight willed,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can he in hours of gloom fulfilled,'



<br><br>Those of us who seek to pursue, not only for ourselves,

the  road of democracy, but to help others not only  to

understand  it  and appreciate it  but  to  make  it  a

reality  for  this  country and other  countries  which

today suffer the rule of Communist dictatorship, we say

that there is a need to go back to first principles and

to give a solemn



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>



assurance to the people from the Assembly. Mr Speaker,

whatever  the ultimate result, the ultimate  action  on

the  White  Paper  proposals, an important  segment  of

Singapore  would  be  deeply  embittered  and   it   is

important  that the `division created should be  healed

as quickly as possible. If a referendum is held, giving

an  honest opportunity to the `people to express  their

views,  however  strongly the minority may  feel,  they

must  accept  the will of the majority. It  is  on  the

basis of this democratic principle of acceptance of the

will  of  .the  majority that  we  can  call  upon  the

minority to accept with good grace and without  lasting

bitterness the decision o, the majority. It is in  this

way  that I hope and I believe we can avoid a permanent

and  very  dangerous cleavage within our own  citizens,

whichever way the decision goes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, apart from the normal obvious reasons for a referendum in a matter of such gravity, I ask this House to note that the people of the Federation would themselves wish to be quite certain that despite the opposition indicated in Singapore, if there is to be .a closer relationship in pursuance of the White Paper agreement, such closer relationship is in fact voluntarily entered into by Singapore with the express

approval of the majority of its adult citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am disturbed, as very many others have been, by

recent  unfriendly  pronouncements  of  the  Federation

Prime Minister and these, to my mind ill-timed threats,

are causing a feeling of anxiety and suspicion that the

Federation has decided to annex Singapore whether  with

or without our permission. This is imperialism whatever

the  excuse. The pages of English colonial history  are

full  of  annexations  on  the  excuse  of  expediency.

Whatever  may  be the truth about the attitude  of  the

Federation  Government, Sir, I am  convinced  that  the

people  of  the  Federation as a whole would  feel  far

happier if there is a referendum whereby the people  of

Singapore could have an `honest opportunity to  express

their views so that no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>



question could possibly arise of domination imposed  in

imperialist fashion against the will of the  people  of

Singapore. It is these considerations which impel me to

urge  this  House-I plead by a unanimous vote-to  allay

the  fears  `oth  of  the people of Singapore  and  the

people of Federation in giving this assurance in solemn

form:  that  on  a matter of gravity, the  transfer  of

sovereignty  of Singapore, the will of the people  will

be  ascertained by process of direct democracy and will

be complied with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have all of us, I trust, in different ways sought

to  bring  about an appreciation of the  value  of  the

democratic process. I ask that through this  motion  we

reaffirm not only our faith in what we preach  but  our

intention to abide by what we preach. I would ask.  Mr

Speaker, that the bitterness of the different reactions

and  views in respect of the merits and demerits of the

White  Paper be not introduced into the debate on  this

motion.  I  would urge that the principle it  seeks  to

enunciate  should  be the one that  should  engage  the

exclusive attention of the House during the debate.  If

there  is any amendment which can better bring out  the

spirit  that I seek to enunciate, I would only  be  too

happy to consider it and to accept it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Members  of  this House will  recollect  that

during  the debate on merger between Singapore and  the

Federation  of  Malaya which lasted from  the  20th  of

November  to  the 6th of December, 1961,  everybody  in

this  House  accepted the desirability  of  merger  and

nobody denied that merger was inevitable. At the end of

that   debate  on  the  6th  of  December,  this  House

resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That as an immediate practical step towards the ideal

goal of complete merger this House accepts the heads of

agreement  set out in the White Paper Cmd. 33  of  1961

agreed  to  between the Governments  of  the  State  of

Singapore  and the Federation of Malaya  as  a  working

basis for a reunification of the two territories.'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, although the Government had the mandate in the

1959 general elections to settle the question of merger

between Singapore and the Federation, nevertheless,  we

felt  it desirable that the electorate should be  given

the  opportunity to express their views on the mode and

manner  of  the  reunification  of  Singapore  and  the

Federation.  Accordingly, on the 27th of November  last

year,  the  Minister  for Home Affairs  introduced  the

Singapore National Referendum Bill. This Bill is now in

Select Committee and at some future date after the Bill

has  passed  through its Third Reading, the  referendum

will  be  held.  The responsibility for executing  this

referendum   will   be   the  responsibility   of   the

Government.  The administration of the referendum  will

be  in  accordance  with the clauses of  the  Singapore

National Referendum Bill. In the Bill itself, provision

is   made  for  political  Parties  to  be  given   the

opportunity  to inform the electorate of the  terms  of

the referendum.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not like to interrupt the

Hon, the  Deputy Prime Minister, but he has  mentioned

that  the  Bill  is  now  before  a  Select  Committee.

Therefore, he must not assume that the clauses  in  the

Bill  will  be accepted. As far as possible, we  should

avoid referring to the details of the Bill.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I am just touching upon the Bill in

passing,  Mr Speaker. I have no intention  to  specify

any particular clause of the Bill itself. Although this

Bill  is still in Select Committee and has not yet been

reported  to  the  House,  the  Barisan  Sosialis  have

already  jumped  the  gun, and,  as  far  as  they  are

concerned,  the  campaign for  referendum  has  already

started.  The  Barisan Sosialis, in fact,  began  their

campaign  against merger and Malaysia on 1st of  April.

The  Barisan Sosialis have sought to represent that the

proposals  as contained in Cmd. Paper 33 are  proposals

which  have  been put forward only by the P.A.P.  As  a

matter  of  fact, Members of this House are aware  that

Cmd. Paper 33 also contains



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>



letters  exchanged between the Prime Ministers  of  the

Federation  and the Singapore Governments. These  state

quite clearly that these proposals have been arrived at

after  discussion between the two Governments, in other

words, these proposals are not merely P.A.P. proposals,

but also proposals of the Federation Government. It  is

therefore  utterly  absurd of the Barisan  Sosialis  to

propagate    the   view   that   the   proposals    for

Singapore/Federation merger, which include autonomy  in

education  and labour for Singapore, are simply  P.A.P.

proposals.  In fact, this House on the 6th of  December

accepted  Cmd.  Paper  33, which  had  been  agreed  to

between the Singapore and Federation Governments, as  a

working   basis  for  the  reunification  of  the   two

territories.  This exposes the deceit  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, the Barisan Sosialis have already

started  their  referendum campaign. For this  purpose,

they   have  issued  a  pamphlet  against  merger   and

Malaysia. About Malaysia, it has this to say -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Deputy Prime Minister will be

perfectly  in  order if he mentions  this  campaign  in

passing.  But  if he goes into details,  I  am  of  the

opinion that those details might take him far away from

the motion itself, unless, of course, he can satisfy me

that  they will not do so. We are now debating a motion

which  ask for an assurance that this matter of merger - I  am paraphrasing, of course - be referred to the people

of Singapore by way of a referendum.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, since I have already

stated that the Barisan Sosialis have already started a

referendum  campaign, it is necessary that  this  House

should also be acquainted with the propaganda that they

have  put  out in the campaign. On previous  occasions,

the Prime Minister and I had given assurances that this

referendum would be held.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions for the holding of this referendum are

contained in the National Referendum Bill, which itself



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>



is in Select Committee. Therefore, while the Bill is in

Select  Committee, for the Barisan Sosialis to  go  out

and  start  a  referendum campaign is just jumping  the

gun. Hence I would like to be given the opportunity  to

explain  to  the House what the Barisan  Sosialis  have

stated in their campaign on the referendum.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Deputy Prime Minister

must  satisfy himself, satisfy me and satisfy the House

that  what the Barisan Sosialis are now doing has  some

reference to the motion we are now discussing.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, if you will refer to

the  motion  put forward by the Member for  Anson,  you

will see a sentence there which is pertinent to what  I

would like to bring out:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly solemnly assures the citizens of

Singapore that before arrangements are finalised for  a

closer  relationship  with  the  Federation  of  Malaya

and/or  the Borneo territories, and before any  request

is  made  by the Government of Singapore to the British

Government for transfer of territorial sovereignty over

Singapore to the Federation of Malaya or Malaysia,  the

wishes  of  the voters of Singapore will be  ascertained

by referendum...'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, it is assumed in this motion that there will be a

closer  relationship between the Federation of  Malaya,

Singapore  and  the  Borneo  territories.  This  motion

implicitly states so. In the campaign which the Barisan

Sosialis  have conducted, a contrary attitude has  been

assumed. In fact, the stand they take in their campaign

is against a closer relationship between Singapore, the

Federation  of Malaya and the `Borneo territories,  and

it  is precisely this point which I would like to  deal

with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this pamphlet which they have issued entitled

"Everyone  must know the whole truth about  merger  and

Malaysia",  there are two versions of  the  propaganda.

One version is printed in Chinese and the other version

is  printed in' English. Referring to Malaysia, this is

what the pamphlet has to say in Chinese. May I read  it

out?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Mandarin): `At the same time imperialism will be

able to suppress more people in more territories in the

Far  East,  and  to suppress nationalist movements  and

progressive   forces.  This  is   the   conspiracy   of

imperialism.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means Malaysia is a conspiracy for imperialism to

suppress more people, more territories in the Far  East

and  to  suppress nationalist movements and progressive

forces.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must rule that that is

completely  away from the motion. The Hon, the  Deputy

Prime Minister may have another opportunity of bringing

these  facts forward. We are now debating a motion  and

the  Deputy Prime Minister must indicate whether he  is

in  favour  of or against the motion. What the  Barisan

Sosialis  have  done has got nothing  to  do  with  the

motion at the moment. I think the Deputy Prime Minister

should find another opportunity to bring forward  these

facts, but not in this debate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I was just trying to

prove  to you that the motion put forward by the Member

for Anson states implicitly or implies that there would

be  a closer relationship between the five territories.

It  is  necessary  for  me, therefore,  to  inform  the

Assembly  of the stand of the Barisan Sosialis.  It  is

quite relevant to the motion which the Member for Anson

has put forward.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Deputy Prime Minister

is  arrogating  unto  himself the job  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis. If what the Deputy Prime Minister has said is

correct,  the  Barisan Sosialis probably  would  attack

this  motion on those lines. I do not think the  Deputy

Prime  Minister is entitled to do that. He is  entitled

to  say whether or not he agrees with this motion:  and

if  he  does  not, to say why he does  not.  He  cannot

persuade  the  Chair that because the Barisan  Sosialis

will  not  agree with the motion, the motion should  be

lost or won.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I will accept your ruling. Mr

Speaker.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson in his speech just now, in one of

his  more lucid and more sober moments, appealed to the

House  not  to refer to the merits or demerits  of  the

proposals in Cmd. Paper No. 33. I think it would indeed

elevate the standing of the Member for Anson if he  had

also appealed to the House that no Member in this House

should  use  the  opportunity of  this  debate  or  the

opportunity  of  the  referendum  campaign  to   incite

feelings   of  race  against  race.  The   Member   for

Anson - better   known  now  as   the   Pied   Piper   of

Anson - himself  is fully aware that as a result  of  the

propaganda  put forward by the Barisan Sosialis,  there

is  indeed  a  rising  tension  between  the  different

communities in Singapore. The Barisan Sosialis  started

their  referendum campaign on 1st April, which is  also

known  as April Fool's Day. There may be fools  in  the

Barisan  Sosialis,  but  we do not  think  the  Barisan

Sosialis are going to fool the people of Singapore with

their childish and stupid propaganda nor are they going

to   fool  the  Tunku,  the  Prime  Minister   of   the

Federation,  with  their mystery  letter  delivered  at

Federation House. I do not know whether there was a tea

party  at  Federation  House, or whether  there  was  a

secret tea party which the Barisan bosses had with  the

British imperialists at Eden Hall: but nonetheless  the

Prime  Minister  of  the Federation  gave  the  Barisan

Sosialis  a  very  courteous  reply  indeed.  That  was

admitted  by  the  Secretary-General  of  the   Barisan

Sosialis,  Mr  Lim  Ching Siong himself,  in  a  Press

interview.  In  return for that courtesy,  the  Barisan

Sosialis have referred to the Tunku, the Prime Minister

of the Federation, in the following terms:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Why is Malaysia a British plot? Why do the British

choose the Tunku?'.



<br><br>The answer given in this pamphlet is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This will allow the Tunku to look after the British

interests both economically -'.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy

Prime Minister, but I am sure he must realise that what

he is saying is completely irrelevant to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>



the motion. If he can satisfy me that what he is saying

about the Barisan Sosialis has anything to do with  the

motion, then I will allow him to carry on, but I cannot

see it at the moment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Very well, Sir,I will proceed. I

referred  just  now.  Sir, to the dangers  which  would

arise  if  any Member in this Chamber were to  use  the

referendum  campaign or the opportunity  of  debate  in

this  House  to play up communal feelings. The  Barisan

Sosialis in their propaganda have said that there would

be different classes of Singapore citizenship according

to  whether  a  person was born in  Singapore, in  the

Federation, in China, in India and whether a person  is

a  Malay.  It  is  a  tragedy indeed that  the  Barisan

Sosialis in their desperation should seek to divide the

people  of  Singapore  and  thereby  hope  that  enough

suspicion   and  distrust  be  whipped  up  among   the

different communities in Singapore so that merger would

not  be  brought  about.  Such  a  stunt  is  not  only

contemptible and infantile but it is also dangerous.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I propose to read the motion and

if  the Deputy Prime Minister can indicate what part of

this  motion relates to what he has said, then  I  will

allow him to carry on. The motion is:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly solemnly assures the citizens of

Singapore that before arrangements are finalised for  a

closer  relationship  with  the  Federation  of  Malaya

and/or  the Borneo territories, and before any  request

is  made  by the Government of Singapore to the British

Government for transfer of territorial sovereignty over

Singapore to the Federation of Malaya or Malaysia,  the

wishes  of  the voters of Singapore will be ascertained

by referendum and the Government will act in accordance

with the views of our citizens so expressed.'.



<br><br>If   the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  by  his  speech   is

indicating   that  because  of  the  Barisan   Sosialis

propaganda  it  is  not wise to go to referendum,  then

perhaps  he is in order but I cannot imagine that  that

is so.





<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, as I have already explained,

the  Minister  for Home Affairs last year,  during  the

debate on merger, introduced the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  National Referendum Bill with one  prospect,

and that was to enable the people of Singapore in their

own   interest   to  go  to  a  referendum   to   state

specifically how the reunification of Singapore and the

Federation  should  be brought about.  It  was  with  a

sincere  desire  to  conduct the  referendum  that  the

Minister for Home Affairs introduced this Bill. At  the

same  time,  he  has even agreed with  Members  of  the

Opposition that this Bill should be discussed in Select

Committee so that the views on how the referendum would

be conducted could also be considered. Therefore, as  I

have previously said, since the responsibility for  the

administration of this referendum is the responsibility

of  the  Government,  I  would  like  to  introduce  an

amendment  to the motion put forward by the Member  for

Anson:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out, after the word "That", the words "this

Assembly  solemnly  assures the citizens  of  Singapore

that  before  arrangements are finalised for  a  closer

relationship with the Federation of Malaya  and/or  the

Borneo territories,", and insert "in view of the Govern

ment's clearly stated stand on the question `of merger,

this  House  welcomes the Government's introduction  of

the Singapore National Referendum Bill in order to hold

a  referendum to ascertain the wishes of the people  on

the mode and manner of the inevitable reunification  of

Singapore   and   the  Federation  of   Malaya   before

arrangements are finalised".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out after the words "Federation of Malaya or

Malaysia",",the wishes of the voters of Singapore  will

be  ascertained  by referendum and the Government  will

act  in  accordance with the views of our  citizens  so

expressed".



<br><br>the amended motion will read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That in view of the Government's clearly stated stand

on  the  question  of merger, this House  welcomes  the

Government's  introduction of  the  Singapore  National

Referendum  Bill  in  order to  hold  a  referendum  to

ascertain  the  wishes of the people on  the  mode  and

manner of the inevitable reunification of Singapore and

the   Federation  of  Malaya  before  arrangements  are

finalised  and  before  any  request  is  made  by  the

Government  of Singapore to the British Government  for

transfer  of territorial sovereignty over Singapore  to

the Federation of Malaya or Malaysia.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I have a copy?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Yes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy of amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment in substance is in order,

but the format should be:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out from "That" in line 1 to the end, and

insert  "in  view  of the Government's  clearly  stated

stand  on  the question of merger, this House  welcomes

the Government's introduction of the Singapore National

Referendum  Bill  in  order to  hold  a  referendum  to

ascertain  the  wishes of the people on  the  mode  and

finalised  and  before  any  request  is  made  by  the

Government  of Singapore to the British Government  for

transfer  of territorial sovereignty over Singapore  to

the Federation of Malaya or Malaysia".



<br><br>That covers the amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> May I draw your attention to the fact

that  the  motion  seeks  an assurance?  The  amendment

merely  welcomes  a Bill, but gives no  assurance,  and

therefore it negates my motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have satisfied myself that the

substance  of the amendment is in order. On  the  point

raised  by the Member for Anson - he will get a  copy  of

this  amendment - he  will note that the  relevant  words

insofar as the assurance is concerned are these -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`in view of the Government's clearly stated stand on

the   question  of  merger,  this  House  welcomes  the

Government's  introduction of  the  Singapore  National

Referendum Bill'.



<br><br>These  are the operative words - 'in order to  hold  a

referendum'.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Forgive me. Mr Speaker, I just want to

draw  this  to  your attention. They say  the  Bill  is

welcomed because it is a Bill brought in order to  hold

a referendum. But they give no assurance that that Bill

will  be  implemented  for the purposes  of  holding  a

referendum. That is the purpose of my motion,  to  seek

an assurance that they will.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That, of course, is an argument against

the  amendment.  The Member for Anson  is  entitled  to

amend the amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion accordingly agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down on the

Order Paper this day he exempted from the provisions of

Standing Order No. 1 until twelve midnight.

<div align="center"><b>DAY MOTION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That at the conclusion of the business set down on the

Order Paper, this Assembly do stand adjourned to a date

to be fixed by the Leader of the House,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the explanation is this. Members of the House are

aware  that during the Second Reading of the  Singapore

National  Referendum Bill, we expressed the  hope  that

this  Bill  would go through a Select Committee  before

the  end of April, so that it could come up before this

House for its Third Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our desire that at the next sitting of this

Assembly, this Referendum Bill will be debated  on  the

Third Reading. Members of the House are also aware that

today  only  one  Bill  has  been  introduced  by   the

Government for Second Reading at a future sitting. That

being  so,  we  would  like to  include  the  Singapore

National  Referendum Bill in the business for the  next

sitting of the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, since you are the Chairman of the Select Committee, on the Singapore National Referendum Bill, and therefore responsible for the passage of this Bill through Select Committee, we will have to await the Report of the Select Committee on the Bill before we can fix a date for the next sitting.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Just to correct a point made by the

Deputy  Prime Minister procedurally. I think the Deputy

Prime  Minister has asserted that the Speaker  will  be

responsible  for  the  passage of the  Referendum  Bill

through Select Committee. That is not strictly correct.

The time of the Select Committee is at the disposal  of

Members  of the Select Committee. I have no  doubt  the

three  Ministers on the Select Committee will see  that

the Bill is considered as expeditiously as possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have seen today an

exhibition  of  the discourtesy of the  Leader  of  the

House  which is a shining example of the reason why  we

have no confidence in him whatsoever. It is a matter of

normal  parliamentary procedure for a Leader worth  his

salt to consult Members of the opposition, or to advise

them  in advance, when he seeks to lift Standing Orders

for any special reason.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Anson is completely

out  of  order.  He  is not permitted  to  debate  that

particular  motion. That motion just goes to  the  vote

without  amendment  or  debate.  We  are  now  on  this

particular motion which is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That at the conclusion of the business set down on the

Order Paper, this Assembly do stand adjourned to a date

to be fixed by the Leader of the House.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am explaining the

reason  why I am voting against the motion and why  the

others  should vote against it. And the  reason  is  to

express  strong disapproval and lack of  confidence  in

the Leader.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Any other Member who wishes to speak on

the motion? No? Dr Toh, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I am not usually a virulent

man,  which fact probably a majority of the Members  of

this House will admit. But as the Member for Anson  has

expressed  in so vigorous terms his disapproval  of  my

conduct, I am afraid I have to reply to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally I would say this to the Member for Anson:

that  the  time of the Government and the time  of  the

Assembly is not at the behest of the Member for  Anson.

When  we had the motion which we are supposed to debate

this  evening, he was absent. When we had the amendment

moved  by  the Member for Anson on Malaysia, where  was

he?  He  was  in Brunei attending to his business,  and

probably getting a handsome income for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no reason why I should ever consult him, seeing

that he has shown



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



his disrespect to this House, and consecutively running

away from voting on all amendment -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not think the Deputy Prime

Minister is entitled to say that the Member for Anson

or any Member has run away from voting.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Absconded!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am afraid I did not hear that

word.  Perhaps the Deputy Prime Minister can  now  pull

himself  together and, let us get on with the  business

of the day.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> As I have pointed out to this

House, we are under no obligation to consult the Member

for Anson, because the time of the Government, which is

responsible for the administration of the country,  and

the  time  of  this Assembly, which is responsible  for

legislation, will be wasted upon him: or to  adapt  our

time  so  that  he  can  fit it in  with  his  business

appointments.  Therefore,  if  the  Member  for   Anson

disapproves of me and has no confidence in me, let  him

correct his behaviour, and probably we may hope one day

that  the Pied Piper of Anson may be a person  who  can

also be believed or trusted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That at the conclusion of the business set down on the

Order Paper, this Assembly to stand adjourned to a date

to be fixed by the Leader of the House.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>REFERENDUM</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly solemnly assures the citizens of

Singapore that before arrangements are finalised for  a

closer  relationship  with  the  Federation  of  Malaya

and/or  the Borneo territories, and before any  request

is  made  by the Government of Singapore to the British

Government for transfer of territorial sovereignty over

Singapore to the Federation of Malaya or Malaysia,  the

wishes  of  the voters of Singapore will be ascertained

by referendum and the Government will act in accordance

with the views of our citizens so expressed.".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which an amendment has been moved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out from "That" in line 1 to the end and

there  to insert "in view of the Government's  clearly

stated  stand  on  the question of merger,  this  House

welcomes the Government's introduction of the Singapore

National  Referendum Bill in order to hold a referendum

to  ascertain the wishes of the people on the  mode  an

manner of the inevitable reunification of Singapore and

the   Federation  of  Malaya  before  arrangements  are

finalised   and  before  any request  is  made  by  the

Government  of Singapore to the British Government  for

transfer of territorial sovereignty over Singapore -".



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Ha, ha!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Minister owes an apology to

the House for that interruption.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I beg your pardon.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment is to insert the following

words,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"in view of the Government's clearly stated stand on

the   question  of  merger,  this  House  welcomes  the

Government's  introduction of  the  Singapore  National

Referendum  Bill  in  order to  hold  a  referendum  to

ascertain  the  wishes of the people on  the  mode  and

manner of the inevitable reunification of Singapore and

the   Federation  of  Malaya  before  arrangements  are

finalised  and  before  any  request  is  made  by  the

Government  of Singapore to the British Government  for

transfer  of territorial sovereignty over Singapore  to

the Federation of Malaya or Malaysia."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the words proposed to be left

out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> On a point of order,

Sir, I wish to seek your advice on this, Sir. I am  not

certain  about it. According to the amendment here,  it

says,  "on  the  mode  and  manner  of  the  inevitable

reunification", "mode and manner", Sir. Those  are  the

things  which will be discussed in the Referendum  Bill

which,  at the present moment, is sub-judice.  Some  of

our amendments to the Bill are couched in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>



terms to make sure that when a referendum is held,  the

mode  and manner of the referendum will be fixed. Under

those circumstances, I would ask your advice whether or

not  this  amendment of the Leader of the House  is  in

order.   I  think  it  is  not  in  order  because   it

anticipates  the  Referendum Bill  which  is  still  in

Select Committee.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am afraid I have difficulty in

following  the  Member for Queenstown. The  words  are,

"this  House welcomes the Government's introduction  of

the Singapore National Referendum Bill in order to hold

a  referendum to ascertain the wishes of the people  on

the mode and manner of the inevitable reunification  of

Singapore  and the Federation of Malaya". No detail  as

to  what "the mode and manner" is given. That,  as  the

Member   for   Queenstown  has  rightly  stated,   will

eventually emerge from the National Referendum Bill, if

so amended in, Select Committee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> May I make an explanation? Sir, I

think  the Member for Queenstown has missed the context

of the amendment - "the mode and manner of the inevitable

reunification".  It makes no mention of  the  mode  and

manner of the referendum.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a matter for debate. The amendment is

now before the House.



<br><br>7.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> When this motion was printed, I do not

think  that  it could possibly find anybody  who  would

object  to it, and I learned with considerable surprise

from  the  seconder of the motion and the supporter  of

the  manoeuvres on the part of certain Members  of  the

Government to persuade him to drop the motion. I  could

understand why. I see this extraordinary mess which the

Deputy Prime Minister has achieved in order to hide the

fact that Government, in truth, do not want to give  an

assurance  to  the people of Singapore that  they  will

have an honest referendum and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>



that  the Government will act in accordance with  their

wishes.  We have now this smokescreen of the Government

patting itself on its own back and no doubt having  the

S.P.A. to  pat  it  too, about welcoming  Government's

introduction of the Singapore National Referendum Bill.

I do not care, Sir, if they pat themselves on the back.

I am not interested.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> What about your back?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> My back is broad enough to carry and has

been broad enough to carry the filth, the spite and the

malice that the entire Front Bench have sought to throw

upon  me. It will survive it and it will outlive  them,

and I hope one day it will bury them.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is what you think.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Let us go back to this motion. It is

with  genuine sorrow that I have to speak in  tones  of

anger of this Machiavellian manoeuvre to camouflage the

naked intention of the Government, now so obvious  that

there will be no referendum on the real issue but  only

on the mode and manner of the inevitable reunification.

"Do  you  want the White Paper proposals to  come  into

force  at midnight on the 31st of August? Or would  you

rather  have it for breakfast on Christmas  Day?"  That

is,   in   effect,  Sir,  their  so-called   referendum

according to this. That is what we are going  to  have.

"Do  you prefer to die by drowning? Or would you rather

be  burnt alive?" The mode and manner of the inevitable

reunification.  So  this is it.  This  is  naked  power

dictatorship. Sir, at one time it used to  irritate  me

to  hear the hollow laughter from the Front Benches.  I

now  accept it as a tribute to the fact that the  shaft

has hit home, and they squirmed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No. It was comical. That is why we

laughed.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> So we are to have a referendum to

ascertain  the wishes of the people, not  whether  they

want   the  arrangements  arrived  at,  the  proposals,

according to the Prime Minister, of the Federation  and

the P.A.P. incorporated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>



in  Command Paper 33. No, Sir. The people will not have

the  opportunity to say whether they want  it  or  not.

They  are going to be asked the mode and manner of  the

introduction of this policy, the mode and manner.  Sir,

you  have  held - and I must respect your decision   - that

this  is  not, at least technically, a negation  of  my

motion  which  seeks an assurance from  this  House,  a

solemn  assurance that the people will have  an  honest

opportunity  to  express their wishes in  a  referendum

before  the  measures affecting our entire  future  and

affecting our children are brought into force. That  is

all  it sought. That was supposed to be the purpose  of

the  Referendum  Bill,  that  there  should  be  direct

democracy,  and  that  this  Government,  as  one  last

gracious act in an extremely discredited career, should

at  least  for  once  show some grace  and  accept  the

people's will.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, we must recognise that obviously the

Referendum Bill was introduced by mistake.  It  was

promised  and they had to go through with the  promise.

But  they are going to see that it is so distorted that

nothing  Machiavelli  ever did could  equal  the  fraud

which it is proposed to be perpetrated on the people of

Singapore. This is a fraud. They are not to be given an

opportunity  to say whether they want a  referendum  or

not.  I  repeat this, Sir - let it be clear  enough,  not

that  the Minister for Culture's Radio P.A.P. will ever

carry  it,  but  at least some of the  newspapers  will

print  it; some of the people will realise the  meaning

of the shabby performance and the shabby amendment, the

shabby smokescreen to hide the naked power politics  of

this Fascist Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I move an amendment to this

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out from the word "That" up to and including

"question  of  merger"; to leave out "the  Government's

introduction of"; and to leave out "mode and manner  of

the inevitable".



<br><br>So that the amendment now reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House welcomes the Singapore National

Referendum  Bill  in  order to  hold  a  referendum  to

ascertain the wishes of the people on the reunification

of Singapore and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>



the   Federation  of  Malaya  before  arrangements  are

finalised  and  before  any  request  is  made  by  the

Government  of Singapore to the British Government  for

transfer  of territorial sovereignty over Singapore  to

the Federation of Malaya or Malaysia.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry I have been rather quick. Sir, and I have

no copy. You will appreciate, Mr Speaker, that we have

just received it and we have just seen it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member produce that amendment to

the amendment in writing?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Certainly, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment to the amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment to the amendment is to

leave out from the very beginning" in view" to the word

"reunification"  and  there  to  insert   "this   House

welcomes  the  Singapore National  Referendum  Bill  in

order  to hold a referendum to ascertain the wishes  of

the people on the".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that the amended motion will read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this House welcomes the Singapore National

Referendum  Bill  in  order to  hold  a  referendum  to

ascertain the wishes of the people on the reunification

of  Singapore  and  the  Federation  of  Malaya  before

arrangements  are finalised and before any  request  is

made  by  the  Government of Singapore to  the  British

Government for transfer of territorial sovereignty over

Singapore to the Federation of Malaya or Malaysia.'.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am not proud of this as it stands now,

Sir,It  is a far cry from the solemn assurance  of  a

decent act of respect to the people and the concept  of

democracy  to this present welcome of a Bill  which  we

may hope will bring about a referendum to ascertain the

wishes  of the people. This is not the solemn assurance

I  seek.  But, Mr Speaker, Sir, I am a practical  man.

The  vilifications  to  which  I  have  been  subjected

repeatedly  are  an  indication of the  extent  of  the

weakness   of  the  Opposition  before  the   Fascist's

steamroller  majority on the Government Benches.  These

are  the people whose leader, the Prime Minister, said,

"Mao  Tse-tung says power is in the barrel of the gun."

That  is  not the power I have; it is not the  power  I

seek; and it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>



is not the power I hope anybody in Singapore will seek.

Those  who, like the Prime Minister, seek it,  I  trust

they  will  find  it in a sustained absence  away  from

these shores. Sir, it is because of the recognition  of

our  numerical weakness that I seek to bring  about  at

least  some  semblance of decency to this'  smokescreen

and this camouflage, to bring about something for which

a   man  may  vote  without  feeling  dirty.  It  is  a

recognition of the fact, so heavily demonstrated today,

of  the dictatorship of the majority who have now  made

certain  by  a  firm alliance with the S.P.A. that  no

matter what the feelings of the people and the feelings

of  the Opposition, they will always have the 30 votes.

Yes,  Sir,  it  is  because of these reasons,  and  not

because  I expect even to impress them, nor even  do  I

expect  having failed in what was a far more reasonable

motion  that I would obtain their consent to this  much

more  mild version. It is in order to bring out starkly

and   clearly   the  reprehensible   reality   of   the

Government's  intention  to  ride  roughshod  over  the

wishes  of the people willy-nilly. No wonder the  Prime

Minister said it would be criminal folly if there was a

risk  of  losing the referendum. He believes in playing

two-up, the Australian game with both sides of the coin

on  his  side - heads I win, tails you lose attitude.  To

make  quite  certain, that is democracy, the  democracy

that loads the dice. Let them pour their filth, Sir.  A

time  comes  when the contempt of the people  for  this

Government is such that those on whom they seek to pour

scorn become heroes. Sir, rarely in the history of  any

democracy have I ever known, certainly in modern times,

such  a transparent, such a disgraceful act of contempt

for  democracy and for the people who elected  them,  a

naked act of sheer abuse of majority power. An act of -



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You are an enigma.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> - clear notice of treachery to the

people,  of an intention to destroy them as they  fear;

the  intention is certainly to treat their wishes  with

complete  contempt.  Now we can  see.  Sir,  that  this

incipient democracy which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>



started  seven years ago and which feared Communism  as

the  enemy which would put an end to its existence must

now  recognise that it is this P.A.P. Government  which

will put an end to democracy in this country. I believe

that here today we see a naked intention on the part of

these  gentlemen never again to stand for election  and

to  make sure that there will never again be elections,

for  they  are too ambitious to give up power and  will

see   to   it  that  they  will  continue  in   office.

[Interruption] This, Sir, is now clear;  not  from  the

hands  of  the  Communists, not by  the  hands  of  the

Communists, it is a dagger used in the hands  of  these

so-called  socialist democrats, to  stab  democracy  as

they have stabbed socialism. Now we have it. Some of us

have  seen  the  signs.  We have  feared  it;  we  have

suspected it. But for the first time now, we see it  in

all its filthy nakedness, this conspiracy to practise a

major  fraud  upon the people of Singapore.  No  wonder

they want to suspend Standing Orders in order to go  up

to  midnight.  They  want to rush  this  shame  quickly

behind them, the shame that is branded on them now  and

forever  as the brand of Cain. No wonder they hate  me,

Mr  Speaker. They hate me, I think even more than they

hate the Communists. For in me they see -



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> A

Messiah.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Sometimes, Sir, they recognise the voice

of  a conscience they may once have had. They recognise

that here at least -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew)</b> walked into the Chamber.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Ah, here comes the great Prime Minister!

[Laughter] And we welcome him, Mr Speaker!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Anson has been on

the   verge  of  being  disorderly.  It  is  completely

disorderly  for  any  Member to comment  on  any  other

Member  walking into this Chamber. The other Member  is

entitled to walk with decorum and to take his seat with

decorum.  He  must  not  in any  way  be  excited  into

becoming disorderly. Mr Marshall.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I was on this major

act  of  perfidy which is now nakedly apparent  in  the

amendment   brought  by  the  Deputy  Prime   Minister,

disclosing  that  the  Government  have  no   intention

whatsoever  to  put a referendum to the  people  as  to

whether or not they want the arrangements of Cmd. Paper

No. 33. This referendum introduced with so much fanfare

is  intended no more and no less than to ask  them  for

the mode and manner of implementing the White Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose of my amendment is to

delete the sycophantic and the obvious, and furthermore

to  delete  the mode and manner and to leave  at  least

possible for a subsequent motion that there will  be  a

referendum  giving  the  people an  honest  opportunity

whether  or not they want these arrangements.  Criminal

folly  it may be insofar as the survival of the P.A.P.

is   concerned,  but  that  criminal  folly  they  have

indulged in already. It is a question of, "Is democracy

criminal  folly because it is not advantageous  to  the

Prime  Minister and his colleagues?" This  is  criminal

folly? Then, Sir, what is the distinction between their

dictatorship and the Communist dictatorship?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You won't be here.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The Minister for Culture says, "I won't

be  here,"  and I have no doubt that in time when  thin

dictatorship  has consolidated itself, I  will  not  be

here. I have not the slightest doubt about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Then what are you here for?



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> He

can let off gas here!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Yes, I am glad to see them squirm and

hear them squirm, Mr Speaker. These interruptions will

in no way stay me. It was a tragic day, -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> - a tragic day for all the people, a

tragic  day  when  decent  people  trusted  these   men

opposite. No



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>



doubt  some  of  those on the Back  Benches  must  have

started  with  sincerity, dedication  and  without  the

megalomania  and  bitterness  of  some  on  the   Front

Benches, but now that they have been led up the  garden

path  of dictatorship, I ask those on the Back Benches,

"How   does  it  feel?"  [Interruption]  Is   there   a

conscience?  For the Front Bench, we can  expect  power

corrupts  and power deadens the conscience. What  about

the Back Benches? How does it feel? Is your loyalty  to

your leaders greater than your loyalty to the people?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Anson should

loyalties are here.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I appreciate your correction. You are

fortunate  enough. Being an elected Member today,  Sir,

and  suffering  a  sense  of being  dirtied,  of  being

associated  with others who have been equally  trusted,

who  have  been believed in, in whom these  people  had

faith,  and who today tell you not bluntly but  in  all

the  camouflage of the absurdity of this amendment that

they intend to handcuff these very people and hand them

bound hand and foot. These are the representatives whom

the people trusted. I happen to be one in this Chamber.

at  this  most unhappy moment in this Chamber in  seven

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, our Prime Minister's riddle about - what

were the words, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> "mode and manner."



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> The words were:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'So the question of winning or losing a referendum

does  not  arise.  If there was the slightest  risk  of

merger  being  frustrated and the country plunged  into

disaster  by the activities of the Communists,  let  me

say  it  will  be  criminal folly on the  part  of  the

Government  to  hold the referendum and  to  allow  the

future of Malaya and Malaysia to be imperilled.'



<br><br>Now,  the  mystery  is solved and the "criminal  folly"

explained.  They  do not intend to have  a  referendum.

They  do not intend to ask the people whether they want

these arrangements of the

P.A.P. or not. They do not intend to do so. The P.A.P.

will be saved, and only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>



the  "mode  and  manner". Such contempt  for  a  really

decent population! I think, Sir, despite the abuse from

both sides of the House about our people - and I say this

as  one who has travelled a fair amount - I know no place

in  the world where you can find as peaceable, as  law-abiding  and  as  decent a people as are  in  Singapore

today,  and I mean solemnly and in all sincerity  every

word  I  am saying. It is these people who have elected

them  and  who are now to be betrayed. I can  sit  till

midnight.  I  would sit till midnight next  year  if  I

thought  for  a moment that I could, like  the  bugler,

blow down the walls of Jericho, but I cannot and I know

that  I  cannot,  Sir.  Now  we  find  the  tragedy  of

democracy - the tragedy of democracy, Mr Speaker, is

that between general elections you can with a group  of

arrogant  people  in the majority have  as  complete  a

dictatorship as under any Fascist or Communist  regime,

that  you can between general elections tie the  people

hand  and foot, put them in a gunny sack and dump  them

in  the  river.  That is constitutional  and  there  is

nothing the people can do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, some weeks ago, I had occasion to be involved in

a  discussion about starting an anti-nuclear  group  in

Singapore  and I asked my Secretary, "Do you  think  we

can  achieve anything? Would the voice of 1�  million

people  here be able to change the view of the stubborn

nuclear powers?" She said, "If we must die, let  us  at

least  die shouting." That is what I say to this House.

If  we must die, then I shall shout. I shall shout till

the  people  know. I shall shout to the people  of  the

Federation who themselves, being decent people, will be

ashamed   of  condoning  this  fraud  that   is   being

perpetrated  upon  the  people  by  the  Government  of

Singapore. I appeal now not to the Front Benches -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Anson is forgetting

the ruling I made some time ago, that voices should  as

having inconvenienced you. I am appealing in the name

of decency as brothers of those in the Federation to

the citizens of the Federation not to condone an act of

perfidy on the part of the P.A.P. Government that is

being perpetrated upon the people of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be left

Member for Anson.

Anson?



<br><br>9.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis

share  the anger expressed by the Member for Anson.  In

the  past  the  P.A.P. have shown  to  the  House  how

dictatorial they have been. What we witness today, Sir,

is   not  parliamentary  democracy  but  parliamentary

dictatorship; a dictatorship imposed on us and  on  the

House by a group of discredited politicians who have no

more  capital  to sustain themselves but the  force  of

numbers.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It seems to me that it would be

convenient if both the amendment of the Government  and

the  amendment to the amendment moved by the Member for

Anson could be debated together. I personally think  it

is  convenient  if the amendment of the Government  and

the  amendment to the amendment of the Member for Anson

are  debated  together, and at the end  of  the  debate

those two amendments can be disposed of.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I would rather speak on the

amendment to the amendment alone, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In that case, I must ask the Member for

Queenstown to confine himself to reasons why the  words

suggested to be left out by the Member for Anson should

be   left  out,  i.e.,  the  words,  "in  view  of  the

Government's  dearly stated stand on  the  question  of

merger", the words "the Government's introduction", and

the words "mode and manner of the inevitable".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the motion as

amended  asks  this  House  to  welcome  the  Singapore

National  Referendum Bill - May I  get  this  straight

first, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The amendment of the Deputy Prime

Minister is to insert these words,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"in view of the Government's clearly stated stand on

the   question  of  merger,  this  House  welcomes  the

Government's  introduction of  the  Singapore  National

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has moved an amendment to the

amendment,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out the words "in view of the Government's

clearly  stated  stand on the question of  merger - I  am

paraphrasing  the  amendment.  The  Member  for   Anson

suggests  that  those words should come  out.  He  also

suggests that the words, "the Government's introduction

of",  and  "mode  and manner of the inevitable"  should

come  out. So that his amendment to the first  part  of

add,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`as to whether or not they are prepared to accept the

proposals  as  embodied in the White  Paper  on  Merger

(Command  Paper 33) before arrangements  are  finalised

and  before  any request is made by the  Government  of

territorial   sovereignty   over   Singapore   to   the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole amended motion will read:

Singapore to the Federation of Malaya or Malaysia."



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The effect of that is that the Member for

Queenstown  desires to leave out from the  Government's

amendment  all the words from the very beginning,  that

is,  "in view of the Government's clearly stated stand"

etc.  down  to the words "Federation of  Malaya",  and

there  to  insert the words he has suggested. That  is,

that   "this  House  welcomes  the  Singapore  National

Referendum  Bill  in  order to  hold  a  referendum  to

ascertain the wishes of the people as to whether or not

they  are  prepared to accept the proposals as embodied

in the White Paper on Merger (Command Paper 33)". If  I

am  correct in my reading, the rest of the words follow

the amendment moved by the Government. Is that correct?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I am amending the Member for

Anson's amendment.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> To start off with, instead of leaving

out,  as  the Member for Anson has suggested, from  the

beginning to "reunification", the Member for Queenstown

seeks  to  leave out from the beginning  to  the  words

"before  arrangements". Once that is accepted, then  we

go  to  the second limb of the amendment; that  is,  to

discuss  whether  or  not the  words  suggested  to  be

inserted, should be inserted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the reason for my amendment to

the amendment to the amendment is very clear. The White

Paper  has  been presented by the P.A.P. Government  to the House. The P.A.P. Government have taken great pains to explain their merger proposals to the people through Radio   P.A.P.,  the  Ministry  of  Culture  pamphlets, Malaysia  Week,  Malaysia  racing  vehicles - the   Grand Prix - and, of course, the newspapers. They have spent  a lot  of money on it. They have also sent touring  teams over to the Borneo territories and to the Federation in

the  guise of playing football, basketball, and  table

tennis  matches to publicise the P.A.P. type of  merger

to the people. The P.A.P. merger proposals are concrete

proposals which have been suggested and accepted by the

two  Governments. They had spent considerable  time  to

get  the  White Paper ready so that they could  present

the  heads of agreement as embodied in the White  Paper

(Command Paper 33) to the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under those circumstances, Sir, the P.A.P. should be

very proud of those proposals. They should have nothing

to  worry about and nothing to fear. They should  under

no  circumstances be ashamed of putting those proposals

before  the  people. If the proposals are so  good,  as

they  have all the time claimed them to be, then  there

is  no  reason why the P.A.P. Government should now  be

afraid  to put them before the people as the real  test

as to whether or not they are acceptable to the people.

In  fact, they should be very happy to ask for a simple

yes  or no to the proposals which they have taken  such

great  pains to get ready. It had been the Government's

intention to bring these White Paper proposals  to  the

people for endorsement. But, Sir, it is generally known

outside that these proposals of the P.A.P. are not such

good things as they are made out to be. The P.A.P. too

know  that  the  White Paper proposals  are  completely

unacceptable to the people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chew Chua):</b> To you.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If, as the Member for Tampines

thinks, it is only unacceptable to me, then here  is  a

clear chance for the Government to put them before  the

people.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua:</b> Certainly.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> That is what they should do.

Therefore, under those circumstances, we see no  reason

why the Government Benches cannot accept our amendment.

Since  the grand old man of this House and of the Party

has  given the word, I hope the Front Benches, as  they

are  much  younger will listen to his  wisdom  and  put

these  proposals  before the people. I  only  hope  the

P.A.P. will live up to their word of always  accepting

the will of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson has already given you an

indication of the intentions of the Government.  It  is

clear that the Government probably have no intention of

even   holding  a  referendum:  and  if  they  hold   a

referendum, they want to make sure that it is a case of

heads the P.A.P. win, and tails the people of Singapore

lose.  Under any circumstances, the P.A.P. ensure  they

must  win.  That, of course, Sir, is a clear indication

of  what confidence they have in their own White  Paper

proposals. It is strongly rumoured outside -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Why do you believe in rumours?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Barisan rumours.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - that the P.A.P. Government,

fearing  that their White Paper proposals will  not  be

acceptable  to  the  people,  will  probably  pose  two

questions instead. That is why there is "the  mode  and

manner  of the inevitable reunification", according  to

the  words of the original amendment of the Government.

The  mode  and manner has been amply explained  by  the

Member  for  Anson,  and I think we  can  all  see  the

Machiavellian  machinations behind those two  wonderful

words.  Mode and manner! As the Member for  Anson  puts

it,  it is almost a case of whether you want the people

to die by hanging or to die by drowning. What



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>



we  are interested in is not dying. Why do we not allow

the people a chance to live? Give them a chance to live

and  not  a  chance to die. If they are  only  given  a

chance  to  die - if that is the intention of the  P.A.P.

Government,  then  that  is the  end  of  parliamentary

democracy in this part of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common knowledge, Sir, that the P.A.P.

Government intend to ask two questions on merger. As so

well  shown  by  those two words, "mode" and  "manner",

they will probably ask the people whether they want the

P.A.P. White Paper merger or some form of merger  which

is inferior -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - to the White Paper merger.

Everybody knows that the Government have all  the  time

been  harping on the Penang and Malacca type.  That  is

the  point,  Sir,  and it is such a distortion  of  our

stand. If they should present truthfully our views and.

the  type  of  merger that the Barisan Sosialis  stand'

for,  then  the people will be given an honest  picture

and  will  understand. Now they are telling  the  whole

world  that  the Barisan Sosialis stand for the  Penang

type  of merger. This is a complete fabrication  and  a

lie.  The  true type of merger which we in the  Barisan

Sosialis  stand  for is complete merger  with  all  the

citizens   of  Singapore  becoming  citizens   of   the

Federation. In other words, all the 624,000 citizens of

Singapore  must on merger automatically become  624,000

Federation citizens, with Singapore having proportional

representation in the Central Parliament. But no,  Sir.

This   is  not  the  true  picture  which  the   P.A.P.

contortionists  and culture experts are  presenting  to

the people. They only know how to twist and turn.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That is a new dance!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They want to make sure that they

give  distorted versions of the Barisan Sosialis  stand

to the people. I would ask the P.A.P. Government not to

trick  the people in such a silly fashion. Let them  be

honest. They were elected by the people and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>



they  have a duty to the people to be honest with them.

They  have  all  the  time claimed that  they  are  the

representatives of the people. Let them prove that they

listen to the will of the people, and not try to  cheat

them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> Honour your pledge!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The fact that the leader of the

House in his amendment asks to leave out "the wishes of

the   voters  of  Singapore  will  be  ascertained   by

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That illustrates my point. The

Member  for Queenstown is now debating the Government's

amendment.  I  suggested that that would be  an  easier

course,  but  he is now going out of order by  debating

the  Government's  amendment. He can only  debate  that

part of the Government's amendment which the Member for

Anson has suggested should be left out.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Sir, the amendment I have moved

will  definitely give a chance to the P.A.P. Government

to  prove  whether or not they can keep their  word  at

least  this  time. They have repeatedly said  that  the

final outcome of any form of merger will be decided  by

the  people. They have gone to great lengths  to  bring

about  agreement  with the Federation  on  their  White

Paper. Now that they have come to an agreement with the

Federation  Government, it is time  that  they  brought

these  proposals before the people and ask them whether

or  not  they are acceptable to them. I hope the P.A.P.

will  be  able  to  accept the  amendment  I  have  put

forward.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be left

out,  be  left  out." I would indicate to hon.  Members

that  the debate must of necessity range over not  only

the  amendment  proposed by the Member for  Queenstown,

but  also  the  amendment proposed by  the  Member  for

Anson; the reason being that if the proposals to  leave

out   the  words  from  the  Government  amendment  are

defeated,  then  it follows that the amendment  of  the

Member for Queenstown



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>



will be defeated, and so will the amendment proposed by

the  Member for Anson. The first Question is, "That the

words proposed to be left out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> As I understand it, the words to be left

out proposed by the amendment to my amendment are up to

the  seventh line; mine is up to the sixth; and in  the

circumstances, surely any negativing of that  amendment

does not necessarily imply negativing of mine which  is

of a more limited character. I would like to understand

this,  when it comes to the question of voting,  surely

the amendments will be put individually to the House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The difficulty is that both the Member

for  Queenstown  and the Member for Anson  desire  that

certain  words  up to the word "reunification"  in  the

Government's amendment be left out. But the Member  for

Queenstown goes a little further. He suggests that  the

words "reunification of Singapore and the Federation of

Malaya"  also  be left out. So that the first  Question

is,  "That  all  the words proposed by the  Member  for

Queenstown  to  be  left out, be  left  out."  If  that

amendment  is  defeated, then,  of  course,  the  whole

amendment   is  defeated.  I  cannot  see   any   other

convenient way of putting it to Members. Is  there  any

other point?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the amendment is

negatived, it may well be that Members do not  want  to

delete   the   additional  line  which   involves   the

reunification  of  Singapore  and  the  Federation   of

Malaya. Surely. Sir, then the other amendment should be

put as to the deletion of the first six lines "mode and

manner  of  the inevitable", to ascertain  whether  the

rest  would  be acceptable. As I understand the  normal

procedure, an amendment to an amendment is taken first.

It  has  priority. Then the amendment  itself,  if  the

amendment to it is defeated, is put to the House.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member for Anson then suggests that

Members  might  wish to retain the words "reunification

of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>



Singapore and the Federation of Malaya" as well as  the

other  words proposed by the Member for Anson  himself.

Well, in that case, the first Question which I will put

then  is,  "That the words `reunification of  Singapore

and  the Federation of Malaya' proposed to be left out,

be left out."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Rajaratnam, on the amendments?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes, Sir. Mr Speaker, I presume I am

talking  on  the  amendment to  the  amendment  to  the

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, personally I do not think there is

much difference in intent between the amendment by  the

Member  for  Anson and the amendment by the Member  for

Queenstown,  because  during the three-quarters  of  an

hour  recess  that we had, obviously  there  have  been

second  thoughts on the amendment moved by  the  Member

for  Anson. So as far as intention is concerned,  there

is  really no basic difference except that the  Barisan

Sosialis have gone further and revealed their hand. One

of  the omissions is the word "reunification" which  is

obviously  a retrogression from the amendment  made  by

the Member for Anson who at least makes a semblance  of

believing  in  merger.  But the Barisan  Sosialis  have

obviously come to the conclusion that what they  really

want  is an independent Singapore. Now they want a  way

out  to prepare the ground for the next phase of  their

propaganda,   that  what  they  really   want   is   an

independent Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as an indication of the deliberate attempt on the

part  of  the Barisan Sosialis, to mislead  the  House,

part  of  their technique is to accuse other people  of

distortion:  of  falsehoods. As regards  the  statement

made  just  a  few  minutes  ago  by  the  Member   for

Queenstown wherein he denied that the Barisan  Sosialis

had ever suggested that they wanted merger on the basis

of  Penang and Malacca, that was one of the slips  they

made. Those of us who read their publications know that

they are now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>



trying to wriggle out of it by saying, never said these

things. That is a complete distortion of our stand  by

the  Government." Sir, by a stroke of  good  luck,  we

have  here  copies  of  the letters  sent  by  all  the

political Parties to the Deputy Prime Minister when  he

asked them to state their stand on merger. There is one

from  the S.P.A., one from the Workers' Party  and  one

from the Barisan Sosialis. A few minutes ago, Sir,  for

the record the Member for Queenstown said that that was

a complete distortion. I want to say that it is just as

well  for  us to bear in mind that the Barisan Sosialis

have  now  come to a point where they are  prepared  to

tell  falsehoods  in  the belief that  they  cannot  be

challenged.  One  of  the reasons why  the  Member  for

Queenstown  and his friends avoid coming  to  a  debate

over  the radio is that they can be challenged. Sir,  I

have  here a copy of the letter which their Party  sent

officially  to  the Deputy Prime Minister  stating  the

terms and conditions of their merger. This is what they

said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The way ahead for reunification of our country and

our  people  is  in one of two directions - an  immediate

full  and  complete merger with Singapore  joining  the

Federation  as  a  constituent state  like  Penang  and

Malacca.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yet, a few minutes ago, Sir, he said

that  that  was  a complete distortion  by  the  P.A.P.

Government.  This is a warning that any statement  made

by the Barisan in their desperate moments must be taken

with not only a pinch of salt, but a handful of salt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Point of order and clarification at

the same time, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member must make up his mind.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Point of order, Sir. It is a

complete distortion of facts and a telling of lies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is out of order by

mentioning  the word "lies". I will not call  him.  Mr

Rajaratnam.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I am prepared for clarification

if the -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Yes. This is a copy of the letter

wherein  they  said  the way ahead for  reunification - a

word  which  they  left  out in the  amendment  because

obviously  it  has become an awkward thing.  It  is  on

record - "and  the way ahead for reunification  is...". This

is  an exact copy of the letter. It is not only a  copy

of  the  letter, it is also a copy of the programme  of

the inaugural meeting of the Barisan Sosialis. The same

thing   was   circulated.   There   it   states   quite

specifically:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`an immediate, full and complete merger with Singapore

joining  the  Federation  as a constituent  State  like

Penang and Malacca.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) an autonomous unit within a confederation with

the Borneo territories coming in when possible.'



<br><br>This is a typical example -



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On a point of order, Sir. The

Minister has been misquoting. If he wishes to quote,  I

will  ask him to quote the whole text and not just  one

or two sentences.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir,I was quoting the relevant bits.

If  I were to read the whole text, it would probably be

more  embarrassing  to  the Barisan  Sosialis  Members,

because  they conceded all sorts of things  from  which

they  want to wriggle out now. I am very sorry to  say,

Sir,  that  the  Member for Anson has also  the  habit,

which  he  has  learnt  from the Barisan  Sosialis,  of

coming  forward - since the word "lie" is prohibited - and

telling  a  bare-faced  falsehood,  because  he  quoted

something else from the Prime Minister earlier on;  but

I  shall  come to that when we deal with his amendment.

This  is  part of the technique, if you will  remember.

Sir -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir. An allegation

is being made. Surely, it, should be substantiated now,

Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Minister substantiates that

statement now, I think he will be out of order. We  are

now  dealing  with the amendment. He has stated  in  so

many words that he will come to it at the proper time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> If you will remember, Sir, at the last

sitting  I  did  say  that one of  the  tenets  of  the

Communist doctrine - at that time they laughed it off -  is

that  a Communist should be prepared to tell falsehoods

and  lies and distort facts if necessary for the cause.

When  we  say  the Barisan Sosialis are  pro-Communist,

they  not only substantiate it by what they do but also

by their method and manner of conducting debates.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would suggest to the Minister

that if he must point, he points at the Chair.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Anyway, Sir, we have said enough to

show that the Barisan Sosialis Communists have now come

to a stage where their word is not worth the paper they

wrote  on to the Deputy Prime Minister, because earlier

on  they repudiated it. I think it is now necessary for

us  and for the people of Singapore to take the Barisan

Sosialis  not  as  a  body of men whose  words  can  be

trusted  hut as men who are prepared to twist and  turn

and  even prepared to spit at their own words. Take the

document that they sent officially to the Deputy  Prime

Minister who asked them to state their stand on merger.

They  are prepared to spit on what they themselves have

written  in black and white, just as they are  prepared

to spit on their undertaking that if they were expelled

from the Party they would resign. They have now come to

be  real  full-fledged Communists who, as  one  of  the

Communist  tenets  says, must be prepared  to  lie  and

distort  facts so as to serve the cause for which  they

stand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as regards the amendment, apart from the careful

precaution  of  leaving out "reunification",  it  means

that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>



Barisan Sosialis are now taking the next step - which  we

have   predicted - of   fighting   for   an   independent

Singapore, which is what they want. As their logic  has

driven them to spout communal and racial propaganda, so

they  must  now  take the next step  to  fight  for  an

independent Singapore, and that, Sir, is one reason why

it  is  necessary  for  them  to  leave  out  the  word

"reunification".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the latter part of the amendment, it is

quite  clear that it has nothing to do with the  spirit

and  intent of the motion, which is to get an assurance

from the Government that a referendum will be held.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> On what basis?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> But this amendment goes a bit further

than  that. They are now trying to commit the House  to

state beforehand the terms of the referendum. That is a

matter  outside the scope of the motion. What they  are

saying  is  that now the Government should state,  "Oh,

this  is  how  we  should set the question."  When  the

Referendum Bill is before this House, then it  will  be

decided as to who sets the question and how it will  be

set.  Therefore, this amendment is an attempt - obviously

during the three-quarters of an hour break some of  the

bright boys thought it out - to commit the House to state

beforehand the terms of the referendum. By the deletion

of   the  words  "mode  and  manner",  they  are  again

substantiating our contention that they are  no  longer

interested in merger. The words "mode and manner"  were

introduced because all of us - the Barisan Sosialis,  the

Workers'  Party,  the United People's Party - believe  in

merger.  We believe in merger in principle. We  believe

in the concept of merger in the abstract. Therefore, we

say,  "That  is  right. Everybody believes  in  merger.

Nobody disagrees with merger." So what we want to  find

out is the "mode and manner": what kind of merger do we

want?  That is a matter which will be decided when  the

referendum is framed. Therefore, this amendment to  the

amendment  to the amendment is an attempt to go  beyond

the original spirit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 807</b></font><br><br>



and  intent of the motion to commit the House to decide

beforehand on how the referendum should be framed. That

is  not the purpose. The purpose is to get an assurance

from  this  House  and  from  the  Government  that   a

referendum will be held.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown quoted the Member for

Anson - I am always very intrigued to note how they quote

each  other.  The  Member for Anson uses  phrases  like

"majority  dictatorship".  Obviously  he  believes   in

minority  dictatorship. The Member  for  Queenstown  is

only  a  tenderfoot in this business.  He  talks  about

parliamentary dictatorship. Sin, I have never seen such

a term as "parliamentary dictatorship" in any political

science   textbook.   I   would   have   thought   that

"parliamentary"  was a negation of "dictatorship",  but

obviously in the logic of the Barisan Sosialis, two and

two  make  five: black is white; you put out a  written

statement saying that you believe in merger like Penang

and  Malacca, and three months later you say  that  you

never  said  such a thing; and when copies  of  such  a

statement  are presented to them, they say.  "Oh,  read

the  whole text - 12 pages of text." Therefore, when  the

Member  for Queenstown says, "Oh, the Member for  Anson

has  said  that the Government is going  to  frame  the

question  for referendum asking whether one would  like

to  die by drowning or by hanging," I can give him  the

assurance  here  and now that such a  question  is  not

going  to  be   submitted for the consideration  by  the

people  of  Singapore. If there  is  going  to  be  any

hanging,  the  hanging  will be  done  by  the  Members

concerned; but as far as we are concerned, I  can  give

the  same  assurance to the Member  for  Anson  who  is

always caught in his own metaphors. He starts off  with

a  metaphor, which, for him, becomes a fact, so much so

that the Member for Queenstown gets also worked up  and

says, "Oh, the people want to live. They do not want to

die." But I can assure him that that is not going to be

one  of the questions. The people are not going  to  be

asked  whether  they  want to  die  by  hanging  or  by

drowning or by any other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 808</b></font><br><br>



means.  The questions are going to be far more  serious

than  that  though it might result in  Members  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis,  who  have  already  started  on   a

suicidal course, probably being driven to that  extreme

as a way out of their difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I therefore submit that this amendment is,

firstly,  an  attempt to go beyond  the  scope  of  the

original motion - and even of the amended motion  by  the

Government - to  more  or less commit  this  Assembly  to

framing  the questions for the referendum. I can  quite

understand  the anxiety that the Barisan Sosialis  feel

about the type of questions that are going to be put to

the   people.  Because  of  their  own  blunders,  they

committed  themselves first to merger on the  basis  of

Penang  and Malacca. They then committed themselves  to

merger   as  a  concept;  and  they  finally  committed

themselves  to internal self-government for  Singapore.

Therefore,    they   cannot   reconcile    all    these

contradictions.  The  fate and future  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis and of the Communists who direct them  is  now

dependent  on  one, or two, or three, or  five  or  ten

crosses  that are going to be put on the ballot  paper.

That  will seal the fate of the Malayan Communist Party

who for 30 years have struggled for something which  is

now  going to be  lost as a result of the voting on  the

referendum. All the work of 30 years has now to  go  by

the board. Therefore, it is a life and death battle for

the  Malayan Communists who are directing the gentlemen

in  the Barisan Sosialis. During a war, if you want  to

find  out  whether there is a land mine, you  send  the

sheep  first; and that is the role the Barisan Sosialis

are playing. They are now in the minefield. A sheep  is

in  the  minefield. They know that the mines are  there

and  that they will be detonated and exploded  the  day

the  people  of Singapore go and vote on  the  question

that  will be put to them by the Government. I  do  not

want to digress,, but it is necessary for me to explain

why  it  is  important to frame the questions  for  the

referendum  in such a way as to ensure that the  people

understand  what, they  are voting  for,  because  the

Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>



Sosialis  have  twisted  and turned  this  question  of

merger  so  much  so that today everybody  is  confused

about  it.  Today  they have come back  to  their  last

weapon - "This is a Chinese versus Malays  issue."  They

have made such a `statement and they have now descended

to   using  the  lowliest  weapon.  Therefore,  it   is

necessary  for  us to see that, when the questions  for

the referendum are framed, they will not be put in such

a way as to confuse the people but that it will be made

quite clear to the people what the real issues involved

in  merger are, so that they will be able to vote in an

intelligent  fashion,  because the  questions  will  be

posed in an intelligent way and not in the way that the

Barisan Sosialis want. They want them to be put in such

a way that they can go round telling the people, "There

you  are. The Malays will come and rule this place, it

is  a  sell-out  to the Malays." That  is  a  dangerous

weapon.  Let me tell them, Sir, that in India also  the

Communists tried it. In Ceylon too they tried  it.  And

the  ones  who were destroyed were the Communist  Party

elements, and not the non-Communist elements. So  those

who  take  up the communal weapon will be destroyed  by

the  communal weapon. We are not afraid of  that,  Sir.

They  are  afraid. That is why they are now  trying  to

oppose  this  motion so that they can ensure  that  the

questions for the referendum are framed in the way they

want  them to be framed. We are not such saps. For nine

months  we have struggled not with the Barisan Sosialis

but  with  the boys behind them. They know  that  today

they have come to a dead end. They see a blank wall and

now have no choice but either to climb it or retreat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I oppose this amendment for two reasons. First,

it  is an attempt to inveigle the House into voting for

something which has nothing to do with the real  intent

and purpose of this motion. Second, it is an indication

of  the  thinking of the Barisan Sosialis.  Today  they

have come to point that what they really want to start,

as  the next phase of their battle, is the fight for an

independent Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>



It  is  quite well known, Sir, that at the last meeting

of  the  Singapore General Employees'  Union,  Mr  Lim

Ching  Siong  did  say openly at this  meeting  of  the

cadres  that  they  should  fight  for  an  independent

Singapore. I think the Member for Anson would  be  very

relieved  to  hear that, because that was what  he  had

been pressing for. We are passing him a tip so that  he

may enter into negotiations with Mr Lim Ching Siong.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Where was this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Then, Sir, at the annual meeting of

the  Singapore General Employees' Union at the Victoria

Memorial Hall, Mr Lim Ching Siong said, "We must fight

for  an  independent  Singapore.  The  masses  are  now

fighting  a desperate battle." When they say  "masses",

we know it means the Barisan Sosialis. We are passing a

friendly tip to the Member for Anson who has been  more

or  less  running them down, saying that  while  he  is

prepared  for  an  independent  Singapore  the  Barisan

Sosialis   want   only  an  internally   self-governing

Singapore. Let him therefore stop all this pretence  of

being two different people. Let them all come together,

because  if  they are in the same boat, Sir,  when  the

boat goes down, they will all go down.



<br><br>10.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

crux  of  all the amendments is not whether it  is  the

Government  that has introduced the National Referendum

Bill  or whether the Government has clearly stated  its

stand  on  merger, but on the mode and  manner  of  the

merger that is going to be brought about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is fully committed to

holding a referendum on merger, and there is no way for

them to pull out of it. The only way left for it is  to

carry  out  successfully its White Paper  proposals  on

merger,  and,  as  we have said in  the  last  Assembly

debate, to put out an alternative, as what the Minister

for Culture



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>



has said just now, a Penang and Malacca type of merger,

which  the Opposition Parties in this Assembly did  not

vote for, at least not we in the U.P.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on 12th October, 1961, the Prime

Minister wrote to the leaders of the Opposition Parties

in  the  Assembly.  The  Workers'  Party,  the  Barisan

Sosialis, and the U.P.P. asked the Leader of the  House

to  convene  an  emergency sitting of the  Assembly  to

discuss the P.A.P.'s merger proposals. The contents  of

the  letter  addressed to the leaders of the Opposition

Parties  were  released to the Straits  Times  on  15th

October, 1961. I shall quote extracts from the  Straits

Times of 15th October, 1961. The Prime Minister wrote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'"Not only you as Members of the Opposition but also

the  whole of the people of Singapore should  be  fully

informed  of the agreement in principle that  has  been

reached between the two Governments."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He added: "Every step forward made should be

communicated  to you as Members of the  Opposition  and

also to the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the intention of the Government when all the

details  have been worked out to publish  a  paper  and

table  it  in the Legislative Assembly for debate.  The

people can accept or reject them."'



<br><br>Mr   Speaker,  Sir,  the  Prime  Minister   has   been

honourable  in putting up all his proposals  which  are

embodied  in Command Paper 33, and this Paper has  been

tabled  in the Legislative Assembly for debate and  has

been  supported  by the P.A.P. and the S.P.A. in  this

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> U.M.N.O. too.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Yes, U.M.N.O. too which has now

joined  the  S.P.A. Alliance. But there  is  this  last

sentence which the Prime Minister wrote to the  leaders

of  the  Opposition Parties. "The people can accept  or

reject them." That means that a referendum will be held

and  the  people can accept or reject the  White  Paper

proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, not only is the Government committed

to  a  referendum in this letter of 12th October, 1961,

addressed to all leaders of the Opposition



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>



Parties, but it is further committed in that  the

question  posed in the referendum will be  whether  the

people accept or reject the White Paper proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the last referendum held in the

world   was   the  one  held  in  France  on   Algerian

independence.  The people of France were  asked  either

"oui"  or "non" (yes or no) to whether they agree  (yes

or  no)  to  giving Algeria independence. I shall  also

quote a book which shows the referendum process held in

Australia  in 1951. The book is entitled Communism  and

Democracy  in Australia, and is written by  Webb.  Page

50:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The form of the ballot paper for a referendum is set

out  in  a  schedule  to  the Referendum  (Constitution

Alteration) Act, and the ballot paper itself gives  the

following instructions on how to vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you approve of the proposed law, place the number

1 in the square opposite the word "Yes", and the number

2  in the square opposite the word "No". If you do  not

approve of the proposed law, place the number 1 in  the

square opposite the word "No", and the number 2 in  the

square opposite the word "Yes"."'.



<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, it is described in this book that in

the  Australian  Referendum Act,  the  wording  of  the

referendum  is  contained in the  Act  itself,  and  no

government  in power can play the fool in a referendum.

In  the  1951 referendum, the question asked was this - I

shall quote page 51:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In the 1951 referendum the question asked on the

ballot  paper  was: Do you approve of the proposed  law

for   the   alteration  of  the  Constitution  entitled

Constitution   (A  Iteration  Powers)  to   deal   with

Communists and Communism, 1951?'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker, Sir, in all referendum processes in  the

world, the question posed before the voters always asks

the  voter  yes  or no'. If we accept  this  democratic

process  practised  in other countries  and  which  the

Prime  Minister has promised Members of the Opposition,

then the question which the Government should pose  is:

"Do  you approve of the White Paper proposals or  not?"

Mr  Speaker, Sir, it will not be fair and it  will  be

undemocratic  if  the workers are  asked  whether  they

prefer  which  manner  and mode  of  merger - the  P.A.P.

merger proposals as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>



contained  in Paper Cmd. 33, or the Penang and  Malacca

type of merger which none of the Opposition Parties  in

this Assembly has supported. The Opposition Parties  in

this Assembly never voted for a Penang/Malacca type  of

merger. If the worst comes to the worst and the  people

were  asked what type of merger they would prefer, then

the   ballot   paper  should  put   forward   the   two

alternatives  which the two groups of Parties  in  this

Assembly have supported. One alternative was the  White

Paper  merger  proposals, and  the  other  is  complete

merger  with automatic Federal citizenship  rights  for

all Singapore citizens.



<br><br>10.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Sir, whenever the

question of merger or a form of close association  with

the  Federation is considered, we always reach a  stage

where we break records in this Assembly! The last  time

we  debated merger, I think the debate went on  for  12

days.  This  time  when it comes  close  to  merger  or

something  related to merger, we have three  amendments

on  an  original motion. To my knowledge, Mr  Speaker,

that has never happened in the history of this Assembly

or   of   any  other  Assembly  since  elections   were

introduced into Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position seems to be a very curious one. Whenever

merger  or  anything connected with it is discussed  in

this august Chamber, everybody is agreed on merger. Not

a  soul dissents from it. The Member for Anson possibly

had some doubts whether any form of merger was the best

thing  and whether it might not be better for Singapore

to  be independent. He certainly voiced that doubt. But

other  than  him, every single Member  in  this  House,

whether he belonged to a Party or not, supported merger

and  supported  a closer form of association  with  the

Federation. So that when we had completed the  previous

debate on merger, two clear issues seemed to emerge  at

the  conclusion of that debate. The first one  was  the

merger proposals as set out in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>



White  Paper  which the House eventually approved.  The

second  was  the  merger proposal as  set  out  by  the

Barisan Sosialis, which was, at least in so far as  the

debate  related  itself to the motion,  that  Singapore

should  come  in  as the twelfth State  (thirteenth  or

fourteenth,  as  the  case may be),  and  exactly  like

Johore or any other State. That was the way it was put.

Malacca  and Penang were studiously avoided  from  that

debate, as far as I can remember.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that, Mr Speaker, as far as I can make out, the

position  today is this: all the political Parties  are

agreed on merger. But each of them has different  views

as  to  what merger should be, or how merger should  be

effected,  or  the  complete  ramification  which  must

logically  ensue  on such a merger,  whatever  type  of

merger  it  may  be. On that, there are differences  of

opinion in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is difficult for me to understand

why  we are arguing more about a referendum than  about

the  positions taken up by the various Parties  in  the

debate on merger. As far as I can make out - I hope I  am

not  dumb  in  this - the Government  have  accepted  the

position that before any form of association or merger,

as  the  case  may  be, is accepted in the  Federation,

there  will  be  consultation  with  the  people.   The

Government have expressly said so, and in this debate,

at  least from the statements made by the Minister  for

Culture  and the Deputy Prime Minister, that  seems  to

emerge  quite  clearly.  So  far  as  the  Alliance  is

concerned, there must be a merger. We accept that.  The

Government  have committed themselves to  it  and  they

will  carry it out. Why then did the Member  for  Anson

move  this  motion? I myself find it very difficult  to

understand  why he moved it. If he had  any  doubts  in

this  matter, he could have easily written to the  Hon.

the  Prime Minister and told him this. "Look,  this  is

what  I  hear in town. Is this correct or not?"  And  a

suitable reply from the Prime Minister would have saved

us  all this trouble. This is a complete waste of  time

of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>



House   and,   to  some  extent,  the  Government   are

encouraging it, if I may put it that way. A  short  and

simple  answer to the Member for Anson could well  have

been,  "Of  course, we are going to have a referendum."

That  might  well have been the end of the matter.  But

no. There are undertones and overtones to this which it

is  very  difficult to understand and  appreciate.  The

undertones  and  the overtones are  getting  even  more

subtle than they were at the time of the merger debate.

Everybody knows there must be a referendum. I think the

Barisan   Sosialis  know  there  is  going  to   be   a

referendum. The Workers' Party know there is  going  to

be   a  referendum.  The  Alliance  know  it  and   the

Government know it. What then are we arguing about, Mr

Speaker? I will tell you what the argument is about. It

is  about whether it is going to be in the form of  one

question or two questions or three questions.  That  is

really  what  is  agitating the minds  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  and  the Workers' Party. From  the  amendment

moved by the Member for Queenstown, we can see the fear

of the Barisan Sosialis and the Workers' Party emerging

quite clearly and basically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, to my mind, a referendum is a device

used   by   a   parliamentary  democracy   for   direct

consultation  with the people. Normally a parliamentary

democracy  does not consult the people. But this  is  a

device which Australia and Canada, and America for that

matter,  have  adopted from the continental  countries.

But  as  far  as I know, the English type of  democracy

does not favour a direct referendum to the people. This

is  practised in Australia particularly and in  Canada,

and  in the younger democracies it is certainly a  very

useful device to consult the wishes of the people.  The

governing words, Mr Speaker, Sir, are "to consult  the

wishes  of  the people to ascertain what  is  in  their

minds." Now if all of us then are agreed on merger, but

if  all  of  us  are not agreed on the  exact  type  of

merger, what then should be the form of the referendum?

How should the consultation with the people take place?

If the consultation is going to be a genuine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>



consultation, the question must be framed in such a way

that the people can, as nearly as possible through this

advice,   express  their  views  in  order   that   the

Government  and the Assembly might be guided  by  their

views. Mr Speaker, Sir, it would be an absolute  waste

of  time  to  go to a referendum if the whole  Assembly

knew  exactly  what was in the minds of the  people  of

Singapore.  A referendum is only justified if  we  have

some doubts on the matter on which we are going to  the

country  on  a  referendum. What is  the  doubt  to  be

resolved? The doubt to be resolved, Mr Speaker, is not

whether  there should be a merger. There  is  no  doubt

about  that. We are all agreed on it. But  there  is  a

great  deal  of doubt as to what type of merger  should

be,  how  merger should be effected and  possibly  when

merger  should  be effected. Those are the  matters  on

which  we are not agreed, and on which some of  us  are

doubtful. I know what I want, but it could well be that

I  may be wrong. And therefore it becomes imperative to

consult the people on that issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Mr Speaker, Sir, if that is a correct

appreciation  of  the  situation,  how  then   can   we

determine - by just putting one question to  the  people?

"Do  you  accept  the  White Paper proposals  or  not?"

Right.  Supposing that was the only question  posed  to

the  electorate and the answer was a no, shall we  say.

Where  is the Assembly? Does the Assembly know  exactly

what  is  in the minds of the people? We are  not  very

much  forrader,  Mr Speaker. The people  might  be  in

favour  of the proposal of the Barisan Sosialis. Should

they not be given an opportunity to express their views

on it? I think, in fairness, they should. Or they might

be in favour of the original proposal of the Member for

Anson,  that  we  should  be an independent  territory,

completely  divorced  from the Commonwealth  maybe,  or

working  within the Commonwealth or within the Security

Council. These are matters on which some advice  should

be  sought  from  the people. And if advice  is  to  be

sought from the people along `those lines, how are  you

going to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>



achieve it? By acceding to the amendment of the  Member

for  Queenstown? It would be a practical impossibility.

So,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, we are not really interested - at

least some of us are not really interested - in seeking a

solution to this problem. I think we are interested  in

jamming up the works. The amendment moved by the Member

for  Queenstown is done in that spirit  and  we  cannot

support it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, Members of the Opposition have moved  an

amendment which I think should not have been brought up

at  all.  The real fact is that the representatives  of

the Barisan Sosialis and the Workers' Party are opposed

to  Malaysia  and  merger.  Let  us  take  the  Barisan

Sosialis, it is a Party which is opposed to merger. The

motive  of  this  Party is to come forward  and  oppose

Malaysia  by way of opposing merger. So this  amendment

which they have moved is actually unnecessary. But they

come  to  this House to bring up all sorts of questions

and excuses to confuse the vision of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have heard the Member for Anson

saying just now that the P.A.P. is a dictatorial Party.

I  will  tell  the Member for Anson this.  If  we  were

dictatorial, then he would have been in the gas chamber

instead  of  in  the  Legislative Assembly  Chamber.  I

repeat,  he would have been in the gas chamber  instead

of in the Legislative Assembly Chamber.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis, the Member for Queenstown, also says that we are dictatorial. He further accuses us of making full use of the facilities of Radio Singapore and the table-tennis team and all sorts of travelling missions to propagate our Malaysia concept. What I do not understand is this. If we are prepared to explain our stand to the people, then how can we be called dictatorial? If we are dictatorial,

why should we go and explain to the people? We can very

well tell them that we want this and they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>



must  follow. So I was quite surprised that the  Member

for  Queenstown should, have brought up  this  kind  of

unreasonable  argument to convince the people  This  is

very  difficult for him to do. The people will  not  be

convinced of his argument. Although this may be  beside

the  point,  I will explain why many Party branches  of

the  P.A.P. have sent out basket-ball and table-tennis

teams to places connected with Malaysia. The reason  is

very simple. In the past, there were some narrow-minded

people  in  our Party who were pro-Communist  and  who'

monopolised  the work of the Party, thereby undermining

the  Party in the eyes of the people. Now we have taken

a  new  step in order to extend the activities  of  the

Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown also says that a lot of

rumours have been flying about in Singapore. But in the

past  he  never  said  anything about  rumours.  So  1

believe  they started their rumour campaign on the  1st

of  April,  which is April Fool's Day, on  a  house-to-house  visit.  That is how the rumours started.  I  can

tell this House of their visits to the people. Actually

they  did  not go and explain to the people. When  they

visited  the  people at their houses, they wished  them

good-morning  or  called them uncles,  and  before  the

people  could  ask them any question, they  would  tell

them that they should not accept merger or Malaysia. If

they did, then the Chinese would be sold to the Malays.

If  they  visited Malay family, they would say Malaysia

was  bad. If they visited an Indian family, they  would

say   that  after  merger  Singapore's  economy   would

deteriorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have brought up all sorts of questions and

excuses just to whip up racial emotions to confuse  the

vision   of   the   people   and   to   undermine   the

materialisation  of Malaysia. So after  their  campaign

and  house-to-house visits, starting from  the  1st  of

April,  they  come and tell us that there  are  rumours

flying  about in Singapore about Malaysia  and  merger.

Actually these rumours have been started by them.  They

have  been started as a result of what they have  told

the people. So the rumours which they have started are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>



ringing in their own ears. Then they come and tell  the

House that the whole of Singapore is full of rumours. I

believe  that as Chairman of the Party, the Member  for

Queenstown,  who  is unable to reflect  the  views  and

opinions  of the people, should not come to this  House

and  say that there are a lot of rumours in town.  They

also  say  that the Barisan do not want the  people  to

die. The P.A.P.'s Malaysia plan and the merger plan  do

not  want  the people to die. Instead these  two  plans

want  the people to live, because we know that  if  the

Malaysia   plan   materialises,   then,   territorially

speaking,   we   become   bigger.   We   can    expand.

Economically,  we can provide more jobs for  our  young

people. So in all respects, Malaysia will bring  a  new

and better life to the people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member is now going into too

many details. In fact, he is debating Malaysia. He  can

just  mention  Malaysia in passing, but he  should  not

debate Malaysia now. We have done that already.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

do not wish to take up too much of the Assembly's time.

I  am  coming to the end of my speech. What I am trying

to  say  is  that, as Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis,

the Member for Queenstown should not have said what  he

has said. That is why I stand up to reply. He says that

if  the people accept the Malaysia plan, then they will

be confronted with death. Now, we do not have to bother

with  which  Party is able to bring about Malaysia.  We

have  to  look ahead and ask this: With the success  of

Malaysia,  will there be a greater nation? This  is  an

important  question.  Now, if we  can  have  a  greater

nation with a larger piece of land, then there will  be

greater opportunities for jobs for the people. So,  for

a  Party Chairman to advance such arguments is very bad

indeed.



<br><br>10.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We will now dispose of the amendment

moved by the Member for Queenstown.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original Question was,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this Assembly solemnly assures the citizens of

Singapore that before arrangements are finalised for  a

closer  relationship  with  the  Federation  of  Malaya

and/or  the Borneo territories, and before any  request

is  made  by the Government of Singapore to the British

Government for transfer of territorial sovereignty over

Singapore to the Federation of Malaya or Malaysia,  the

wishes  of  the voters of Singapore will be ascertained

by referendum and the Government will act in accordance

with the views of our citizens so expressed.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which an amendment has been moved by the Deputy

Prime  Minister to leave out from "That" in line  1  to

the   end  and  there  to  insert  "in  view   of   the

Government's  clearly stated stand on the  question  of

merger,    this   House   welcomes   the   Government's

introduction of the Singapore National Referendum  Bill

in  order to hold a referendum to ascertain the  wishes

of  the people on the mode and manner of the inevitable

reunification of Singapore and the Federation of Malaya

before  arrangements  are  finalised  and  before   any

request is made by the Government of Singapore  to  the

British   Government   for  transfer   of   territorial

sovereignty over Singapore to the Federation of  Malaya

or Malaysia".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which an amendment has been moved by the Member

for  Anson to the amendment, to leave out from the very

beginning  to  the word "reunification"  and  there  to

insert  "this  House  welcomes the  Singapore  National

Referendum  Bill  in  order to  hold  a  referendum  to

ascertain the wishes of the people on the".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since which the Member for Queenstown has moved an

amendment to the amendment to the amendment,  to  leave

out  from  the beginning of the Deputy Prime Minister's

amendment  to  `the  words, "before  arrangements"  and

there  to  insert  "this House welcomes  the  Singapore

National  Referendum Bill in order to hold a referendum

to  ascertain the wishes of the people as to whether or

not  they  are  prepared  to accept  the  proposals  as

embodied in the White Paper on Merger (Command Paper 33)".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question I put is a Question which is necessitated

by  reason  of the fact that the Member for  Queenstown

and  the  Member  for Anson are desirous  that  certain

words  in  the  Deputy  Prime Minister's  amendment  be

omitted.  The  Member for Queenstown desires  that  the

words "reunification of Singapore and the Federation of

Malaya"  should be omitted: whereas the Member for  An-son  has not suggested that those words be omitted. So,

the  first Question I would like an answer to  is  that

the   words   "reunification  of  Singapore   and   the

Federation of Malaya" proposed to be left out, be  left

out."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might add that if the voting is against those words

being  left out, then the whole amendment of the Member

for Queenstown falls. I will put the Question then.



<br><br>10.37 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The result of the voting is that the

whole of the amendment of the Member for Queenstown  is

defeated. We are now back to the amendment moved by the

Member for Anson, which is in relation to the amendment

moved by the Deputy Prime Minister. The amendment is to

leave  out  from  the beginning of  that  amendment  to

"reunification", that is to say, to leave out the words

"in  view  of the Government's clearly stated stand  on

the   question  of  merger,  this  House  welcomes  the

Government's  introduction of  the  Singapore  National

Referendum  Bill  in  order to  hold  a  referendum  to

in  order to hold a referendum to ascertain the  wishes

of the people on the".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question is, "That the words proposed to be left

out, be left out."



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I am speaking now

on the amendment to the amendment. The Member for Anson

has  accused the S.P.A. of forming an alliance with the

P.A.P.  It  is indeed a matter which I can  only  laugh

off, because if the record of the debates in this House

were  to show correctly - as I am sure Hansard will show

it  correctly - it  was  first the  S.P.A. and  now  the

Alliance   that  have  provided  the  most  responsible

opposition to the P.A.P. Government. We do not  believe

in   irresponsible  opposition.  We  believe  that  the

interest of the country should come first and  not  the

Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the debate on the Government agreement with

the  Government of the Federation of Malaya (Cmd. Paper

No.  33  of  1961), it was very clear that the  Parties

represented in this Assembly, apart from the Alliance,

were  playing party politics. Although each  and  every

Party did say that they were for a closer



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>



relationship,  for reunification of Singapore  and  the

Federation of Malaya, there were different views as  to

the  manner  in  which this reunification  should  take

place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the referendum, I think everyone

has  agreed  that  it  will have to  be  conducted,  to

consult  the electorate on the constitutional proposals

vis  a  vis  the  reunification of  Singapore  and  the

Federation  of  Malaya. Here again, unfortunately,  all

the  Parties represented in this Assembly,  apart  from

the Alliance, still continue to play party politics. We

who  are a responsible Opposition sometimes can be said

to  be  amused at the play of party politics.  We  have

here the Member for Anson who moved an amendment to the

amendment,  and he has voted with the Barisan  Sosialis

in defeating his own amendment! If the amendment to the

amendment  to  the  amendment had  succeeded,  his  own

amendment would have been defeated. He voted  with  the

Barisan  Sosialis  because it  is  popular,  since  the

Workers' Party has -



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Surely that is

wrong and it should be corrected.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Member indicating that his vote

has  been recorded wrongly? The Member for Anson  voted

`aye'   in   favour  of  the  deletion  of  the   words

"reunification  of  Singapore  and  the  Federation  of

Malaya". Is that his complains?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the deletion was for

the    purpose   of   clarification   of    the    word

"reunification". A man can accept an amendment  to  his

amendment  without in any way denying an  amendment  to

his motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is a point of argument. Tun Lim.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> It could be that the lateness of the

hour  must be having some effect on some of us who have

been  sitting here since 2.30 p.m. But the record  will

show  that  the Member for Anson voted for an amendment

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> The amendment proposed by the Member

for  Anson. He has forgotten how he spoke very strongly

against the Bill, but he is now prepared to welcome it.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of order, Sir. I welcomed the

principle of the Bill and voted in favour of it.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is not a point of order. It is a point

of the Member being misrepresented.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, all we want to say, as a

responsible   Opposition,  is  that  a  referendum   is

necessary, the Government is committed to it,  and  the

introduction  of  the  Referendum  Bill  is   a   clear

indication that a referendum is to be conducted. But we

will  not play party politics on an issue that concerns

the  very  livelihood of the people of  Singapore.  The

Alliance  will  abstain  on  all  amendments   to   the

amendment  as well as on the amendment to the  original

motion.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We are on the amendment of the Member for

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`in view of the Government's clearly stated stand on

the   question  of  merger,  this  House  welcomes  the

Government's  introduction of  the  Singapore  National

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, we cannot accept the amendment  proposed

by  the Government. From the Government's intention  of

deleting  the words from the motion of the  Member  for

Anson,  we  can  clearly  see  their  motive.  In   the

Government amendment, there is a word which has  caught

my  attention.  This  word is  "reunification"  in  the

phrase  "reunification of Singapore and the  Federation

of  Malaya". In this amendment of the Government,  they

have  not used the word "merger", which means that  the

Government  clearly  understand  that  the  people   of

Singapore have already seen through the P.A.P. type  of

merger.  Therefore, they do not dare  mention  now  the

word  merger".  Now  they  use  another  word,  namely,

"reunification" in its stead, in order to  deceive  the

people  of  Singapore. It was because of this  that  we

moved    our    amendment   to   delete    that    word

"reunification".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.59 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr JOHN MAMMEN) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Government's amendment, we see that they

intend  to delete the last part of the motion  proposed

by  the  Member  for  Anson - that  is,  the  words  "the

Government will act in accordance with the views of our

citizens so expressed". Why should the Government  want

to  delete  such a phrase? This is because  the  P.A.P.

Government are not prepared to accept the views of  the

people.  It also goes to show that they are  now  under

pressure   to   hold   such   a   national   referendum

unwillingly.  The  Government's intention  of  deleting

such a phrase shows that they have no confidence in the

result of the coming national referendum. From this, it

can   also   be  seen  what  purpose  is  the  national

referendum if the Government are not sincere about  the

so-called  national referendum. They want to  play  the

political game.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, this question of a national referendum is one which touches on merger and which affects our people. The original motion of the Member for Anson states "That this Assembly solemnly assures the citizens of Singapore...". This wording clearly shows that the mover of this motion is taking this issue above party politics. But the Government have another attitude towards it. From the amendment moved by the

Government, we can see that the holding of  a  nationa1

referendum  is to play party politics and  it  will  be

conducted  on  that  line. If the  Government  are  not

trying  to play party politics, why cannot they  accept

the  original  motion,  that  is  to  say,  "That  this

Assembly solemnly assures the citizens of Singapore" of

certain things?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, another reason why we cannot

accept  the amendment by the Government is that  before

the  National Referendum Bill is passed we must get  an

assurance  that  it  will  accept  the  views  of   the

Opposition   Parties  to  delete  certain  unreasonable

provisions in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

was  saying  just now that the amendment moved  by  the

Government was intended to use the word "reunification"

to  replace  the  word "merger". This is  the  type  of

constitutional  relationship  envisaged  in  the  White

Paper. They now dare not use the word "merger", because

the  word "merger" has already been seen through by the

people  for  what  it means. Can the proposals  in  the

White Paper, which outlines the plan for merger between

Singapore  and  Malaya,  be  truly  called  a  kind  of

reunification?  Can the proposals in  the  White  Paper

achieve  a reunification or merger? The answer  is  no.

Tunku   Abdul  Rahman,  the  Prime  Minister   of   the

Federation  of  Malaya,  also  did  not  use  the  word

"reunification" to describe the proposals in the  White

Paper.  What he said was a type of closer relationship.

Only  this and nothing more. From this, it can be  seen

that  the  P.A.P.  Government are  now  trying  to  use

another  term to deceive the people so that an  unequal

type of merger, as in the White Paper, can be accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the amendment moved by the Government, there is another term used. That is, the "mode and manner," which refers to the mode and manner of merger. Why do the Government not dare to express clearly, by their wording in the White Paper, the merger proposed by them? Why should they use this new term in its stead?





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Hong Lim, in the course of his

speech,  also  correctly pointed  out  what  the  Prime

Minister  said  on the 12th of October  last  year.  In

answer to the leaders of all the political Parties,  he

said  in his letter that the people would' be consulted

on  whether  they accepted or rejected the White  Paper

proposals  on  merger. But from the  amendment  of  the

Government,  we can see that they intend to  eat  their

own words. The Government have the intention of evading

what  the Prime Minister promised or guaranteed to  the

leaders  of the political Parties represented  in  this

Assembly. From the terms of the Government's amendment,

we  can  see  that  not  only have  the  Government  no

confidence  in the national referendum, but  they  have

also  no  confidence in their own merger  proposals  as

contained in the White Paper. The Government have  also

no confidence in the parliamentary system of consulting

the people for their opinions. If the Government do not

like  the people to freely express their views; if  the

Government  will not allow the people to fully  express

their views; and if also the Government want the people

to accept their type of merger as outlined in the White

Paper,  then  it  would be better that  the  Government

should not waste so many thousands of dollars to  carry

out this type of national referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that if the Government are

determined not to abide by the opinions of the  people;

if  they are not prepared to act according to the  will

of  the  people; if they will not allow the  people  to

express  freely and correctly their own views;  and  if

they  like  to  use deceiving methods to carry  through

their  type of merger, then it will cause very  serious

consequences  to  our State. If this misfortune  should

happen,   the   Government   should   bear   all    the

responsibilities.



<br><br>11.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, there are times when democracy

cannot be practised. There are places where we can  see

that parliamentary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>



democracy is not successful, and  there  is  a

scrambling  for  power  by the  military  in  order  to

safeguard  the security of the State. This is necessary

when  the  lives of the people are in difficulties,  or

when the machinations of irresponsible leaders who have

no  sense of responsibility to their country, or  of  a

group  of men who have no real interest in the  country

in which they are staying, have to be dealt with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we consider a referendum to be a good device

for the purpose of consulting the people.  But, as  has been

explained by my colleague, the Member  for Farrer  Park,

this  issue which we are  discussing  is being played about

in some irresponsible quarters.



<br><br>11.26 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr John Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have followed the debate on merger in this

Assembly.  I believe the people of Singapore,  who  did

not  understand the debate, could see clearly the  good

and  the bad points about the matters discussed in this

Assembly. But there are some quarters in this  Assembly

who  carry out irresponsible activities. They  are  not

responsible  to this country and they do not  wish  the

people  to  have a prosperous and peaceful  country.  I

believe  the  type  of  merger  they  demand  today  is

something  in  which they themselves  do  not  believe,

because what they really want is that there should  not

be any merger. However, they are not disposed to; state

clearly  that they do not want merger. They  only  hide

behind the issue of the referendum and so on. Some have

raised  this issue as a matter of party politics.  What

they really want, in my view, if they can achieve it is

a large field wherein they can gather all the people in

order to arrive at a decision on an issue. What we  are

now  discussing  seems to be producing no  results.  In

this respect, it appears that the Barisan Sosialis  are

actively  carrying out a dangerous line  of  propaganda

which  has given rise to communalism. If they  continue

to persist in this line,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



it  will create an undesirable situation for the people

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Mr Deputy Speaker, that every Member of this

Assembly will discuss our problem sanely, because there

is no other way to improve the situation. We have hoped

there  should  be  a  merger. But  now,  the  means  of

achieving  merger is through a referendum, and  we  see

this  issue  being  played about. As emphasised  by  my

colleague,  we on our part will not take  part  in  the

voting because we regard this matter as a part of party

politics.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I  did not quite hear what the Member  for  Anson

said just now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was saying that the

intention  of the motion brought forward by the  Member

for  Anson  is  to assure that the people  can  express

their  views on the question of merger and the question

of  Malaysia. However, unfortunately, when  the  motion

was  amended  by  the  Government,  it  has  caused  an

unnecessary debate. If both sides of the House  believe

that  democracy can be practised in this State, then  I

think the question is very simple.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The debate arising

from  the  amendment by the Government is  unnecessary.

For  example, in the amendment by the Government, there

is  one  sentence which says that the reunification  of

Singapore and the Federation of Malaya is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



inevitable. My point is that since we all eat rice,  if

the  P.A.P. Government put some poison in the rice  and

if  they  want us to eat it, then, of course,  we  will

refuse to eat it. When the Government put forward their

White  Paper  merger proposals, some of  them  are  not

acceptable to the Opposition. We support the concept of

merger.  We  do  not  want to give the  Government  the

excuse  to  say that we are opposed to merger  and  the

concept  of Malaysia. This has been our stand. But  the

behaviour  of  the P.A.P. reminds me  of  the  Japanese

occupation   in  Singapore.  During  that  period   the

Japanese  troops committed atrocities in  this  country

which  were very similar to what the P.A.P. are  doing

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no point in opposing a national referendum.

Let  me  quote  some  incidents.  During  the  Japanese

occupation, the atrocities and barbarities committed by

the Japanese troops could be likened to what the P.A.P.

are  doing today. At that time there were many gambling

dens in Singapore. There was a kind of gambling by  the

Chinese known as "fan tan". This kind of gambling -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): On a point of order. This is

not relevant to the amendment.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> It is not a point of order. The

hon.  Member is just giving a comparison.  If  he  goes

into details and is out of order, then I will pull  him

up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Teng Kian -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Teng Kian</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): In this kind of

gambling  the  figures 1, 2, 3, 4 are written.  At  one

time the Japanese Army went to gamble in these gambling

dens.  The  result was that they lost all their  money.

The  next  day  they thought of a scheme and  went  and

gambled  again. They used only chips on the  table,  no

actual money. Then the chips would be counted in fours,

and  if  there was only one chip remaining at the  end,

that would be No. 1; if there were two chips remaining,

that would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



be  No. 2; if there were three chips remaining, then it

would be No. 3; and if there were four remaining at the

end,  it  would  be  No.  4. But the  unreasonable  and

barbaric  Japanese  soldiers  on  this  particular  day

forcibly asked the gambling den operators not to  count

in fours but in twos, so that they could stake on No. 1

and No. 2, because then the result would be either 1 or

2.  So they were in a very advantageous position to win

the  game.  The  method  of  referendum  gives  me  the

impression that it is quite similar to how the Japanese

soldiers behaved in the gambling dens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, because of the debate arising

out of the question of merger, the friendship which has

existed between Singapore and the Federation for a long

time  has now become very unstable. This is regrettable

because  we  in the Opposition and the Government  both

are  quite  unanimous  in  supporting  the  concept  of

merger. But because we do not agree with the Government

on the method and form of merger, there is the question

of  closing down the causeway, which has given rise  to

fear  among  the people of Singapore. So we would  urge

the  Government,  if they do believe  in  parliamentary

democracy,  to do this simple thing - let the  people  of

Singapore  choose either of these two alternatives - one,

whether the people of Singapore are prepared to  accept

the  merger proposals as contained in the White  Paper,

or  whether they are opposed to those proposals. It  is

as simple as that. There is no need for any argument or

debate. Now, if the P.A.P. do not do this, then, in  my

opinion, they do not dare to face the people.  That  is

why  they  are  thinking of the  method  which  I  have

already described, and which the Japanese soldiers used

in  the gambling dens. This behaviour of the P.A.P. has

given me the opportunity to recollect that incident.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br>11.45 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Deputy Speaker, Sir, today the Government has moved  an

amendment to the motion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



tabled by the Member for Anson. We can see clearly that

the  present  P.A.P.  Government is  quite  similar  to

Hitler's  Government in the past. There  is  only  this

difference  between them. Hitler was able  to  mobilise

all  his  military forces to suppress  nearly  all  the

people of the world whereas the P.A.P. cannot do so. If

the  P.A.P. were to have such military forces  at  its

disposal, I believe that it would not hesitate to  make

use  of  them  to  force the people of  Singapore  into

accepting      the     retrogressive     constitutional

arrangements; but because it does not have the military

forces  that Hitler had, it has attempted to  introduce

all   sorts   of   devices  to  achieve  constitutional

arrangements  which  are not in  the  interest  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, some Government Members have

contradicted  their own statements.  For  example,  the

Minister  for  Culture, when touching on the  amendment

moved  by  the  Member for Queenstown,  said  that  the

Government cannot put only one question - the question of

the  White Paper on merger - in the referendum  because,

if the Government should do so, then the Assembly would

be  involved  and  committed  to  the  framing  of  the

question in the referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the White Paper on the merger

proposals  was  debated  in  a  motion  moved  by   the

Government in this House. Since then, the Ministers  of

the  Government  have stressed in  the  newspapers,  at

Press  interviews  and radio forums,  and  through  all

forms  of  publicity  facilities, the  point  that  the

future constitutional arrangements would be referred to

the  people for a final decision. In other words,  Cmd.

Paper  No.  33 of 1961 would be referred to the  people

for  a  decision as to whether they accept  the  merger

proposals  agreed between the P.A.P, and the Federation

Government. So we can clearly see today in  this  House

that there is a very simple question to be answered  by

the  people of Singapore. This question is one where  a

yes  or no is required to the White Paper proposals  on

merger. It is not a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



matter of putting various questions to the people for a

decision.  The  P.A.P. knows this very  well.  It  also

knows  that,  as  far as the people  of  Singapore  are

concerned, the White Paper proposals on merger are  not

acceptable. That is why the Government has not got  the

guts to put down the White Paper proposals on merger in

the  ballot  paper.  If the Government  is  sincere  in

wanting to refer this issue in a referendum -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I would like to remind the

hon.  Member that at the present moment we are debating

the amendment moved by the Deputy Prime Minister. If he

wanted to debate the White Paper, the proper time would

have  been  when  the  Member for Queenstown  moved  an

amendment to Cmd. Paper No. 33 of 1961.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, I

am  now  trying to make you understand this,  that  the

amendment  of  the Government concerns  the  "mode  and

manner"   of   reunification  of  Singapore   and   the

Federation.  The House has discussed this  question  of

the  "mode and manner" as contained in the White Paper.

Where  is  the other "mode and manner" for the decision

of  the people? If the Government has the courage, then

I  will  challenge it to amend the motion of the Member

for  Anson  `by using the words "White Paper"  therein,

and   then  refer  the  matter  to  the  people  in   a

referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the question before this

House  and  before  the  people  is  very  simple.  The

amendment of the Government has indicated to the people

of Singapore that more than one question will be put in

the  national  referendum for a decision,  because  the

P.A.P. knows  that the people of Singapore  treat  the

White Paper like poison. If the P.A.P. were to ask  the

people whether they wanted to drink poison - that  is  to

say,  whether they wanted the White Paper proposals  on

merger - I am quite sure that 100 per cent of the  people

in  Singapore would reject them; but because the  Prime

Minister  on many occasions has promised to refer  this

matter



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



to  the people for a decision, the Government  has

to  make  use  of  a democratic  device  and  take

advantage  of  democratic  forms  to  deceive  the

people  of  Singapore  into believing  that  their

future  is to be decided by themselves and not  by

the  P.A.P. The P.A.P. is cunningly trying to make

use  of  more than one question for a decision  by

the  people.  If the P.A.P. has the confidence  of

the  people and if it has given publicity  to  the

advantages  of  the  White  Paper  on  merger  and

Malaysia,  then I believe the people of Singapore,

who  are  reasonable and rational,  will  consider

carefully the speeches and arguments of the P.A.P.

The P.A.P. has said that the White Paper on merger

is   good  and  advantageous  to  the  people   of

Singapore, which is tantamount to saying that  the

P.A.P. has confidence in the people. If  that  is

so, then there is every reason to believe that the

P.A.P, should put one question to the people in  a

referendum, and that is whether the White Paper on

merger is acceptable to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Cairnhill says the Alliance has never indulged  in

party  politics.  He  claims  that  his  Party  is

looking  after the interests of the whole country.

I do not understand what he means by "the interest

of  the country". I do not know whether he has  in

mind  the  interest of the people. By the interest

of  the country, does he mean the interest of  the

minority leadership of the P.A.P. and the  leaders

of the Alliance?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the P.A.P. and the

Alliance  held different political  views  in  the

past,  but  now  they seem to have  come  to  some

agreement.  The  Member  for  Cairnhill  wants  to

convey the impression that the amendment moved  by

the Barisan Sosialis is only in the interest of an

individual  Party  instead  of  in  the   national

interest. I wish to inform him that we look  after

not only the interest of the country, but also the

interest of the people of Singapore, including the

interest of their children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, if the coming national

referendum   and   the   proposed   constitutional

arrangements  cannot be conducted on  a  basis  of

equality, then, as the Member for Southern Islands

has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>



said,  suspicions and fears will inevitably  arise

in the minds of the various communities.

<div align="center"><b>THE FORGOTTEN DETAINEES OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>1956 AND 1957 UNDER THE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PRESERVATION OF PUBLIC</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SECURITY ORDINANCE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not think

I  need apologise to this House for keeping it for

another  few minutes, since the people of  whom  I

have  to  speak have been kept waiting for several

years.  I  want  to  speak to you  tonight  of  14

people,  whom I have never met, whose names  I  do

not  know and whom I do not know personally in any

way  whatsoever, who languish in prison  and  have

languished in prison for five to six years without

trial  by  executive order renewed  from  time  to

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, in the year 1955, the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance was passed against P.A.P. opposition in this Assembly, and vicious and malicious P.A.P. propaganda out side this Assembly was led by the present Prime Minister and his henchmen, Mr Lim Ching Siong and Mr Devan Nair. At that time, the present Minister for Health condemned what he called the

undemocratic   Preservation  of  Public   Security

Ordinance  in  no  uncertain terms.  During  1955,

despite   considerable   teething   troubles    in

Singapore,  the provisions of this Ordinance  were

so  sparingly and so fairly used - all the detainees

were   released   as   soon  as   conditions   had

settled - that no criticism was levelled against its

use in that period.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came 1956 and 1957 when there was unrest,

and   the   provisions  of  the   Ordinance   were

extensively  used  and a large number  of  persons

were  detained.  It  is not the  purpose  of  this

motion to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



seek  to  reopen either the issue of the need  for  the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance today or  the

propriety  or otherwise of the detentions of  1956  and

1957.  The purpose of this motion, Mr Deputy  Speaker,

is  to  draw  the  attention of hon.  Members  of  this

Assembly  to  the fact that human beings who  have  not

been  found guilty by any Court are imprisoned for five

and six years during a period when there is no question

of  an emergency. Even serious offences under our Penal

Code  are very rarely met with such extensive terms  of

actual   imprisonment,  for  it  is   recognised   that

imprisonment  has  a deleterious effect  upon  a  human

being,  and  unless  a  man  is  beyond  the  hope   of

redemption  the Courts will not impose sentences  which

will  destroy  his personality completely.  How  do  we

justify the continued detention of these forgotten  men

of 1956 and 1957?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, it is interesting to note that on the

night of 20th/2lst July last year - that unhappy all-night

sitting which started a curious P.A.P. circus - the Deputy

Prime Minister said, and I quote from col. 1682:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There were altogether 61 persons detained on 2nd June,

1959.  From  the day the P.A.P, assumed office  on  3rd

June, 1959, to date. 35 persons have been released.  Of

those  who were detained by the previous Government  in

the two purges of 1956 and 1957, there are now only  18

persons still under detention.'.



<br><br>Those are the persons of whom I am speaking, Mr Deputy

Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is vital that the continued detention of these 18

detainees  should  not be allowed to obscure  the  main

issue  in  the  minds of the people, and  that  is  the

political future of Singapore - whether we are to  attain

independence through merger with the Federation in 1963

either  with  or  without  the Borneo  territories,  or

whether, as has been suggested by Mr Lim Ching Siong's

group,  the  next  step should not  be  merger  hut  an

internally   self-governing   Singapore   without   the

Internal Security Council.'.



<br><br>He added:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would like to lay on the Table the Singapore

Government's  Paper  to the Internal  Security  Council

dated  12th  August, 1959, for the information  of  the

House.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>



At  a  later  stage, Mr Deputy Speaker, he said  [col.1683]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`... in the light of recent developments which have

been  outlined by the Prime Minister to the  House,  to

remove  all  doubts and any vestige of suspicion  about

the  sincerity of the P.A.P. Government in  wanting  to

release  these  detainees, we have no  alternative  but

feel  compelled  that the whole truth  should  be   made

known to the people.'.



<br><br>"... the sincerity of the P.A.P. Government in wanting  to

release  these  detainees..."! This was  nine  months

ago.  Let  me  continue. This is what the Deputy  Prime

Minister said in ending up:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The importance of the question of merger so outweighs

all  other considerations that we are anxious that this

side  issue  of  continued detention of  the  detainees

should  be  immediately resolved [note the  words,  Mr

Deputy  Speaker,  "immediately resolved"]  and  not  be

allowed  to  be  used  as an argument  against  merger.

Notwithstanding the stand of the British Government  in

the Internal Security Council,'-



<br><br>"Notwithstanding  the stand" - brave words,  Mr  Deputy

Speaker:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Notwithstanding the stand of the British Government

in   the   Internal  Security  Council,  the  Singapore

Government  will issue orders for the  release  of  the

detainees  in  hatches from time to time in  accordance

with  the original proposal of the Singapore Government

to the Internal- Security Council. In doing so, I would

like  to  clarify  that it is not  the  desire  of  the

Singapore  Government to precipitate  any  conflict  or

crisis with the Federation Government with whom it  has

always  been  our  policy  to  maintain  amicable   and

brotherly relationship in the interest of the people of

both territories.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, that is an unequivocal assurance that having

considered  fully  the interest of the  Federation  and

having  considered fully the opposition of the  British

Government, the P.A.P. Government was going to  proceed

with  its firm intention to release the detainees  whom

it  had wanted to release from 12th August, 1959.  This

was  said two years after 1959. We are today in  1962 -

nine months after those words were said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, despite this formal assurance of

the Deputy Prime Minister, I have to inform you that on

2nd  April,  1962,  I received an intimation  from  the

Ministry of Home Affairs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



that only four of these 18 persons detained during  the

1956/1957  purges were released between 20th  July  and

2nd  April. I am not guaranteeing the accuracy  of  the

figure  given by the Ministry, but I will be  happy  to

table  the letter itself, Sir. I shall table it at  the

end of my speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember that I sought this information by a

Written Question. Maybe the Minister misunderstood  its

purport,  but let us give him the benefit of the  doubt

and  assume he did. In any event, he was not ready  and

so  I had to write him a fairly lengthy letter spelling

out  what I required. And after two weeks, I did get  a

reply - unequivocal  for  a change - stating  categorically

that four persons of these 18 whom they had promised to

release nine months ago have now been released.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I cannot see how persons who have

spent  more  than five to six years in gaol can  really

continue   to   be  effective  agents   of   subversive

organisations  if,  in  fact,  they  belong   to   such

organisations.  After being five to six  years  out  of

circulation,  it is not unreasonable to assume,  unless

they  are  particularly prominent  personalities,  that

their  release  cannot materially affect  the  security

position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I am heartened in this view - not

that  I  need any support from the P.A.P. but  just  in

case  they  wish  to indulge in arguments  which  belie

their  own  documents - let me remind  them, Mr  Deputy Speaker,  of the paper which they tabled in

this  House on  the night of 20th July, 1961, being their

ISC.59 of 12th August, 1959, Secret, and this is what it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Once he is released [that is, Mr Lim Ching Siong is

released],  it  makes very little difference  from  the

point  of view of subversion whether the remaining  40-odd

detainees are released or not, because they cannot

materially affect the security position.'.



<br><br>This  was  written in 1959 - almost three  years  ago - in

respect of these persons who had then been two to three

years in gaol and who are still today in gaol. Why  are

they still detained? Is it because since 20th July  the

P.A.P. has  suddenly awakened to the fact  that  these

former P.A.P. members would not return



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>



to  the  P.A.P. fold? Why the change of position  from

three years ago? Why this additional broken promise?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the bitter lessons I have learned and

relearned in the nine months I have been here  is  that

an  appeal  to the Government on the grounds of  reason

and on the grounds of humanity will more often than not

be  met  with  raucous laughter more appropriate  to  a

different  institution. The only  logic  to  which  the

P.A.P. Government is open is the logic of power. But  I

would  ask  the P.A.P. and those who sleep  behind  the

Front Bench: what of these comrades of theirs who  five

to  six years ago were detained and whose release  they

promised  to obtain when they took office? How  do  you

justify,  Mr Deputy Speaker, these 14 human beings  in

prison  for five to six years by executive order  at  a

time  of  peace in the face of Government's own promise

to   release   them   and  the  Government's   official

recognition  that  their release - in the  words  of  the

letter  of 12th August, 1959 - "cannot materially  affect

the  security  position"?  How  do  you  justify  their

continued detention?



<br><br>00.15 a.m. (18th April, 1962)



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Deputy  Speaker, before I go on to show  for  whom  the

Member for Anson is acting as proxy, let me dispose  of

his  allegation  that  the Government  has  broken  its

promise made on its behalf by the Deputy Prime Minister

on  20th  July, 1961. It is necessary to get our  facts

straight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As those who have followed recent correspondence

between  the  Member  for Anson and  the  Minister  for

Health  and  Law in the Chinese Press will  appreciate,

the  Member for Anson is strong on fiction and weak  on

facts.  What  was the promise made by the Deputy  Prime

Minister  on 20th July in this Assembly? Let  me  quote

the relevant portions in Hansard, Vol. 14, No. 23, col.

1683:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Notwithstanding the stand of the British Government

in   the   Internal  Security  Council, the  Singapore

Government  will issue orders for the  release  of  the

detainees  in  batches from time to time in  accordance

with  the original proposal of the Singapore Government

to the Internal Security Council.'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



There  was no pledge of unconditional release within  a

specified  time. We could not have done so for  obvious

reasons.  This  was  made clear in  the  sentence  that

immediately  followed the quotation I have  just  made.

This reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In doing so, I would like to clarify that it is not

the  desire  of the Singapore Government to precipitate

any  conflict or crisis with the Federation  Government

with  whom  it has always been our policy  to  maintain

amicable and brotherly relationship in the interest  of

the people of both territories.'.



<br><br>In other words, since the Federation is a member of the

Internal  Security Council, it is necessary to convince

the  Federation representative that the  release  of  a

detainee does not constitute a security risk.  In  this

connection,  may I quote an authority whom  the  Member

for  Anson  can  disregard only at his own  peril?  The

authority  is  none  other than the  Member  for  Upper

Serangoon.   He   made  this  pronouncement   on   21st

September, 1960, when the Member for Hong Lim brought a

motion   asking  for  the  unconditional   release   of

detainees. I quote from Hansard, Vol. 13, No.  9,  col.

707. This is what the Member for Upper Serangoon said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But, if among those who are now detained there are

some  who  do  not  believe in peaceful  constitutional

struggle  and  who harbour the design of replacing  the

democratic   parliamentary  system  with  a   Communist

regime, then the P.A.P. has no obligation to fight  for

their release and their freedom.'.



<br><br>Needless  to say, the Member for Upper Serangoon  voted

against   the   unconditional  release   of   political

detainees. The strictures that the Member for Nee  Soon

made  on  the  Member  for Hong Lim  for  bringing  the

detainee issue were so spirited that the Speaker had to

call  upon  him  to  withdraw some  telling  nouns  and

adjectives  directed against the Member for  Hong  Lim.

But  one sentence which was not ruled out of order  may

be  of  some interest to the Member for Anson. I  quote

from Hansard, Vol. 13, No. 9, col. 716:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Running through this motion, we are able to read in

and between the lines the false premises messed-up with

paranoic tendencies of a persecution complex.'.



<br><br>And  in col. 717, the Member for Nee Soon also had this

to say:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I [that is the Member for Nee Soon] might add, Sir,

that  the original motion was worded to make it  appear

that the Singapore Government had never fought for  the

release  of the detainees. Nothing can be further  from

the truth. Even before the P.A.P. formed Government the

wheels  were set in motion for the release of political

detainees by the collective leadership of the Party.'.



<br><br>He went on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Since then we have unrelentingly fought for the

release of the remaining political detainees, and  will

continue to fight for their release.'.



<br><br>And in col. 718, he continued:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If he [that is, the Member for Hong Lim] agrees that

the  creation of a democratic, socialist, non-Communist

Malaya  is  in the best interest of this country,  then

surely  he  must agree with us, Mr Speaker, Sir,  that

any  power  that  seeks  to overthrow  this  democratic

system  by subversion and by violence must be  squarely

met and boldly dealt with.'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Havelock was no less hard on the Member

for  Hong Lim for bringing this motion. He thought that

the  Member for Hong Lim brought the motion  to  revive

his  fading  political prestige. In the  end,  all  the

Barisan  Sosialis Members approved the  amended  motion

which reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly urges the Government to continue

to  fight  in  the  Internal Security Council  for  the

release of all political detainees who were detained by

the  Lim Yew Hock Government and this Assembly endorses

the  Government's view that the detainees should assist

the  Government in its efforts to secure their  release

by  sincerely  repudiating  the  methods  and  aims  of

political  forces  dedicated to the  overthrow  of  the

democratic system by subversion and violence.'.



<br><br>In  the  context  of the debate, what  this  meant  was

clear.  These  detainees  can help  the  Government  to

secure  their  release by categorically and  decisively

repudiating  Communism  and  allegiance  to   Communist

objectives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member for Upper Serangoon observed, the P.A.P.

has   no  obligation  to  fight  for  the  release   of

Communists or their willing henchmen. The Deputy  Prime

Minister's statement of July 1961 was not a promise  of

unconditional release of the 17 persons still detained,

14 of whom were detained during the 1956/57 purges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Eighteen.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> No. We have 17 left. Since the

Deputy  Prime Minister made his speech in the  Assembly

in  July  1961, 9 further detainees have been released,

and  out  of these nine, 4 were from the 1956 and  1957

purges. So there arc 17 left.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> On a point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> If the Minister will give way. The

Minister does not give way.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Out of these 17, 14 were detained

during  the  1956 and 1957 purges. The  P.A.P. made  a

pledge of unconditional release only in regard to the 8

P.A.P. members who were intimately connected with  the

leadership of the Party. These included Mr  Lim  Ching

Siong,  Mr  Fong  Swee  Suan and  Mr  Woodhull  among

others.  We  secured  their release  as  promised  just

before  we assumed office on 5th June, 1959. As regards

the others who were members of the Party, we agreed  to

press for their release to the best of our ability  and

having  regard to the tripartite nature of the Internal

Security  Council.  Of the 61 persons  under  detention

when the P.A.P. assumed office, only 17 are still under

detention.  The Government would like to  secure  their

release,  as it has secured the release of the  others.

To  do this, we must convince the Federation Government

that these persons are not security risks, and the best

way to do this is - as was stated in the resolutions  of

September  1960  and  approved by those  who  now  call

themselves  the Barisan Sosialis - for the  detainees  to

categorically and sincerely repudiate Communism.  I  do

not  know  whether  the Member for  Anson,  unlike  the

Member for Nee Soon and the Member for Upper Serangoon,

is  suggesting that we should press for the release  of

detainees  who  are  not prepared to disavow  Communist

ambitions as he has admitted in this Assembly that  his

Party has been captured by the Communists.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> That is not true.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> But if he himself has not been

captured by the Communists who run his Party,  then  he

will do better to exhort the detainees to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>



categorically  repudiate Communism  and  thus  make  it

easier  to secure their release. To ask for the release

of  those  who are not prepared to repudiate  Communism

would  be  to act as proxy for Communist designs  at  a

time  when  the  Communists are not  only  looking  for

stooges but also for much needed cadres for the  coming

battle.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, time is

very  short  and I will not be long about  this.  These

people have been detained for seven years, from 1955 to

1962,  and  all  on  what? It  was  on  the  advice  of

informers,  agents  provocateurs  and  spies  who  tail

people  and  make  up  stories.  These  detainees   are

spending  the  best years of their lives in  detention.

What  crimes  have they committed? Robbery? Kidnapping?

Murder?  Even  people who have committed  such  crimes,

Sir,  have only limited periods of detention  and  they

know  when they can expect to be out. What future  have

the  detainees now? Their future now depends on whether

or  not  they get into the good books of the P.A.P.  If

the  P.A.P. leaders in their whims and fancies  should

want  to  release them, they come out,  otherwise  they

will continue to be detained.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b>

Repudiate Communism.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All at the whims and fancies of the

P.A.P. leaders! The Prime Minister himself  said  long

ago that he would consider all detainees -



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On their merits.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Not on their merits but that if at

any  time certain of the detainees were to be released,

he  would  consider all detainees as belonging  to  the

same class - all put together. No separation has been -
