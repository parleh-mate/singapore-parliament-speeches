<div align="center"><b>BASIC FOODSTUFFS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Compilation of price-list)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister of

Finance whether the Department of Statistic will

compile a list of prices of basic foodstuffs in the

main markets in Singapore and make such information

available to the public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>



daily through radio television and the press to keep

the people informed of price trends so that they may

avoid being overcharged by unscrupulous vendors.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr Tang See Chim) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at present, retail prices

for  a wide range of basic foodstuffs, perishable and

non-perishable,  are  collected  regularly   by   the

Department of Statistics for the purpose of  the  compilation  of  the  Consumer Price  Index.  The  items

included for regular pricing were selected based on a

Household   Expenditure  Survey  conducted   by   the

Statistics  Department  and  generally  reflect   the

consumption  pattern  of the average  household.  For

perishable  foodstuffs, e.g.,  meat,  poultry,  fish,

fruits  and  vegetables, prices are collected  weekly

from  market-stalls in eight markets in the Republic.

In  the  case of non-perishable foodstuffs where  the

prices  are  normally not subject to  frequent  daily

fluctuations,  e.g.,  rice  and  sundry   provisions,

prices are collected twice a month from retail  shops

distributed in the main shopping centres. A total  of

about  140  items are covered in this  regular  price

collection, and the data are primarily used  for  the

compilation  of  the  Consumer Price  Index.  Monthly

average  prices of the major items are also  compiled

and  published  in the Monthly Digest of  Statistics.

Occasional revisions to the list of items  have  been

made  as  and  when  necessary,  and  the  Department

intends to undertake a detailed study of the existing

retail price collection system and the compilation of

the Consumer Price Index with a view to assessing the

need for any major changes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data collected for the compilation of the retail

price index are not suitable for use as a daily guide

to the consuming public for the following reasons:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the data are not collected daily;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) prices tend to vary according to locality,

from  market to market and in different  stalls

in the same market;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) prices depend on the quality of items, the

buyer/seller  relationship and  the  bargaining

capacity of the customer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The retail price index is a weighted average of

prices  of  goods  and  services  entering  into  the

consumption  pattern  of  the  average  working-class

household. In compiling the index, specific  care  is

taken to exclude the influence on prices arising from

the  variations  in  locality,  quality  of  product,

buyer/seller relationship and the bargaining capacity

of  customers,  which are important factors  directly

affecting the personal shopper in the market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These considerations will still obtain even if the

data  are  collected  daily and  will  therefore  not

provide the kind of guidance to the consuming  public

that the Member for Kallang would desire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this and of the expenses that would be

involved  in  a  daily  collection  of  data,  it  is

considered uneconomical to employ a large  number  of

staff and resources to undertake such an exercise.

<div align="center"><b>HOUSE ASSESSMENTS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Disparity)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr N. Govindasamy</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  why is the annual value of certain  dwelling

houses in a housing estate assessed at double that of

other houses in the same estate where the houses  are

each  of  similar  construction and size  and  owner-occupied.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, every property on  the  Valuation

List  should be valued in the same manner. From  time

to  time,  the Chief Assessor corrects the  Valuation

List  to  remove anomalies which are brought  to  his

attention.  Due to the considerable workload  in  the

department,  it has not been possible to correct  all

the  anomalies that arose from earlier valuations  by

the City Council and the Rural Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are instances where values shown on the

Valuation  List  have to be corrected for  individual

houses  in the same area, but care is taken to ensure

that the property tax payable is the same.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Telok Blangah will write to me on

specific cases that he comes across, I will see to it

that the anomalies are corrected.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, it is not a

matter  of  old houses being valued at  City  Council

rates,  but  a  matter of houses in the  same  estate

being  valued  at different rates and certain  houses

being given concessions -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Govindasamy, we have 26 questions

on  the Order Paper and I think you had better accept

the Parliamentary Secretary's invitation to write  to

him than embark on a speech at this time.

<div align="center"><b>STAMP OFFICE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Measures to speed up work)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Finance

what  measures have been taken or are being taken  to

speed  up  the work at the Stamp Office in  order  to

cope  with  the increased pressure on that Department

as  a  direct result of the recent amendment  to  the

Stamp Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, the recent amendments to the Stamp

Ordinance  only  alter  the  rates  of  stamp  duties

payable  on  documents. These amendments  should  not

increase  the workload on the Stamp Office, once  the

rates  are  gotten  used to. There  is  therefore  no

permanent increased pressure on the Stamp Office as a

direct   result  of  the  amendments  to  the   Stamp

Ordinance. In December, however, there was a rush  to

stamp documents before the increased duties came into

force  in  January  1969. But that  was  a  temporary

pressure which has eased off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, hon. Members may be happy to hear that

shortly  after the coming into force of the  amending

Act,  the  Organisation  and Methods  Branch  of  the

Ministry of Finance was asked to make a study of  the

system  at the Stamp Office with a view to increasing

its efficiency and to giving the public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>



better  service. As a result of this  study,  it  has

been   decided   to  provide  three  more   Assistant

Examiners  for  the Stamp Office and to  install  two

more  franking machines. This should further  improve

the services at the Stamp Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrangements are also in hand for more documents to

be  stamped by franking machines, so that these  docu

ments  do not have to be brought to the Stamp Office,

thereby reducing the workload at the counter.

<div align="center"><b>TRADE DESCRIPTIONS ACT, 1968, OF UNITED KINGDOM</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Introduction of similar legislation in Singapore)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Selvadurai -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr P. Selvadurai</b> asked the Minister for Finance

if  he  will consider introducing legislation similar

to  the  Trade Descriptions Act, 1968, of the  United

Kingdom.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government has made a study  of

the  United Kingdom Trade Descriptions Act. 1968, and

feels there is no immediate need to introduce similar

legislation in Singapore. General principles embodied

in   the  United  Kingdom  Act,  particularly   those

provisions     prohibiting     misdescription      or

counterfeiting of goods, are already covered  by  the

following Singapore Ordinances:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Trade Marks Ordinance;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Merchandise Marks Ordinance; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Sale of Food and Drugs Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the new provisions are concerned, such as

false  or  misleading indications as to the price  of

goods and the power given to United Kingdom officials

to impose requirements in the description of goods in

advertisements, and the power to assign  meanings  to

certain  expressions, it is considered too  early  at

present  to decide whether to incorporate  them  into

our  law, since our existing laws are working  fairly

efficiently and are adequate to deal with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>



the  situation. The Government would therefore prefer

to  wait and see how the new legislation works out in

the United Kingdom so that if we eventually decide to

incorporate the new provisions into our own  law,  we

would have the benefit of their experience.

<div align="center"><b>IRON AND STEEL MILL</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b> asked the Minister for Finance

if  he will encourage the setting up of another  iron

and steel mill in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the answer is "No".

There is no advantage to Singapore in a proliferation

of  steel  mills. It will not increase employment  or

output.  It will mean the sharing of a fixed domestic

market by more producers, and will probably result in

excess  capacity.  Most  of our  steel  products  are

produced  by National Iron and Steel Mills  Ltd.,  in

which  Government has a significant  equity  holding.

Prices  of  products as well as prices of  scrap  are

controlled  by  Government, to ensure that  customers

and  scrap dealers have a fair deal. More than 30 per

cent  of  the  output is exported  and  most  of  the

profits  of  the  Company  are  not  distributed   to

shareholders  but are ploughed back to  the  industry

for  further expansion, so as to create more jobs for

Singapore citizens.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, in my view, one iron and

steel mill is not good enough, because our country is

in  the  process  of development, and consumption  of

iron  and  steel  is very high. For this  reason,  we

should have a quota system. We should have a few iron

and  steel  mills in Singapore. I have  heard  people

saying that -



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Mr Lee, you heard what I told

Mr Govindasamy just now. I cannot allow a speech  at

this stage. Do you have a supplementary question?

plaints of the non-receipt of renewal forms by  radio

and   television  licence-holders;  and  if  he  will

instruct those officers not to institute prosecutions

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, the non-receipt of renewal forms by

radio  and  television licence-holders  has  been  in

vestigated.  Over  17,000 licences are  renewed  each

month,  and  the number of reports of non-receipt  of

renewal forms is about 200 or 3 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, the non-receipt of renewal forms is

through  the failure of the licensees to  inform  the

Department  of  their change of address.  Failure  to

notify change of address is in itself an offence  but

so far no one has been prosecuted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a licence-holder gives reasonable grounds for

failure  to  renew  his licence,  no  prosecution  is

instituted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A licence may be renewed one month before the valid

licence expires.

<div align="center"><b>(Replacement of old quarters by multi-storey flats)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b> asked the Minister for Finance

if  he  is  aware that some Government quarters,  for

example,  those  in  the Haig Road  and  Farrer  Park

areas,  are old and are rented out to civil  servants

at  uneconomic rents, and if he will consider pulling

down  such  quarters and erecting multi-storey  flats

instead, so that more families of civil servants  can

be accommodated and more rents collected.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the provision

of quarters for civil servants is a colonial practice

which  we  have  inherited and have  been  unable  to

terminate  because  this  involves  a  reduction   of

perquisites  enjoyed by occupiers of these  quarters.

It  seems to be an enshrined principle that no  civil

servant  shall  have his conditions of  service  made

worse off in any circumstances, though I cannot  find

any  authority  either in law or in the  Constitution

for  this principle. Governments of modern states  do

not  provide  quarters  at low  rents  to  government

employees  except in special cases, such as  military

camps,  lighthouses and so on. We should move  slowly

towards  this  position and are, in fact,  doing  so.

When  occupiers of quarters retire, or resign or  are

dismissed, it is the intention not to rent out  these

quarters to other employees but rent them out to  the

public  at  economic rents. Civil servants should  be

encouraged to own their own houses, and more and more

of  them  are in fact doing so. I agree that some  of

the  more  ancient quarters could with  advantage  be

pulled  down  to make way for high-rise flats.  Their

occupants  can be moved to comfortable Housing  Board

flats.  This  is true not only for quarters  in  Haig

Road and Farrer Park but also elsewhere.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister for Finance says that the

provision  of  quarters  to  civil  servants  by  the

colonial  Government  was a bad  practice.  Will  the

Minister  agree with me that the P.A.P., a  socialist

Government, should adopt a good practice?

the following scale:-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 1 per cent of investment between $100,000 and $500,000;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) 3 per cent of investment between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) 5 per cent of investment between $5,000,000 and above;



<br><br>and if he will introduce the necessary legislation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I see no merit whatsoever in

the hon. Member's proposal. At the present moment, we

want  to  increase the rate of investment  so  as  to

increase  our economic growth. With economic  growth,

tax yields increase, thereby producing the additional

money  for defence. The hon. Member wants to penalise

citizens who invest in Singapore. Incidentally,  does

he propose to exempt foreign investors from this tax?

lf  not, why not? He should not be surprised, in  the

event the P.A.P. Government were mad enough to accept

his  proposal, that the Government ends up with  less

total  revenue instead of more. It may be  comforting

to  the  hon. Member to know that his ideas  are  not

really  unique  and several developing countries  had

been  pursuing policies of this kind.  The  rich  and

successful are targets of envy, more especially so if

they belong to an ethnic minority. Action is taken to

deprive them of their wealth, or that part of it  the

Government can lay their hands on. The end result  is

not  progress  and  better living standards  for  the

masses, but economic ruin and increasing poverty  for

everyone.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the Minister for Finance says that my

proposal  has  no merit. I think he is mistaken.  The

advantage of my proposal is that we would be able  to

buy  aeroplanes. Right now the money in the  National

Defence  Fund  is  not sufficient  to  buy  even  one

aeroplane. What can we do? Of course, we have to  aim

at the rich.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance also says that investors

would  be  discouraged from investing  in  Singapore.

Actually  I  am aiming at Singapore citizens.  On  an

investment of $100,000, they should be taxed  $1,000.

On $1 million, they should be taxed $30,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee, I take it that your

supplementary  question  is,  has  the  Minister  for

that will be raised by this device?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): What I want is to

reply to him.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Standing Orders do not permit you to

reply. Please frame a supplementary question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, my

point is this. We need to build up our

national defence. To achieve this, we need to aim  at

the rich. We should not aim at the poor by increasing

the  tax  on P.U.B. bills. This is making the  burden

heavier on the poor. What we should do is to  aim  at

the rich.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, these matters have been

dealt with by me at great length and in

great  detail in my Budget speech. May I  invite  the

hon.  Member to make some research in this direction?

If  he  does, I am sure he will not find grounds  for

saying  that  we are taxing the poor. It has  already

been  made  clear in my Budget speech that  exemption

limits  have been imposed whereby the poorest  people

are  exempt  from paying a tax on P.U.B, bills.  More

than  half of the customers of the P.U.B, do not  pay

such  additional  tax. I do not  know  why  the  hon.

Sosialis have been saying in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Teck Him -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Teck Him</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

1966  to  1968, and what is the percentage  of  these

<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui) (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  British Armed  Forces  commenced

their retrenchment exercise sometime in mid 1967, and

during  that  year  declared 479  civilian  employees

redundant.  In  1968, 4,340 civilian  employees  were

declared redundant, of whom 3.293 ex-employees of the

British  Navy  were employed by the  Government-owned

Sembawang Shipyard as from 1st December, 1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the private sector the number of workers

as follows:

were retrenched.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1967 there were 13 firms involved and 322 workers

<br><br><!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee</b> asked the Minister for

Foreign  Affairs and Minister for Labour whether  the

Government proposes to provide a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>



retraining  scheme  for  retrenched  workers  in  the

private  sector similar to that offered to retrenched

workers of the British military establishments.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Labour):</b> Sir, the magnitude

of  the  redundancy  problem  affecting  some  30,000

civilian  employees in the British Armed  Forces  has

made  it  imperative to organise a retraining  scheme

for   these  workers  to  fit  them  for  alternative

employment. This does not necessarily mean  that  all

employees  declared redundant can be  retrained.  The

limited   resources   of  the   Technical   Education

Department are at the moment fully taken up  in  this

task.  It  must  be  pointed out  that  the  cost  of

training  is high and, therefore, it is the intention

of  the Government to recover the training cost  from

the British Government under the special aid scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government does not propose to provide a

retraining  scheme  for  retrenched  workers  in  the

private  sector because the number involved  is  very

small.  Further, a retraining scheme  for  retrenched

workers  in  the private sector would  call  for  the

provision of substantial funds. This being so, it may

well  be  necessary for training costs to be paid  by

the   workers   themselves.  The  hon.  Member   will

appreciate that, taking the circumstances as a whole,

there  is no urgent need for a retraining scheme  for

retrenched  workers  in  the private  sector  at  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Eric Cheong Yuen Chee</b> asked the Minister for

estimated  cost for organising the retraining  scheme

for   retrenched  workers  of  the  British  military

establishments; and what will be the  estimated  cost

for   providing  similar  facilities  to   retrenched

workers in the private sector.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui (for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Labour):</b> Sir, based on the

experience



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>



of  the  first course organised for  ietrenched

base  workers,  the  total  cost  of  retraining  561

workers  would  be  in the region of  $57,000,  which

would include instruction fees, cost of materials and

overhead.  On  this  basis,  the  estimated  cost  of

training  each  worker for a period of  three  months

would be about $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a retraining scheme were organised for retrenched

workers  in  the  private  sector,  the  cost   would

probably  be  no  different.  Indeed,  costs  can  be

influenced  by the type of training to be given.  For

example,  if electric welding were to be taught,  the

cost  of  materials  and electricity  would  be  much

higher. The hon. Member will appreciate that  in  the

light  of  the  answers I have  given  to  his  other

questions,  there  appears to be no justification  at

the moment to incur such costs.

question  of  costs involved. We will still  have  to

look for space and instructors, and there are so many

scheme, I shall be very glad to have some idea of  it

on  paper.  We  can  then  give  the  matter  serious

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Education  how many bursaries the Government  intends

to offer in 1969 to students in the University



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 848</b></font><br><br>



of  Singapore, the Nanyang University, the  Singapore

Polytechnic and the Ngee Ann College; and  the  basis

on which the bursaries will be awarded.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (for the Minister for Education)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the award of

bursaries   and  scholarships  for  post-   secondary

educational institutions is the responsibility of the

Public  Service  Commission. The Secretariat  of  the

Commission has informed me that the sum of $1,499,370

is available for the award of scholarships, bursaries

and  interest-free study loans to students  in  post-secondary  educational institutions for  the  current

financial year, which runs from January 1969 to March

1970. Worked on a proportionate basis the amount  for

this  year  is  $1,199,500. The Member for  Sembawang

might like to know that last year a sum of $1,176,000

was made available for similar awards. The number  of

awards  for  this year will depend on  the  budgetted

provision as well as on the number of applicants  who

have    good   records   in   academic    work    and

extracurricular activities and who deserve  financial

assistance. The Member for Sembawang will  appreciate

that the actual number of awards to be made will only

be   known   later   after  all  the   post-secondary

educational  institutions have admitted students  for

the 1968/69 session.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the basis of award of scholarships,

bursaries   and  study  loans,  the  Public   Service

Commission tells me this will vary with each type  of

award.    President's    scholarships    and    Merit

scholarships  are  awarded on the basis  of  academic

excellence   in   the   Higher   School   Certificate

Examination   and  on  outstanding   performance   in

extracurricular  activities.  Merit   bursaries   are

awarded  on the basis of merit alone irrespective  of

financial  circumstances. On the other hand,  special

bursaries  for  Malays are awarded on  the  basis  of

financial  need. Finally, interest-free  study  loans

are  awarded  to  students who are unable  to  get  a

scholarship or a bursary.

<div align="center"><b>(Loss of service weapons)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the Minister for

Defence (a) how many Police officers have lost  their

service  weapons from 1st January, 1968,  up  to  the

latest  convenient  date  in  1969,  and  under  what

circumstances the weapons were lost; (b) how many  of

the  lost  weapons have been recovered; and (c)  what

disciplinary  action  has been  taken  against  those

officers  who  negligently or carelessly  lost  their

weapons.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Defence (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, from the 1st of January, 1968,  to  the

16th  January, 1969, three police officers lost their

service  weapons.  The  weapons  were  lost  in   the

following circumstances:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 5th February, 1968, at about 11 p.m. Detective

police  constable  No.  6603,  D.  Munisamy  of   "D"

Division, attempted to make an arrest at the Lee Kong

Open  Air Cinema in Bukit Timah Road. He was set upon

by  a gang of five persons. He drew his revolver  and

shot  at  his  attackers but he was  overpowered  and

stabbed to death. His revolver was taken away but was

later  recovered in a letter box at the  junction  of

Peirce  and  Holland  Roads. Two  persons  have  been

charged  and  convicted for the murder  of  Detective

Munisamy and have been sentenced to death.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 9th December. 1968, at about 8.30 p.m.,

Probationary  Inspector Lim Ah Ho  was  with  a  lady

friend at the King George V Park. He kept his service

revolver  in  his  friend's  handbag.  Later  in  the

evening when he proceeded to leave, his revolver  was

missing  from  her  handbag. This gun  has  not  been

recovered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 3rd January, 1969, at about 9.50 a.m., some 90

to  100  quarry  workers who were on  strike  at  the

P.W.D. Quarry in Jalan Gali Batu, together with their

supporters, attacked 20 riot unit personnel  on  duty

at  the  site  with  granite and bricks.  During  the

rioting, Corporal 3852, Mohamed Yunis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 850</b></font><br><br>



Shah,  was  surrounded and attacked and his  revolver

snatched  away  from  him.  The  revolver  was  later

discovered hidden on a site near the quarry at  Jalan

Gali Batu and has been recovered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, disciplinary action is being taken against Probationary Inspector Lim Ah Ho for negligently losing his weapon. With regard to Corporal 3852, Mohamed Yunis Shah, no disciplinary action is contemplated as there is no evidence of neglect on his part. And the question does not arise

in  the  case of Detective Munisamy who died  in  the

line of duty.

interrogated in investigations following  the  arrest

and  detention  of  certain  persons  for  activities

connected with illegal Chap Ji Kee operators, and the

number  of  such  officers; and if  he  will  make  a

statement on the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, following the

arrest and detention of 14 men under

the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance for

activities  connected  with  illegal  Chap   Ji   Kee

operations,  certain information came to light  which

merited   further  investigation   by   the   Corrupt

Practices  Investigation Bureau.  In  consequence  of

this  five  police officers and two detectives  were

questioned  by the Director of the Corrupt  Practices

Investigation  Bureau. Action will be  taken  against

anyone,  no matter whether he is a police officer  or

not,   if   evidence  is  adduced  against   him   of

<div align="center"><b>TRAFFIC OFFENCES BY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>MILITARY VEHICLE DRIVERS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. <b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> asked the Minister for Defence

(a)  what  is  the  total number of traffic  offences

committed by drivers of Singapore military



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 851</b></font><br><br>



vehicles  during  the  period  1st  January  to  3lst

December,  1968; (b) whether disciplinary  action  is

taken  against  the  drivers in each  case;  and  (c)

whether  it  has  been impressed upon  military  personnel  that  they should at all times  endeavour  to

maintain a high standard of road courtesy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the total number

of  traffic  offences of every description  involving

drivers of Singapore military vehicles and members of

the  public  during the period 1st  January  to  31st

December,  1968,  is  444.  All  accidents  involving

Singapore  Armed Forces' drivers and members  of  the

public  are investigated by the civil traffic police,

and  action  is  taken  appropriate  to  the  offence

committed  in  exactly the same way as  for  offences

committed by civilians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the total number of Singapore Armed Forces'

drivers involved in accidents, 49 had their cases com

pounded and were subjected to disciplinary action. In

52  cases,  the  accidents are being investigated  or

action  is  pending.  In  two instances,  action  was

brought  against members of the public. Three hundred

and forty-one of the reported cases were investigated

and no further action was taken. These cases were  of

a  very  minor nature. There were two fatal accidents

and in 13 others, injuries were sustained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all drivers of military vehicles found guilty of negligence or reckless driving have to face the consequences of any action brought against them by the traffic police and, in addition, under military regulations, they have to pay a fine where damage is caused to the vehicle under their

charge.  Where they are found guilty of inconsiderate

or  disrespectful  conduct  towards  members  of  the

public, disciplinary action is taken against them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Singapore Armed Forces' drivers are, of course,

instructed in the Highway Code and the S.A.F. Code of

Conduct, and it is impressed upon them that they must

be courteous and considerate to members of the public

at all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 852</b></font><br><br>



times.  Depending  on the type of  vehicle  they  are

assigned to drive, all Singapore Armed Forces'

drivers are given special training in the handling of

that particular vehicle.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

will the Minister consider limiting the speed of some

of the heavy trucks to, say, 20 miles per hour?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, there is a limitation to the

speed  of  these  trucks. I do not, at  this  moment,

recall whether it is 20 miles an hour or 30 miles  an

hour, but there is definitely a limitation in keeping

with  the  limitation of speed  of  other  trucks  of

similar size.

<div align="center"><b>PEOPLE'S DEFENCE FORCE</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Absence from training by private sector volunteers)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Inche Rahmat Bin Kenap</b> asked the Minister for

Defence  if  he is aware that some employees  in  the

private  sector who were volunteers in  the  People's

Defence Force were sometimes late for, or even absent

from,  training  because their  employers  would  not

grant them time off from work to attend training  and

because  of  their frequent absences  were  dismissed

from the Force though they were very keen to continue

in the Force; and what steps he has taken or proposes

to take in the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it would not be

feasible   to  compel  employers  to  release   their

employees  to  participate in  activities  which  the

employees themselves engage in voluntarily. There is,

therefore, no provision in the People's Defence Force

Act, 1965, to require employers to release volunteers

for training. It is expected, however, that employers

will  have  a  sense of obligation and  duty  to  the

country and will assist and encourage their employees

to volunteer in the People's Defence Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Defence Force has an operational role

to  play within Singapore's defence structure and, as

such, the members of the force are expected to attain

a certain level of military



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 853</b></font><br><br>



training  and preparedness. This can only be achieved

by  regular  attendance at parades  and  training.  A

volunteer who fails to appear at parades or to attend

training exercises will not be able to keep  up  with

his military knowledge and will be a liability to the

force.  He will therefore not be allowed to carry  on

and his place will be taken by someone who can fulfil

his military tasks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government is most appreciative of the sacrifices that our citizens make in volunteering for service in the P.D.F, and, for this reason, encourages both employers and employees to participate directly in the efforts of the People's Defence Force to train our citizens to

defend the Republic.

<div align="center"><b>ALLOWANCES TO CANCER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>PATIENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Social

Affairs whether he will consider introducing a scheme

for allowances to cancer patients, similar to the

T.B. Treatment Allowances Scheme, in view of the

increasing number of cancer patients.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng) (for the Minister for Social Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the purpose,

of  the  special  financial scheme  for  tuberculosis

patients  is  to  support  such  patients  and  their

families during their period of treatment while  they

have  to  remain inactive so that they can be quickly

cured  and  return to normal life. As a  patient  who

suffers  from pulmonary tuberculosis is  generally  a

danger  to the family and the community, the  special

financial  scheme  is therefore primarily  a  measure

taken  for  the protection of the public  health.  In

this respect, a cancer patient does not fall into the

same category as one suffering from tuberculosis.  It

is   for   this  reason  that  no  special  financial

provisions have been made for cancer patients, as  to

render  them  such assistance will make it  necessary

for persons affected with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 854</b></font><br><br>



other diseases to be similarly eligible for financial

assistance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For needy cancer patients, however, financial

assistance  is  provided under the public  assistance

scheme  and  through  the  Almoners'  Welfare   Fund,

besides  a  waiver  of medical charges  if  they  are

treated  in  the  hospitals.  In  addition   to   the

financial  assistance provided by the Social  Welfare

Department through the Almoners' Welfare Fund and the

public   assistance  scheme,  the  Singapore   Cancer

Society, which was set up in 1965, has also set aside

sums of money to help needy cancer sufferers resident

in Singapore.

following areas:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the junction of Serangoon and Beatty Roads;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the junction of Serangoon and Towner Roads;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the junction of Kreta Ayer Road and Neil Road;

be  built at Kandang Kerbau, near the market, I would

suggest  that  he  makes  a  representation  to  this

<div align="center"><b>(Revision of house plan No. 2A)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24. <b>Mr Ang Nam Piau</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National Development whether he is aware that persons

intending to use the standard type house plan No.  2A

of  the  Chief Building Surveyor's Department usually

make  certain alterations to the plan before adopting

it;  and  if steps will be taken to make available  a

revised   plan   2A  incorporating  the   alterations

generally made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the standard type

house  plan  No. 2A of the Chief Building  Surveyor's

Department  is  meant to serve as a  guide  to  those

intending  to  build a simple house  and  who  cannot

afford  to  employ an architect to design his  house.

Minor  alterations  to  the standard  type  plan  are

permissible  if  such  alterations  are  within   the

provisions  of  the building regulations,  and  often

applicants do make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 856</b></font><br><br>



such alterations to suit their individual tastes. But

to  revise this standard type plan to incorporate all

the  alterations  generally  made  will  not  prevent

further  requests for alterations  to  the  plan,  as

individual requirements and tastes differ widely.  It

is  far  better, therefore, to allow a certain degree

of  flexibility  in the design of  a  house  plan  by

retaining  the standard plan as a guide and  allowing

alterations  than  to have a plan  that  attempts  to

represent all requirements and individual tastes  and

that allows for no changes.

<div align="center"><b>REFUSE DISPOSAL PLANTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. <b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng</b> asked the Minister for Health

how  many refuse disposal plants are operated by  his

Ministry,  and whether there are any plans  to  erect

more of such plants.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  refuse  disposal  at  the  moment  in

Singapore is by dumping of the collected refuse  into

swamplands  under  controlled conditions.  There  are

three  such  refuse  dumping grounds  on  the  island

located  at the 7 ms. Tampines Road, in Koh  Sek  Lim

Road,  and  at  the end of Choa Chu  Kang  Road.  The

Public  Health  Division collects and transports  all

refuse  to  these sites for disposal every day,  with

about  85 per cent of all refuse disposed of in  this

manner  being  dumped at the Tampines refuse  dumping

ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are accordingly no mechanical refuse disposal

plants  being operated by this Ministry. However,  in

view  of  the  shortage of land for industrialisation

and  for  development into commercial and residential

complexes, dumping  of  refuse   into   swamplands,

although  a less expensive method of refuse disposal,

is considered no more appropriate as the swampland so

reclaimed  is  unsuitable for housing  or  industrial

development. Such method of dumping is also not  very

satisfactory  from the health point  of  view  as  it

gives  rise  to stench and some fly breeding  in  the

dumping area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, this Ministry has considered the

suitability of using other methods of refuse disposal

such as composting, incineration, controlled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 857</b></font><br><br>



tipping  and the more recent technique of  compacting

refuse  into  high  density  bales  and  using  these

compacted refuse bales for land reclamation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of compacted bales of refuse for land

reclamation  work has been successfully exploited  in

Japan  and appears to be an economical way of  refuse

disposal  which  may  be adopted  with  advantage  in

Singapore,  especially when used in conjunction  with

land  reclamation schemes, for light or single storey

structures for industrial or residential purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Ministry is, in addition, actively considering

the  feasibility of building an incinerator not  only

for disposal of part of the daily refuse tonnage, but

also  to facilitate the proper disposal of carcasses,

condemned  foodstuffs, security documents, and  other

material   that  require  incineration   for   proper

disposal.

population  and  the increasing number  of  accidents

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there is an

agreed  division of function between  the  Government

Hospital Ambulance Service and that provided  by  the

Fire  Brigade. The Fire Brigade provides an  accident

ambulance service while the hospitals provide for all

other medical emergencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Fire Brigade Ambulance Service is centred

at its main centre at Hill Street, it has sub-centres

in  other areas of the island. For the present, there

are  no  plans  to  set up a new  accident  ambulance

centre  at  Jurong Town. But this will be  considered

should  the  calls for an accident ambulance  service

increase to justify it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hospital ambulance service is a decentralised

one.  Each  hospital  has  its  own  small  fleet  of

ambulances.  There are no hospital ambulance  centres

outside the hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members will recall that the Bill was referred

to  a  Select Committee on 1st August, 1968.  Members

will  also  recall that during the Second Reading  of

the Bill I stated that though the Singapore Advocates

its   suggestions   and  recommendations   had   been

incorporated in the Bill, it was the intention of the

Government to refer the Bill to a Select Committee so

as  to  provide  opportunities  to  other  interested

bodies  and  members of the public to  present  their

views  on  the  Bill  which is a useful  measure  for

coping

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr

Speaker.  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is designated to reform and hiberalise

the law of abortion in Singaport so that treatment to

terminate  pregnancy may be carried out,  subject  to

certain    safeguards,    by    registered    medical

practitioners   acting  on  the  authority   of   the

Termination  of  Pregnancy  Authorisation  Board   on

medical, social, humanitarian and eugenic grounds, or

by  any  registered  medical practitioner  acting  in

consultation   with   another   registered    medical

practitioner  on extended medical grounds,  or  by  a

registered  medical  practitioner  as  an   emergency

treatment  to  save  the life  or  to  prevent  grave

permanent injury to the physical or mental health  of

the pregnant woman.



This is in summary what the Bill proposes to do.  But

what  are its objectives? A full explanation  of  its

underlying  purposes will be given  when  I  come  to

elaborate on its provisions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 861</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me give a reason why it is necessary to

reform and liberalise our laws on abortion. Our  laws

on  abortion are based on the old Indian  Penal  Code

which in turn was derived from English law, Even  the

English  have liberalised their laws on  abortion  by

the  passage  o' the United Kingdom Abortion  Act  of

1967 which became operative on 27th April, 1968.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present law on abortion in Singapore is found

in our Penal Code. The relevant sections are sections

312  to  316  and  section 511  of  the  Penal  Code.

Legally,  an abortion is the expulsion of the  foetus

from  the uterus at any time before the full term  of

pregnancy. To induce an abortion, i.e., an artificial

abortion,  is  a  statutory  crime.  The  problem  of

induced  abortion is that it is governed by  criminal

law rather than medical knowledge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law in Singapore does not specifically recognise

any interference with pregnancy on any grounds except

"in good faith for the purpose of saving the lifc  of

the  woman", it  has, however, been  interpreted  by

general  definition and by judicial  authority,  that

the  phrase  "to  save life" has the meaning  of  "to

preserve  health", and since life depends on  health,

abortions  may be performed to preserve the  physical

and  mental  health of the mother.  In  other  words,

induced  abortion  may be done  for  the  purpose  of

treatment  and these are usually termed  "therapeutic

abortions".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judicial precedent, however, forms a rather flimsy

basis  for  the performance of therapeutic abortions.

It  is said that the law cannot expect medicine to be

practised under sufferance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing law, therefore, an obstetrician

can  be  considered  to  have  infringed  it  in  the

performance of an abortion other than for the purpose

of  saving  the  life of the pregnant woman.  If  his

action  is  ever  questioned,  his  sole  defence  to

justify  his  action in performing the  operation  is

that  it  was  not only for the reason  that  it  was

necessary in his opinion, but also to prove  that  it

was done to save the life of the mother.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 862</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present law, therefore, presents serious

conflicts  to  the practitioner -between  a  duty  to

serve the patient and a duty to obey the law. Doctors

who are fearful of the possible consequences may fail

to  recommend termination of pregnancy. The result is

that an abortion which should be done for the sake of

the  mother is not done, or if done is done too  late

and when the pregnant woman's life is endangered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to correct the present legal

ambiguities  by  stating in clear terms  the  medical

conditions under which abortions can be performed; to

permit  the prompt operation which will be  performed

under the best possible conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent of the Bill is to promote the well-being

of  the  woman and to avoid impairment of her health,

in the interests of humanity and human progress.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill, therefore, seeks to codify what is now

generally   accepted  as  the  medical  reasons   for

treatment  by termination of pregnancy. In  clause  5

(2)   (a)  the  conditions  under  which  therapeutic

abortion can be done are unambiguously stated. It may

be done where the pregnancy would involve risk to the

life  of the pregnant woman or injury to her physical

or mental health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common practice where two practitioners consult

together  before termination of pregnancy is  advised

is  also recognised under clause 5 (3) which provides

for  an abortion if two practitioners in consultation

and,  acting in good faith, advise that the  abortion

is necessary on medical grounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in clause 5 (5) , a medical practitioner may

terminate  pregnancy  in an  emergency  where  it  is

immediately necessary to save the life or to  prevent

grave  permanent  injury to the  physical  or  mental

health of the pregnant mother.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions therefore permit abortions if there

is any medical reason to warrant an operation because

such  an operation will safeguard the life and health

of  the  mother.  It  does not need  any  complicated

arguments other than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 863</b></font><br><br>



common  sense  to  tell us that  such  abortions  are

justifiable  as there is no reason why  the  pregnant

woman  should be forced to go through the ordeal  and

anguish  of  pregnancy  and  child  birth  which  can

endanger  her life, or have serious repercussions  on

her physical and mental health.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to the other conditions on which the

termination  of  pregnancy may  be  authorised  under

clause  5  (2) .  Let me first deal with  the  eugenic

considerations.  There are several  conditions  which

are  known  to carry a high risk of the  birth  of  a

mentally handicapped child or the birth of a deformed

child normally termed a "monster" or the birth  of  a

"mongol".  Certain  of  these are  due  to  inherited

conditions. In others, the affliction might be due to

an  infection  of the mother in the early  stages  of

pregnancy.   German  measles  in  a  pregnant   woman

especially  in  the  very early months  of  pregnancy

carries  a  high probability that the child  will  be

born with some severe abnormalities. Certain drugs or

X-ray examinations taken in early pregnancy are  also

known  to cause such defects. The disastrous  effects

of  the thalidomide drug is well known and are  still

fresh in our memory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conditions where there is a likelihood of the

birth of a mentally or physically deformed child, few

can  deny that it would be an act of kindness or even

a  moral  obligation  to avoid the  tragedy  and  the

serious repercussions to the parents, the child,  and

society  alike  by permitting abortion.  It  is  also

fully  justified by a further reason that  it  is  an

acknowledged social evil to countenance the  breeding

of  defectives in society. This consideration may  be

described as the eugenic reason for abortion, and the

provision  is  embodied in clause 5 (2)  (c)  of  the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there will always be the few who will on

religious   and  ethical  grounds  oppose  permitting

abortion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 864</b></font><br><br>



even under these conditions. These minority groups in

their opposition will no doubt advance their familiar

arguments  which  are  highly theoretical  and  often

emotional, of divine creation and the sanctity of the

fertilised  ovum  or  the  foetus  which   is   quite

different from a living person, (concepts which  have

sprung  from  the Middle Ages and beyond).  To  enter

into  such  types  of arguments for  or  against,  to

justify  or oppose abortion is, to my mind,  entirely

futile and to ignore completely the realities of  the

modern  world and its problems. I would just like  to

invite  these  groups to visit the  Mental  Defective

Section  of  the  Woodbridge  Hospital  to  see   for

themselves the mental defectives or "mongols" whom we

have  to  care  for. Perhaps then they may  begin  to

think  in  more rational terms and start to  question

the  very purpose of the Divine creating such  mental

defectives,  the  nature of whose existence  in  this

world is just to vegetate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, where pregnancy has been caused by sexual

crimes such as rape, incest, or following intercourse

with  an insane or feeble-minded person, who  is  not

accountable for her sexual responsibility,  abortions

on  humanitarian  grounds  will  be  permitted  under

clause 5 (2) (d) of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the conditions which I have described, meaning

the  medical, eugenic and humanitarian considerations

for the termination of pregnancy, would be said to be

generally  acceptable and justifiable on the  grounds

that  the  health  and  welfare  of  the  mother   is

paramount and takes precedence over any consideration

of the unborn foetus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are a host of other conditions for

which   women   seek  termination  of   an   unwanted

pregnancy.  Common  examples are  -  when  there  are

already  too  many children in the family,  when  the

addition of yet another will mean inability to upkeep

the  family; when the pregnancy occurs too  close  to

the previous one; when the pregnancy will bring about

social  ruin  as  when  the woman  is  unmarried,  is

deserted or when she is on the threshold of a  career

or  when the woman is too young or too old; and  many

others.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 865</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the problem of an unwanted pregnancy, the

gravity  of  which  only an ostrich  is  unaware.  Of

course,  there are people who would put on a straight

collar  and  moralise and argue that she should  have

known   better   or   that  she  should   bear   full

responsibility  for  her  action.  Often  under  such

circumstances  the  predicament and  anguish  of  the

woman  is ignored. It is all very easy to pontificate

on  someone else's predicament. The Bill faces up  to

this problem and offers a solution, by providing  for

environmental or social considerations for permitting

an abortion as set out in clause 5 (2) (b) .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since in our present law there is no such provision

for the performance of abortions for environmental or

social  reasons,  the majority of  women  under  such

circumstances  are  driven to seek  relief  from  the

unwanted  pregnancy by resorting to dangerous  do-it-yourself home procedures or resort to back-street and

illegal  abortionists, usually with  tragic  results.

Does  not  the real immorality lie in the restrictive

laws which drive women to illegal abortions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal with the problem of illegal

abortions in Singapore. Whereas the number of induced

abortions  for medical reasons in the Kandang  Kerbau

Hospital is small, the number done illicitly has been

estimated at several thousands a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criminal abortions in Singapore are not known

because  obviously such figures are not available  as

they  are not reported. A study of criminal abortions

admitted into Kandang Kerbau Hospital for a six-month

period in 1964 recorded 1,230 patients. Projected for

a  year the total number of abortions would have been

2,500  in that year. This was a study made by Dr  Y.

K. Lee for an M.D, thesis which was published in

1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the total number of abortions is usually

estimated to be 10 per cent of all pregnancies,  this

would  have worked out to about 6,000 a year in Singa

pore.  Of  these, 5,000 are estimated  to  have  been

criminally induced. This gives



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 866</b></font><br><br>



an incidence of 8.3 per cent of criminal abortions to

all   pregnancies  in  Singapore.  The   figures   of

abortions  from other countries vary  but  have  been

described  as  high and constituting a  major  health

problem, "abortion being the greatest epidemic of our

times".  In  the United States it has been  estimated

that criminal abortions number one million a year, or

number  in  the  region of one out of  four  or  five

pregnancies (20 per cent to 25 per cent).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United Kingdom it has been variously

estimated to number from 50,000 to 250,000 per  year.

In  the  Scandinavian  countries,  the  incidence  of

criminal  abortions is reported to be between  5  per

cent and 10 per cent of all pregnancies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numbers of women submitting themselves to

criminal  abortions,  therefore,  run  into   several

millions throughout the world. A figure quoted is  25

million  a  year (out of a total of 120 million  live

births a year).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost in suffering and pain to the individual

and the financial burden on the state must add up  to

something  colossal. Since the laws are  flouted  and

violated  so  frequently, it might  he  assumed  that

prosecutions would be numerous. Ironically  this  is,

however, quite the contrary. Prosecution for criminal

abortion  is  a rare occasion, and the conviction  of

one  is  even rarer still. In Singapore in  the  last

five  years, there were three prosecutions  and  only

one  conviction;  and it was not  a  doctor  who  was

convicted. It is often forgotten that no law  can  be

effective unless it has the general approval  of  the

people.  The  widespread incidence of  criminal  abor

tions  suggests not only that the law is  ineffective

but  also that abortion is generally approved by  the

community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In countries which have recognised the demand for

abortions for social reasons and have legalised them,

the   abortions  performed  for  these  reasons  form

approximately  70  to 95 per cent  of  all  abortions

done.  Thus the problem to be faced up is  the  large

numbers  of  women who for one reason  or  other  are

prepared to flout the laws and covertly seek out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 867</b></font><br><br>



the   back-street  abortionist.  The  result  is  the

terrible  cost to health and the tragic  consequences

which  are all too well known. That is the  price  of

illegal abortions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the prohibition of abortion has a

discriminatory  effect. For the rich,  who  have  the

means,  seem  remarkably able  to  obtain  abortions.

Among  the  poor who cannot afford the high  fees  of

illegal  abortions, resort is made to  the  untrained

incompetents or the back-street abortionist, or  they

even attempt it themselves, often with fatal results.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps if I quote a number of real life examples to

illustrate the desperation of our women in  Singapore

caught with an unwanted pregnancy, and the lengths to

which  they  are  prepared to go to get  rid  of  the

pregnancy,  I  will be able to drive home  my  point.

These   examples  are  collected  from  a  study   on

abortions made by Dr Y. K. Lee and published in  his

M.D, thesis  entitled The Non-Clinical A  spects  of

Induced A bortions in Singapore. They are as follows:



<br><br><b>Case A298</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27-year old Chinese housewife. Mother of three, ages

ranging from 5 years to 9 months. Husband is a sailor

who  earns $200 per month. Was admitted with a  fever

of  103�F.  Strongly denied interference. Later  when

told  that  there  was evidence of  interference  she

claimed that she only tried oral methods - pineapple,

stout  and hung hua. When shown, after the curettage.

the  products of conception with a stick in them, she

sheepishly  admitted interference, but said  that  it

was self-inserted.



<br><br><b>Case A237</b>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese widow, aged 28, whose husband had been

killed by falling logs in February 1964. Patient  was

admitted  on 20th October, 1964, for incomplete  abor

tion  which she claimed was due to a fall. Mother  of

five children, ages 8 to 1 year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When friends heard of her predicament, they

recommended a general practitioner



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 868</b></font><br><br>



who was willing to abort her for  $25.  She

was  made to lie down and some liquid was pumped into

her.  There was no pain. She was given some tablets.

She  started  to  bleed  on the  very  day.  Bleeding

persisted  and she called on, the doctor  again.  She

was given an injection, tablets and mixture, and paid

$6.  She  returned  again after a  few  days  as  the

bleeding  did  not stop as hoped. However,  it  seems

that  the  doctor took it as a big joke and told  her

not  to worry as the baby would be aborted eventually

even  if  it  took  one or two months.  She  came  to

hospital.



<br><br><b>Case A202</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27-year old Indian housewife, mother of 8 children,

ages ranging from 12 years to 7 months. Husband is  a

gardener, earns $120 per month. Pays $20 rent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paid $25 to a general practitioner for an

abortion  on 2nd October, 1964. Said 'something'  was

inserted per vaginam and there was slight pain on  in

sertion.  She was unable to give details as  she  was

lying  down  and too frightened to observe  anything.

She was given six tablets to take home. She began  to

have fever on 4th October. 1964, and was admitted  on

8th October, 1964.



<br><br><b>Case A481</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese seamstress, aged 34. Mother of 6 children,

ages  ranging  from  11  to 2  years.  Husband  is  a

carpenter  who earns $150 per month. Has  been  using

vaginal tablets for contraception since the birth  of

the youngest child.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paid a Malay woman $10 to abort her baby on 21st

December,  1964. This woman called at her  house  and

brought  along with her a thin rubber piece  about  a

foot  in  length. This was inserted  per  vagina  and

patient  was  told to take it out only when  bleeding

became  excessive. She was advised not to give  infor

mation  to her friends or relatives. Patient  did  as

she was told.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was admitted to hospital on 22nd December, 1964,

with a temperature of 105�F.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 869</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><b>Case A122</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33-year old Chinese housewife. Roman Catholic.

Mother  of 6 children, ages from 12 years to 4 years.

Had  a previous abortion before this present one last

year. Was admitted with a fever of 103�F. Refused  to

change  her  story - which was this - she bought  some

pills from a Chinese medicine shop but does not  know

what  they  are called. Said she took the same  pills

for her previous abortion and they worked wonderfully

she  had a complete abortion and she did not come  to

hospital, in addition to the pills she took  5  whole

pineapples  and  3 bottles of beer.  When  the  inter

viewer suggested to her that this would not cause her

high  fever,  she  reluctantly  said  that  she   had

inserted  a  finger into her womb and  dislodged  the

foetus!



<br><br><b>Case A345</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 29-year old Malay housewife. Mother of 8

children,  ages ranging from 14 years to  11  months.

Husband is a pensioner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient was reluctant to divulge who the

abortionist was or where she practised and told  this

story  -  A  Malay woman hawker came to the patient's

home to sell mats. She saw the patient surrounded and

harried  by  many children, and enquired if  she  was

pregnant  and if so whether she wanted to be relieved

of  her  burden. Said that she did this as  a  social

service and not for gain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She massaged the patient's abdomen and squeezed the

uterus  at the same time inserting a finger into  the

vagina. She felt some pain and started to bleed.  She

paid  the woman a token sum of $5. Bleeding increased

and she began to bleed profusely and was admitted. On

admission she had a temperature of 101�F. and a foul

discharge   and  there  was  evidence   of   forcible

dilatation of the cervix.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A description of do-it-yourself and back-street

abortion is contained in Dr Lee's publication  which

is as follows:



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 870</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'All sorts of substances have been inserted, e.g.,

bamboo leaves, bamboo slivers soaked in alcohol, hair

pins,  catheters, lidi (veins of palm  leaf),  roots,

stems   of  leaves,  e.g.,  sireh,  grasses,  fruits,

vegetables,  e.g.,  brinjals, rumput  rendang,  three

stems of daun dedap tied together, sticks wrapped  in

cotton   wool  sometimes  soaked  in  oil   or   some

antiseptic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malays practise a form of local interference

known   as   urut  (massage).  Here  the  uterus   is

vigorously massaged in order to dislodge the  foetus.

The  practitioners of this are quite  efficient.  The

uterus is kneaded if possible, and massaged with  the

thumbs downwards and towards the vagina. Bruises  can

be  seen  on the abdomen of patients. Thereafter,  if

necessary,  a hard object, e.g., a stone, is  pressed

against  the  uterus and bound down  tightly  to  the

abdomen  or  wedged into the pelvis.  Sometimes  this

technique  is  combined with insertion of  a  foreign

body in the cervix.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have many more such examples, but because of the time factor, I think the examples that I have given will suffice at the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such examples of human anguish, suffering and tragedy perhaps may anger some at the unenlightened

laws on abortions that we have here. But they do also

serve  to  put the arguments advanced on  ethical  or

religious  grounds of opposing abortion  under  these

circumstances in their proper perspective,  that  is,

these  opposing  arguments are in  comparison  rather

petty and highly theoretical and academic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to popular belief, we can see from the

examples  that the majority of the women  who  sought

illegal  abortions are married women who had  already

too  many children and who for socio-economic reasons

are  not able and cannot afford to face the birth  of

another  child. This category of women will certainly

come  under  the  clause which  will  allow  them  an

abortion  on  socioeconomic grounds and thereby  save

them  front the suffering and the great risk to their

lives in resorting to the back-street abortionist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to make it quite clear here that I

am  not  claiming that the Bill will completely  wipe

out  illegal abortions in Singapore. What I am saying

is  that  clause 5 (2) (b) will offer an  alternative

solution  for  a  comparatively safe  abortion  under

aseptic conditions for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 871</b></font><br><br>



woman who qualifies on socio-economic grounds and who

would otherwise in her desperation resort to the back-street  abortionist.  Needless  to  say,  this   will

certainly  reduce drastically the number  of  illegal

abortions if it does not eliminate it altogether  and

with   it  the  consequent  toll  of  mortality   and

morbidity amongst our women.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill recognises these problems and faces up to

them  squarely. Clause S (2) (b) in fact  breaks  new

ground  by permitting abortion to be done for  purely

social and economic reasons. This extends beyond  the

provisions  which appear in abortion  legislation  in

the   Scandinavian  countries,  (where  the  pregnant

woman's  environment  must be related  to  a  medical

prognosis   -   i.e.,  abortion  on  a  socio-medical

ground). The Bill, however, is comparable to  similar

provisions  to  be found in abortion  legislation  in

Czechoslovakia,  Poland and to he as  liberal  as  in

Japan.  But it has not gone as far as the legislation

on abortion of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria and Hungary

which authorise abortions on demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill recognises, however, the right of every

woman to choose when she wants a child; and the right

to  have an abortion in case of an unwanted pregnancy

on socio-economic grounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abortion for social reasons would therefore speed

the  goal of making each child a wanted child; reduce

the  army  of  neglected and rejected  children;  and

"take  the  powder  out  of shot-gun  marriages", in

Poland, for example, the illegitimacy rate fell  from

16 per 1,000 to 9 per 1,000 after the law was amended

permitting abortions for social reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abortion offered under these reasons certainly offer

a  substitute  of  a safe medical  procedure  for  an

unsafe one offered by the illegal abortionist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abortion for social reasons would also remove the

conditions  which  encourage the  flagrant  practice,

that ferment disrespect for the law.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 872</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to this stage the reasons I have advanced for

introducing the Bill have been those relating to  the

health  and welfare of the pregnant woman or that  of

her family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Important as these reasons are and which alone

would  justify  the passing of this  Bill,  the  more

fundamental  reason which should also be the  concern

of  hon.  Members of this House who are charged  with

the   overall  welfare  of  the  community,  is   the

underlying social aims or objectives of the Bill. The

reasons  so  far described pertain to the  individual

and  the other reasons relevant to the community have

not  been  described. The former is based on  medical

opinion  and  the welfare of the individual  and  the

family,  while  the latter is based on the  community

welfare.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In advancing the reasons for reforming the law,

passing  reference was made to the  important  social

reasons  affecting the community. The eugenic reasons

for  abortion, for example, would save the mother and

her  family  the tragedy of the care of  a  defective

child.  But it also saves the state from the expenses

of providing for the care of such children. For often

the   handicapped  children  are  abandoned,  or  the

families  require assistance in caring for them;  and

expensive  medical or institutional care is  required

throughout the life of the handicapped children.  But

what  is even more important is that the bringing  up

of   defectives  gradually  enlarges  the   pool   of

defectives in the population. As no civilised society

would  in  its conscience abandon such children,  the

result is that instead of breeding the best qualities

in  our  population  the quality becomes  poorer.  We

will,   in  fact,  have  reversed  nature's  process.

Instead of breeding the fittest for survival, we will

be breeding for our own decline.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, advocating the fundamental right of a woman to have an abortion if her family circumstances are not right for the birth of a child is not therefore made merely on grounds of principles, legal or otherwise. There is also the interest of the community. Underlying all this is

that every child



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 873</b></font><br><br>



born  in  our  Republic should be a wanted  child;  a

child that can be cared for, and provided for. It  is

needless  for  me  to  say that  decently  cared  and

provided children develop to their maximum potential,

make the most of the opportunities offered by society

and  in return make a successful contribution to  it.

Conversely,  it  is  mainly from  the  ranks  of  the

unwanted children, the illegitimate and broken  homes

where most of the delinquents, the criminals and  the

antisocial  elements  are  derived.  Our  society  in

Singapore  cannot  afford to breed such  people.  The

central purpose of the Bill may, therefore, be stated

thus: to assure the quality of life of children  born

in  Singapore - to ensure that the children born  are

wanted  children, being children who will be properly

cared  for  and have opportunities for education  and

the  full development of their faculties so that they

can  grow up to lead meaningful lives and be usef iii

members of our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important benefit to our society that would

result  from this Bill would be to lower the rate  of

our  population growth and help to tackle our problem

of population explosion so that our population can be

kept  in  bearable numbers where each has  reasonable

expectation of livelihood and a reasonable quality of

life.  However  let  me hasten  to  correct  any  mis

conception  that may have arisen that  this  Bill  is

intended  to  control population growth  and  replace

family  planning  by contraceptive  methods.  Let  me

state  now  categorically, as I have  stated  before,

that legalised abortion will not be a substitute  for

family  planning  but will be a vital  complement  to

provide that ultimate security for the women who does

not wish to have the unwanted child.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the countries of Eastern Europe and

Scandinavia  that  permitted  abortion  had  done  it

primarily to prevent the sad consequences of  illegal

abortions and to enable the women to decide on  their

pregnancy  - and not in order to limit the population

-  in  these countries it reduced the birth rate  con

siderably. Therefore, if in the process



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



of  the  operations of our proposed abortion law  our

population increase is reduced, this would be one  of

the incidental benefits to our community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point of the advantage of a lower rate of

population growth for Singapore need not be  laboured

as  it  is  all too evident in overcrowded Singapore.

Let  me  only state that ours is an island of limited

area  with one of the highest densities of population

in  the  world -about 8,900 persons for every  square

mile. And the population is increasing, although at a

decreasing rate, at 1.8 per cent a year. At this rate

the population which now stands at two million people

will  double  in about 39 years, i.e.,  by  about  AD

2010. Steps must, therefore, be taken now to decrease

further this rate of growth if we do not wish to face

the disastrous consequences of running out of land or

be reduced to penury.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is true that the Government's family planning campaign has achieved tremendous success. Family planning has been generally accepted by the population as evidenced by the number of women attending the Government Family Planning clinics over the last two years. Since Government entered this

field of activity, attendances have been in excess of

the  target numbers. The dramatic falling birth rates

are   due   to   the  acceptance  of  birth   control

techniques.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be some who argue that since family

planning is a success in Singapore there is therefore

no  necessity to seek the aid of legalised  abortion.

The  answer to this is quite simple. Apart  from  the

fact  that  the Bill is not intended as  a  means  of

population control, there is an additional  important

reason for the Bill. Contraceptive techniques are not

yet  completely  effective. There are  failures  even

though  instructions are followed closely in any  one

of   the   techniques  used.  It  would,   therefore.

stimulate  the  practice of contraception  if  failed

contraception   is  regarded  as  a   criterion   for

abortion.  It  would  be  logical  where  there   are

failures  in  the method used as advised or  provided

through  Family  Planning  clinics  that  pregnancies

occurring  should be allowed to be  aborted.  In  the

studies of women using



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



the intra-uterine devices immediately after birth  at

the Kandang Kerbau Hospital, it was demonstrated that

40  pregnancies have resulted out of 3,044 women; and

177   pregnancies  out  of  5,694  women.  While   in

demographic  terms this was small,  between  two  and

three  per cent of the women, the problem is  a  real

one, and a personal tragedy. These women did not want

to  be pregnant again. It is not known if they sought

termination of their pregnancy elsewhere. The concept

of   failed  contraception  as  a  criterion  for   a

permissive abortion would motivate more women to seek

family planning advice and endeavour to follow it. In

other  words, "failed contraception" is  one  of  the

reasons  for  liberalising the laws on  abortion.  It

will  not be a substitute for family planning by  con

traceptive methods but a vital complement to  provide

that  ultimate  clinical security for the  woman  who

does  not  wish to have an unwanted child.  Abortions

should  be  permitted as a logical and ultimate  step

for contraceptive failures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is that this Bill must be looked upon as a

social  Bill which must be regarded as an adjunct  to

family  planning. In this respect, it  must  be  read

together  with  the  Family Planning  and  Population

Board  Act,  1965, the Sterilization  Bill  which  is

being introduced concurrently with the Abortion  Bill

and  other  steps taken or will be taken to encourage

small  families. Often people who criticise the  Bill

ignore  the  Sterilization Bill which is also  before

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, now I would like to deal with the

arguments against liberalising and reforming our  law

on  abortion. I must say that there has been quite  a

lot of public debate and discussions going on on this

controversial subject of abortion outside this  House even

before the Bill was presented to Parliament.  At

the  same  time, there have been quite  a  number  of

loose arguments being bandied about resulting in some

misconceptions. I shall, of course,  try  to  correct

these misconceptions that have arisen.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now dispose of the opposing arguments. No

doubt  some  hon. Members who oppose this  Bill  will

advance further arguments in the course of the debate

in  this House. I shall, of course, deal with them in

my reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, opposition views fall under

three main categories:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first category is religious. Briefly the basis

of objection is that abortions destroy the life of  a

foetus.  Since the foetus is the beginning  of  human

life,  induction of abortion is equivalent to murder.

This  is a matter of view-point. Learned men, medical

or  otherwise, for centuries have not  been  able  to

agree on whether the foetus is human life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view abortion is not murder. The destruction

of  the  early conceptus differs in no essential  way

from destruction of the sperm cell or egg cell before

the  act of fertilization. No one mourns for a  sperm

killed  by  a spermatoxic contraceptive cream  or  an

ovum  permitted to die twelve hours after  ovulation,

because  the woman from whose ovary it came knew  how

to  prevent  its  survival by practising  the  rhythm

technique  of birth control. Further, few also  mourn

the death of the fertilized ovum when it is prevented

from  implantation  by  the intra-uterine  device  or

certain  contraceptive "pills"  -  for  such  is  the

action, it is surmised, by which these contraceptives

work.   Sperm   and  egg  are  living  cells   before

fertilization; otherwise, conception could not occur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An early conception is not a human being; it is a

potential  human  being. The  difference  between  an

early  embryo  and a living person  is  immense.  The

embryo  has  no  consciousness, no  life  experience.

Therefore,  equating the elimination  of  a  mass  of

developing  cells with infanticide,  euthanasia,  and

genocide  is  offensive and patently fallacious.  The

further  charge that the liberalisation  of  abortion

laws will inevitably lead to these practices is a non

sequitur  and is illogical and wickedly inflammatory.

Has   liberalisation  of  divorce  laws  led  to  the

abolition of marriage, if I may ask?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end-point when abortion is no longer

permissible, as provided by the Bill, is not governed

by  intangibles like the exact day or week  when  the

foetus  is  assumed to receive its soul or  when  its

mind  is  thought first to function,  but  by  purely

medical considerations. Rarely a 27-week foetus lives

after  a  natural  birth, and a surviving  foetus  so

small, fragile, and immature has grave likelihood  of

serious  brain  damage. Therefore, to forestall  this

possibility  a  full  3-week  leeway  is   given   in

producing an aborted foetus. Abortion up to the  24th

week,  but  not  beyond, is therefore  allowed  under

clause  6  of the Bill. From the technical view-point

of  the  operation, abortion before the 16th week  of

pregnancy  is  simple and virtually danger-free,  and

between  the  16th  and  the 24th  week  it  is  more

complicated and slightly more hazardous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The religious view-point is, of course, respected.

It  is  precisely for this reason that  persons  with

conscientious objections to performing the  operation

may  refuse  to  do so. But such persons  might  also

ponder  their responsibility. While they may  have  a

conscientious objection to perform the operation,  it

does not absolve them from advising on whether or not

an abortion is necessary as a method of treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as I have stated just now, to allow

ourselves  to be tied up with the religious arguments

for  or against abortion which in any case will never

result  in any satisfactory conclusions, even if  the

debate  goes on till the cows come home, is  entirely

futile. I am sure hon. Members of this House who  are

charged  with the welfare of the community will  look

at  this issue on a realistic and rational basis  and

judge  what is to the best interest of the community.

I would like to emphasise here that the Bill does not

force  anyone  to have, or to perform,  an  abortion.

While the woman is given a freedom of choice, and the

individual  medical practitioner the freedom  to  act

within  his conscience, is it right, may I  ask,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, in our multi-racial and multi-religious

society  for opponents to the liberalisation  of  the

laws on abortion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



to impose their moral or religious standards upon the

entire community?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the United Kingdom experience is an indication -

where  legal  abortions  have increased  several-fold

since  the  Abortion Act was passed a  year  ago  -it

proves that the public have endorsed the Act and  are

asking that it be implemented more liberally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ethical, moral and social reasons form the second

category. Based on religious premises, moral  reasons

are advocated against abortions and these reasons are

further extended to social issues. The arguments  may

be stated as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Abortion is destruction of life; allowing

abortions to be done reduces respect for the sanctity

of  life resulting in a degrading of character  which

will  lead  to a lowering of morality, licentiousness

and increased promiscuity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent variation of the argument brought up by a

medical  man  is that abortion is the destruction  of

life  and  is completely at variance with a  doctor's

fundamental  ethics.  Allowing  it  will  blunt  this

sensitivity towards the importance of saving life and

may  have  disastrous results, turning  doctors  into

dangerous persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who predict these dire consequences have very

flimsy  grounds indeed. Their conclusions must surely

be  purely  conjectural.  They  have  indeed  allowed

themselves to run away with fantasies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same arguments were raised by the opponents of

birth control. It cannot be said that these practices

have  resulted  in  licentiousness,  a  break-up   of

families  and homes. In countries which have  adopted

very  liberal  laws on family planning and  abortions

such  as  in  Japan, the East European countries  and

Scandinavia,   these  conclusions   have   not   been

justified.  There have been no essential  differences

between  human  values  and moral  judgments  between

these countries and others which have not liberalized

their  laws. There is the same sense of family  unity

and  parental  urge  towards their children.  Births,

marriages and deaths have been the same.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who take this line that legalised abortion

will  bring about degradation of human life, I  would

like  to suggest that they should themselves just  as

well  ponder the fact that by allowing a child to  be

born  into  this  world  unwanted  and  uncared  for,

condemned to a life of squalor, misery and crime,  is

this not just as surely to destroy the person or  his

personality and his family? Will this not more surely

bring about the degradation of human life?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Another moral argument is that abortions should

not  be  made  available as persons  should  be  made

responsible for their acts. Abortions are an easy way

out  from  their  responsibility  for  the  care   of

children  and  again will tend towards  moral  decay.

This  argument is also quite ludicrous. If a  similar

line  of argument is accepted, then persons suffering

from,  say,  venereal disease, should not be  treated

because  he should be made to bear the responsibility

for his foolishness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Another small argument which is just as

fallacious is that legalised abortion will  encourage

promiscuity.  If  this argument is  valid,  will  not

family  planning  by contraceptive methods  encourage

promiscuity even more? Common sense will tell us that

if  a person wants to be promiscuous - and you cannot

prevent it - the pill which is freely available  will

be  a  better  safeguard.  Is  it  not  a  fact  that

promiscuity  is  a matter that must depend  upon  the

moral   fibre   and  character  of   the   particular

individual  and  the type of society that  individual

comes  from  rather than the availability  of  contra

ceptive measures or legalised abortion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) And finally, the opponents state that the moral

principle   cannot   he  sacrificed   for   "economic

expediency"  and that the practice of  abortion  will

undermine the family planning programme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This view again is equally fallacious. In all

countries  which  have  liberalised  their  laws   on

abortion,  it  has  been shown that  the  numbers  of

abortions declined when family planning programmes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



were instituted. This was particularly  seen

in  Japan.  Often  it  is  forgotten  that  in  Japan

abortion laws were liberalised before family planning

was  generally accepted by the population. After  the

passage of the Eugenics Law in 1949, amended in 1952,

giving   even  greater  liberty,  abortions   rapidly

increased  in numbers in Japan. But after 1955,  when

family planning programmes were instituted, abortions

have  declined steadily. Another important point with

regard  to  the  experience in Japan which  is  often

overlooked is that their family planning programme is

still backward. The present laws in Japan forbid  the

use  of  the  pill  and the intra-uterine  device  in

family   planning.  This  fact  is  stated   in   the

publication  entitled  Japan's Experience  in  Family

Planning  -  Past or Present edited by M.  Muramatsu.

Therefore, Japanese women have little choice  in  the

family planning methods since the pill and the I.U.D.

are illegal. As we know from our experience of family

planning in Singapore, the majority of the women  who

have accepted family planning are on the pill and the

I.U.D.  Yet  when family planning was  introduced  in

Japan abortions have declined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the argument that legalised abortion will

undermine  family  planning is yet another  piece  of

fantasy and does not take into account the experience

of  women  who have had abortions. Few of them  would

choose  an  abortion in preference  to  contraceptive

practice.  In our Singapore society in particular  we

know  that there is always the fear of undergoing  an

operation and our women will certainly not submit  to

an  operation  unless as a last resort.  Persons  who

think  otherwise have probably no knowledge of  these

matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may repeat again, the nature of the

relationship of our family planning campaign and  the

Abortion  Bill is that family planning is  prevention

and  legalised abortion is the cure. Perhaps  another

analogy from the game of cricket might drive home the

point  -family planning is the wicket-keeper  whereas

legalised abortion is the long stop.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third category is medical objections. They say

that  induced abortion is a surgical procedure which,

like  all  surgical procedures, carries a  degree  of

risk  to  the  life and health of the woman.  Figures

quoted should be looked at with great care and with a

critical  eye. For one thing, the hazards of abortion

differ, depending on the stage of pregnancy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early stages - up to about 16 weeks of

pregnancy  - the abortion is induced by scraping  out

the  contents  of  the womb. This is a  comparatively

simple  operation which in some cases can be done  as

an  operative procedure in an Outpatient  Department.

Under   the  circumstances  the  mortality  rate   is

excessively low.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evacuation of the uterus at a slightly more

developed  stage  will require an  operation  on  the

pregnant uterus. Obviously such a procedure carries a

slightly higher risk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interesting comparison may be made of the number

of   abortions  done  in  the  countries  which  have

liberalised   their  abortion  laws   against   their

maternal mortality rates. In every country which  has

done   so,   although  the  incidence  of   abortions

increased  after its laws were enacted, the  maternal

mortality  rates decreased. This is quite  surprising

as one would expect that with the increased number of

interferences  of  pregnancies,  maternal   mortality

rates would have increased instead of decreased.  The

reason is that previously many of the deaths were due

to   the   women  subjecting  themselves  to  illegal

abortions  with all the attendant dangers. Perhaps  I

may  explain  here  that maternal  mortality  figures

include  deaths to mothers due to deliveries as  well

as during pregnancy. It might be justifiably surmised

that a result of liberalising the laws of abortion is

that women will turn to abortions legally done in the

safe,  sterile  facilities of hospitals  rather  than

resort to an illegal abortionist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, it is clear that more recent figures on

abortion mortality are coin-parable to, if not better

than,  those of maternal mortality. In Singapore,  no

death  from  abortions induced in  the  hospital  was

recorded out of 820 and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



1,376  cases  in  1967  and  1968  respectively.   In

Czechoslovakia a similar experience was recorded  for

the  same years. In Scandinavia the overall mortality

rate  for  abortion  is 0.7 to 1,000  which  compares

favourably  with maternal mortality  rates  in  other

countries.  In  comparison,  the  maternal  mortality

rates in Singapore stood at 0.32 per 1,000 in 1967.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another medical objection is that there will be

recurrent demands for abortion by the same women.  In

a series of 13 cases studied in Japan, 20 per cent of

the   women  on  whom  abortions  were  induced  were

pregnant  again within six months, and  50  per  cent

within  12  or 18 months. From Sweden it is  reported

that  38 per cent of the women whose pregnancies were

terminated had a second unwanted pregnancy within two

to  four years. In Czechoslovakia it is said that  50

per  cent of the women on whom abortions are  induced

are having a second operation and 12 per cent a third

operation within two years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are pertinent arguments. It is for these

reasons  that  a  Bill on Voluntary Sterilization  is

being introduced concurrently. Where a woman requires

repeated abortions, sterilization will be advised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reveal here that the Government has

already  decided, even before the Bill was  presented

to  Parliament,  that  in order to  prevent  repeated

abortions where a woman who presents herself  for  an

abortion  has  three children or more,  the  abortion

will  be  permitted on condition that she  agrees  to

sterilization  subsequently.  This  policy  will   be

adopted  as  standing practice by the Termination  of

Pregnancy Authorisation Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third objection to abortion is the frequent

undesirable psychic and physical reactions  following

its  legal performance. I bring this matter up to lay

a  ghost.  Three excellent studies, published  during

1966,  by  Niswander and Patterson, Pack and  Marcus,

and Baird all show that "in women who had a pregnancy

terminated, psychiatric and neurotic symptoms were no

more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



common  than  one  might  expect  in  the  population

generally." In his study, Sir Dougald Baird, who is a

distinguished  emeritus professor  of  obstetrics  in

Scotland, states: "In most unmarried women the crisis

is  resolved  by  termination of pregnancy,  and  the

benefit is immediate and very pronounced."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, these quotations are from learned journals and if Members are interested, they are in front of me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many young married women the effects of termination are equally gratifying and the benefits

to  the whole marriage situation may be very consider

able.  In  older married women who do not  want  more

children  and are strained to the breaking  point  by

the  occurrence of another pregnancy, the results  of

termination    plus   tubal   ligation    are    most

satisfactory.  There is striking improvement  in  the

woman's  physical and mental health and in the  well-being of the whole family.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the Bill offers a safe alternative to an

unwanted pregnancy where there is none now; where the

abortion  is  carried out expeditiously, cheaply  and

confidentially.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cautionary note has been injected by many

suggesting  that abortions should not be made  freely

available, that is, that abortion should not be  made

on  demand,  The  reasons for this reservation  range

from  religious,  moral to medical grounds  described

above. Whatever the reasons, may I repeat again  that

it is not the intention of the Bill to make abortions

on demand. To presume so is a misrepresentation or  a

misunderstanding of the purpose of the  Bill.  If  it

was  the  purpose to make abortions on demand,  there

would  have  been no necessity to introduce  such  an

elaborate Bill with its several conditions  and  safe

guards. All that would have been required would be to

pass  a  short  amending Bill deleting  the  relevant

sections of the Penal Code referring to illegality of

abortions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain safeguards have, however, been written into

the   Bill   which  would,  amongst   other   things,

effectively prevent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



abortions   being   procurable   on   demand.   These

safeguards are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The establishment under clause 3 of the Bill of

an  Authorisation Board known as the  Termination  of

Pregnancy  Authorisation Board. Every  abortion  will

have  to  be  authorised by the Board  unless  it  is

carried out as an emergency under clause 5 (5) or  if

two  medical  practitioners in consultation  deem  it

necessary to do so under clause 5 (3) .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board will consist of 11 members; six are

officials,  and five are appointed by  the  Minister.

Its  composition is well balanced and representative.

The  medical representation would naturally dominate,

with the three medical directors from the Ministry of

Health;  an  obstetrician and a psychiatrist.  Social

workers are represented in the person of the Director

of  Social  Welfare and a female person who  has  had

experience in social welfare work. At least one  more

female member is guaranteed and she will be nominated

by the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it will be essential that the Board is able to

fulfil  its  functions  and  to  complete  its   work

expeditiously,  provision is  made  for  it  to  form

committees which will be delegated powers to  perform

any specific function of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) It is also required - under clause 5 (4) - that

the  abortion is done in a Government hospital or  in

an  approved  institution. And under clause  9,  abor

tions approved by the Board are to be done only by  a

medical  practitioner with specialist  qualifications

or who has the necessary experience. This will ensure

that  abortions  are  done under  the  best  possible

conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Abortions will not be authorised where the

duration  of  pregnancy  has gone  beyond  a  certain

period  of  time unless such treatment is immediately

necessary to save the life or prevent grave injury to

the  physical or mental health of the pregnant woman.

This is provided in clause 6. As this time factor  is

important, it is also written into the Bill  in  sub-clause  (6)  of  clause  7 that  the  termination  of

pregnancy  must be carried out within seven  days  of

its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



authorisation. The objective of this provision is  to

minimise  the  danger  to the  health  of  the  woman

seeking  abortion  as  it  is  known  that  abortions

carried  out  late in pregnancy carries with  them  a

high mortality and morbidity rate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Consent is required of the person to have

abortion - this is provided in clause 8 - and in case

of  feeblemindedness or where the woman is unable  to

give a valid consent if she is below 18 years of age,

the  parent or guardian or, in the absence of  either

one,  the Board, after consultation with the husband,

may authorise the abortion. Consent may, however,  be

withdrawn any time before abortion is carried out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Secrecy is guaranteed for any application for

treatment for termination of pregnancy. Disclosure of

any  facts or information without the consent of  the

pregnant woman is an offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) The medical practitioner who has conscientious

objection  in  carrying  out abortions  is  protected

under clause 10 which provides that he may refuse  to

do  so  unless such treatment is to save the life  or

preserve  the  physical  or  mental  health  of   the

pregnant woman. It should be elaborated further  that

the  practitioner  has  a general  duty  towards  his

patient. Once a doctor/patient relationship has  been

created when the practitioner accepts the patient, he

must   provide  advice  as  well  as  treatment  with

reasonable care and skill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, under clause 10 (3) the medical

practitioner  has  a  duty  to  participate  in  such

treatment  in an emergency where no other  doctor  is

available and which is necessary to save the life  or

to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical and

mental health of a pregnant woman. The Singapore Medical  Association in their memorandum  have  expressed

strong  opposition to this sub-clause.  According  to

them,   their  Roman  Catholic  members   will   find

themselves accountable and this will not, as has been

envisaged by clause 10, allow them a way out  without

breaking  the  law.  But  I  cannot  really  see  any

justification to the objection to clause 10 (3) since

it,  in fact, restates our existing law in which  all

doctors have a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



legal  duty  to preserve life. This legal  duty  must

certainly over-ride all religious dogmas and beliefs.

It  is  the Roman Catholic dogma that the foetus  has

the  right to life as the born child. This assumption

can,  if  I  may  point out, lead the Roman  Catholic

doctor  into a great moral dilemma, for sometimes  he

has  to choose between destroying the foetus in order

to  save the mother's life and allowing the mother to

die  in  the hope of saving the foetus. As  has  been

well  said  and I quote: "The Catholic preference  of

doing nothing to assist the mother amounts in fact to

a  preference of the foetus over the mother  and  may

amount to a sentence of death for both."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, a member of the public who

participated  in  a recent public  forum  on  Medical

Ethics organised by the Singapore Medical Association

had stated that, by insisting on absolute freedom  to

refuse to act against conscience even in an emergency

to save the life or prevent grave permanent injury to

the pregnant woman, the Singapore Medical Association

seemed  to have overlooked the Declaration of  Geneva

where a doctor is required solemnly to pledge that he

would   not   permit  considerations   of   religion,

nationality,  race, party political  affiliations  or

social standing to intervene between his duty and his

patient.

<div align="center"><b>ABORTION BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate on Second Reading resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before we rose

I  was  on  the  safeguards of the  Bill  and  I  was

interrupted when I was expounding the dilemma of  the

Roman Catholic doctor. Sir, if I may be permitted  to

continue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The religious beliefs of the Roman Catholic as well

as those of other religious groups are respected. But

the  duty  to  save  life must surely  over-ride  all

religious  beliefs or dogmas. It is  therefore  quite

clear that clause 10 (3) should be retained.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) To prevent women residing outside Singapore from

taking advantage of the liberalisation of the laws on

abortions, the operations will be available  only  to

women  who  have  been resident in Singapore  for  at

least four months prior to the application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) Finally, the law will run for a limited

duration.  It shall continue in force for four  years

and  may be extended for a further period of not more

than one year. Parliament would, therefore, have  the

opportunity  of  reviewing  the  experience  and  the

effectiveness of the legislation and the desirability

of continuing it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essence of the liberalisation of the laws is to

provide  a  pregnant woman with an unwanted pregnancy

to procure a cheap but safe method of abortion. To do

so,  efficiency  of  procedure and  secrecy  must  be

maintained  throughout. To be  effective,  the  whole

process from application, authorisation, or rejection

must be done with despatch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless treatment to terminate a pregnancy is

permitted under sub-clauses (3) and (5) of  clause  5

of the Bill, every pregnant woman wishing to have her

pregnancy  terminated shall apply to  the  Board  for

authorisation, but, before so doing, shall submit  to

a medical examination. The woman has a free choice as

to  whichever  registered  medical  practitioner  she

wants  to  go  to  and no doubt she will  go  to  the

medical practitioner in whom she has confidence.  The

registered  medical practitioner  who  performs  this

examination   will  then  send  to  the   Board   the

application form of the pregnant woman with a medical

certificate  certifying the  reasons  which,  in  his

opinion,  justify  treatment to  terminate  pregnancy

together with such other certificates or documents as

may  be  prescribed.  The Board  may  also  call  for

further  information or arrange for  further  medical

examinations.  If the Board decides to authorise  the

abortion, it shall advise the applicant the  date  on

which  and place at which treatment is to be  carried

out  and this date will normally be within seven days

of the date on which treatment is authorised by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



Board.  The  Board shall at the same  time  send  all

relevant information on the application to the  place

where  treatment is to be carried out for the use  of

the registered medical practitioner carrying out such

treatment.  Provision is also made, where  the  Board

refuses  an  application, for the pregnant  woman  to

request the Board to reconsider its decision  in  the

light of further evidence. This is provided in clause 7 (9).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am fully aware that by introducing this Bill

making  abortions more permissive, it does  raise  as

many  issues  as it attempts to solve. Liberalisation

of  our abortion laws is not only a legal, medical or

sociological  problem. It does  touch  on  our  basic

moral and religious beliefs - and for this reason  it

has  created  an  intense interest as  well  as  some

controversy.  But these are important issues  and  we

must  face  them  courageously. The  problem  is  not

whether  the foetus is inchoate and hence  expendable

as  the  law reformers claim, or whether it is  human

and  inviolable as the opponents insist. The  central

problem is that of an unwanted pregnancy and  how  to

treat it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is simply the right of an individual to

have  a  choice to abort an unwanted pregnancy  under

specified  conditions, just as it  is  the  right  of

every human being to enjoy a meaningful life, a right

to  liberty  and  a  right of privacy.  And  for  the

medical   practitioner,  the  right  to  perform   an

abortion  without the threat of criminal proceedings,

both being free to follow their conscience and not be

imposed  by  any ethical code, religious  belief,  or

moral  standard  of others. And conversely  there  is

nothing  in  the Bill to force anyone to perform,  or

have, an abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will now liberate our women, allowing

them   to  determine  when  they  should  bear  their

children.  For  the woman, therefore, the  Bill  will

liberate  her  from the fear of unwanted pregnancies;

where the termination of an unwanted pregnancy can be

performed  under the best possible circumstances  and

in approved hospitals where the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



risks are minimum. As a corollary, it will discourage

her from resorting to the back-street abortionists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for society and the state, by ensuring that every

child  born  is  a wanted child, it will  assure  the

quality  of  life of children in Singapore.  It  will

ensure  that the children born in Singapore  will  be

properly   cared  for  and  have  opportunities   for

education and the full development of their faculties

so that they can grow up and lead meaningful lives in

our  society. The lower reproductive rate among those

who  can  least afford children will have  beneficial

effects  in  ensuring  that  the  children  of  these

members of the community would stand a better  chance

of  having a happy and meaningful life. All these can

only  result in greater good to our society and  help

to improve the quality of our next generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we in Singapore are now standing on the

cross-roads  of  history. We  are  facing  the  major

problems  of  defence and economic  development  that

must be solved if we are to survive as an independent

nation. But in order to succeed in this, we must also

solve  our  social problem which is by no means  less

important  to our continued survival and  prosperity.

As  you know, Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a  small

island  with no natural resources; but we  have  been

able  to  survive and prosper so far because  of  the

high quality of performance of our people. Therefore,

our  continued  survival and well-being  will  depend

upon  the  quality of our next generation,  which  in

turn  must  depend on the quality of the children  we

now  produce.  As a matter of fact, with  our  advent

into  the modern age, the pace and tempo of life will

be  much faster and the quality of our people to meet

the  future challenges must therefore be of a  higher

calibre.  Can  we,  therefore,  particularly  in  our

Singapore   situation,  afford   to   have   children

resulting  from unwanted pregnancies from where  most

of  the  delinquents,  the criminals  and  antisocial

elements are derived, or allow children with physical

and mental abnormalities to be born? Will not these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>







lower  the  quality  of our next generation  and,  in

fact, reverse the process of nature where the fittest

survive?  The  Bill, therefore, offers a  humane  and

rational  solution to this important social  question

facing us. It will assure the quality of our children

so that we can continue to survive and prosper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, appeal to hon. Members to face up to

the challenge on this important social issue and give

their  full support to the Bill. I do hope that  they

will not falter just because of some pressure, social

or  otherwise,  brought  to  bear  on  them  by  some

minority  groups  outside who, on  account  of  their

religious dogmas, desire to impose their will on  the

majority.  There  have been similar  minority  groups

before who, in their out-of-date beliefs, have  stood

opposed  to  the  introduction of  birth  control  in

Singapore  and  whose stand, as we  know  today,  has

found itself in the dustbins of history. In the  same

way,  I  am certain that the opposing stand  to  this

Bill  taken by this minority group will also  in  the

course of time end up in the dustbins of history.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, it must be emphasised again that the Bill

does not compel anyone who has any religious scruples

and   conscience  against  abortion  to  undergo  the

operation. In fact, the Bill makes it an offence  for

anyone  who  compels any person to have an  abortion.

The  Government has even gone further  in  respecting

the religious and ethical beliefs of hon. Members  by

withdrawing  the Whip in this debate.  On  the  other

hand,  what I would like to stress again is this:  is

it  right  in  our  multi-racial and  multi-religious

society  for  any  person or  group  of  persons,  on

grounds  of  religious dogma, to deny  others,  whose

religious and ethical beliefs do not forbid  them  to

have  an  abortion,  from  taking  advantage  of  the

provisions of this proposed law?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, criticisms of the Bill there will be,

but  after all that has been said, the case  for the

Bill on every count is indeed overwhelming.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have every confidence in the good sense of

judgment,  of  fair play and of the high humanitarian

principles  of  our hon. Members who are  always  con

scious  of  the  public good. I  am  sure  they  will

courageously   rise   to  the   occasion   and   give

overwhelming support to this historic Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this

Bill  which we are debating today is by far the  most

controversial ever to come before the House. Since it

was  first raised in the middle of 1967, the question

of  liberalised abortion has been discussed at  great

length by civic, professional and religious bodies in

Singapore.   It  has  been  the  subject   of   three

extraordinary  general  meetings  of  the   Singapore

Medical  Association;  it has  been  the  subject  of

forums  in  the  University  of  Singapore  and   the

Polytechnic; it has been much talked about  over  the

radio  and on TV; it has been the subject of articles

and letters in the press. From all the discussions no

consensus of opinion has emerged. Or perhaps it would

be  more  accurate to say that a consensus  has  been

reached  on  only two points: first,  no  responsible

body  in  Singapore  would  approve  of  abortion  on

demand,  and, secondly, scarcely anybody is satisfied

with the present Bill as it stands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my contention that the Abortion Bill now

before the House is ill-conceived and ill-timed,  and

that it should be withdrawn from the programme of the

Government.  This  Bill does  not  serve  any  useful

purpose at all and will not answer any need expressed

by  the  people.  When the then Minister  for  Health

announced  that  the  Government  was  proposing   to

introduce a Bill to liberalise abortion, was this  in

response  to any public clamour for a change  in  the

existing  law?  It  was  not.  His  announcement  was

received with dismay by many, with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 893</b></font><br><br>



surprise by all. This Bill was not something that the

people  wanted, lt was something that the  Government

thought  up  for  the  good  of  the  state;  it  was

something  on  which, in my opinion, the Government's

thinking went seriously wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far the people have shown no enthusiasm for the

Government's proposal to grant them easier facilities

for  abortion, in spite of all the comments made, and

because the people are convinced that abortion  is  a

bad  thing. They are not easily deceived by those who

tell them that liberalised abortion is an enlightened

policy.   They  are  not  confused  by  philosophical

arguments  as to when exactly human life is  present.

They  know that abortion means killing a life  which,

if  left  alone, would very soon be a baby boy  or  a

baby  girl.  And they are quite sure that  the  fewer

abortions there are the better.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if this Bill before the House today is passed,

the  one  certain  result  is  that  the  number   of

abortions performed in Singapore is going to increase

enormously.  It  has happened everywhere  else  where

they  have changed the law and I am positive it  will

happen here also. People know this, and are far  from

enthusiastic  about it. Of one thing I am  absolutely

convinced,  namely, that any change in  the  existing

law will bring more harm than good to the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to change the law. The only grounds

on  which any self-respecting doctor would wish to be

allowed to perform an abortion would be on very  rare

medical  grounds,  when the life  or  health  of  the

mother  is at stake. This is already provided for  in

our present law. By statute, the doctor is not liable

to prosecution if he operates to save the life of the

mother.  By interpretation, he will not be prosecuted

if he operates to prevent the mother from becoming "a

physical  or mental wreck". The doctor who,  in  good

faith,  operates  for this purpose, provided  he  has

followed the accepted medical practice in therapeutic

abortion, will have nothing to fear from the existing

law as actually applied.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some doctors would like to see this interpretation

written  into the statute. But I think this would  be

unwise.  This statute embodies one of the fundamental

values of our society - respect for human life,  even

the life of the unborn child - and any tampering with

this  statute will give the impression  that  we  are

changing our sense of human values. Moreover, if  the

present  stricter  wording of the law  makes  doctors

cautious in the matter of performing abortions,  this

is  as  it  should be; an abortion is  a  destructive

procedure  which should never be contemplated  except

with extreme caution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other clauses in the Bill under which

abortions  would be allowed, they are  completely  un

acceptable.   Either  they  are  reducible   to   the

preservation of the life or health of the mother - in

which  case  they are unnecessary - or  they  are  a

totally  unwarranted extension of the  one  plausible

reason for even considering permitting an abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody arguing in favour of changing our present law

has brought forward any convincing reason for change.

Many reasons indeed have been advanced. None of them,

in  my  opinion, will stand up to critical  analysis.

For instance, we have been told that our ideal should

be:

"Every  child a wanted child." Now, may I ask, either

this is meant seriously -  in which case it is  an

argument  for abortion on demand - or it is  not  - in

which   case   it  is  an  example  of  irresponsible

sloganeering.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every child a wanted child" - what is this supposed

to  mean?  That  every woman who finds  herself  unexpectedly pregnant has a legal right to have the  baby

removed? This is abortion on demand. Is this what  is

wanted?  If  it is, then why not say so,  instead  of

making us all study a long and complicated Bill  with

provisions   for   "Boards"  and   "committees"   and

"approved institutions" and the rest? But the Bill is

not  what is intended, so let us stop pretending that

a  liberalised Abortion Bill will ensure  that  every

child is a wanted child.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every child a wanted child" -often enough we have

to  deplore  the circumstances in which  a  pregnancy

occurs, but once the child has been conceived we have

an  obligation to protect it. We cannot be  deflected

from  this  duty because the intercourse  might  have

been  illegal (because of rape or incest); or because

the  woman  might  be  unmarried,  or  separated,  or

divorced;  or  because her environment might  not  be

suitable  (whatever that might mean); or because  the

baby   might   be   born   handicapped.   All   these

circumstances  might be deplorable, but  not  to  the

extent of justifying the killing of the unborn child.

To  say  otherwise  would  be  to  legislate  out  of

sentimentalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We speak of the right of the child to be a wanted

child  - and then we deprive it of the right to live.

What sort of crazy logic is this?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every child a wanted child" - this should indeed be

our  ideal;  but  not  by increasing  the  number  of

abortions.  Who can really judge whether or  not  the

child   is  wanted  until  it  is  born?  There   are

innumerable  cases reported of women who,  when  they

first  became pregnant, asked for an abortion  -  but

were  persuaded  to have the baby, and  once  it  was

born,  were  very grateful that the  doctor  had  not

given  in  to  their request. In any  case,  a  child

unwanted by its parents may well become a treasure to

some  childless couple. I quote from a paper by Prof.

Tow  Siang Hwa, Why I disapprove of legalised  socio-economic abortion:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The "unwanted child" - if there is such a term -

should surely be entrusted to the care of an adoption

society rather than to the abortionist.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would prefer to change this slogan to: "Every

child  a  protected child." Here is an aim  which  is

worthy  of  a truly liberal and enlightened  society.

The  cornerstone of a truly enlightened society  lies

in  its  protection of the right to life. In  such  a

society  the  function  of the  law  is  seen  to  be

primarily  to  protect the rights of individuals,  of

which the most fundamental is the right to life.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



The  protection which the law affords to  individuals

extends to the unborn child in its mother's womb.  In

our society the assumption underlying the law is that

the  value  of  a human life, even the  life  of  the

unborn child, is so great that its destruction  could

never   be   justified  on  the   grounds   of   mere

convenience, either to an individual or to the state.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there is wish to change all this; there is wish

to change a basic principle of our society and of our

law;  there is wish to measure the right to  life  of

the  unborn  child  according to  the  socio-economic

circumstances of its mother. On what grounds does the

Government  seek to reverse a long-held tradition  of

our  society  about the right to life of  the  unborn

child?  Is it on the grounds that this foetus is  not

human, and therefore does not enjoy the right to life

which is embodied in our law? If this is the view  of

those who wish to liberalise our abortion laws,  then

it  is  up  to  them to prove it, for the  weight  of

evidence  lies heavily against them. From innumerable

testimonies available I shall choose only three:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. From the International Code of Medical Ethics

published by the World Medical Association: 'A doctor

must always bear in mind the importance of preserving

human  life from the time of conception until death.'

[Ref. INTERCHANGE - Vol. 1, No. 4 of 1968, page 206].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. From the International Conference on Abortion

held  in Harvard in 1967: 'From the present available

data, we can only conclude that human life begins  at

conception, or no later than 'blastcyst' (i.e, eight

days  after  conception). The foetus,  therefore,  at

least  from  blastcyst,  deserves  respect  as  human

foetal  life.' [Ref. INTERCHANGE - Vol. 1, No.  4  of

1968, page 206].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. From Professor Scott, Professor of Obstetrics and

Gynaecology  at Leeds University, who, after  lengthy

research  into  this question, concluded:  'The  most

important fact that gynaecologists know, and the  one

most understandably



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



suppressed,  is  that performing an abortion  at  the

time  they are usually called upon to do so  involves

destruction  of a clearly recognisable human  being.'

[Ref. INTERCHANGE - Vol. 1, No. 4 of 1968, page 205].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point of these citations from experts - and they

could be multiplied indefinitely - is to show that it

is  a  solidly founded tradition that foetal life  is

somehow  human. Because this brings us to the central

issue at stake in this debate. That central issue  is

this:   our  present  law  on  abortion  embodies   a

traditional  social  belief about  the  humanness  of

foetal   life,   a  belief  strongly   supported   by

scientific  opinion. Any decision by  this  House  to

change  that  law  involves  society  in  a  decision

affecting life and death, not merely for the  foetus,

but ultimately for the whole of society. For what  is

at issue is the right to life. Once the law sanctions

the  invasion of that fundamental right, may  I  ask,

where then does it draw the line?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or will it be said that because the foetus is not

yet  fully  developed,  therefore  it  possesses   no

rights?  This is a dangerous principle  on  which  to

rely.  Once  we start putting the convenience  of  an

individual or of the state before respect for a human

life  that is not yet fully developed, then  we  have

set  our  feet  on the slippery path indeed.  If  one

considers  oneself  justified  in  destroying  foetal

human  life for the well-being of the mother, or  the

family, or the state, then there is every danger that

one  will  not be satisfied to stop there. I  am  not

thinking  of  this  Government.  I  am  thinking   of

whatever  government might be sitting here 10  or  20

years  from  now.  If  we  here  today  abandon   the

principle  that human life, even foetal  human  life,

must be respected, then we have opened the way for  a

future government to argue that it is justifiable  to

legislate for the destruction of deformed babies,  of

the  mentally defective, of the incurably ill, of the

old  and the sick and the economically worthless.  In

other  words, once we allow the destruction of foetal

human  life  on the grounds that it is not completely

human, then we leave the door open to others to argue



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



about what constitutes a "complete human". Compulsory

euthanasia is not unthinkable in a society  that  has

accepted voluntary abortion. Once one starts to value

human   beings  according  to  their  worth  to   the

community, then one soon begins to notice quite a few

without  whom  the  community  -  the  rest  of   the

community, that is, - might be considered better off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sort of thing of which people are always

accusing  politicians  - sacrificing  principles  for

expediency. And all for what? What problems does  the

Government  attempt  to solve by  these  drastic  and

dangerous  measures?  What  good  will  come  to  the

Republic   of  Singapore  by  pushing  through   this

controversial Bill?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is difficult to find the answer to this obvious

question,  for  those  who  favour  liberalising  our

abortion laws keep chopping and changing the  reasons

they put forward to justify this move. They tell  you

horror  stories about women suffering  disability  or

death  at the hands of illegal abortionists. When  it

is  proved to them that legalising abortion does  not

lead  to  any  decrease  in  the  number  of  illegal

abortions, they change their ground and say  that  it

is  necessary to control the population growth.  When

it  is pointed out that our rate of increase is  well

on  the  way to being controlled by less drastic  mea

sures, they change again and say that no woman should

be  obliged to bear a child which she never wanted to

have.  When it is again pointed out that  it  may  be

necessary to take into consideration the right of the

child to be born, they resort to abuse and claim that

one is talking idealistic nonsense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us try to look dispassionately at these

alleged  reasons for changing our law. First of  all,

to  get  rid  of  the  criminal  abortionist.  It  is

commonly  assumed  that it is necessary  to  legalise

abortion  if we are to reduce the number of  criminal

abortions.  May  I point out in passing  that  in  no

other  criminal  activity has it been suggested  that

ordinary  citizens,  much  less  the  members  of   a

dignified  profession,  should  take  over  from  the

criminals because they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



do  the  job  so  much better. Again, what  does  the

experience  of  other countries teach  us  about  the

relationship  between liberalising the abortion  laws

and   reducing  the  number  of  illegal   abortions?

Professor   Ingelman-Sundberg  from   Stockholm   has

reported  that  25  years of  legalised  abortion  in

Sweden have not made the slightest difference in  the

criminal  abortion rate. He found the  experience  of

Hungary  and Czechoslovakia was similar.  The  reason

for this strange fact is given in the Report:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'...the legalising of abortion alters the climate of

opinion among the public and even the Courts of  law.

The  result  is that criminal abortion  becomes  less

abhorrent. The public becomes abortion-minded.' [Ref.

5th  World  Congress of Gynaecology and Obstetrics  -

Sydney, pages 784 to 787].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in September 1967, speakers at the 5th World

Congress  of  Gynaecology and  Obstetrics  in  Sydney

testified  to  the  same  effect.  Two  doctors  from

Switzerland stated:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Contrary to many people's expectations the

legalisation of therapeutic abortion has not led to a

reduction  in  the incidence of illegal abortions  in

the countries concerned.' [Ref, ibid, page 764].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe similar conclusions have been reached

about the experience of Japan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all these cases the result of liberalising the

abortion laws has simply been that the overall number

of abortions shoots up, but there is no evidence that

the  number  of illegal abortions shows any  sign  of

decreasing. The reason is obvious: as long as the law

demands  that certain conditions be fulfilled  before

an abortion can be performed, then those women who do

not come under those conditions will continue to seek

out the illegal operator.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Is the Member for Punggol saying

that abortions should be freely available?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> In fact, there is good reason to

believe  that the effect of liberalising the abortion

laws  is to increase the number of illegal abortions,

since women become more abortion-minded.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, the only hope of getting rid of the

illegal  abortionist  is  to  make  abortion   freely

available on demand; to induce women to believe  that

having an abortion is as respectable as having a hair-cut.  Is this the attitude we wish to encourage among

our women?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the argument that a liberalised abortion

policy  is necessary foi population control, I  would

say this:



if  abortion is resorted to as a means of  population

control  when  other  family  planning  methods  have

failed,  then it will either be something rare  -  in

which case it will make no appreciable difference  to

the overall population -or it will be widespread,  in

which  case it is a very bad means of birth  control.

It  is  a  bad means because it is dangerous for  the

health  of  the  women, because it  only  solves  the

problem temporarily, and because it will put a severe

strain on the medical services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not go into details concerning the medical

dangers of abortion but shall content myself with one

quotation.   This  is  a  statement  by  Dr   Hector

MacLennan,   President  of  the  Royal   College   of

Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in Britain, made  in

the Times of 21st January, 1966:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Even if the operation is to be limited to hospital

practice  by  recognised  specialists  it  should  be

stated  most  emphatically that therapeutic  abortion

even  in  skilled  hands is more dangerous  than  the

public and many doctors appreciate.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, with a falling birthrate like that of

Singapore  - I have just received the Report  of  the

Population Board - it is absurd to say that  abortion

is  a  necessary adjunct to other methods  of  family

planning  as a means of population control.  This  is

why   so  many  overseas  visitors  to  international

conferences  here  have expressed  amazement  at  the

proposal  of  the Government to introduce liberalised

abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning now to the socio-economic argument: that a

woman  should  not be obliged to carry  on  with  her

pregnancy   if  her  environment  would  justify   an

abortion.  I have already spoken about the importance

our law should attach to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



the  protection of human life, even the life  of  the

unborn child, if competent medical authorities are of

the  opinion that the preservation of the life of the

mother  entails  killing the foetus, then  the  state

does  not  abdicate its responsibilities  to  protect

human life if it exonerates the woman and her doctors

from prosecution. But where the position involves not

only  one  life  against another  but  socio-economic

convenience against the right to life, then any truly

progressive  and  enlightened law must  be  one  that

protects  this human life. Abortion on socio-economic

grounds  is  not a liberalisation of the law,  but  a

leap into lawlessness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we perhaps to change our abortion law just

because  some  other countries have  changed  theirs?

Before  we decide to jump into the same boat, let  us

reflect on the fact that some of those countries  are

having  second  thoughts about the  wisdom  of  their

decision. London is not proud of her new title as the

"abortion-centre of Europe". Japan has for many years

been  worried  about  the  continuing  high  rate  of

abortions, in  a Japanese paper entitled  The  East,

Vol.  IV,  No.  6, November-December 1968, a  report

entitled A report of Induced Abortion, it was  stated

that  according to the investigation carried  out  by

the  Institute of Population Problems of the Ministry

of  Health and Welfare, the amendment to the  Eugenic

Protection  Law which allowed abortion on grounds  of

financial  hardship resulted in a sudden increase  in

the number of abortions. Between 1953 and 1961, there

was  art  annual  average of one  million  abortions.

Although  1962  showed some decrease, cases  in  1965

numbered   840.000.  These  were   only   the   cases

officially reported.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, an article in the Straits Times of

20th  November,  1967,  page  9,  entitled  "Abortion

Alarm. Communists take to the Pill", states that  the

governments  of  several Eastern  European  countries

have   become   alarmed  at  the  increasing   number

undergoing  legal  abortions. The  reason  for  their

alarm is that the health of young women, both



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



married  and  unmarried, is being affected  by  these

numerous abortions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, in spite of all these warnings, are we still

eager  to  rush  into a liberalised  abortion  policy

without   even  pausing  to  estimate  the   probable

effects? Let us be clear about one point: to  imagine

that we can safely pass this Bill since it can always

be repealed in four years' time is to be blind to the

realities  of life. An enlightened society like  ours

cannot liberalise its abortion policy and then,  when

the evil consequences become apparent, hope to change

the  permissive  attitude that  its  own  policy  has

engendered. This is quite unrealistic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, in the Republic of Singapore, we are

trying  to build a nation. We are striving to  instil

into  our  people a spirit of dedication, a sense  of

responsibility,  an  attitude  of  social-mindedness,

loyalty,  patriotism  and the rest.  We  are  niaking

strenuous efforts to encourage people to think beyond

their  own selfish interests, to look to the  welfare

of  their  fellows. We are aiming to  strengthen  the

character of our people by proposing high ideals,  by

calling for self-discipline. And now we are in danger

of  undoing all this by introducing a Bill to make it

easier  for women to obtain abortions, We  have  been

trying  to  inspire  our  people  to  face   up   to

challenges. Now, when we are faced with a  challenge,

we take the easy way out by legalising abortion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have tried to teach our people responsibility.

Now we encourage irresponsibility.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always been trying to build a hard society.

Now we are preparing the way for a soft society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may well be said that this Bill does not oblige

anybody  to have an abortion if she does not wish  to

do so. But we must remember that the law itself has a

certain  educational  value,  It  is  one  thing   to

introduce a new law constituting abortion a crime; it

is  a  different thing to repeal or amend a law which

has  been on the statute books a long time and  still

holds  good. In this case the impression is given  to

people that if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>



abortion is no longer as illegal as before, that must

be because it is no longer as bad as before.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in Singapore want to be looked up to as a beacon

in  Southeast Asia - not just for our economic drive,

not  just  for our skills and dynamism, but also  for

our  sense  of  justice, for  our  defence  of  human

rights,  for  our protection of the weak.  Therefore,

nobody  is in more need of that protection  than  the

unborn child in its mother's womb.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singapore is to survive and prosper, it will be

because of the physical and moral sturdiness  of  its

people,  because of the personal moral discipline  it

is  prepared  to  face challenges  with  courage  and

determination.  Encouraging easier abortions  is  not

the  way to foster such an attitude. On the contrary,

it  is the way to foster a selfish society; one which

puts  personal convenience before a sense of duty  to

others;  one which refuses to face challenges because

that  requires effort; one which ends up as  a  soft,

comfort-seeking  society - people  looking  for  more

money  for  less work, people more eager  to  receive

than to give, and people looking for the easy way out

rather than striving hard to achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Singapore needs is not an Abortion Bill, but an

increased   emphasis   on  self-respect,   on   self-discipline,  on  common human  decency.  We  need  to

ensure   that  our  young  people  receive  a  better

preparation    all-round   for   marriage,    towards

responsible parenthood and the rest. This  should  be

and must be our main objective if we are to develop a

hard  society. We need to make more strenuous efforts

to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, I would like to believe that

Parliament,  being the responsible  legislating  body

and  being  responsible for the foreseeable consequences, of  its acts, would not turn a deaf ear  to  my

arguments against the passing of this Bill, because I

am  fully  convinced that its consequences  would  be

detrimental to the future growth, health and  welfare

of our young Republic.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singapore - Instant Asia". It is a very nice

caption and well projected. I fear that if this  Bill

is  passed,  another name "Paradise of  Abortionists"

may  be  added to it. Surely this is not the sort  of

reputation  we want to get. Surely this  is  not  the

sort of image of ourselves we want to project.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Government has never before been afraid to

admit its mistakes. Let us admit that this Bill was a

mistake  and  that this Abortion Bill  is  one  whose

purpose is obscure, whose need is unproven and  whose

consequences would be deplorable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, I urge hon. Members of this

august Chamber to support me in asking that this Bill

be withdrawn.



<br><br>6.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the Abortion Bill is a complex  issue

and its implications are extremely wide, for this  is

not only a problem of medicine but also a problem  of

social  life, family welfare and personal health.  It

is  to  be  expected, therefore,  that  the  attitude

towards  this problem will not be uniform  among  the

people.  The reason is quite simple. There  are  some

people  who  persist in following certain  moral  and

religious concepts and, as a result, lack the courage

to  adopt  positive measures in the face  of  a  very

important problem. Attitudes of this sort are  likely

to  obstruct the efforts of the Government to  change

our society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, the Abortion Bill is designed in accordance with the needs of our people and the requirements of our society. I personally have gone through very carefully the clauses of this Bill and I have the following reasons to advance in full support for the liberalisation of the law on abortion. My

view-point is a completely independent one and  I  am

not  influenced  by  any medical ideas  or  religious

concepts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all realise that our country is in a peculiar

situation  and  we should not be satisfied  with  our

present  situation.  We should  plan  ahead  for  the

future as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



our country does not have enough natural resources to

accommodate  the  increase  of  our  population.   At

present, our population growth rate is 2.5 per  cent,

a  figure  slightly higher than that in some  Western

countries. At the same time, we also have some 50,000

people  who are unemployed, and on top of  all  this,

the British forces are going to withdraw, it is to be

expected, therefore, that the problem of unemployment

will  become  more and more serious. As a responsible

Government  we must pay attention to these  problems.

We  should  plan  ahead and find  fair  and  rational

solutions  to  these  problems. I  believe  that  the

liberalisation of the law of abortion will reduce the

population growth rate and this will be beneficial to

our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Abortion Bill will ensure that

children born in the Republic will be of a very  good

quality. They will be able to obtain proper care  and

have a fair chance of a good education. Thirdly,  the

Abortion  Bill will provide a last resort  for  women

when     contraceptive    measures    have    failed.

Liberalisation  of  the law  on  abortion  is  not  a

substitute  for  family  planning,  it  is   only   a

supplementary method, especially for those women  who

do  not  wish  to  have any more children.  In  other

words, it is a very safe last resort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, bearing in mind the national interests and the requirements of our environment, the future of our children, family welfare and the safety and personal welfare of our women, I fully support this Abortion Bill in principle.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member sitting beside  me  has

stood  up to oppose vehemently the Abortion Bill.  In

rising to speak on the Bill, I have a different view-point  from his. His arguments are based on religious

considerations, but my opposition to the Bill  arises

from humanitarian considerations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we all know that Singapore is a tiny island

with  no  natural resources. The land area is limited

and there is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>



also  very  little valuable land. But our  population

has reached two million with a population density  of

8,000  people  to  a  square  mile.  This  population

density has given cause for worry, and if this is  to

continue,  we  may  one day reach a  situation  where

there  will be a population explosion. On  the  other

hand,  our country is only at the beginning of nation

building  and there are many tasks which require  our

attention. Our rate of economic growth is  still  far

behind  our  rate of population growth, in  view  of

this,  the  former  Minister  for  Health,  now   the

Minister  for  Communications,  during  his  term  of

office  tried  his very best to promote family  plann

ing.  As  a result, our rate of population growth  is

decreasing.  According  to a report  by  the  Kandang

Kerbau  Maternity Hospital, it is stated  that  in

1965,  40,181 babies were born in Singapore,  on  the

average of about 110 babies a day. Whereas after  the

nation-wide  campaign of family planning,  the  birth

rate in Singapore decreased to 38,252 in 1967.

<div align="center"><b>HIGH COST OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN SINGAPORE</b></div>



<br><br>6.16 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore

Government  has  prided  itself  on  its   pragmatic

socialism  and,  in  accordance with  its  socialist

principles,  has introduced and implemented  various

social  projects and schemes for the benefit of  its

citizens. Not the least praiseworthy effort  of  the

Government has been that in the field



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>



of education. We are one of the few countries in Asia

to provide free primary education for the children of

our  citizens in the language media of their own free

choice.  It is not surprising that today in Singapore

illiteracy has ceased to be a problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government, however, to give it due credit, has

not  contented  itself  with  merely  providing  free

primary  education  but  has made  plans  to  provide

similarly  free secondary education for our citizens.

It  is unfortunate that the scheme for free secondary

education  could  not  be  implemented  for   various

reasons   of   national  exigencies.  The  indonesian

confrontation,   followed  by  our  separation   from

Malaysia  and  the  accelerated  withdrawal  of   the

British Armed Forces, has in no small way contributed

to  making this scheme economically unfeasible. It is

inevitable  that our scarce financial resources  have

to  be  channelled away from social projects to cater

for  more  vital needs, namely, our industrialisation

programme and defence responsibilities. The  generous

response  to  the  National  Defence  Fund  from  all

sections  of  our  citizens, however,  is  sufficient

indication of the realisation and the appreciation by

our   citizens  of  the  magnitude  of  our  national

problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while our citizens understand the problems of

the  Government,  I  am sad to  say  that  a  similar

compliment  cannot  be  paid to  the  authorities  in

charge of administering our educational policy. But I

must  also  hasten  to  add  that  our  Ministry   of

Education  has done well to fashion its  policies  to

meet   the   changing   economic   circumstances   of

Singapore. The recent emphasis on technical education

is  in  keeping  with the transition  of  Singapore's

economy   from   entrepot  trade   to   manufacturing

industries. The channelling of students at the end of

their second year of secondary education into various

educational   streams,  in  accordance   with   their

respective  aptitudes or skills  as  determined  from

their academic records, is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



in  consonance with the rational development of our

national  resources. The Ministry, however, does  not

appear to give any thought to the minimisation of the

economic  effect of the readjustment of its  policies

on the parents of the students concerned. To my mind,

it  is a singular failure on the part of the Ministry

not  to take into consideration the problem of  human

relations  when  effecting changes  in  policy,  thus

showing an ignorance of the problems of our citizens.









<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>6.20 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is not possible for the Government to

implement a scheme of free secondary education, it is

reasonably   expected   of  our   Government,   which

subscribes to pragmatic socialism, to bring secondary

education  within  the means of as many  citizens  as

possible.   But,  contrary  to  such  reasonable   ex

pectations,  many citizens, particularly  those  from

the  lower  income  group, have  found  the  cost  of

educating their children to a secondary level prohibi

tively  expensive. As hon. Members of the  House  are

aware, every student in a secondary school has to pay

a  school  fee of $4 per month plus a fee of  $2  for

miscellaneous purposes, thus making a total of $6 per

month.  The only students who are exempted  from  the

payment  of  such fees are students of Malay  origin.

Others,  even those whose parents are in  receipt  of

public assistance from the Social Welfare Department,

are  expected  to  pay  at least  a  fee  of  $1  for

miscellaneous  purposes. Thus even a student  from  a

family  with no income at all is expected to  pay  at

least  a  fee  of  $1  per month for  the  luxury  of

secondary education, But the point I wish to make  is

that  the  conditions prescribed by the  Ministry  of

Education  for the remission of school fees  from  $6

per  month  to $1 per month are extremely  rigid  and

restrictive to such an extent that it is possible for

a student from a family in very difficult



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



financial  circumstances not to  be  granted  such  a

remission  of school fees. I refer, Sir, to  the  two

conditions which must be satisfied before  a  student

can be granted remission of school fees. The first is

that  the  income  of the student's family  does  not

exceed  $200  per  month.  The  second  is  that  the

granting of such remission is subject to a maximum of

10  per  cent  of the total enrolment in each  school

being granted such remission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what is the basis for the selection of

the magical figure of $200 per month

family income as a means test for determining whether

a  student  qualifies for remission  of  school  fee,

exemption  from the miscellaneous fee and entitlement

to  free textbooks. I may be wrong, but it appears to

me  that  the Ministry has chosen the figure of  $200

because  that is the figure mentioned in the  Central

Provident Fund Ordinance for the purpose of exempting

an  employee  from  making  contributions  under  the

Ordinance,  it  appears to be the  reasoning  of  the

Ministry  of  Education that if a family bread-earner

can  afford  to  pay  C.P.F. contributions  from  his

income of more than $200 per month, he should be able

to  pay  the school fees of his children in secondary

school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever may be the actual reasons for the selection

of  the  figure  of  $200 per month,  the  figure  is

arbitrary  and ridiculous as a means test.  Reference

here must be made to the Urban Incomes and Housing  -

a  Report  on the Social Survey of Singapore  1953-54

prepared by our Finance Minister, Dr Goh Keng  Swee.

On  the  basis  of  data obtainable in  1953-54,  the

result of the survey indicates that a minimum monthly

income to sustain a family of four (man, wife and two

children) in bare comfort is $101.85. Such  a  figure

was  arrived at on the basis of the bare necessities,

such  as food, that are required for the survival  of

the family and do not take into consideration various

luxury items such as cigarettes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 910</b></font><br><br>



and  entertainment.  But most important  of  all,  no

account  was  taken of the expenses of educating  the

children, not even at primary level, not to speak  of

secondary level.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor that was not taken into consideration

is  the cost of housing for the family. Assuming that

the  family  is occupying the cheapest Housing  Board

accommodation at $50 per month, it would appear  that

a  family of four requires at least $151 to house and

feed  itself  on  the basis of the  findings  in  the

1953-54  Report.  But  from  our  investigations,  it

appears  that  the  cost of living has  increased  by

about 20.5 per cent over the last 15 years since  the

conduct  of the survey in 1953-54. I am quite certain

that  our  price index and cost of living index  etc.

may  even show that the cost of living has gone  down

over  the  past few years. I am quite aware that  the

price  index,  the  cost of living  index  and  other

statistical  indices can be manipulated by  assigning

different weights to different components in indices.

Thus,  it  is  not surprising that it is possible  to

compile a price index to show that the cost of living

has gone down by 50 per cent while every housewife in

Singapore has found, from bitter experience, that the

cost  of  living has increased rather than decreased.

To  return to my point, however, I would say  that  a

family  with an income of $200 per month can  barely

afford secondary education for the children,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is more so with the introduction of compulsory

technical subjects in Secondary I and II, The  reason

for  the additional cost is the necessary expenditure

of money for the purchase of drawing boards, workshop-aprons and geometrical instruments which are required

for  the  technical subjects. From inquiries  I  have

made,  the lowest amount that is required to be spent

on  the  purchase of such equipment is  approximately

$15.  Besides such additional expenditure,  there  is

the normal expenditure for the purchase of textbooks.

Again, from inquiries I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



made, I am able to quote the least amount of money

that must be spent on the necessary

textbooks for the secondary classes, The figures  are

as follows:



<pre>

         Secondary I    $35 (for textbooks alone)

         Secondary II   $30

         Secondary III  $59 (for pure Science Stream)

                        $50 (for non-Science Stream)

         Secondary IV   $30

</pre>



<br><br>These  figures are hypothetical figures based on  the

cheapest  textbooks available. The actual figure  may

be  around $80 when all the other equipment is bought

for  each  of the secondary classes, as I  understand

each school has its own selection of textbooks to  be

used  by students. Thus it would be accurate  to  say

that to maintain a student in a secondary school,  it

is  necessary for his parents to spend about  $50  or

$60  a  year on books and other educational materials

in  addition to the school fees of $6 per month which

works out roughly to an average of $11 per month  per

student in a secondary class.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the risk of boring Members of the House, I wish

to stress that the cost of secondary education is too

burdensome for a family in the lower income group.  I

have  previously referred to the remission of  school

fees  by  the  Ministry of Education in the  case  of

families whose monthly income is less than $200. Such

remission is again subject to the condition that only

a  maximum  of  10  per cent of the total  number  of

students  enrolled in a particular school are  to  be

allowed  such remission. Such a 10 per cent limit  is

strictly  applied irrespective of whether the  school

is  situated in the urban or rural area. It stands to

reason  that  a  greater percentage  of  students  in

secondary schools in the rural area are from families

in  the lower income group as compared to students in

secondary   schools  in  the  urban  area.   Yet   no

consideration has been given by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



the Ministry to this fact in applying the rigid limit

of  10 per cent of students to be given remission  of

school fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, on paper it may seem very grand that our

educational  policy  permits the  maximum  number  of

children  of  our citizens to avail themselves  of  a

secondary  education  with  the  assistance  of   the

Government.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, the position is not so rosy as I have

shown  earlier. For instance, the remission of school

fees for parents who are not financially well off  by

reason  of  fixing  the arbitrary  figure  of  earned

income  of  $200  per  month  as  a  means  test  for

qualifying for remission of school fees. It  is  true

that  the  Government has a scheme  of  bursaries  or

financial  assistance for students in  the  secondary

schools. The voted provision for such bursaries  this

year amounts to $1.35 million, which works out to  an

average   of  $8.40  per  student  in  the  secondary

classes.  This,  Members of  the  House  will  agree,

hardly  bears  comparison with  the  actual  cost  of

textbooks  for a secondary class amounting  to  about

$80 inclusive of school fees,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides shouldering the expenditure on school fees

and  textbooks, parents also have to pay for the  bus

fares  and  pocket  money of their children  who  are

fortunate enough to be enrolled in secondary classes.

The  Secondary I pupils in some schools have to  stay

behind at least once a week for technical drawing and

workshop  practice and in some schools they  have  to

stay  behind  twice a week because  of  the  lack  of

workshop  facilities  in  many  schools.  Again,   in

accordance  with  the  policy of  our  Government  to

develop  a rugged society, students are now  required

to  participate  in  more  and  more  extracurricular

activities.  With  the  extensions  of   sports   and

athletic meets and parades of uniformed organisations

at  various levels, it becomes increasingly necessary

sometimes  for  students to spend the  whole  day  in

school.  For instance, those in the morning  sessions

have to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



come  in  the afternoon to participate in  extramural

activities.  For those in the afternoon sessions,  it

is  necessary for the students concerned to  come  to

school  in the morning. If the students do not return

home  they  have to spend additional money  on  some

necessary  refreshments. If they go  home  for  their

meals,  it  is necessary for them to incur additional

bus fares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In giving vent to the grievances and grouses of

parents in the lower income groups whose children are

attending  secondary schools. I am in agreement  with

their justified contention that the cost of secondary

education could have been minimised to some extent if

the  Ministry had exercised some imagination in  this

direction. I have, therefore, two suggestions to  put

forward  for the consideration of the Ministry.  They

are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The creation and maintenance of a central poo1

of  teaching  aids and implements such as  T-squares.

set  squares and other geometrical instruments of the

type   required   for  technical   drawing.   It   is

appreciated  that consumer articles such as  pencils,

pins and stationery do not lend themselves to such  a

pooling arrangement, but a school can arrange for the

bulk  purchase of such material and sell them without

profit to the students. This will help to save untold

trouble   for  the  parents  and  the  students   who

invariably  have to spend a lot of time  hunting  for

particular  types  that  have  been  recommended   by

teachers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. A more liberal policy of awarding bursaries or

remission of school fees and the loan of textbooks to

students whose parents are not financially well off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making these two suggestions, I am fully

cognisant  of the fact that the education  budget  is

already very high and that we cannot go on increasing

the   budget  just  to  afford  an  opportunity   for

secondary  education to students  who  may  not  even

complete the full course of secondary education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the same, it is the avowed policy of our

Government  that no student is to be deprived  of  an

education because of financial hardship. A survey  of

the drop-outs from secondary schools, I am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



sure,  will  reveal  interesting  facts  and  figures

concerning  the  family income of such  students  who

have dropped out of school. I do not know whether the

Government  is planning to undertake such  a  survey,

particularly in relation to the socio-economic aspect

of the home environment of the students who drop out.

But I do know that financial hardship is the real, if

not   the  main  reason  for  parents  to  plead  for

financial  assistance for their children who  are  in

secondary schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree that nothing can be given free, but we must

understand  the  plight of families who  cannot  even

afford  to  pay  the  school fees of  their  children

attending  secondary schools.  I  am  sure  that  our

efficient  Minister  for  Education  will  give   his

sympathetic   consideration  to  the  very   pressing

problems of the underprivileged children.



<br><br>6.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, for

a  moment, I thought the Member for Telok Blangah was

going  to  give us new proposals whereby we can  give

everyone  free  secondary  education.  But,   unfortu

nately, they were not forthcoming.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I reply to all the queries raised by the

Member, may I just state some facts?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, the Ministry of Education had the

largest share of the national budget. It amounted  to

nearly a quarter of the national budget. In fact,  it

is the highest in developing countries, if not one of

the  highest in the world. Even in Japan, it  amounts

to only 22 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1968 budget, of the $152 million allocated to

the Ministry of Education, some $50 million was spent

on  secondary  education. This does not  include  the

cost  of  tertiary education, administration and  the

cost  of  training  the  teachers  at  the  Teachers'

Training College. The cost per student works  out  to

$360  per student per annum. As far as Government  is

concerned,  $1 out of every $4 is spent on education.

The amount spent on a student also works



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>



out  to  about  15 per cent of the per  capita  Gross

National Product for last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go on to the expenses borne by the parents,

1  would like to remind the Member for Telok Blangah,

who, I believe, was a former committee member of  the

Singapore Teachers' Union, that our secondary  school

teachers at the present moment are working an average

of  18 hours per week, which compares very favourably

with  secondary school teachers everywhere  else  who

work an average of 22 hours per week. Their salary is

one  of  the highest in the world and the highest  in

this  region. In fact, I would like to add that  some

of  the  teachers and principals of secondary schools

are  drawing  salaries  much  higher  than  those  of

Parliamentary Secretaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now come to the expenses borne by parents? As

the  Member correctly pointed out, parents pay $6 per

month for their child's school fees and miscellaneous

fees  and  every  year  pay some  $60  on  textbooks,

exercise books, uniforms, etc. This works out to some

$11  per  month.  May I ask the  Member  for  Telok

Blangah a question? Can anyone truly say that he  has

never  foolishly wasted $11 per month  if,  in  fact,

that  $11  can  be  wisely  spent  on  the  secondary

education of his child?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also like to point out some wrong impressions the

Member   for  Telok  Blangah  gave.  First  of   all,

remission of fees is for 15 per cent and not  10  per

cent  of  the school student population. And  in  the

less  affluent  rural areas, the percentage  is  much

more.  I  also  wish  to point out  that  some  9.000

students  are at present receiving bursaries  at  the

secondary  level, representing some six per  cent  of

the student population at this level. In other words.

a  total of 21 per cent of the student population are

not paying any fees. In 1968, 8,000 students obtained

free  textbooks; this makes up another six per  cent.

Therefore,  27 per cent of the student population  at

this level, one way or other, directly or indirectly,

are being subsidised



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>



by the Government. This is over and above the

$360  which the Government is paying for their  education,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to draw the attention of the Member for

Telok  Blangah  to the fact that while  the  cost  of

living  has increased slightly - I will leave  it  to

the Minister for Finance to contest the figure of  20

per  cent  which I recall was brought up in the  last

Budget  debate the expenses borne by the  parents  of

students  at  the  secondary  level  have,  in  fact,

decreased.  I  recall that when  I  was  a  secondary

student,  I  paid  $15 per month for  fees  while  my

teachers  were  drawing a salary of  a  hundred  over

dollars.  Now  they are getting over $1,000  and  the

school  fees  have come down to $4.  Of  course,  the

figure of 27 per cent does not include those students

coming  under  social welfare relief  cases.  I  must

admit that I was unable to get this particular figure

in time for this debate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, due to the remarkable success of this Government in improving the social conditions of the nation particularly in the field of education. I am afraid some people have come to a stage where they are taking everything for granted. They expect things to be free. I must remind Members that nothing is

free  in Singapore. In fact, at very moment, the very

air that we are breathing is being paid for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to inform Members that any further

subsidy  for secondary education has to be met  by  a

corresponding  cut somewhere else.  Will  the  Member

suggest   that   the  teachers  would  volunteer   to

subsidise secondary education?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a point of

clarification. The Parliamentary Secretary  has  been

talking about the teaching service. I fail to  equate

the  teaching service issue with a better  system  of

secondary education. I fail to see the connection  at

all.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are talking

about  the high cost of secondary education.  Eighty-five per



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



cent  of  the  cost  of secondary education  goes  to

teachers' salaries. [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Parliamentary Secretary has

only two minutes to conclude.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish

to  take  up the issue of teachers' salaries.  But  I

would  like  to  assure the Member for Telok  Blangah

that  my  Ministry is looking into  various  ways  to

reduce the burden of parents. In fact, the Department

of  Technical Education is now setting up  a  central

pool  of drawing boards which will reduce the  burden

of   the  students  in  this  respect.  We  are  also

conducting  a research into the number of  drop-outs.

or  rather  the wastage of education at the secondary

level. In fact, by doing this, we hope, coupled  with

planned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



enrolment  exercise, to be able,  with  a  standstill

budget,  to improve - I will not say improve  because

we  have  reached the optimum stage - but to  provide

more  or better educational facilities for people  in

the lower income group.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I quote a figure for the Member for

Telok  Blangah  - that for a person earning  $150  or

$200  a  month, the education cost for  his  children

amounts to only about five per cent of his income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Question having been proposed at 6.15 p.m, and

the  Debate  having continued for half an  hour,  Mr

Speaker  adjourned  the House without  Question  put,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><i>Tuesday, 8th April, 1969</i></div>



<div align="center"><b>ABORTIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for Health

(a)  how many abortions have been carried out by  the

Hospital  Authorities from 1st January, 1967,  up  to

the latest convenient date; and (b) how many cases of

abortions  have  been  treated  or  recorded  by   or

reported to the Hospital Authorities, and how many of

such cases have been fatal, during the same period.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> (a) Abortions carried out by

Kandang Kerbau Hospital 1967 = 820 (with no deaths).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abortions carried out by Kandang Kerbau Hospital

1968 = 1,376 (with no deaths).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Cases of abortions treated, recorded or reported

by  Hospital  Authorities for 1967 =  3,327  (with  5

deaths). 1968 = 2,922 (with 2 deaths).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In amplification of the figures in these answers 1

should  add that the figures in my answer to question

(a)  for  abortions carried out in the Hospital  were

those  done  for  medical reasons, i.e.  "therapeutic

abortions"   for   such  conditions   as   incomplete

abortions (to complete the evacuation of the womb  of

the contents of conception when abortion has occurred

spontaneously   -  "naturally"  -or  by   "artificial

induction"; or from inevitable abortion, or  in  some

other  conditions where the continued  pregnancy  may

endanger the life of the pregnant woman such as heart

diseases  in  heart  failure, tuberculosis,  advanced

kidney diseases with kidney impairment and cancer  of

the breast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figures in my answer (b) for cases of abortions

treated,  recorded or reported by the Hospital  would

include the figures for abortions carried out by  the

Hospital given in answer (a) .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference in the numbers would, therefore,

more  correctly  be  figures for cases  of  abortions

treated  in  the hospital. These cases would  include

persons treated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



for threatened abortions, i.e. where there is  a

possibility  of  the  pregnancy terminating  for  one

reason or the other, but usually from natural causes;

where  it is necessary to try and save the pregnancy.

In  others,  these were for treatment of cases  which

had  been  interfered with, and were  suffering  from

infection  of injury to the womb. These latter  cases

cannot  always be determined accurately as the  woman

seldom  will  admit interference with the pregnancies

and  many  of the numbers included in the  group  are

based   on   presumptive  evidence  that   they   are

criminally induced abortions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An MD thesis on Non-clinical aspects of induced

abortions  in Singapore was written by Dr  Lee  Yong

Kiat.  His  figures for induced abortions were  1,676

for  a six-month period in 1964, i.e. 3,352 projected

for the year. He also estimated that the total number

of abortions occurring in Singapore would probably be

about  6,000  a year. My predecessor, replying  to  a

question in Parliament on abortions, quoted the  same

source   for  his  figures  on  estimated  abortions.

(Hansard  -  Thursday, 7th September 1967,  Vol.  26, Columns 95 and 96).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my answers, it can be inferred that abortions

carried out (for medical reasons) in the Hospital are

safe since no deaths occurred in the entire series in

the   last  two  years.  In  comparison,  the  deaths

recorded from abortions treated in the Hospital  were

deaths from those who had in all probability been criminally  aborted  outside and were brought  into  the

Hospital  for  treatment. The comparative  safety  of

abortions  done  under  the  Hospital  conditions  is

further confirmed by comparison with deaths resulting

from   childbirth.  Whereas  there  were  no   deaths

resulting  from therapeutic abortions, there  were  a

few  deaths resulting from childbirth in the Hospital

(0.5 and 0.3 per thousand of births) as appears in my

answer to another question filed by the hon. Member.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 921</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>CHILDBIRTHS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr L. P. Rodrigo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr L. P. Rodrigo</b> asked the Minister for Health

how many births have been recorded by or reported  to

the  Hospital Authorities from 1st January, 1967,  up

to the latest convenient date -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) in which the child was born with physical or mental abnormalities as to seriously handicap it;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) in which a pregnancy had been the result of -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) rape or incest;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) intercourse with an insane person;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) intercourse with a feebleminded person;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) which resulted in the death of the pregnant

woman as the pregnancy had involved risk to her life:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) which resulted in physical or mental injury to

the pregnant woman as the pregnancy had involved such

risk to her.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Child born with physical/mental abnormality,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1967 =  78 (0.22 per cent of births).

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1968 = 109.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) (i) Pregnancy following rape/incest = 5.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Pregnancy following intercourse with insane person = Nil.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Pregnancy following intercourse with feeble-minded person = Nil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Maternal deaths following pregnancy in Kandang Kerbau Hospital,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1967 = 19 deaths.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1968 = 12 deaths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) It is not possible to give figures of the number

of  women  who  suffered physical  or  mental  injury

following  the birth as follow-ups of women following

their  confinements are not carried out indefinitely.

Further,  any morbid condition which a woman suffered

from  is treated at other institutions, and there  is

no  linkage in the records to be able to provide  for

information  on  these  matters.  Hence,  unless  the

morbid condition occurred soon after birth, no  infor

mation will be available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of deaths given in my answer should be

related to the total number of births in the Hospital

which were 38,252 and 36,727 respectively. This gives

a  maternal mortality rate per thousand births at 0.5

and  0.33 respectively. Maternal mortality is defined

as  the  number  of  women  dying  shortly  following

childbirth whether a child was born alive or at still

birth.  The  number of deaths is usually given  as  a

rate,  i.e. total number of maternal mortalities  per

thousand  births. The latest figures  available  from

the  overall maternal mortality rate in Singapore  in

1965 and 1966 were 0.4 and 0.5.
