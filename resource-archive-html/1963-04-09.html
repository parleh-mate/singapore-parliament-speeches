Finance  what progress has been made in the  Common

Market talks with the Federation of Malaya.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, this House has been

informed  on several occasions that the discussions

on  a proposed Commodity Common Market between  the

Governments  of  the  Federation  of   Malaya   and

Singapore  have  concluded  with  an  agreement  to

submit  the matter for further investigation  by  a

body   of  international  experts.  That  body   of

international  experts,  namely,  the  World   Bank

Mission  headed by Professor Jaques Rueff,  is  now

here and the two Governments are waiting to receive

their preliminary recommendations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Can  the  Parliamentary  Secretary  enlighten  this

House  as  to when this delegation from  the  World

Bank  can  table a report to this House as  regards

its investigations?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> The Word Bank Mission is here.

They  are making investigations and preparing their

report.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot say what is the exact date when the

report will be submitted.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 272</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>TRADE BETWEEN SINGAPORE AND INDONESIA</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> asked the Minister for

Finance   whether  trade  between   Singapore   and

Indonesia  has improved since the establishment  of

the  Trade and Cultural Commission in Djakarta, and

to what extent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy (for the Minister for Finance):</b>

There  has been a great improvement in total  trade

between   Singapore   and   Indonesia   since   the

establishment of the Singapore Trade  and  Cultural

Representation. The value of Singapore's exports to

Indonesia  has  more than doubled  since  1960.  In

1960,  we  exported $121 million worth of goods  to

Indonesia; in 1962, our exports increased to $292.5

million, which is 242 per cent of the 1960 figure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hon. Member may be aware, every country

tries  its  utmost to expand its export  trade  and

this  increase in our exports to Indonesia is  most

gratifying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards imports, the value has declined and

this  is due principally to the heavy fall  in  the

price  of rubber over the last two to three  years.

Rubber accounts for more than three-fourths of  our

imports   from  Indonesia.  Although  values   have

dropped,  the  volume  of  imports,  that  is,  the

quantity   of   rubber  imported,   has   increased

considerably, from 285.3 thousand tons in  1960  to

367.2  thousand tons in 1962, an increase of nearly

30 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Trade and Cultural Representation

has  helped  to explain Singapore's policy  to  the

Indonesian  Government and in return to  understand

and appreciate Indonesia's policy, thus helping  to

foster  and improve cordial relations now  existing

between Singapore and Indonesia.

<div align="center"><b>INVESTMENT OF GOVERNMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>FUNDS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>SINCE 1962</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  what amount of Government funds  has  been

invested  in  foreign  countries  since  1962,  and

where.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy (for the Minister for Finance):</b> I

am sorry, Sir, for the delay in replying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1st January, 1962, a total of ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think the Parliamentary

Secretary  is  aware  that if he  is  answering  on

behalf of a Minister, he should preface his remarks

by saying, "I have been asked to reply."



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have been asked to reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1st January, 1962, a total of $141 million

was  invested by the Singapore Government in  gilt-edged  securities  available in  the  London  money

market.  These  Reserve Funds are  not  immediately

required for utilisation in Singapore. The money so

invested  can, at a moment's notice, be transferred

to  Singapore any time the Government is in need of

it. This practice of investing such reserves in the

United  Kingdom  is  adopted  by  all  Commonwealth

countries - Asian, and non-Asian.

<div align="center"><b>PIONEER CERTIFICATES GRANTED SINCE 1959</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Amount of capital from foreign countries)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  how  many pioneer certificates  have  been

granted  since June 1959; what is the total  amount

of  paid-up capital involved; and how much of this

capital  is from foreign countries, and from  which

countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have been asked to reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since June 1959, 24 pioneer certificates have

been  granted.  Another five certificates  will  be

granted soon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the firms which have been awarded pioneer

certificates, the capital involved is as follows:

<pre>

Total Authorised Capital    163,750,000

Total Subscribed Capital     48,538,715

Total Paid-up Capital        33,112,132

      (a) Local              13,972,134

      (b) Foreign            19,139,998



</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the other five firms, the capital involved

is:

Total Authorised Capital      9,500,000

Total Subscribed Capital        920,202

Total Paid-up Capital           920,202

      (b)  Foreign              555,998

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the total amount of Paid-up Capital, 58 per

cent  is  from  abroad. This foreign capital  comes

from  the  United  Kingdom, the  United  States  of

America, Japan, Hongkong, Holland, Switzerland, and

other countries.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker.

Sir,  the Parliamentary Secretary said that foreign

capital  of $19,139,998 has been invested in  local

industries, namely 58 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can he tell us whether the Government has any

future  plan to encourage our local capitalists  to

invest in our local industries and not to issue too

many  of  these  pioneer  certificates  to  foreign

capitalists?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> We have always encouraged local

capitalists to invest in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>BOGUS INSURANCE COMPANIES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  what  action has been taken against  bogus

insurance companies since the coming into operation

of   the   Life   Assurance  Companies  (Compulsory

Liquidation)  Ordinance,  1962;  and  whether   any

policy holder has been refunded his money, and what

percentage of the original amount.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I have been asked to reply.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Life Assurance Companies (Compulsory

Liquidation)  Ordinance, 1962, came into  operation

on  3rd April, 1962. Positive steps were then taken

to wind up and liquidate the unsound life insurance

companies  in Singapore. There were, at that  time,

two  groups  of such companies. Firstly, Federation

incorporated companies with branches in  Singapore;

and secondly, companies registered and incorporated

in   Singapore.  The  first  group   of   insurance

companies  are  being liquidated by  order  of  the

Federation High Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of liquidating a company is a lengthy

one,  often  complicated with legal technicalities.

Because  of  this  and  because  of  the  tens   of

thousands   of  claims  that  were  reviewed,   the

liquidators in the Federation have not been able to

complete  their work in respect of any one company.

There  is  information, however, that while  a  few

companies  may  have  some  assets  that  could  be

realised  and  distributed,  many  were   in   poor

financial  position and it would be  optimistic  of

any  policy  holder  to  expect  any  more  than  a

fraction of his claims to be honoured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Action has been taken in Singapore to wind up the

unsound  insurance companies registered  here.  The

liquidators appointed have been working to  realise

the  assets of the insurance companies and  of  the

three  Singapore companies. Policy holders will  be

informed  in the next month or two regarding  their

claims and the refunds they will receive.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  can  the Parliamentary Secretary assure  this

House  that  after one or two months  some  of  the

policy holders can get a refund of their premiums?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, I have already said

that  the  policy holders will be informed  in  the

next  month or two regarding their claims  and  the

refunds they will receive.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

according   to   the  reply  of  the  Parliamentary

Secretary, it means



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 276</b></font><br><br>



that  the Government cannot assure this House  that

in  the  coming  two  or three  months  the  policy

holders cannot realise their claims.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee)</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary is

answering questions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it all depends

on what assets the Companies have. If there are any

assets,  the  policy holders will receive  whatever

can be distributed.

<div align="center"><b>APPLICATIONS FOR INSERTION IN ELECTORAL REGISTERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>IN 1962</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  how  many persons applied  to  have  their

names  inserted in the electoral registers in 1962;

how many applications have been approved; of these,

how many were from Singapore citizens by birth, and

how   many   were   from  Singapore   citizens   by

registration; and how many have been  refused,  and

the reasons for refusal.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is

presumed  that  the Member for  Choa  Chu  Kang  is

referring  to  the  claims  submitted  during   the

revision  of  the  registers for 1962.  There  were

roughly   15,000   claims  submitted   during   the

statutory   period   and  the  number   of   claims

disallowed  were 1,395. The reasons for the  claims

being disallowed were lack of qualification or non-attendance   at   the  public   inquiry   to   give

information as regards entitlement to registration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Minister  said that  1,395  claims  were

refused.  Can  he  inform this  House  as  to  what

happened to the other 14,000 claims?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer

is  obvious. All the others except the  1,395  were

approved and their names will be included  in  the

registers for 1962.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The question also asks how many of

them  were Singapore citizens by birth and how many

were  Singapore  citizens by registration.  Is  the

Minister  prepared  to  answer  that  part  of  the

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a

compilation of these classified figures  asked  for

by the Member for Choa Chu Kang has never been kept

in   the  past  and  it  is  not  being  done  now,

especially when the Elections Department is  busily

engaged  in the revision of the electoral registers

for 1962.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, according to my knowledge, the registration of

citizens  born  in Singapore is done  by  procuring

their  identity  cards from the  Identity  Registry

before they can be registered. Those who have  been

registered  as citizens are those whose names  have

been   supplied   by   the  Citizenship   Registry.

Therefore, the Minister should be able to know  the

various figures asked for.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I cannot, for one moment,

understand  the  purpose of  the  question  of  the

Member for Choa Chu Kang. It is quite true that  if

the  Government wants to get these figures, it  can

do  so if there is time and the staff for it. As  I

said  just  now, the Elections Department  is  busy

with the revision of the 1962 registers and, as far

as  I  can see, there is no purpose in getting  the

figures.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of those

citizens born in Singapore and those registered  as

citizens arose in the constitutional talks  between

Singapore  and  the  Federation.  Therefore,   this

question  is  very pertinent. That is why  we  have

asked  this  question.  The  reply  given  by   the

Minister  shows that he is not willing to  disclose

these figures.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member now is inviting a debate.

Perhaps  the  Member's question could just  be:  In

view of what



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font><br><br>



he  has  said,  will  the Minister  reconsider  his

answer?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if a citizen

by  birth or by registration is qualified to  be  a

voter,  his  name will be placed in  the  electoral

register. I have just obtained information from the

Minister for Finance that to obtain the information

for  the  Member for Choa Chu Kang, the  Government

will require another $38,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

according to the earlier reply of the Minister  for

Home Affairs, it seems that we are not entitled  to

know   the  figures  or  facts  of  the  Government

Ministry. I am asking, are we entitled to know  the

facts and figures in the Government Ministry?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if the

Member  for Havelock is prepared to approve $38,000

for  this purpose, we will engage the staff to  get

this information for him.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 50 be

reduced  by  the  whole  sum  in  respect  of   new

subhead - National Referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, under this item, the Government asks for $436,001 to be paid for the shameful National Referendum conducted on the 1st of September last year. Mr Speaker, Sir, to the people of Singapore, the 1st of September last year was a dark day. It was a day when parliamentary

democracy died. Throughout the whole proxies of the

National  Referendum, the people in Singapore  were

able  to  see that the P.A.P., in order to  prolong

their  political  life, did all sorts  of  shameful

things  and  utilised all means of  the  propaganda

machinery  to  intimidate the people of  Singapore.

This  is only for the sake of a few leaders in  the

oligarchy  of the P.A.P. Mr Speaker, Sir,  we  saw

that on that day



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 281</b></font><br><br>



the  Government  used all police  vans  with  loud-speakers. They went to every housing estate,  every

lane,  every street and every village to intimidate

people,   to  coerce  them  into  voting  for   the

Government's proposal as otherwise they would  lose

their citizenship rights. We were able to see  that

officers  in  the Ministry of Health  went  to  the

coffee  shops, laundry shops and canteens. Now,  if

the  licences of these shops had to be approved  by

the  officers  in the Ministry, then  the  officers

went  and  pasted up Government posters  about  the

National Referendum on the walls of these shops and

intimidated the people into voting for proposal  A,

otherwise they would find difficulty in carrying on

their business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you could also see that the

Prime  Minister  in the mass meeting  at  Fullerton

Square uttered his threats through Radio Singapore,

thereby forcing the people to vote for the P.A.P.'s

proposal.  From  all  these  propaganda  activities

conducted by the Government, we can see their  main

object was to salvage their political life and  not

for  the  national interest or for the interest  of

the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you could also see that on National Referendum Day,

when the voting came to an end, the various political

Parties were not able to enjoy all the facilities.

They were not allowed  to send  representatives to

supervise the counting  of the votes. We also saw

that the ballot box in every

division  was  not  carefully  examined   and   the

representatives were not able to know  where  these

ballot  boxes came from. However, only  the  P.A.P.

people  knew  to  which electoral  divisions  these

boxes belonged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this is very important. All the

people in Singapore knew that the P.A.P. would make

use  of  the  National Referendum to find  out  the

extent  of  the  people's  support  for  them.  The

Government also knew that if they openly  disclosed

the electoral boxes to the Opposition Parties, that

would  be  to their disadvantage. Because of  this,

the  whole National Referendum was conducted  under

undemocratic conditions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 282</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About three weeks ago when the Prime Minister

paid  a  visit  to  Sembawang, he said  during  the

course  of the National Referendum that many people

in  the  rural areas put in blank votes.  That  was

because the Government was not doing enough in  the

field  of propaganda in the rural areas. The  Prime

Minister also pointed out that during the course of

the  National Referendum, the number of blank votes

in  the  Jurong  area was very  high.  It  was  the

highest  throughout  the whole  of  Singapore.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  all  these speeches  by  the  Prime

Minister very clearly exposed their political  aims

in  conducting this National Referendum.  In  other

words,  the Ministers in the P.A.P. were trying  to

seek  out  the  safe  seats  in  a  future  general

election.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that  is  why   the

Government spent the people's money for  their  own

political objectives and they have no reason to ask

the House to approve the $436,001 as ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The hon. Member is interpreted as

saying that the amount to be voted is $436,001. The

amount is $372,422.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Government ask this House to approve  the

sum  of  $372,422 for the purpose of  the  National

Referendum. What I have said just now very  clearly

shows  that  we  the  people in Singapore  have  no

obligations  to pay out this sum of  money  because

the  people of Singapore were not able to know  the

detailed  results of the voting in  each  electoral

division  except  the  P.A.P.  In  view  of   this,

therefore, the Government have no reason to ask the

people  to  defray this amount of expenditure.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, that is why I think this sum of money

should not be approved by this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 50 be

reduced by the whole sum ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. This amendment has already

been moved by the Member for Choa Chu Kang. But the

Member for Upper Serangoon can, of course, speak.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 283</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

deem  it necessary to add to what my colleague  has

said just now. This is a question of principle.  No

matter  what  amount  of money  was  spent  on  the

National Referendum, it should not be paid  by  the

people  in  Singapore, because in the 51  electoral

divisions,  how many people voted for  proposal  A,

how  many  people voted for proposal  B,  how  many

people  voted for proposal C, how many people  cast

blank votes, how many spoilt votes were there,  and

how  many  people did not turn up  at  the  polling

stations? All this information about the voting was

turned  into a political secret by the  P.A.P. and

was known only to the P.A.P. Therefore, this amount

of  money should be defrayed by the P.A.P. and  not

paid  by the taxpayers because the Members in  this

House are all elected by the people. Therefore,  if

the  expenses were to be borne by the people,  then

the   representatives  in  this  House  should   be

entitled to know the results of the referendum. But

we  are  not  able to know the detailed results  of

each  electoral  division, and if the  P.A.P. kept

this  information as their political  secret,  then

they should pay for it.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that if they want to buy political

secrets,  they  have to pay more.  Therefore,  they

should pay a sum which doubles this amount if  they

want to buy political secrets. We are not objecting

to  their buying these political secrets.  So  they

have to pay for this and not ask the people to  pay

for  it. The crux of the problem is not whether the

amount  is  great or small but whether or  not  the

result  of the referendum should be made  known  to

the people. Therefore, the people in Singapore have

no obligation to pay for this amount of money.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, you will

have  doubtless noted that when the Member for Choa

Chu Kang rose to speak against this particular Head

in  the Supplementary Estimates, his arguments were

completely  political  in  nature.  There  was   no

discussion of financial or economic merits of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 284</b></font><br><br>



item  of  expenditure. Since he chose to raise  his

objections on purely political grounds. I feel that

in  defence  of the Supplementary Estimates  before

the  House I must meet him on the same grounds. And

so I crave your indulgence, Mr Speaker, Sir, if  I

should ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It is, of course, perfectly

in  order for any hon. Member to attack an item  on

political  grounds.  The  Minister  can  reply   on

similar lines, of course.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, I do not dispute that,

Mr  Speaker, Sir. But it does occur to me that  in

the  course of my rebuttal, I may have to  go  over

very  tedious arguments which have been  belaboured

in   this   House  so  often  and  much   to   your

discomfiture and perhaps tedium. So in advance, Mr

Speaker, Sir, I do crave your indulgence if I  have

to ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Make a two-hour

speech?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> One hour really. Sir, the

Member  for  Choa  Chu Kang said that  the  1st  of

September  last  year was really  a  dark  day  for

democracy  and that, in fact, he saw the referendum

was an exercise of such evil dimensions that it was

a  very gloomy day for democracy. Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  cannot  at all subscribe to this sentiment.  Far

from  1st September being a dark day for democracy,

it  was the brightest day, it was the turning point

for  democracy in Singapore, for it was on that day

that   the  Communists,  pro-Communists  and  their

sympathisers    working   in   the    open    front

organisations were completely exposed. Until  then,

they  had  tried to build a myth of invincibility

- that  they  control the masses, that they  control

the  trade  unions, and that anybody who  stood  up

against them would be destroyed politically through

the  democratic processes. But eventually when they

take over the organs of State, the destruction will

be   more   than  just  a  question  of   electoral

constitutions; it will be physical elimination  and

liquidation.  That was the fear, Mr Speaker,  Sir,

that   they   would   spread  through   all   their

multifarious open front organisations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font><br><br>



from the time they broke away from the P.A.P.

in  May 1961. These are the weak men who themselves

were  for  the most part not believers in  Marxism-Leninism  as a revolutionary philosophy;  but  when

the  parting  of ways took place between  the  non-Communist   socialists  in  the  P.A.P. and   the

Communists and pro-Communists in the P.A.P.,  these

men  and women were made of straw. Subjected  to  a

tremendous  amount of persuasion and  intimidation,

they  decided  to "play with the Communists".  That

was the only reason why they weakened and went over

to  the  other  side, thinking that, with  all  the

panoply  of open front organisations which we  have

allowed the Communists to organise, it was  only  a

matter  of  time  when they could seize  power  and

break us up. And we took up this challenge, and  on

1st September last year the battle was joined. What

was   the   result?  We  allowed   them   all   the

constitutional  freedoms - they could  have  all  the

mass  meetings  provided they  observed  the  laws,

which  they  did. I must pay them  a  tribute,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  The  mass  meetings  were  held  in

accordance  with  the conditions  of  the  licences

stated  for the conduct of such mass meetings,  and

they  thought that they were winning. And  this  is

the  curious thing - almost to the end the Communists

and  their  running  dogs in the  Barisan  Sosialis

believed that they were going to win. Never for one

moment, until perhaps a day before polling day, did

they  entertain any doubt at all as to the  outcome

of the referendum; so certain were they!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, why were they routed? Why was there

such a tremendous defeat for these people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if you will bear with me for a moment, I

will try to analyse the position. As I said, I have

got  to go back to basic historical processes  when

the  Communists broke with us. Their No. 1  mistake

was  to  break with the P.A.P. on a national issue.

We  said that we wanted merger with Malaya and that

we  were  in  favour  of Malaysia,  as  indeed  all

genuine  nationalists in this country must support.

They   oppose  `merger  and  Malaysia  for  obvious

reasons which have been explained adnauseam



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font><br><br>



in  this  House. They  oppose  merger  and

Malaysia  simply because after merger and  Malaysia

the  Internal Security Council will be in the hands

of  the  Federation  Government  who  have  a  less

delicate  regard  for constitutional  niceties  and

rights that can be afforded to Communists and their

fellow-travellers. The Federation  Government  have

got clear views on them. We, on the other hand, say

we  will  always give them an opportunity  for  the

legal  open  confrontation so long as they  observe

the laws and the constitution of the country. But I

am afraid opinion in Kuala Lumpur differs from ours

on  that  point. Therefore, because they feel  that

after  merger and Malaysia they will be conscribed,

they   oppose  it  purely  for  their  own  selfish

political  interests. That is  their  No.  1  error

which led to their defeat on 1st September.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their No. 2 mistake, which combined with their

No. 1 mistake proved fatal, was that they said they

wanted  more  merger  than the P.A.P.  They  wanted

complete merger. Therefore, since we wanted  merger

on  special terms and they wanted complete  merger,

the  issue  that had to be posed in this referendum

was  not  whether you wanted merger or you did  not

want  merger, but what type of merger did you want.

Our  type  of  merger was Alternative  A;  complete

merger Alternative B; or the Borneo/Sarawak type of

merger  Alternative C. Those were the three  honest

issues that were posed to the electorate for  their

choice.  I do not want to go through the merits  of

each  of the three alternative choices; but suffice

it to say, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the electorate of

Singapore listened to all points of view. We  never

stopped the Barisan from having mass meetings. They

were completely free to disseminate their views any

time  they  liked, in any way they liked,  provided

they  observed the law. And they went pretty  close

to  the  brink.  For  instance, carrying  out  this

phoney Gallup Poll in Tanjong Pagar and Kreta Ayer - strictly speaking, according to the Municipal  bye-laws  and  a  few local laws, these exercises  were

illegal.  But we said. "Well, it does not  matter."

They wanted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font><br><br>



radio time and we offered them radio time. We wrote

to them, "Please come to Radio Singapore and let us

discuss  matters in a human and adult manner."  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I am sad to relate that after  about

ten days of the open confrontation before the radio

microphone,  the  Barisan  decided  that  they  had

enough  of  it  and would not appear  before  Radio

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people knew exactly what was fought for, Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  No  amount of sophistry,  of  half-cooked  Marxism-Leninism or  what-have-you  on  the

other  side  can deceive the people that  the  best

interest  in the near future is to have  a  limited

conditional  form of merger whereby Singapore  will

have a considerable measure of local autonomy.  And

because the Barisan were foolish enough to  try  to

outbid  the P.A.P. in wanting more merger  than  we

did,  they failed in the result because the  people

of  Singapore at the present moment are prepared to

go  only so far and no further in a merger with the

Federation of Malaya. The Barisan Sosialis  thought

that  complete merger was out of the  question.  In

fact, Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may let the House into

the  secret for the first time as to the reason why

the Barisan Sosialis tried to outbid the P.A.P. in

demanding  complete merger. Mr  James  Puthucheary

was  an  old colleague of ours. In 1959 we unlocked

the  gates  of  Changi Gaol and  released  him  and

placed  him  in a position of responsibility.  When

the fight between the P.A.P. and the pro-Communists

developed  into  a crisis, I could  see  Mr  James

Puthucheary -  he    was    working     in     my

Ministry - weakening from day to day.  Eventually  he

told me that he was going over to the other side as

he  found his position as a supporter of the P.A.P.

intolerable. And he said they were going  to  wreck

merger, "This is absolutely on the cards."  I  said

to  him,  "James, why do you say so?" Then  he  did

some  calculations on a piece of  paper.  He  said,

"There are 105 seats in the Federal Parliament. The

Alliance has 60 votes; the Opposition has 40 votes;

a  margin of 20. If Singapore were to go in on full

merger, Singapore would get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font><br><br>



anything  between 20 and 25 votes, the majority  of

which  would  be  anti-Alliance  votes.  Therefore,

under   no   circumstances  will   the   Federation

Government  contemplate complete merger."  Complete

merger,     of    course,    means    proportionate

representation. Therefore, he said, "We  are  going

to outbid you, and that will put you in a fix."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the No. 1 reason. I do not know if that

was the No. 1 or No. 2 reason - the strategist  in

the  Barisan  Sosialis who led them up  the  garden

path.  It was absolutely a basic error in political

strategy. If at that time in May or June 1961  they

had   said,   "Nonsense  with  merger.   Absolutely

nothing.  We  want an independent  Singapore,  come

what  may",  then, Mr Speaker, Sir, if  we  had  a

referendum,  the choice must be either merger  with

the   Federation   on  those  terms   or   complete

independence. And if the alternative posed  in  the

referendum was either merger with the Federation or

complete  independence  for Singapore,  the  result

could  have been one way or the other. But given  a

choice  of  limited  and  conditional  merger,  and

complete  merger, we had no doubt at all  what  the

result  would be - a shattering defeat for the  pro-Communists who on that occasion were trying  to  be

too clever.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, although we had no doubt as to the

outcome,  we  took the precaution of ensuring  that

the  electorate  understood all  the  basic  issues

involved in the referendum. The Barisan accused  us

of using the radio to put forward these views. What

is  so wrong about it? What is the radio for but to

explain  to  the people the nature of the  decisive

choice which they had to make on 1st September?  It

was  quite  proper. We had to do  it.  We  have  no

apologies  at  all. We are not at all ashamed.  In.

fact,  we are very proud and we are very glad  that

they  found  out how the use of the  radio  was  so

effective.  That is why we have advanced  the  time

for  starting Television. It is going  to  be  even

more  effective - not  only sound,  but  audio-visual

aids!



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we do not really enjoy tormenting the young men and women on the other side, but I think it is about time they listened to a few home-truths, having wandered, like the lost tribes, through the desert and not being able to come out. Now, Sir, not oily did we use the radio

but  we  made sure - after all, not every  family  in

Singapore owns a radio set - that there had to  be  a

face-to-face explanation. The Member for  Choa  Chu

Kang  complained about the use of police  cars.  We

used  police  cars simply because - I have  forgotten

the exact number; I think there were about eight or

nine police cars - we could commandeer them at  the

time  for  use  to explain to the people,  face  to

face. We told them what this was all about. We used

police  cars because some of them have loud-speaker

equipment. If the Barisan Sosialis think  that  the

whole  of  our field propaganda outfit consists  of

police  cars, they are absolutely wrong. The police

cars amounted to more than 10 per cent of the loud-speaker vehicles which we sent out. We sent out  75

such vehicles equipped with radio, loud-speaker and

tape-recorder. On the average, each of these  teams

carried  out between 30 and 50 �-hour meetings  per

day,   bringing  a  total,  during  the  referendum

period,   of  between  6,000  and  8,000   meetings

throughout  the  towns, streets and  villages.  Let

them not believe that this is just a matter of half

a  dozen  police  cars. We arranged the  referendum

publicity  campaign with all the  thoroughness  and

energy  that we could command. There is  absolutely

no apology for what we did.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the broadcasting of Fullerton Square

speeches.  What is wrong with that? I do  not  know

why  they  even  raised that subject.  But  on  the

fourth point which they raised, that is, the result

of  the  referendum was not known to  the  Barisan.

Sosialis,  they complained, saying, "You must  know

what the results are."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the referendum was conducted on the 1st of September. I thought the result was published on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 290</b></font><br><br>



2nd  of  September last year. I am  surprised  that

they  do  not know the result. The result was  that

they had a hell of a whacking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Not by constituency.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Ah, they want to know the

result  constituency by constituency. I would  have

thought that for their peace of mind, it is  better

that  they  do  not know. To these  two  particular

Assemblymen,  for their own peace of mind,  I  say,

the  less said, the better. They want to know!  Why

should  they know? The law does not say  that  they

must  know. No referendum results in any democratic

country,  or even in any undemocratic country,  are

published  constituency by constituency.  You  will

remember,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, we went  through  all

this   in  Select  Committee.  We  challenged   the

representors  in Select Committee  to  produce  any

precedent,  and they were completely unable  to  do

so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Upper Serangoon said that the

P.A.P. know the result and that therefore we should

pay for it. This really brings into the proceedings

of this Assembly a somewhat mercenary element which

we  do not quite like. But I say to the Member  for

Upper Serangoon, whether or not the Barisan want to

pay  for  it,  they will still not  know  what  the

detailed results are. There is absolutely no reason

why  they should know. In fact, for their own peace

of mind, it is better that they should not know.

<br><br>3.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, to continue

with  my  speech  where  I left  off  yesterday  in

connection with the motion in the name of the Prime

Minister  expressing our thanks  to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara.

I was speaking of the awakening  on

the  part  of the Government to expect co-operation

and  support of all political leaders and community

leaders.  However, from the practices  employed  by

the  Government, I can say that they still consider

the  Opposition  Members as a  group  which  cannot

extend  their co-operation in the interest  of  the

people  of  Singapore. I say as a  Member  of  this

Assembly,  as  an  elected  representative  of  the

people, that it is accepted in the Constitution  of

this State that each representative represents  his

respective constituency irrespective of whether the

constituents voted for him or not. However, in  the

light of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font><br><br>



tactics adopted by the Government, it does not even

consider    such   representatives    as    elected

representatives, let alone extend respect to  them.

For instance, I am unable to understand the concept

of the P.A.P. democracy when, as the representative

of the Southern Islands, I was not consulted on the

occasion of the visit of the Head of State  to  the

Southern  Islands. I feel that it should have  been

proper  on  the  part  of the  Government  to  have

consulted me.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister will visit

the  rural  constituencies throughout Singapore.  I

understand  the  Prime  Minister  has  visited  the

Kampong    Kembangan   constituency    where    the

representative is my colleague. I was informed that

the  `Member for Kampong Kembangan was only invited

to  participate  just  for  name's  sake  only.   I

understand that the Prime Minister will be visiting

my  constituency - the Southern Islands - either on the

21st  or  the  28th.  This  came  to  my  knowledge

unofficially. Meetings were conducted by the  heads

of  the Islands to prepare for the Prime Minister's

visit.  At  these meetings, the question was  asked

why  the  Member for the Southern Islands was  left

out at the meetings to discuss the Prime Minister's

visit.  The Government's reply was that the  object

of  the proposed visit is for the Prime Minister to

know the extent of the difficulties encountered  by

the people in this constituency. The question which

I  have  posed,  Mr Speaker, is not  motivated  by

sheer jealousy for fear of loss of my constituency,

but it was motivated more by our attempt to achieve

a democratic society. I think the time When we have

different views on political ideologies was  during

election time. It is up to the people to make their

choice according to the Constitution. In accordance

with  the practice of parliamentary democracy,  the

candidate  who  gets  the most  votes  is  elected.

Surely  the  intention  is not  to  carry  on  this

ideological  battle  continuously.  We  should  not

engage in activities which will confuse the people.

If  we are sincere and are dedicated to the service

of  the  people, we should not have any  qualms  or

fear as to whether we may or may not be elected  at

the next



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font><br><br>



election.   That  is  the  accepted   practice   of

parliamentary   democracy.  We   will   have   more

responsibilities to shoulder in the next 4� months.

If this practice based on party ideology is carried

on,  as  expressed by the Member for Geylang Serai,

there  is bound to be that feeling of provincialism

when  Malaysia  is achieved. This will  lead  to  a

state   of   affairs  which  no  one   wishes.   As

unanimously  agreed, we should set  an  example  to

fulfil our duties to our people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I further wish to touch upon the Communist activities as mentioned in the speech delivered by His Excellency. We must be ready to face any eventuality which may be posed by the Communist threat in future. It is appropriate that we should shoulder this responsibility. We cannot face this responsibility all by ourselves. When we

realise the manoeuvres of our enemies arc to  wreck

our hopes, we should not' hesitate and be afraid to

take positive steps which we are certain will bring

prosperity  and security to our State.  As  I  have

said  in  this  House on a number of occasions,  we

have  shown  the  dangers and  yet  the  Government

fights shy of taking action, or is passing the buck

to the others to take action - I cannot say which. If

the  P.A.P. Government, which is non-Communist,  is

shy to declare openly that it is anti-Communist but

sincerely  believes  that the  Communists  have  no

sympathy towards humanity and are constantly taking

destructive  action, I hope it will  really  behave

like  non-Communists. I hope it will not  keep,  in

its  midst pro-Communist elements who are still  at

large  in Singapore. Mr Speaker, this matter  will

be  mentioned again in the next motion.  I  do  not

intend now to make a lengthy speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the amendment moved by the Member for

Queenstown  wherein he expresses  his  regrets,  it

seems  to  me  that  he is not satisfied  with  the

decision taken by the people at the referendum held

on  1st September last year. I realised that it  is

difficult  to  satisfy people like the  Member  for

Queenstown  who cannot accept the decision  of  the

people.  The call for honest general elections  can

be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font><br><br>



set aside so that we will not be bothered by that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the future policy of the Government, I

would  like to mention the treatment given  by  the

Government  for equal opportunities.  I  think  the

Malays  in  Singapore are ready to live in  harmony

with  the  other communities, but the  Government's

hope  to establish an egalitarian society will  not

be  achieved. I respect the P.A.P. Government  with

its  socialistic policies. But it has been stressed

in the Constitution, as mentioned by the Member for

Geylang Serai, that it should be the responsibility

of  any government to promote the interests of  the

Malays in all spheres. The object of including this

clause  in  the Preamble is not because the  Malays

want  to  supersede the other races. It  is  but  a

request  for the non-Malays to consider the special

position  of  the  indigenous people  so  that  the

Malays will not be treated like the Red Indians  in

America and the Maoris in New Zealand. What harm is

there in the Government helping the Malays to  lift

up  their standard of living irrespective of  their

political  beliefs?  I have to  mention  this,  Mr

Speaker, because this has been misrepresented as  a

result  of  different political beliefs. There  are

political Parties who are afraid to implement  this

clause in the Preamble. For instance, if there  are

non-Malay leaders, such leaders are not prepared to

put forward a scheme for the Malays because the

non-Malays will not support their political Parties  in

future.  If  there are Malays voicing  the  special

position  of  the  Malays,  those  Malays  will  be

accused  of indulging in communalism. Mr  Speaker,

the  awakening of the Malays to survive and to live

has   been  proved  by  their  acceptance  of   the

Constitution. If they are hard pressed and there is

no   change  in  their  status-for  instance,   the

provision  of flats. The Malays are not  accustomed

to  living in flats. If it is within the  means  of

the Malays to live in flats, there is no doubt that

they will be prepared to live in them. On the other

hand, if he is a fisherman or a hawker



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font><br><br>



earning $2 or $3 a day, surely he cannot afford  to

live  in  and pay a rental for a flat. The  Housing

and Development Board expect that rentals for flats

must  be paid promptly, otherwise the tenants  will

be evicted. This aspect must be considered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know the environments here are pleasant, but

in  the  Southern Islands there is really  a  sorry

state  of  affairs,  to  the extent  that  talented

children, who are keen to further their studies and

who  have passed their examinations, cannot  go  to

secondary  school  because  their  parents   cannot

afford   to  send  them  to  secondary  school   in

Singapore.  In the circumstances, the parents  have

no  alternative  but  to stop their  children  from

attending secondary school in Singapore. I have  on

many  occasions pressed the Government to  build  a

secondary  school in the Southern Islands  for  the

benefit  of  the children there. Unfortunately,  my

request  has not been considered by the Government.

I  do  not know if it is because they consider  the

request as coming from a non-P.A.P. member. I  have

made  arrangements  for  those  children  attending

primary school to live on the mainland. I hear  the

officials  of the Ministry are not very happy  with

my  action because they consider it is a reflection

on the Government. In all sincerity, Mr Speaker, I

am prepared to assist these unfortunate children in

any  way  I  can  to make available facilities  for

their  further education. For instance, the  school

at  Blakang  Mati. In 1961 I raised this  question.

The Minister for Education himself, when

asked when

the  school at Blakang Mati was going to be put up,

replied  that it would be in 1961. But  it  is  not

until 1963 that the school is put up. This is  also

to coincide with the forthcoming visit of the Prime

Minister  to  the Southern Islands. Similarly,  the

jetty   at  Sekijang  Pelepah.  Because  the  Prime

Minister will be visiting that island, work is  now

in hand to repair the jetty. The school at Sekijang

Pelepah,  which was built when the Member for  Hong

Lim was the then Minister for National Development,

is  being  left  haunted. These are  all  political

manoeuvres  and  there is no sincere  intention  to

bring facilities



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font><br><br>



to  the  Southern Islands. We should  not  continue

with  these  practices  as  political  leaders;  we

should forget political affiliations when we fulfil

our  obligations towards the people. We should  not

allow  the  people to be made use of  as  political

pawns.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of .the Economic Development

Board   which  is  responsible  for  the   economic

development  of  Singapore, many  sites  have  been

prepared for industrial growth. One of the  islands

affected is Pulau Ayer Limau.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Deputy SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>4.11 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I learnt that from the newspapers and I immediately wrote to the Board about the plight of the people. Only when I wrote to the Board were they willing to communicate with me, and, of course, they were prepared to co-operate with me as an elected representative of the people. My assistance was sought on how to resettle

the  affected families because the island was going

to  be  used  as  a harbour. In our  endeavours  to

industrialise, I bad hoped that the Malays who have

to   be  resettled  on  Pulau  Semulut  would  also

benefit. I had also hoped that this would pave  the

way for them to be in gainful employment. Hitherto,

they  are  engaged in fishing. The  setting  up  of

factories  in the vicinity will, it is hoped,  mean

more  employment  for  the islanders.  However,  it

appears  that the islanders are still  waiting  for

the  setting up of factories and I feel  guilty  as

though  I  have  deceived them. When  I  got  their

consent  to shift them from Pulau Semulut to  Pulau

Ayer  Limau,  I  gave them an assurance  that  they

would   be  considered  for  employment  when   the

factories  are set up. They are still  waiting  and

there  is  not a single factory that has  issued  a

notice  to  the islanders asking whether  they  are

prepared to work in the factories. Very few  people

indeed  have  got employment. The Board  has  never

recruited  any hands from the islands. I fear  that

the affected places concern only the Malays - for

instance, Pulau Semulut or Tanjong Kling - who will

be resettled elsewhere.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 298</b></font><br><br>



If there is an intention to get these people

to  live in flats, and if they are unemployed,  how

can we expect them to do so unless, of course, they

are in steady employment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the case of Pulau Bukom. We

are  happy  to  see the industrial growth  in  that

island  because  this  will mean  more  employment.

However,   Sir,  this  growth  is   only   in   its

preliminary  stage.  At  Pulau  Bukom,  the   Shell

Company  has  asked its employees to  vacate  their

houses  and find alternative accommodation  on  the

mainland  of  Singapore.  This  again  affects  the

Malays because the number of Malays living in Pulau

Bukom is great. I hope the Government will not  sit

tight  and  watch  the Company  taking  such  steps

without    first   making   available   alternative

accommodation for its employees. We do  nut  object

to  the Company enlarging its sectors, but it  must

ensure  that  its  employees will  not  be  put  to

hardship.  Then  again  the question  of  employees

being dismissed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not intend to dwell at length on this

matter, Mr Deputy Speaker, but what I really  wish

to  convey  is  the  position of  the  Malays.  The

position  of the Malays has not received attention.

Although  it has been mentioned that the Government

has provided free textbooks and free schooling,  it

is  still  found that the agents of  Government  or

Government  officials do not give consideration  to

the  special position of the Malays. For  instance,

on   the   subject  of  circulars  from  Ministries

regarding the provision of textbooks, some teachers

have failed to notify the students of this facility

for  the  reason that if they do so it  means  more

work  for  them. Such circulars which the  teachers

receive  from the Ministry are not relayed  to  the

students. For instance, if certain forms issued  by

the  Ministry  are  in  the English  language,  the

parents  cannot understand these forms. So time  is

wasted  in their translation. The excuse  given  by

the  teachers  is  that the applications  submitted

cannot be considered as they are too late. This  is

the  method  employed by the Ministry. I  think  it

must be rectified. It is a slow process to build  a

just and equal society.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.22 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng (Mountbatten):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, Hansard Vol. 20, No. 1 is supposed to

contain the Government's policy speech delivered by

the   Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara.  I  challenge   the

Government  to  submit this speech to Parliamentary

experts  and seek their opinion as to whether  this

is the policy speech of the Government for 1963,  a

speech which is customary for the Head of State  to

deliver  at  the  opening  of  a  new  Session   of

Parliament or the Legislative Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this speech is nothing but an election

campaign speech spreading P.A.P. propaganda. It  is

a   catalogue   listing  the  P.A.P.'s  self-styled

achievements in the greatest detail possible.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> It is not a policy speech.

It  does  not  give  any idea of  what  policy  the

Government intend to follow this year. It gives  no

suggestion at all ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam:</b> Bankrupt.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> --- of the legislation

Government intend to introduce or amend, the social

services Government intend to provide, Government's

attitude   and  plans  with  regard   to   national

employment, security, labour, trade union,  and  so

on.  In  fact,  it  tells  us  nothing:  absolutely

nothing.  Compare  this  with  the  policy   speech

delivered by the Head of State of the Federation of

Malaya  on 26th April last year. Sir, if  you  will

look  at  Hansard Vol. IV, No. 1 of the Federation,

at col. 27, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As Members of both Houses of Parliament you are

here today, as you have been in past years, to hear

the important aspects of my Government's policy  so

that  you may deliberate on these and through  this

gain   acceptance  in  both  Houses   during   this

session.'



<br><br>Later, he goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I propose rather to survey the broad lines of

policy my Government intends to follow during  this

year. In doing so I believe that you will obtain  a

most  valuable and useful picture of the  thinking,

planning and priority which my Government considers

to   be  most  beneficent  and  productive  in  the

national interests and well-being of my country and

my people.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 300</b></font><br><br>



That  is  exactly what everybody expects out  of  a

policy speech. Do we find that in our Hansard  Vol.

20,  No.  1, Sir? Nothing of the sort. We are  told

nothing at all. And not only is the Opposition kept

in   the   dark  concerning  new  legislation   and

amendments  until  these are introduced,  but  when

they  are introduced, they are often introduced  on

Certificates  of Urgency and rushed  through.  Sir,

not   satisfied   with  using  public   funds   and

Government  machinery to promote P.A.P. propaganda,

they now insult the esteemed office of the Head  of

State   by  turning  him  into  a  mouthpiece   and

publicity  agent  for  the Party.  They  abuse  the

privilege and dignity of this Chamber by  using  it

as a ground for election ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Point of order. Sir, I think

it would be less embarrassing all round if the Lady

for  Mountbatten could confine herself to what  has

been  published. I think no reference has ever been

made  to  the Yang di-Pertuan Negara. He fulfils  a

constitutional role and what he has  read  out  has

been  published by the Government. I think it would

be  preferable  if  she makes no reference  to  him

whatsoever.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> So far the hon. Member for

Mountbatten  has  not attacked the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara personally.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Thank you, Sir. May I say

that  I  have  no  intention at all  whatsoever  to

attack the Yang di-Pertuan Negara? My attack is  on

the  Government  for  drawing up  that  speech  and

making him deliver it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one just has to read the speeches of the

Yang  di-Pertuan  Agong  and  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara - of  course, it is a Government  speech;  and

again  I  repeat  it  is not  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's  speech - and one will see very clearly  the

reasons   why  the  Alliance  Government   in   the

Federation  is  such a success  compared  with  the

failures  of  the P.A.P. Government  in  Singapore,

which is only one mile away.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Ha, ha!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> The Causeway is about one

mile long, Sir.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The Head is in Kuala Lumpur.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> He is the Yang di-Pertuan

Agong  of  the  whole  of the Federation,  Sir;  of

Johore  as  well, which is only one mile away  from

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When reading the Hansard of the Federation, one

cannot   help   but  realise  that   the   Alliance

Government  is  humble,  courteous  and   full   of

gratitude and consideration for others. Immediately

after  the  formal salutary remarks, the  Yang

di-Pertuan Agong said, at col. 27:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Speaking in a spirit of profound reverence and

humility  I  should first offer on  behalf  of  the

whole nation our heart-felt thanks to Almighty  God

for the peace, happiness and progress which we have

enjoyed  in  the  past  year.  May  we,  under  His

protection and benevolence, continue to have  these

blessings,  so  that we may carry  out  our  duties

honourably  and  well,  conscious  always  of   our

responsibilities both to God and to our fellowmen.'



<br><br>Later, Sir, in col. 40, he said -



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. After listening to the

hon.  Member for Mountbatten so far, I am wondering

whether we are debating the Yang di-Pertuan Agong's

speech or the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech.  She

is   quoting   the   Hansard  of   the   Federation

Parliament.  Of course, she can quote the  contents

in  passing,  but  if she is going  too  much  into

details,  we  will be debating the Yang  di-Pertuan

Agong's  speech  instead  of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's speech.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, I am just pointing out

what  is  missing  in the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

speech-things which should have been in, and rather

than  give  my own opinion, there is no better  way

than to quote examples of what should have been  in

it,  from  other speeches of Heads of State.  As  I

said,  in col. 40, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong  gives

credit to the civil servants. And he says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I would like to take this opportunity, which I

am  sure  all Members of both Houses of  Parliament

will  wish to share with me, to pay a warm  tribute

to  their devotion to duty and to their service  to

the community during our years of independence.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font><br><br>



Everyone,  Sir,  even  the abstract  God,  receives

thanks  where  thanks are deserved. The  Federation

Government even took the opportunity to record its

gratitude  to  countries  and  organisations   that

extended to it hospitality and aid and to show  its

appreciation and the importance of the co-operation

of  the people. I have mentioned all this, Sir,  to

show  that all these human relations are very, very

important  and if only our Government - the  P.A.P.

Government  in  Singapore - would practise  little

appreciation of human relations like that, and when

they  have a public opportunity like that, to thank

publicly the people who have given aid, hospitality

and  the  like; also the civil servants,  who  have

given their services; the Government would get much

better results and a better feeling internationally

and locally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Election speech.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, I am not hoping that

the   United  Nations  or  other  governments   and

international bodies would give me their vote  when

I ask the Government to thank them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even the Opposition is not discriminated

against  in  the  Federation. The  Yang  di-Pertuan

Agong  even  mentioned them as part  of  the  whole

Parliament  when he gave credit to the  Parliament,

and  when he said that the people looked up to them

as  their  leaders  and  their  representatives   be

included everyone in the House. Even the Opposition

was  mentioned  and their role was  recognised  and

respected by the Head of State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, compare it, Sir, with this, our Hansard,

which the Government was very anxious that I should

come  to and leave the Federation Hansard. I  shall

leave the Federation Hansard for the time being and

come  to  the Singapore one. Compare this with  the

egoistic,  selfish and arrogant atmosphere  of  the

P.A.P. policy  speech which was delivered  by  the

Head  of  State  here. `The P.A.P. claims  all  the

credit  for  all  the achievements that  they  have

catalogued in the so-called policy speech.  No  one

else  deserves any mention or credit,  neither  God

nor  man, not even the civil servants without  whom

no P.A.P. projects could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font><br><br>



have  been  implemented - none of them  received

any  mention  or thanks in the Speech. Neither  the

U.N. nor    international   organisations    and

governments  who, as I have pointed out  just  now,

are not going to give me any of their vote, and who

have  rendered  aid, service arid hospitality,  not

even  the  electorate who have voted them to  power

have deserved any mention. To the P.A.P. - I think

this  is a well-known fact - the whole world is  a

P.A.P. world  and no one, as I have said,  neither

God  nor  man matters. They live, they  work,  they

strive  - they  work very hard,  I  give  them  that

credit,  Sir.  After blaming them  for  not  giving

credit  where credit is due, I give them the credit

of  working  very hard. They work very  hard,  they

strive very hard not for the people of the State of

Singapore but for the P.A.P. and the P.A.P. alone.

Development projects have been imp1emented with one

eye on the next election and the other eye on their

present  seats  in  this Chamber. Consequently,  no

eyes are left for the welfare of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Sir, in the housing project, you

will see in Hansard, Volume 13, No. 2, 1960, column

82,  it  was only after I had exposed to the public

that  the  Government had only built 124 houses  as

against  6,734 built during the first year  of  the

previous Government, that they started to  wake  up

and  started  building. They were  then  complacent

about public needs because they were over-confident

of  their  power and their overwhelming victory  in

the last elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, now that they have to fight for their

survival because of the splits in their Party, they

are  pushing  ahead, building houses  in  order  to

catch votes, ignoring the vital social consequences

of  their planning. For example, Sir, may I ask the

Government  whether they have taken the trouh1e  to

find  out - for instance in the case of  a  squatter

who  has  been  forced by fire, or some  inevitable

factor like slum clearance, to seek a Housing Board

flat  -  this squatter with a househo1d  of  twenty

persons, who used to pay $2 or $3 assessment probably,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font><br><br>



when he moves into a fiat, let us say, if he

takes a one-room flat and pays about $25; only four

or  five  persons can stay in that flat? Therefore,

he  has  to rent about four or five flats  for  his

entire household, bringing his expenditure on  rent

to  about  $100 a month. Have the Government  taken

the   trouble  to  find  out  whether  this   extra

expenditure - such a great difference,  Sir,  $100

as  compared to the previous $2 or $3 - whether  this

extra  expenditure  incurred  in  paying  rent  and

public  utilities  has caused increased  crime  and

delinquency?  Whether people have  to  go  out  and

steal to make enough money to feed their family? Or

whether   the   need  for  extra  money   and   the

opportunities  made available by  the  new  housing

provision have led to the economic independence  of

the   women?   The  necessity  to  work   and   the

opportunities available might have made  the  women

go  out and work. Therefore, it is a good thing and

Government  should encourage this.  Has  Government

taken the trouble to see the social consequences of

its  housing  project? How and to what  extent  the

modern  provision of housing affects  and  disturbs

the  patterns of family and community life? Whether

modern housing patterns promote racial harmony?  Or

do   they  have  the  opposite  effect  of  causing

friction  among people of different races, beliefs,

customs  and  creeds? And what role Government  can

play  to  help  minimise if not eradicate  entirely

these frictions?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have heard the Member for Geylang Serai

mention,  Sir, that if blocks of flats are  offered

to  Malays, he feels that they would accept  blocks

of  flats. Well, it is up to the Government to find

out whether it is good in the long run to segregate

them  for temporary peace, or whether it is  better

for  the  Government to try and  promote  tolerance

among them. All this is very, very important. I  am

asking  the Government to say whether all this  has

been  thrashed  out, debated, and the  opinions  of

experts  and  those  interested  and  the  families

themselves  sought; whether a survey or a  research

has  been  made to find out the true situation,  to

avoid  racial friction and, what is more important,

to  promote  racial tolerance; to discover  whether

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font><br><br>



breaking  up of large households into small  family

units  have  improved family ties among members  of

the  families  and the different  families  in  the

household.  This is as important as racial  harmony

- this  family  harmony - because where there  is  not

this harmony in the family, it is a breeding ground

for juvenile delinquency. Do the Government know to

what  extent modern sanitation and health and other

facilities have benefited the people?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will agree with me that misuse of those

facilities can in time - probably 20 years, 15 years,

10  years - turn that housing estate into a slum. Has

Government  tried to find out whether  people  from

the  slums who come to a housing estate are  living

up to the standard expected in a housing estate, or

are  they bringing slum standards into the  housing

estate  and endangering or threatening to turn  the

whole  of  Singapore  into slums - the  more  housing

estates,   the  more  slums?  This  is   not   just

imagination,  Sir; it could happen and  to  prevent

this happening, we must find out -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Do not build houses!



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Oh, no, Sir. By no means,

the  solution is not in "Do not build houses," Sir.

If  you get indigestion, do you starve yourself  to

death?  No,  that is not the remedy.  If  you  have

indigestion,  you find some remedy which  will  get

rid of your indigestion. You do not starve yourself

to  death.  You  do  not say, do not  build  houses

because they are going to turn them into slums. You

have to prevent them from becoming slums.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> How?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Well, it is up to the

Government.  Sir,  when we form the  Government,  I

shall  tell  the  P.A.P. how?  And  if  they   are

interested, Sir, they can find out how even  before

we form the next government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, this is how! I hope they will take note of

this, and they will give some assistance. Two women

organisations in Singapore, the P.P.S.E.A.W.A.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font><br><br>



and the Wanita Singapura are jointly making a study

and survey in their own limited way - I admit it is a

very  limited  way - to find out the  real  state  of

affairs  in  these  mutters and to  see  how  women

organisations in Singapore can step in and help  to

minimise  any  adverse  consequences  that  may  be

revealed  by  the  survey.  If  the  Government  is

sincere  in  its efforts to raise the  standard  of

living  in  Singapore, they would take interest  in

finding  the answers to these questions and  assist

in  the  said  survey, although it is headed  by  a

Member of the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the P.A.P. Government is inclined to belittle

and mock all efforts except their own, I would like

to  quote  a little paragraph from page 35  of  the

Report  of the E.C.A.F.E. Seminar held in Singapore

last     December.    Talking    about    voluntary

organisations,   women  organisations   and   youth

organisations, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is only too easy to underestimate their value

in  relation to the size of the problem with  which

they  are  concerned, but the fact  that  they  are

concerned  and  that within their limitations  they

are    tackling   the   problem,   are   of   great

significance.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the Report of the United Nations, so I

hope  the Government will not belittle it too much.

If  they think that the effect of the survey is too

small,  they  can  come  and  help  make  it   more

effective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Geylang Serai mentioned the

housing development in Kampong Amber. I would  like

to  add this. No doubt compensation is paid to  the

squatters, but it is not sufficient to find them  a

new  home. It may not be advisable, and  I  am  not

here trying to suggest that the Government stop the

development - No! It may not be advisable  to  hinder

private   efforts  in  development,  because   such

efforts  do  help  to  ease  unemployment  and  the

housing  problem.  But  the poor  victims  of  such

development  must  not be allowed  to  suffer.  The

Government  must help them to get new  homes;  they

deserve  this  after giving up their own  homes  in

order that Singapore might be developed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, where labour is concerned, Sir, in column 20

of the same Hansard, that is, Volume 20, No. 1, the

Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font><br><br>



said they hoped to "build it modern industrial city

out of Singapore". May I remind them, Sir, that the

success of their industrialisation projects depends

on  labour  conditions in Singapore? If the  P.A.P.

and  the Barisan Sosialis continue to interfere  in

trade unions and compete in encouraging strikes  in

order to get the support of the trade unions,  then

no amount of effort to industrialise Singapore will

succeed.  In  the  end, who will  suffer?  Not  the

P.A.P.,  not  the Barisan, not even the capitalists

because  the capitalists have elsewhere  to  invest

their money besides Singapore. It is the worker who

will  lose  his job if this goes on.  Trade  unions

must   be  left  alone  and  not  be  coerced   and

intimidated  by  the  P.A.P. or  the  Barisan  into

supporting  them.  Psuedo advocates  of  unity  and

freedom for trade unions are now themselves causing

a  serious  split  in  the  trade  union  movement.

Everybody  knows,  Sir,  today  there  is  a  clear

demarcation  within  the trade  union  movement - one

side is the pro-P.A.P. trade unions, the other side

is  the pro-Barisan trade unions. Whenever you talk

about  a  strike, they ask which, P.A.P. or Barisan

trade  union?  They  even  call  them  "P.A.P."  or

"Barisan"  trade unions. I am sure  you  will  find

this very common in the streets and shops when you ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What about the S.P.A?



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, I think we can proudly

say  that we have not interfered with and  we  have

not used labourers to win an election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Women.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Not even women. When I say

"used",    Sir,    I    mean    used    to    their

disadvantage - exploited them.  Of  course,  all  our

campaigns  are  carried out by men and  women,  not

cats  and  dogs surely. What I mean  is,  we  never

exploit  them  like  the  P.A.P. and  the  Barisan

Sosialis  exploit  workers, causing  them  to  lose

their  jobs,  and who cares? "They can  lose  their

jobs; all the P.A.P. and the Barisan Sosialis  want

is their support." I warn them, Sir, they will not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font><br><br>



get their support when the workers lose their jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave it to the world to judge whether the

P.A.P. and the Barisan are true trade unionists  or

political  adventurers, whether they are the  great

statesmen  that they claim to be, or  whether  they

are  just power-mad politicians stabbing their  own

ex-comrades  in  the  back in  their  struggle  for

power, as each has accused the other of doing. I am

not  accusing them, Sir; I have heard them accusing

one  another, and I leave the world to judge  which

they are. It would be relevant here, Sir, for me to

quote  what  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  of   the

Federation  said  in  his  speech  to   the   Grand

Alliance. He said. "A politician thinks of the next

election;   a   statesman  thinks   of   the   next

generation."  Whether the P.A.P. and  the  Barisan

think  of  the next generation or the next election

is for the world to judge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, where finance is concerned, it is obvious to

anyone reading column 7 of Hansard, Volume 20,  No.

1,  that  the P.A.P. Finance Minister is a magician

who  just  has  to  wave his magic  wand,  and  hey

presto!  the  money  in  the Treasury  begets  more

money. But what is not so obvious, Sir, is that the

magic  wand  is  nothing but P.A.P. inactivity  for

almost  two years. No less than the Hon, the Deputy

Prime  Minister  himself admits  that  in  Hansard.

Volume 13, No. 6. Our Deputy Prime Minister said on

the 9th of August, 1960, in column 460:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The slowness - admittedly the Government was slow

in getting housing development to start - was due to

the  depletion of technical staff and  the  haywire

changes  in building plans. A total of 79

monthly-rated  staff  left the service of the  S.I.T.  They

were  dismissed, or they resigned, or they retired.

And  of  these  79, 22 were senior  officers,  five

being  heads of departments and five were heads  of

sections."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Deputy Prime Minister admitted the inactivity

in  housing  development and he also  accepted  the

responsibility in column 461 for the fact that "our

housing development programme has not got off to  a

fine  start". True, that was years ago!  But  there

were   two  years  of  inactivity,  and  the  money

reserved  for that development has accumulated  and

that  has formed the magic wand that has made money

beget money.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, I must give credit to the Minister

for Finance. I am prepared to respect his claim for

credit  for  having brought the  Treasury  to  this

wealthy  state.  We  all know  he  is  a  brilliant

Finance Minister and I give him credit. Although  I

did  say that the money has accumulated through two

years  of  inactivity, I do  give  him  credit  for

bringing  Singapore into such a  wealthy  state  as

they  claim  it  is now. Singapore is  now  wealthy

enough  to make, according to this Hansard,  Volume

20,   No.  1,  contributions  in  loans  and  other

assistance  to help develop the Borneo territories.

Do  you  not think, Sir, that it is only  fair  and

just that the Government should restore in full the

money  which  has been "illegally"  -  Sir,  I  say

"illegally" because not even a month's  notice  had

been  given - illegally taken from the pay  of  civil

servants  who  have given the best years  of  their

lives  in  loyally serving the State of  Singapore?

Now,  let  me make this very clear. I do  not  want

what  I  have said twisted to mean my objection  to

the   Government   giving  help   to   the   Borneo

territories. It is nothing of the sort. What  I  am

saying  is  this, I am appealing to the Government,

to  borrow  a phrase of the Prime Minister  of  the

Federation  when  he addressed the  Grand  Alliance

recently - this  is what he said - I am  appealing  to

them  to  "see the elephant in front of their  eyes

before  looking  for the needle across  the  seas."

Remedy this great injustice that they have done  to

civil  servants  before  attempting  to  extend   a

helping  hand to others across the seas.  It  is  a

very  good gesture to extend a helping hand:  I  am

all for it. I say let us remedy this home injustice

first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money is theirs by right, Sir. It was taken

away   from   them  because  of  the   Government's

miscalculation and lack of foresight. Had they  the

foresight to see the state of affairs we  would  be

in  today,  probably the civil servants' pay  would

not  have  been  cut. The money  is  still  in  the

Treasury, and it has helped to beget more money. It

should be returned to them in full now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No logical reason, Sir, can be given for

returning only part of that money. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font><br><br>



hear  someone say in jest, "... with interest". That

reminds me, the money has helped Government to gain

interest  on it, and the civil servants have  never

asked  for interest. They have just asked  for  the

money  that has been taken from them. They are  not

asking for interest; they are pretty generous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, could I end up with this? I say to the

P.A.P. Government: restore the pay cut in full  and

they  will get more goodwill and co-operation  from

the  civil  servants than all the  dinners  at  Sri

Tamasek. Thank you, Sir.



<br><br>4.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, regarding the

policy  of the Government as expressed by the  Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara  recently, I  am  glad  to  draw

attention  to  that part of the speech  wherein  he

says Singapore has weathered the storm and that all

is  now  calm and tranquil. But we must  always  be

vigilant  because there are still some elements  in

our  midst  who  are  actively  trying  to  disrupt

national  security  and  sabotage  our  plans   for

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am surprised that these anti-national elements are still against the establishment of Malaysia. Has the referendum not been held and has it not given a definite answer that the people of Singapore from all walks of life have decided how their future should be

established?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I must say in this Assembly, let this be a warning to all those anti-nationalist elements who wish to disrupt the unity of the Malaysian territories, because Malaysia is not for the Malays only, but also for the Chinese and for the peoples in the territories of Borneo

and  from  various races. Malaysia is non-communal,

as  has  been said by the Barisan Sosialis. If  the

Barisan Sosialis try to flare up the flame -  and

they  are trying very hard to do this - then I  say

it is possible this will mean loss of life and will

result   in  bloodshed.  There  have  been   enough

examples of this in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people in Malaysia who adhere to

foreign ideologies and who would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font><br><br>



stand  by  Djakarta.  We are  firm  in  our  stand.

Although  the  people who are the  leaders  of  our

neighbouring country, Indonesia, are people of  our

own   kind   and   they   are   against   Malaysia,

nevertheless we pay no heed to them at all  and  we

will proceed with Malaysia. So the Barisan Sosialis

should  be  aware of this and consider  the  matter

very,   very  carefully,  because  to  be   against

Malaysia  is  to be against a nationalist  movement

among  people  who have the same  outlook.  So,  if

there are still those elements within our midst who

adhere to foreign ideologies - it is possible  that

they in their dislike for Commonwealth troops would

prefer foreign troops - they should  not  dream

that  we will give them an opportunity to bring  in

foreign  troops, who are tinted red, to look  after

the  welfare  of these territories. I  myself.  Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, will defend  my  homeland  no

matter  what happens. I hope this warning  will  be

received  well by those parties concerned and  they

should not bring about communalism in an effort  to

bring about peace and harmony.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, we know the Assembly

would  not like the British and Commonwealth troops

to  be  in  Malaysia, but this is only a matter  of

political rnanoeuvres. We make use of them for our

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ali Bin Alwi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ali</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

continuing  what  I  have  said  just  now  in  the

Assembly   regarding  the  attitude   of   U.M.N.O.

especially  towards those political  Parties  which

are anti-national, we know why the Barisan Sosialis

are  much  inclined to make Singapore  a  fort  for

opposing  Malaysia. I am altogether surprised  that

the leaders of the Barisan Sosialis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font><br><br>



were not connected with an incident recently when a

member of one of the labour unions I represent  had

his  nose  broken by one of the favourites  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis.  One of their  leaders  asked  a

seaman, "Are you Lee Kuan Yew's man or Tunku  Abdul

Rahman's? I asked that person, "Did he ask  whether

you  are  Lim  Ching Siong's man?" The  reply  was,

"No."  Mr  Speaker, that means  that  the  Barisan

Sosialis  do have an ulterior motive as  stated  by

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara in his speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Mr Speaker, I have made investigations

into  the  labour  movement before  and  after  the

formation of the Barisan Sosialis who can  be  said

to  have control of the leadership of S.A.T.U.  The

investigations were in connection with the  workers

in Shaw Brothers. As a leader of the people, as one

who  has the interest of the trade unions at heart,

I  have found that all the statements published  in

the  papers  used  the name of the persons  without

their  knowledge.  I  asked one  man.  "During  the

election,  whom did you vote for?" The answer  was,

"I voted for the P.A.P." I asked him, "Why have you

changed  your  attitude now?" The  reply  was  that

because of the formation of Malaysia he was  forced

to  vote  for  the  P.A.P. and  also  because  the

statements  given  to the Press  were  without  the

knowledge  of the persons concerned. It is  certain

that   such  things  are  not  carried  out  in   a

democratic  country; and the Barisan Sosialis  have

used all these methods for their own interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked the members present at that meeting, "Are

you  or  are you not aware that you are all members

of the unions under the administration of S.A.T.U.?

Do  you know that the money you pay is used against

the  P.A.P. Government, the present Government? You

are  paying  money out of your wages and allowances

to the Central Control of S.A.T.U. for the purchase

of  paper for making banners, and for anti-Malaysia

purposes?  You may not be aware that you are  being

used to stab the people who have tried to help  you

in your fight now."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, what has been said in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font><br><br>



true.  There  are people and political Parties  who

try to misinterpret our motive today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Queenstown has spoken in this Assembly.



<br><br>5.37 p.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Deputy SPEAKER in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>He  has said that he does not like the formation of

Malaysia. I wish to know - and this question can  be

answered  by  his friends - have they tasted  whether

the  formation of Malaysia is good or bad? If  they

want to know whether it is good or bad, then let it

be  formed. With its formation, I believe the  fate

of  the  Central  Control of the  Barisan  Sosialis

today will be certain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not look upon them as henchmen of the countries I have mentioned just now, but if they want to go against our wishes, then they can say that Malaysia is bitter, because in the future we know that the responsibility for defence would be changed. Now the defence of the people of Singapore and the defence of the people

of the Federation are different.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us try not to do anything which will give a

bad  impression of our good intention. I know  well

the  attitude  of the Barisan Sosialis  Members.  I

would like to explain in this Assembly. When I  was

about   to  have  discussions  with  the  Singapore

Maritime  Employees' Federation  at  a  meeting,  I

recognised  who the Barisan Sosialis members  were.

They  were arrogant. They ignored us. They did  not

want  to speak to us. Are these the people who  are

in  control? I am surprised why they have  such  an

attitude. But we went with open hearts in order  to

discuss  matters which concerned the  workers.  But

they showed their true colours. They were angry and

they  did  not care for us. They wanted to  discuss

between themselves and the employees only. And this

is  their  attitude, which I know. It has  been  an

example to me and I must be careful about what I do

when  I meet such people. I hope we have noted  the

true  character  of  the  Central  Control  of  the

Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker. I fully agree with the findings of the Prime Minister on the wishes of the Member for Anson in order to inquire into the position of the labourers, whether they want to know who will sit in the labour unions, people who wish to bring in foreigners, or people who are working against this ideal. It is time that this

matter be settled



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker. I am rather concerned now about the working of the S.A.T.U. group. As we know, the S.A.T.U. group, as published in the Working Paper, have not been registered, and since they have not been registered, why have the Government given them the opportunity to exist? I am surprised. It is not that I want to defend the

P.A.P. Government at this time. With regard to  the

accusation  thrown  against the P.A.P.  Government,

namely,  that  democracy does  not  exist  in  this

country,  it is clear that the body which  has  not

been  registered is, according to the  law,  wrong.

The  law  says  it is wrong, but it is  allowed  to

carry  on.  Does that mean that democracy  is

non-existent? I therefore hope that the group that  has

been twisting all the statements should be careful.

I  say  this  because there will be a time  in  the

future  when I believe a change will take place  in

the  labour  movement; because the  workers  today,

whether Chinese or Malays, are still influenced  by

a  number of people who can speak, and who speak so

that  they can influence these people. But the time

has  conic,  I believe, when especially the  Malays

will  rise - I  am  not bringing up the  question  of

communalism  - but they are aware that they  have  a

duty :o participate in the controlling body of  the

labour  movement both in Singapore  and  throughout

the Federation. We cannot allow this opportunity to

pass to a number of adventurers who try to make use

of  us  for purposes of election or to grab  power.

There is current today a new sense of awareness and

we  bear it in our bodies. It is not that we do not

believe in centralised control of trade unions, but

we  do  not  want them to use this opportunity  for

bettering  their  own position  or  for  any  other

motives. That, Mr Deputy Speaker, is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font><br><br>



as  far  as I can say here which can be of guidance

to the people concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the question of housing, I feel

proud  and  satisfied  with  the  ability  of   the

Government to increase the number of houses in  the

course of its administration of the country.  I  am

not  able to state, but I hope the Government  will

be  able to clarify when the Malay Settlement  will

be  divided  and  allocated to the people  who  are

entitled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I appeal to the Government to

consider  the position of the people who under  the

present  policy of Government cannot get  aid  from

the.  Social  Welfare Department. Until  today  the

people of Singapore who do not have families do not

get  aid  from the said Department because they  do

not  have  dependants. But we should remember  that

they are the people of Singapore just the same, and

are   entitled  to  receive  aid  when   they   are

unemployed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, I appeal to the Government and to the

respective   Ministries  to  review  the   position

regarding   the  traders  and  hawkers,  especially

roadside  operators alt night markets.  Within  the

Kembangan  area,  Jalan Eunos,  the  road  is  very

small,  and  on every Friday night when  there  are

night markets all traffic along that road cannot go

through  safely, and it is very dangerous.  I  hope

the  authorities  concerned will take  this  as  an

example  so  that  all night markets  are  allotted

fixed  and  proper places where there is  not  much

traffic in order to avoid accidents and danger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also cases which I have brought to the

Ministry  concerned, namely, that  hawkers'  unions

demand  coffee money from hawkers who cannot afford

to  pay  it.  Because of this, the opportunity  for

those  people to hawk is nil. I believe this matter

is   within   the   knowledge  of  the   respective

authorities, and I hope they are able to  help  all

parties concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, on behalf of the Opposition group, I am

satisfied  with the Government once again  in  that

they  have  fulfilled 100 per cent of  the  appeals

that come from my constituency, and although



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font><br><br>



I am responsible to my constituency I appeal

to  the Government particularly not to forget other

constituencies,   although   those   constituencies

represent Parties that the Government do  not  like

especially  in  Kampong  Ayer  Gemuroh  and  Padang

Terbakar where all essential requirements are  very

little.  I  hope the Government can look into  this

matter  so that the residents in that area  can  be

said  to  have their own father and will  get  full

attention. That is more or less all that I can  say

in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also thank the Government for taking a great

interest  in  matters which I have brought  to  its

notice,  including the appeals  of  the  people  of

Kampong  Amber,  where  the  Ministry  of  National

Development  has  already  carried  out  its   work

satisfactorily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have one matter

with which I am not satisfied. That is the question

of  building  drains in Kampong Kembangan.  I  find

there are about 200 houses or families who will  be

the  victims.  I hope the Government  will  try  to

carry out other plans to deepen the existing drains

so  that the occupants of the houses who have taken

the   trouble  to  build  these  houses   are   not

inconvenienced and that their houses  will  not  be

demolished, because that would become a big problem

both to me and to the Government.



<br><br>5.53 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, there are one or

two  points which I wish to bring to the  attention

of the House. The Prime Minister in his speech said

that  private  enterprise, so far  as  building  in

Singapore  was  concerned,  was  estimated  by  the

Government to contribute at least 6,000  units  per

annum during the course of the ensuing year. And  I

wish  to bring to the notice of the House a problem

which  intensive  private development  is  bringing

about in Singapore, and, unless it is checked, will

lead  to  great difficulties in the future. Private

development now confines itself to building

multi-storey  flats  to a very large extent  and  selling

each  of these flats to people in the middle income

groups.  Now, it raises a problem of management  of

these houses, a problem of ownership



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font><br><br>



in  the future, and the problem of maintenance  and

upkeep of these flats and of the block in which the

flats  are situated. The Housing Board builds these

flats and lets them out to private individuals. But

while  they are let out, the Housing Board sees  to

it  that  the  passages and stairways are  properly

maintained,  lighted and looked after.  So  far  as

these  private flats are concerned,  they  arc  now

being  sold  by  the hundreds to the middle  income

group  people. The private developer is  a  private

limited  company. The point I wish to  stress,  Mr

Deputy Speaker, is this: that these are all private

limited  companies,  and in the  conveyances  which

they  give to the purchasers of these flats,  these

companies    give   certain   covenants,    certain

undertakings to the purchasers of these flats, such

as that they would maintain the stairways, see that

they are lighted, that they are repaired and so  on

and so forth, which makes it possible for the

flat-dwellers to enjoy living in those flats. Now it has

already  come  to  our notice that  some  of  these

private limited companies which started, say, five

or   six   years  previous  to  today  have   wound

themselves  up. They have wound themselves  up  and

disappeared  from the scene and have ceased  to  be

legal entities. `The net result now is that some of

the  people who bought the houses from them do  not

have  anybody against whom they can proceed in case

the covenants they have undertaken to carry out are

not implemented. But if it is a private person, you

can  either  go against him or against his  estate.

But if it is a private limited company and once  it

goes  into  liquidation, it ceases  to  exist,  and

there  is  nobody against whom you can  proceed.  I

bring  this  problem to the attention of Government

who  are  now taking a liberal view with regard  to

houses which are owner-occupied. I think one of the

results  of  that attitude is going to be  an  even

more  intensive  development of  flats  by  private

companies with a view to idling them to the  middle

income groups. My own view, Mr Deputy Speaker,  is

that  these private limited companies which  go  in

for  housing  development should be  treated  in  a

different category, and separate legislation should



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font><br><br>



be  brought about whereby they could be kept  under

proper  control, so that these middle income  group

purchasers, in five or ten years' time, will not be

left  high  and  dry with their stairways  rotting,

their  roofs  leaking, and all  the  covenants  not

being  able  to be implemented. That is  the  first

point  I  thought I should bring to the  notice  of

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point, Mr Deputy Speaker, on which I

wish  to address the House is the question  of  the

water  supply  of  Singapore, on  which  the  Prime

Minister spoke. The Prime Minister has indicated in

his  speech that during the last three years  there

has  been an increase of 9 million gallons  in  the

consumption  of water, so that the yearly  increase

at the moment is 3 million gallons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister has given figures that the consumption of water today is 73 million gallons per day. He has also indicated that so far as Tebrau is concerned, he can get a maximum intake into Singapore of 45 million gallons per day, and that the rest of the water supply for every day conies from the impounding reservoirs. He has also

indicated  that in the impounding reservoirs  there

is  only  54  per cent of the maximum  supply.  The

position,  to  my  mind, is  a  very  serious  one,

particularly as the Government is pressing on  with

the  building  of flats. The more  flats  that  are

built, the more water will be consumed. And if  the

Government  builds another 12,000 houses,  as  they

say  they  will,  then  the consumption  will  most

assuredly rise beyond 3 million gallons next  year.

If the scheme in Jurong materialises in the way the

Minister for Finance hopes that it will, and if the

steel mill in Jurong goes up, in the way we hope it

will,  the  steel mill alone will account  for  one

million gallons per day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has suggested that it wil1 build

some sort of a natural reservoir in Jurong. How far

that  project  has  progressed Government  has  not

informed us, although schemes are afoot, it  seems.

Whether  the  reservoir will  be  in  readiness  to

receive  the steel mill is another matter.  All  in

all,  Mr Deputy Speaker, the position with  regard

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font><br><br>



the  water supply is a very grave one, and I regret

that  the  Government does not seem  to  be  unduly

worried about the position, because it seems to  be

taking  its time over augmenting our water  supply.

It has started a scheme at Scudai, and it says that

under the Scudai scheme it hopes to get in about 15

million  gallons per day. It says that  that  river

will be brought into operation, so far as our water

supply is concerned, towards the end of next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the position with regard to Scudai and

Tebrau  is this: these two rivers are tidal  rivers

and  they are subject to a dry weather flow  and  a

wet  weather flow. When the Prime Minister says  he

can get a maximum of 45 million gallons per day,  I

think  what  he really means to tell the  House  is

that from the river at its wettest, he will get  45

million gallons per day. But when Tebrau is at  its

driest,  he cannot get more than 10 million gallons

per  day. Similarly Scudai is also subject to a dry

and wet weather flow, and when it is at its driest,

he  cannot get from it more than 5 million  gallons

per day. Assume a very dry season, such as we might

run  into in the course of the next few months, the

result  will  be that even with Tebrau  and  Scudai

working to its full dry weather capacity, we  could

have  a  water shortage in Singapore, and we  will,

Mr  Deputy  Speaker. I regret very much  that  the

Government  is not pressing on as fast  as  it  can

with the Johore River scheme, and I regret that the

first  intake  from the Johore River, according  to

the  Prime  Minister, will not be  until  the  year

1967,  which is 4 years away. Unless and  until  we

can  get to Johore as quickly as possible, we shall

always  be faced with the danger of a water shortage

in  Singapore,  Nobody likes to predict  ill,  but,

unless  we  get to the Johore River as  quickly  as

possible,  we will always be faced with the  danger

of a shortage of water supply during the dry season

in  Singapore.  The  dry season in  Singapore  also

coincides  with  the dry season  in  the  south  of

Johore where these two rivers are situate.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I wish to raise, Mr Deputy

Speaker,  is a matter raised by the leader  of  the

Barisan,  the Member for Queenstown.  Sir,  he  has

indicated  to  the House how strongly  he  and  his

Party  support  the parliamentary system  which  we

have  adopted in Singapore. One of the basic things

on  which parliamentary democracy rests is that  we

must  accept  the verdict of the majority.  Let  us

fight  as  hard  as we can until  that  verdict  is

delivered, but once the verdict has been delivered,

then,  however  hard we might have  objected,  how'

ever  hard  we have fought against it, I  think  we

must accept the verdict.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the referendum, on the

question of Malay sin, the Barisan were entitled to

fight  as hard as they could, and they fought  very

hard  indeed. They have lost the battle, they  have

last  the  fight.  And  I do  ask  the  Member  for

Queenstown  and his followers in this  House -  that

the verdict having been delivered by the people  of

Singapore   after   a   hard   contest,   as   good

parliamentarians,  they  should  now   accept   the

verdict, and not lead Singapore to bloodshed.



<br><br>6.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir, on  the  policy  speech

delivered by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara,  both  the

Government  Party and the Opposition  Parties  have

expressed their views, if they say that there is no

democracy in Singapore, no freedom of speech,  then

they are blind or they are out of their minds.  Let

us   examine  the  arguments  put  forth   by   the

Opposition Parties. Of course, they come  from  the

various different Parties, but all of them  have  a

lot  of  grouses,  hut  when  we  ask  them  to  do

something, they cannot do it. Therefore,  they  are

forced  to make use of this Assembly as a forum  to

voice their grouses. The contents of their speeches

are nothing more than abuses or boasting. We have a

strange   phenomenon  today  among  the  Opposition

Parties - there is one common feature. In all  their

speeches  they have not been able to deny that  the

P.A.P. have done



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 321</b></font><br><br>



something  for  the people and they have  not  been

able  to deny that we, the P.A.P., have done a  lot

for  the  people. This is worthy of our  attention.

Why  do they not say the P.A.P. is incompetent? Why

do  they  not accuse the Government of not building

bridges,  roads,  schools  and  hospitals  for  the

people?  Why can they not, on behalf of the people,

put  forward constructive schemes to better the lot

of  the  people? Mr Deputy Speaker. Sir,  we  know

that the Members in the Opposition Parties have all

along  professed to be the representatives  of  the

people but they have not suggested any constructive

schemes to improve the lot of the people. There are

some  neighbouring  countries  which  claim  to  be

progressive,  that  they are trying  to  raise  the

standard of living of the people by providing  them

with  food  and  clothing.  Now,  when  we  compare

Singapore with these countries, we can see that the

standard  of living of the people here is far,  far

higher  than it is there. Opposition Party  Members

have  seen the achievements of the P.A.P.  That  is

why  they have not been able to criticise the  work

of the Government. They know full well that all the

schemes carried out by the Government are aimed  at

trying  to  improve  the  living  standard  of  the

people.  The  building of bridges and repairing  of

roads   will  go  towards  improving  their  living

standard.  The Members in the Opposition are  blind

to  all  these facts. What the Government has  been

doing  is to bring a better life to the people.  If

the  Government  builds another outpatient  clinic,

this  will benefit the people not only in the urban

area but also in the rural area. People who are ill

can  get treatment from this clinic, and they  will

save a lot of time and energy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with more police stations the crime situation

has improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the elected Government, we have many problems

to  solve.  If  you  do  not  talk  about  bringing

electricity  and water to the people, you  have  to

solve the problem of employment for the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1961 the Government started carrying out the

Four-Year Development Plan. When these projects are

completed,  in  conjunction with the  other

small-scale industrial projects, they will bring more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 322</b></font><br><br>



employment opportunities to the people.  They  know

that  we  the  P.A.P. have done a lot. They  cannot

deny  all  these  facts. They cannot  convince  the

people  that  we have not done anything  for  them.

They are only capable of boasting. With sweet words

and  sweet  slogans they are trying to deceive  the

people.  They say that we are not anti-colonialists

and imperialists. They are able to make speeches of

this nature. They also blame the Government for the

shortage of water. Can we turn the anti-colonialist

slogan into something that we can eat? Can we  live

on slogans alone?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one paragraph in the speech of the

Member  for  Queenstown yesterday which merits  our

attention.  He  said the open rebellion  in  Brunei

will  lead  to guerilla warfare. Now, if  we  study

closely his speech, we will know that he has  shown

his  true  colours. Although they have  been  quiet

after the referendum, today they are trying to  ape

the  cocks  in Bali Island, to recover  their  past

glory. Only people with foresight can conceive  the

idea   of  Malaysia.  Only  people  who  have   the

interests  of  the people at heart will  appreciate

the importance of national unity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown has warned the people

that a constitutional struggle is possible only  if

there  are  avenues for a constitutional  struggle,

otherwise  the people will resort to  other  means.

The  people  will  clearly understand  what  he  is

talking  about.  Does he want the  people  to  shed

blood  in the so-called revolutionary war? I  think

the  Member for Queenstown should accept the advice

given by our Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the situation in Singapore is stable. You

are  in a very desperate position now. People  have

not  supported you, if you are trying to become the

stooges  of foreign powers, then one day  you  will

regret what you are doing now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The territories which are going to form Malaysia

have common features, that is, they are of a common

ethnic  group, having the same racial  groups.  The

establishment of Malaysia will mean  the  death  of

colonialism. People in the five territories realise

that it is only when they are united that they  can

survive and form a strong nation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 323</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson has accused us of doing

all  sorts of wrong things, but we are only leading

our country towards a prosperous society.



<br><br>6.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall (Anson):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

we  seem to have forgotten that this is a motion of

thanks  to H.E. the Yang di-Pertuan Negara.  I  for

one  find no difficulty at all in saying thank  you

to  him  for his courtesy in coming here, in saying

"thank  you"  to him for the manner - the  dignified

manner - in  which  he discharged a  most  difficult

duty. In fact, Mr Deputy Speaker, as I listened to

him, my admiration grew for the iron discipline and

the  dedication to duty which permitted him to read

through reams of praise for pigs and the P.A.P.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a policy document, Sir, the speech which was

prepared  for  him  to read - the  last  speech  the

P.A.P. will ever prepare - was the crowing of a cock

on a dunghill. The dishonesty of that policy speech

lies  not only in its drooling self-praise, hut  is

particularly noticeable for the remarkable omission

to explain the major inroad into the rule of law in

the  arrest  of 133 persons during a period  which,

according  to the policy statement of  the  P.A.P.,

was  characterised by "peace and tranquility". That

is their phrase.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the arrests were under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance, a measure passed to meet emergency situations endangering the security of the State. I am not interested in scoring a debating point. I know it might be amusing to go back to Hansard in the days when the Government were in the Opposition and to

quote their many statements about the P.P.S.O. and

what   a  dreadful  measure  it  was  that  I   had

introduced. Nor is it necessary to go back  to  the

days  when in 1959 the Government extended the life

of  the P.P.S.O. by five years - this Government, the

P.A.P. Government, together with the gentlemen  and

the  ladies  on the Barisan Sosialis  side,  and  a

little to their left where the leader is missing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 324</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is ironic, Sir, that these people who

supported  the  extension  and -  never   mind   the

extension, it may have been necessary and  probably

was - who supported the removal of the protection of

the Judges from it, now complain of suffering under

it.  If  they had had the respect for human  beings

that was embodied in that Ordinance, they would not

have  been screaming today about the abuse,  as  in

fact it is an abuse, of these provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Sir, you have been told blatantly that the

Preservation  of  Public Security Ordinance,  which

was  intended  for emergency situations,  is  being

used in a period of peace and tranquility. What  is

the  excuse  for this action? There is an  indirect

reference  in the policy statement to the "decision

of  the Internal Security Council to remove persons

active in a Communist united front conspiracy."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, that is a cowardly phrase. Constitutionally it is the duty of this Government to govern in Singapore and decisions under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance are decisions of the Government. It is true that under our Constitution the Internal Security Council has power to issue orders to the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara.  That power was not exercised, Mr Speaker.

There  was  no  order  from the  Internal  Security

Council.  The order came from this Government,  and

it  is cowardly to seek to hide behind the skirt of

the  Internal Security Council. You will  no  doubt

remember  how I foresaw just this type of manoeuvre

when  I  fought  the  provisions  of  the  Internal

Security  Council  in the Constitution  many  years

ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read the statement issued by the Internal

Security Council, and the most interesting part  of

it  is  that nowhere is there any direct indication

or  allegation  of  a threat of imminent  violence;

nowhere  in  that document, and, consequently,  Mr

Speaker, no right to exercise emergency powers  for

an emergency situation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, on a point of

hurled  between the P.A.P. and the Barisan. I  have

studied the motion succeeding this and it is not to

submit that there is matter in the policy statement

without  seeking  to adumbrate them  in  detail.  I

shall  not trouble you with a marathon speech,  but

it   is  my  intention - and  I  would  not  like  to

camouflage  it - to deal both with the inadequacy  of

the   reasons  for  this  massive  misuse  of   the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance  and  for

the  dreadful  conditions to which  these  persons,

whatever  their political views may be,  have  been

subjected. They are parts of the general policy  of

the  Government  and I can assure you  I  will  not

weary  you  with  detail. So,  might  I  have  your

permission, Mr Speaker?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have indicated that the hon.

Member is perfectly in order if he touches on  this

matter  in  a  broad aspect but he should  try  and

avoid  details; details can always be discussed  in

the next motion.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I am much obliged, Sir. Mr

Speaker, there is a phrase in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



this  policy  speech  which  gloatingly  speaks  of

merger  and  Malaysia as being the magic dissolvent

of the Communist threat. I wish that were true. But

I  say  it is but an act of cowardice of trying  to

pass  the  buck. There will be no solution  to  the

issue  of attracting the loyalty of a vast  segment

of the population in Singapore to the traditions of

democracy  and to a sense of unity within ourselves

and  within  Malaysia except  with  the  people  of

Singapore. If we, the people of Singapore,  do  not

find the solution, Kuala Lumpur will not be a great

help. Sure they can arrest; so can this Government,

as it has proved, arresting people and calling them

subversives. Mr Speaker, there are times  when  it

is  necessary  to  take sharp  measures  for  one's

health, but there are times, as one does in a  case

of  surgery,  when  sharp  measures  can  kill  the

patient,  not cure him. It is easy to  call  people

subversives,  to  damn  them  as  Communists.   Mr

Speaker,  I  know myself that I am as Communist  as

the Pope, but that has not prevented the Government

and, its stooges, it has not prevented malice, from

seeking  to  paint me red. I speak from experience.

We  have  heard the Government seek to connect  the

ghastly tragedy of that criminal folly in Brunei as

an excuse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You supported them.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Mr Speaker, you see, I am glad you

are  elsewhere  engaged.  Their  falsehoods,  their

dishonesty - oh,  but  why  talk  of   it,   we   are

accustomed  to  it  every day.  The  Workers  Party

issued  a  statement soon after the  Brunei  revolt

condemning  it in no uncertain terms,  and  it  was

published  for  a change; but two  of  the  Workers

Party members, who are no friends of mine - at least

not   politically - find   themselves   amongst   the

detainees.  They were not at any time  publicly  or

otherwise  associated  in  supporting  the   Brunei

Revolt.  Mr  Speaker, the tragedy of Singapore  is

that we have inherited the results of the omissions

of   the  Imperial  Government  in  the  field   of

education, seeking not to have income tax  so  that

the over-worked expatriate may have enough



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



profits  and his directors at home may have  enough

cream.  We had no education policy other  than  the

policy of having a few English-speaking clerks  for

the  commercial machine, and a few Malay peons; and

therefore  the vast Chinese community had  to  fall

upon  its  own resources through charity,  to  give

education to its own youth. A youth that  has  been

brought up to Chinese language naturally seeks  and

is inclined towards mainland China for its cultural

patterns and for its thinking. At no time  have  we

in  Singapore  really made an effort to  give  this

youth hope and a meaning in the future. They are in

a  spiritual vacuum, Mr Speaker, and though it  is

regrettable,  it  is  by  no  means  difficult   to

understand.  In that vacuum are to be found  echoes

of  the  ways of thought which are now  current  in

mainland  China  and  we find what  I  have  termed

"Peking  Parrots",  net  Communists  as  such,  not

understanding    what   they   are    doing,    not

understanding  the realities of  the  situation  in

their  own territory, but "Peking Parrots"  echoing

weakly,  without understanding, a line  of  thought

which happens to be the vogue in mainland China  at

any    material   time,   not   with   any   malice

aforethought,  Sir,  on  the  part  of   the   vast

majority,  but because they have nothing else.  Mr

Speaker,  far  from being lost to us,  I  say  with

respect  that  we  can fill that  vacuum  with  the

values of the ideals of democracy, with a sense  of

belonging  to Malaysia, a sense of unity  with  the

different  races.  We must act  with  patience  and

human   wisdom,   respect   for   human   failings,

recognition   that  it  is  through  patience   and

perseverance  that  one can  win  through,  not  by

abusing  and maligning them perpetually. The  Prime

Minister  in  his hysterical efforts  to  save  his

Party  from  doom,  which is its due, has  divided

Singapore into two - the subversives and "the rest".

And  that  is  the  evil which  they  now  make  it

necessary  for  us to inherit. An evil  perpetrated

for  no  other  purpose  than  the  survival  of  a

political Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have failed, and I will say this for the P.A.P. - I will not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



say  for  all of them, but I will say for  some  of

them - that there are and there have been efforts  on

their part - as there have been efforts on the part

of  others  - sincere efforts to seek  to  bring  an

understanding  of the democratic  process, of  the

values  and virtues of democracy, of the  unity  of

the  people of Singapore to the Chinese  youth  and

the  Chinese industrial workers. And it is true  we

have  failed,  but it has only been a short  period

that  we  have  sought  to bridge  this  gulf  that

divides  us  culturally and educationally.  However

often we fail, even more often must we try, because

if   we  are  to  admit  failure,  like  the  Prime

Minister,  and  divide Singapore into  two  unequal

parts,  that will be the end not only of those  who

are not of our way of thinking but it will also  be

the  end of us - the people of Singapore. The conduct

of   this  Government  has  not  been  helpful   in

attracting the loyalty and respect of this  segment

of our population to the democratic process. I say,

Mr   Speaker,  that  it  is  bad  policy  to  keep

attacking our Chinese youth and industrial  workers

as  Communists. Not only is it bad policy but it is

also not true. These are our fellow citizens and  I

am  not prepared to condemn them and to slough them

off  and  to cleave to the new peoples of Malaysia,

throwing  away these fellow citizens who  form  the

major part of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is astonishing too that the policy statement has not seen fit to contain at least some indication of the tragedy of the conditions of detention which have been imposed on these people, conditions which have been made public, and which I repeat, Sir, are far worse than

anything perpetrated by the Imperial Government  or

by any previous Government. I do not intend to seek

to  shock  you tonight. I received with a sense  of

hope   yesterday  the  assurance  from  the   Prime

Minister  that  he would allow a  delegate  of  the

International Red Cross to investigate  conditions.

I  know  what  that means, that  by  the  time  the

delegate   gets   here  or  gets  the   invitation,

conditions  will have improved to an  extent  which

will  make it bearable for the detainees; and  that

is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



good  enough for me. I do not seek to blacken faces

that  are already black or to show you hearts  that

you know are filth. I merely seek to assist, so far

as it is possible for one human being, persons who,

however  much I may disagree with some of  them  in

their  political views, however strongly  I  resent

the  obstructive conduct of which  they  have  been

guilty, should be treated as human beings.  We  all

err, Mr Speaker - that is not just a phrase. But  to

err  does not make us animals, and not even animals

should  be  subjected to the conditions  which  the

P.A.P. have imposed, I am quite sure their boars of

which the speech talks are better looked after than

the detainees ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Their what?



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Boars, b-o-a-r-s. You will find it

in  His Excellency's - well, if the P.A.P. want me to

refer  to  them  in  terms  of  one  syllable,  Mr

Speaker,  it  is  curious the  emphasis  which  the

P.A.P. have laid in this last major policy  speech

on  pigs. You know, Mr Speaker, there is  a  maxim

that water finds its own level, and I would suggest

that the P.A.P. seem to have achieved theirs. I  am

delighted  that they recognise their affinity  with

boars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, finally I would suggest that you, not you - Mr Speaker; I will impute nothing personal - but I find it the height of impertinence

that  the  policy speech of this Government  should

refer  to the integrity of political leaders.  What

does  it know of integrity, Mr Speaker? What  does

this   Government   which   has   perpetrated   the

Referendum    Ordinance   know   about    political

integrity?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Anson is

becoming out of order by casting reflections  on  a

decision  of this House. This House has passed  the

Referendum  Ordinance and he  insinuates  that  the

referendum  is a fraud. He cannot do that.  It  has

been  decided  by  this House that  the  Referendum

Ordinance  should pass into law and it  has  passed

into law.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> May I say infamous law, Mr

Speaker, Sir?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. There again, "infamous" also

casts  a  reflection on a decision of  this  House.

Perhaps   the  hon.  Member  will  just   say   the

Referendum Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> I did refer to the Referendum

Ordinance,  Sir. Passing on to the falsehoods  that

have  been  perpetrated in your  presence  in  this

House   by   Government  Ministers   in   answering

questions  as  to the conditions of detainees,  Mr

Speaker, these people have the impudence to talk of

integrity!  I  say  to  you  that  it   will   take

generations  for  Singapore  to  recover  from  the

traditions of political dishonesty which the P.A.P.

has  displayed.  Mr  Speaker,  much  that  I  find

repugnant  in this policy statement,  I  find  that

nevertheless  I am in no position to  vote  against

it,  because I am certainly not going to  vote  for

the  amendment. I, Mr Speaker, have no regret that

the  Government did not keep its promises. I  never

believed  that  it  would.  I  can  understand  the

Barisan Sosialis regretting and the Member for Hong

Lim  and  his colleague regretting. They belong  to

the  group.  Maybe they were taken in.  I  was  not

taken in, Mr Speaker, Sir, I knew they would welsh

and  they  have  welshed. How can I regret  what  I

anticipated?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there will be no question of my voting for the amendment. As for voting against the motion itself, Mr Speaker, I mention this only in passing, since some Members seem to be unaware that it is an act constitutionally of discourtesy even to seek a division on the motion of thanks, that an attempt to defeat it should be made on any

amendment  before the House which may be acceptable

to  Opposition  Members, but once those  amendments

have  been  defeated and the main motion is  before

the  House, whatever one might think of the speech,

let  us  remember that the motion is  a  motion  of

thanks  to His Excellency and nobody should refrain

from that gesture of thanks.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I notice that the Member  for  Anson

and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>



Member   for  Hong  Lim  there  have  obviously   a

premonition  that there is going to  be  a  carcass

soon  and therefore they are both bidding  for  the

same  carcass, that is the carcass of  the  Barisan

Sosialis.  You will recollect, Sir, that yesterday,

the Member for Hong Lim in his speech quite rightly

avoided making any judgment on the achievements  of

the P.A.P. insofar as they were referred to them in

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's speech. He  confined

himself  quite wisely to making an election  speech

in  which he appealed to all groups, as the  Member

for Anson has done today, because this is the first

time  I  have  seen the Member for An-son  in  this

Chamber disavowing the Barisan Sosialis for whom he

has  acted as adviser and back-room boy until  now.

But now he knows that the Barisan Sosialis is going

down  and  that new masters are coming up  and  the

Member  for  Anson  has quite wisely  made  certain

obeisance to the Federation Government. This  comes

from  a  person, Sir, who has in his lifetime  lost

three political parties which have been stolen from

under his nose.



<br><br><!-- Mr David Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David Marshall:</b> Three?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Three.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Four! [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I remember the first

occasion  was the Progressive Party from  which,  I

think,  he was either ejected or he retreated - I  do

not know which. Then you will remember the occasion

when  he was in the Labour Party but prior to  that

there  was  talk of his forming a Socialist  Party,

and  it  eventually ended up as the  Labour  Front.

Then  he  had  the Workers' Party and  we  in  this

Chamber  advised  him that his Workers'  Party  was

being  divided.  He refused to accept  our  warning

that if he was not careful the carpet was going  to

be  pulled away from under his feet. But now he has

decided the best way to play this game is to make a

bid for the remnants of the Barisan Sosialis if and

when  it  comes  a  cropper. In fact,  the  Barisan

Sosialis



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 332</b></font><br><br>



is  quite  well  aware that if not the  Member  for

Anson at least the Member for Hong Lim is making  a

bid  to  inherit the revolution and in fact in  the

recent  issue of the Plebeian of 21st March,  1963,

the  Member  for Queenstown in an article  entitled

"Socialism will be Victorious" said this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As for the leader of a certain political party,

Dr  Lee  said, like what Lee Kuan Yew  said,  this

person was waiting for the arrests of all Left-wing

leaders so that he could come out and pose  as  the

Left-wing leader.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee said, "If the person [that is the Member for Hong Lim] is really anti-colonial, we will sincerely welcome him to our ranks."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim is quite bright; he knows

that  if  he joins their ranks he is also finished.

Therefore, Dr Lee said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But we will not tolerate him if his Party organ

smeared  and  jeered at our comrades  who  are  now

under  detention.  We will attack all  opportunists

and support all anti-colonialists.'



<br><br>So,  the Member for Anson, like the Member for Hong

Lim  too, is expounding the cause of the detainees.

He  has  been engaged, I think, in a duel  with  my

Political   Secretary  over   the   conditions   of

detainees, because if they stand up for  the  issue

of  detainees  now, then they hope  that  when  the

Barisan  Sosialis comes a cropper they will inherit

the  revolution. We can tell the Member  for  Anson

that  he  who has not been able to look  after  two

small political Parties will not be able to inherit

the  revolution  from the Communists.  So  I  would

suggest to him that he should rather play the  role

of  an observer and an independent socialist, as  I

hope he would be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think neither the Member for Anson nor the

Member for Hong Lim does really matter when the big

battle starts, because I think the real force  here

is  the  Barisan Sosialis. Listening to the Barisan

Sosialis amateur revolutionaries, I could not  help

noticing  that they were this time like  bewildered

sheep  bleating for their lost shepherds. At  least

on  previous occasions when they had their  battery

of  ghost-writers, they had scripts which at  least

made them sound like militant and confident cheep.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 333</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown, in particular, gave a

creditable performance of a leader who was  leading

his  Party  towards recognizable goals-that  is  in

those days-even though the more perceptive among us

knew  that  he was being remotely controlled.  This

time,  I  must however congratulate the Member  for

Queenstown for making a speech that sounded for the

most  part  like the Member for Queenstown.  Though

the  broad lines of policy have been laid down  for

him  by  others,  I  could not  help  feeling  that

interpretation of the lines was his own; it has all

the  hallmarks  of authenticity; it  was  confused,

illogical,  groping and, of course, hilarious.  For

the most part, the speeches of the Barisan Sosialis

Members  consisted of repetitions of what they  had

said  in this Chamber and outside for the last  two

years.  We  had, Sir, the same old arguments  about

phoney  merger, about genuine reunification,  about

Malaysia  being  a  British  plot  and  about   the

dishonest  referendum. I would  have  thought  that

after  his  hazardous and expensive trip to  London

and  after having sat at the feet of Mr John Eber,

the  Member for Queenstown would have come out with

something  fresh, startling and original.  But  all

that  we  had  from the lost sheep of  the  Barisan

Sosialis was that they confined themselves  to

re-opening  an issue that had already been decided  on

by this Assembly and by the electorate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Sir, we heard angry complaints from

the  Barisan  Sosialis that free  speech  was  dead

because  this session of the Assembly was not  long

enough.   But  would  this  complaint  carry   much

conviction with the people when an Assembly Session

is  used  to  re-discuss issues which have  already

been  decided  upon and repeat arguments  which  we

have heard over and over again in this Assembly?



However,  before  I go on to the amendment  by  the

Barisan Sosialis Members, I would like to deal with

some  of the astonishing comments made by the

parlour   revolutionaries  on  the   Yang   di-Pertuan

Negara's speech. Both the Member for Queenstown and

the Member for Thomson dismissed as of no



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 334</b></font><br><br>



great  consequence  references  to  the  number  of

houses,   standpipes,  roads,  factories,  schools,

community  centres and things of  that  kind  which

constitute  concrete achievements. The  Member  for

Queenstown  found  all these tangible  achievements

irritating. Because he could not deny the existence

of  schools, flats, standpipes, he was  reduced  to

making  a  very  remarkable observation.  He  said,

"Take   away   the  houses,  the  standpipes,   the

community centres and all that, and what  have  you

got?"  And  he  gave  the  answer,  "You  have  got

nothing."  Of course, Sir, any school boy  who  has

done  any elementary mathematics can tell you  that

if  you  take away everything, then there  will  be

nothing. But the same school boy could have pointed

out  to the Member for Queenstown that in fact  you

cannot  take  away houses, roads, schools,  clinics

and  stand-pipes that have been built however  much

the Barisan Sosialis might try to wish them away.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand the irritation of the Member for

Queenstown over such things as houses and  clinics.

I  understand that his constituency is one of those

areas  where buildings and clinics are shooting  up

even  as  he tries to convince the people  in  that

area  that they are being oppressed by the  P.A.P.,

that they are ill-fed, ill-housed and neglected and

that only after the revolution, can people get more

schools, houses and the good things of life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the Member for Thomson dismissed all

these   concrete  achievements  as  of   no   great

consequence.   In   building   schools,   community

centres,   houses  and  the  like,  he  said,   the

Government  was only carrying out its  obligations.

But  that is the point. Sir,If we are carrying out

our  obligations,  then instead of  denouncing  the

Government, the Barisan Sosialis should commend  us

and  exhort us to build more houses, more  schools,

more  roads, more clinics and, more factories. They

should  come forward with concrete and constructive

suggestions on how the livelihood of the people can

be improved still further. Instead, as we all know,

the  Barisan Sosialis tactics have been  to  hinder

development projects as in the case of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



Toa  Payoh and create an atmosphere of tension  and

crisis to ensure that no economic development takes

place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will have noticed, Sir, how irritated the

Members for Queenstown and Thomson were by the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara's references to the atmosphere of

calm  and  tranquility now prevailing in Singapore.

This  irritates  the  Barisan  Sosialis  and  their

Communist puppet masters for two reasons. The first

is  that  this  air of calm and tranquility  should

prevail after the recent arrest of Communists is  a

social  embarrassment to them. The  fact  that  the

disappearance  of prominent Communists,

Communist-front  men, should have been received so calmly  by

the people, and even with relief by the people,  is

a mortal blow to the Communist propaganda that they

enjoyed  the  esteem, support and  loyalty  of  the

masses.  So  too  in the case of  houses,  schools,

roads  and the like, the Barisan Sosialis  have  to

deny the fact that there is calm and tranquility in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason why they find references to

calm and tranquility so irritating is that, so long

as  there  is  calm and tranquility,  the  pace  of

economic   development,  investments  in  business,

industry  and construction work generally would  be

accelerated,  thus exposing the Communist  argument

that only after a Communist revolution can people's

problems  of livelihood be solved. They  know  that

this   thesis  is  false.  They  know  that  in   a

democratic  socialist  Singapore  we  are  able  to

steadily improve the welfare of the people  without

imposing  hardships, the terror and the intolerable

burdens  which  are  the  inevitable  preludes   of

Communist  forms  of reconstruction.  Every  house,

every  school, every standpipe, every  factory  and

every  road built under a non-Communist,  socialist

Government is one more nail to the Barisan Sosialis

lie  that only a Communist revolution can make life

better  for  the  people. The thesis  that  only  a

Communist regime can solve the livelihood  problems

of  the  people is obviously refuted by the  steady

and  concrete achievements. Therefore,  every  time

they see a flat, a standpipe, a road,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



they  have now to wish them away. They cannot  deny

these  achievements  and, in  fact,  they  made  no

effort to deny the existence of these achievements.

All  that the Barisan Members did was to claim,  as

the   Member  for  Queenstown  said,  that  if  you

disregard all these achievements, then there are no

achievements worth talking about.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from time to time, we, on this side of the

House,  have given free advice to Barisan  Sosialis

members.  I  know, they have stubbornly refused  to

heed  such  advice,  presumably because  they  were

free,  but  had they listened to our  advice,  they

would  not  be in this sorry plight that  they  are

today.  Sir, I propose to give them another bit  of

advice which may possibly be the last bit of advice

we  will be able to give them. Anyway, Sir,  having

regard  to  the  present  state  of  neurosis   and

anxiety,  this  advice  may  well  be  disregarded.

Nevertheless,   the  advice   is   this:   do   not

underestimate  the intelligence of  the  people  of

Singapore. They are not duffers and morons  as  the

Barisan  Sosialis discovered during the referendum.

The  people will judge the Government and forms  of

government not by oratory, not by promises of a pie

in  the  sky,  not  by abstract talks  of  freedom,

revolution, anti-colonialism, democracy  and  other

verbal mishmash, but by what the Government does to

make the day to day life of the people better.  The

Member  for Queenstown and the Member for  Thomson,

fairly  well-fed, well-housed, possessed of  steady

incomes,   may  think  that  things  like   houses,

schools, stand-pipes, roads, factories, and so  on,

are   trivial  matters  compared  with  the   vague

abstractions   about   anti-colonialism,    genuine

unification  of Malaysia with Indonesia,  with  the

revolutionary struggle and so on. But I think, Sir,

the  people  of  Singapore have reached  sufficient

political   maturity  to  be  able  to  distinguish

between gentlemen who keep talking on and on  about

revolution and Utopia at some undefined future  and

those  who, while not promising a workers' paradise

or  a Utopia in some future period, produce houses,

schools, standpipes and so on, now.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis and their Communist mentors

may   not   think  very  much  about  our   housing

achievements,  but  I can tell them - and  they  must

have read - that international experts on housing who

have  visited Singapore have been impressed by what

has  been achieved so far and these experts, unlike

the  Barisan  Sosialis, not only  know  more  about

these  matters, but they have no political  axe  to

grind one way or the other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Sir, the Member for Queens-town, not

knowing how to minimise or refute the facts as laid

out  in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech and not

knowing  how to attack us, went even so far  as  to

blame  the  Government for the water  shortage.  In

fact,  his  argument  is even  more  hilarious.  He

argued  that  since  a  lot of  rain  fell  on  the

tropical  isle of Singapore he could not understand

why   there   should  be  any  water   shortage - the

implication presumably being that the wicked P.A.P.

Government  had  somehow hoarded  all  this  excess

water and deliberately created a water shortage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another noticeable source of irritation to

the Barisan Sosialis was television. The Member for

Queenstown  was more than usually distraught  every

time  he  referred to television which for want  of

some  stronger term he described as a new craze.  I

think  that in describing television as a new craze

he  is not showing the progressive outlook expected

of  good revolutionaries, because even in Communist

countries  including Moscow and Peking,  television

is described as the hallmark of an advanced society

and  as  a  useful  mass media for  increasing  the

cultural  and  intellectual level  of  the  people.

Therefore, by establishing television as in  Moscow

and  in  Peking, not to mention Jakarta,  Singapore

too  is  in the vanguard of progress, and  I  am  a

little surprised that the Barisan Sosialis who  are

so  anxious  to  see Singapore in the  vanguard  of

progress  should  manifest such  hostility  towards

television. It is not that the Barisan Sosialis did

not  know  that  the  Government  had  planned   to

introduce  television. In fact some of the  Barisan

Sosialis Members while still in the Government  had

looked  forward to the introduction  of  television

with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



great  eagerness.  Now  that  television  has  been

introduced,  I would have thought they  would  have

congratulated  the Government for  having  realised

their  dearest wish a little bit ahead of schedule.

However,  I  know why the Barisan  Sosialis  are  a

little bit anxious about television. It is one more

mass  medium - and a very powerful medium - with which

to  combat and circumscribe the Communists  in  the

open encounter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Government realise that there is

nothing  the  Communists dread more than  the  open

encounter, the open argument. During the  past  two

years the argument, particularly over Malaysia  and

merger, was carried out with the Communists in  the

newspapers and radio. Members will remember how  we

invited the Communists and their front men to radio

forums  which at first they accepted with  alacrity

believing  that here at last was a  chance  to  put

forward  their  case to hundreds  of  thousands  of

people. But the first encounter in which the Member

for  Queenstown participated proved to  be  such  a

disaster  for  the Communist cause that  subsequent

invitations  to  such forums were very  reluctantly

accepted  and then finally, consistently  rejected.

With  television,  the Member for Queenstown  knows

full  well  not only will he be heard but  seen  as

well.  And  to this extent, he knows that  he  will

inflict twice and probably thrice as much damage to

his  cause  as he was able to inflict by his  radio

appearance.  That  is  why I thought  he  looked  a

little  bit disconcerted yesterday when  the  Prime

Minister   extended  an  invitation  for   him   to

participate  in a television forum.  I  advise  the

Member  for  Queens-town that he can do  no  better

service  to  the  cause of non-Communist  socialist

democracy  than by appearing in a television  forum

and   pleading   the  cause  of  the  pro-Communist

Barisan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state here that the battle against

Communism and anti-national forces is as  much  one

of   restraining  their  propensity  to  resort  to

violence as it is a battle of ideas. In the  battle

of  ideas,  mass  media like radio, television  are

vital,  and the Government intends to use  them  as

effectively as possible to safeguard the democratic

system as well as the security of Malaysia. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



Barisan  Sosialis and their Communist mentors  know

that  we  can use this mass media to counter  their

propaganda  effectively in  this  battle  with  the

Communists.  Recently, the battle over  merger  and

Malaysia was largely a propaganda battle, sustained

and  relentless, but in the end, we showed that the

non-Communist  socialists can win this  propagandas

battle ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in explanation of this motion, I would like to inform the House that yesterday the House passed a motion approving that at the rising of the Assembly today we adjourn to the 7th of June, 1963. As Members of the House are aware, 12 o'clock midnight is the end of Tuesday, and it would, therefore, be impossible for this Assembly

<br><br>7.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> As I said, Sir, the battle

against  the Communists is a battle of  ideas,  and

yesterday  the Member for Queenstown paid unwitting

tribute   to   the   efficacy  of  the   democratic

propaganda against Communist propaganda during  the

Malaysia  battle. He said that the  Government  was

pressing  ahead with plans to have more radios  and

T.V. sets  in  the rural areas because  the  blank

votes  were higher in the rural areas.  This  is  a

correct  appraisal of the situation. In  the  urban

areas,   thanks  to  fuller  coverage   by   radio,

newspapers  and  Rediffusion,  the  open   argument

between  the  democratic forces and the  Communists

reached  the  ears of the ordinary men who,  having

heard   both  sides  of  the  case,  rejected   the

Communist case in favour of the democratic case. In

the  rural areas, however, Communist propaganda was

pressed   through  such  outfits  as  the   Country

People's   Association  and  the  Rural   Dwellers'

Association. The democratic case did not reach  the

ears of the rural people as widely as the Communist

case,  or  rather Communist rumours and falsehoods.

So the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



for  Queenstown knows that once T.V. and radio  are

introduced into the rural areas as well, we can not

only  begin to nail down every Communist  falsehood

and  rumour but bring home to the rural people  the

simple  truth, that the democratic system can  give

them a better life. Therefore, this violent dislike

for  television  and radio by the Communists  means

that  we  have done the right thing in establishing

these new mass media and it would certainly be  one

big nail in the Communist coffin.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis may also be interested to

know  that towards the latter part of the  year,  a

second television channel will be established,  and

next  year  a  third channel and  television,  like

other  mass  media,  will be  effective  allies  of

democracy  against the Barisan Sosialis  and  their

Communist manipulators. Unable, therefore, to offer

serious  criticism  of  the  achievements  of   the

Government,  the Barisan Sosialis  leaders  do  not

know  what  to  do. All they can offer  by  way  of

improvement  to  the motion on the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's speech is an amendment "to truthfully  and

honestly ascertain the views of the people on their

constitutional future". This is, I  think,  one  of

the  most  astonishing cases of collective  amnesia

that  I  have come across, because many of us  will

remember  that  some  eight  months  ago,  on   1st

September,  the  people of Singapore  went  to  the

polls  to  decide  on their constitutional  future.

They  had to decide whether they wanted merger with

autonomy  in  education  and  labour,  or  complete

merger, or merger on terms available to the  Borneo

territories.  I  distinctly  remember  the  Barisan

Sosialis running around telling the people that all

these  three  alternatives were bad  and  that  the

people  of  Singapore should show their disapproval

of these three alternatives by casting blank votes.

We  all know that the outcome was that over 70  per

cent  of  the people voted for alternative A,  that

is, merger with autonomy, and only some 25 per cent

east blank votes. We know that the result came as a

shock to the Communists, and also to the Member for

Hong  Lim,  who  also had been running  around  for

reasons of his own asking the people to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



cast blank votes. The fact that the Communists  got

only  25  per  cent  of  the  votes  exploded   the

Communist  myth  which  they  got  even  many  non-Communists  to  believe, that  the  Communists  had

unassailable   influence   over   the   masses   of

Singapore. This myth of the mass influence  of  the

Communists  was often used to neutralise  the

non-Communists  with  the threat that  if  they  openly

opposed  the Communists, then they would  be  dealt

with  when  the  Communists won  the  next  general

election. So the fact that the Communists were able

to   influence  only  25  per  cent - and  even  that

percentage must be shared with the Member for  Hong

Lim because he also campaigned for blank votes;  so

if  we  give  him  5  per cent, then  at  best  the

Communists were able to influence only 20 per  cent

of  the electorate to follow their line. And  as  a

result  of  the explosion of this myth of Communist

mass  influence,  today more and  more  people  are

prepared  to stand up to the Communists. The  power

of  Communist  intimidation has  been  considerably

weakened  as a result of the exposure of this  myth

of Communist mass influence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more disastrous for the Communists has been

the  impact of this defeat on the weaker  of  their

Communist   supporters.  These  weaker   of   their

Communist  supporters, these weaker  comrades,  had

trailed after the Communists in the fond hope  that

they  were on the winning side, that they were with

a Party which had the majority of the masses behind

it. But now the Party which could only mobilise  25

per  cent of the electorate, and that by and  large

from the rural areas, could no longer hold the  old

fascination  for  the  weaker  followers   of   the

Communist  cause. So, therefore,  one  myth  having

been   destroyed - the   myth   of   Communist   mass

influence - it  became necessary for  the  Communists

and the Barisan Sosialis in the interest of its own

survival  to create yet another new myth to  repair

the  damage and prevent demoralisation among  their

dwindling  supporters. Therefore, the new  myth  is

now  being  developed  that  the  defeat  that  the

Communists suffered at the referendum was  illusory

and that they, in fact, had the masses behind them.

The myth, as propagated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



by  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  is  that  the

referendum was dishonest and rigged. In fact,  Sir,

you  will  remember that hilarious moment yesterday

when  the  Member for Queenstown drew attention  to

the  results  of the two Gallup polls conducted  in

Tanjong  Pagar  and Kreta Ayer by Barisan  Sosialis

and  Communist supporters or dupes in  the  Nanyang

University   and  the  Singapore  University.   The

referendum    in   which   some   600,000    voters

participated, he dismissed as unrepresentative. The

results   of  that  referendum,  he  dismissed   as

unrepresentative  of public opinion.  But  the  two

Gallup  polls  conducted by pro-Communist  students

and dupes supervised by Communists and limited to a

few  thousand selected subjects in these two  areas

are  now  held  forward seriously as evidence  that

these  two  Gallup polls proved that the Communists

had  a  vast  majority of the people  behind  them.

Apparently in these two Gallup polls, well over  90

per  cent  of the people cast blank votes, implying

therefore that the 25 per cent blank votes  in  the

referendum  was  not  truly representative  of  the

people. Surely. Sir, the Member for Queenstown, who

is a fully grown adult male, does not expect either

this  Assembly or the people to take what  he  says

seriously.  This business of a private Gallup  poll

being  more  reliable  than a nationally  organised

referendum  may go down well among the infants  who

formed  the  large proportion of the crowd  at  the

Barisan Sosialis rally held a few weeks ago at  the

Badminton  Hall. But surely, Sir,  the  Member  for

Queenstown  must  be  on  the  verge  of  a  mental

breakdown  if  he  expects adults  to  accept  this

thesis,  that his own Gallup poll is more  reliable

than the nationally organised referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, Sir, the Member for Thomson suggested

that  the  referendum was rigged.  If  the  Barisan

Sosialis really believe this, then they could  very

well  have taken the matter to Court, produced  the

evidence and set aside the referendum. But  as  far

as  I know, Sir, they have not done so. I know they

made art attempt just before polling day



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 344</b></font><br><br>



to get the Supreme Court to restrain the Referendum

Superintendent from exercising his powers, but  the

argument   was  so  unconvincing  that  the   Court

rejected  their plea. But, I think, Sir,  there  is

one  authority whose testimony about  the  honesty,

the  regularity of the referendum, no single member

of  the  Barisan  Sosialis can question.  And  that

authority  is none other than Mr Lim Ching  Siong.

On  the night of the 1st of September after polling

had  closed,  Mr  Lim Ching  Siong  was  asked  by

Pressmen  to  comment on the polling, and  this  is

what he said, and I quote from the Sunday Times  of

September 2, 1962:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Said Mr Lim: "We are sure the majority of the

people have cast blank votes in protest against the

dishonest referendum."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if Mr Lim Ching Siong had thought that

the  referendum  had  been rigged  or  in  any  way

tampered   with,  he  would  not   have   said   so

categorically that he was certain that the majority

of  the people had cast blank votes. If the Barisan

Sosialis leaders had thought that the balloting had

been  so  rigged that it would have  precluded  the

people  from  casting blank votes,  the  Communists

would  not have got their followers to camp outside

Badminton  Hall that night to celebrate a  possible

victory. If the Barisan Communists had thought that

the referendum had been rigged, they would not have

waited until the very early hours of the morning to

watch  the  ballot  papers being  counted  and  the

results  announced; nor would  they,  if  they  had

believed  that the balloting had been rigged,  have

asked  for a recount and then scooted off from  the

Badminton  Hall immediately after the counting  had

begun.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Communists know that the referendum was

fairly  held. The only trouble is that they  really

believed their own myth, that their influence  over

the  masses was unassailable. So when they got only

a  25 per cent vote which was worse than even their

most pessimistic prediction, they knew that the end

had  come.  What angered them even more,  I  think,

Sir, was that the Government had at the last moment

decided to accede to the plea that they had made



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



that  the blank votes should be counted separately.

I  think they would have given their right arm that

night  for the Government to have decided to  count

the  blank votes with the other votes because  then

they  could have gone out and said, "Yes, you know.

But  the blank votes exceeded all other votes." But

now,   once   having  declared  the   blank   votes

separately, it was shown with mathematical accuracy

that  at  their  best,  the Communists  could  only

muster  about 20 to 25 per cent of the  electorate,

and  that from the rural areas where our propaganda

had  not been able to reach the rural masses.  This

fact,  the realisation that they no longer had  the

support  of  the people, has pushed the  Communists

and  the  Barisan Sosialis into a new and dangerous

course.   They   knew  that  they  had   lost   the

constitutional struggle in Singapore and that  with

the  advent  of Malaysia their chances  of  winning

power constitutionally were gone for good. So  they

decided  on violence. The only way they could  halt

merger  and  Malaysia was not by  a  constitutional

struggle  in  Singapore, but by violence;  and  the

battlefield of violence was first Brunei. Sir, I do

not  wish  to go into details about the involvement

of  the Barisan Sosialis members and Communists  in

the  armed revolt that took place in Brunei.  There

is a White Paper on the subject. I think there is a

motion  when Communist Barisan Sosialis  connection

with  the  violent revolt in Brunei would be  spelt

out.  However,  the fact to be noted  is  that  the

Singapore Communists knew that they could no longer

rely on the people of Singapore to fight their

anti-Malaysia  and  anti-merger  battle  and  that   the

Singapore Communists had now to rely on Azahari and

foreign  volunteers  to fight  their  anti-Malaysia

battle  for them. The Singapore Communists and  the

Barisan Sosialis hoped that the violent struggle in

Brunei  would  then spread to Singapore,  and  that

from  Singapore they could provide fuel and support

for  the  violence  in Brunei and  other  parts  of

Malaysia.  If the violence which started in  Brunei

could  spread  to  Singapore, the Communists  hoped

that this would give them a chance of imposing,  by

force, what they could not get the people of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



Singapore to do by constitutional means,  that  is,

to  break up Malaysia. Fortunately, Sir, the Brunei

revolt fizzled out, and so there was one last  hope

for  the so-called anti-colonialists. Just as  they

went  to  see  certain  colonialists  in  the  U.K.

Commission to help to break up merger, to come to a

deal. So this time, after the revolt in Brunei  had

fizzled  out,  they were banking on the  fact  that

relations between Malaya and Indonesia would worsen

so that the confrontation would pass from a passive

to   an   active  stage  when  they  hoped  foreign

volunteers  and  armies would invade  Malaysia  and

help to break up Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was when the Barisan Sosialis and the

Communists  not only openly supported violence  but

were  also engaged in playing the treacherous  role

of  supporting  intervention by foreign  volunteers

that the Internal Security Council decided that the

Communists  now  constituted not  anti-colonialists

but fifth columnists in our midst. These Communists

were  arrested not because they were our  political

opponents. We tolerated them for two years. We gave

them  every  opportunity to say  or  do  what  they

liked.  So  it  was  not  because  they  were   our

political  opponents but because  they  had  become

fifth  columnists - to sell Singapore  and  Malaysia

not  only to racketeers, "bums and liars" like  Mr

Azahari, and like Osmena who says he is prepared to

do  a  deal  on  Malaysia for  something  like  $10

million.  But worse than that. The Barisan Sosialis

have  become stooges of foreign powers and  foreign

groups like the Indonesian Communist Party.  It  is

because the people know of this role that they  are

playing  today - that the Barisan  Sosialis  are  not

anti-colonialists - that the detention  of  over  100

Barisan Sosialis supporters has not brought about a

single  reaction from the people.  We  know  for  a

fact, Sir, that the Barisan Sosialis leaders on the

day  some of them were arrested, tried to get  some

of  the  unionists like those in the Singapore  Bus

Workers'  Union to go on strike. But this time  the

people of Singapore had come to know the real  role

of  the Barisan Sosialis - that they were treacherous

fifth columnists.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



Therefore,  when the Barisan Sosialis leaders  were

locked  up, there was not a tear shed. That is  why

unlike before, in 1956-57 when the Communists  were

arrested,  there was reaction because they  managed

to  wangle  into the real anti-colonial  front  and

pose as anti-colonial martyrs. But today they stand

condemned  as traitors to our country  and  to  our

people.  So  however much they  tried  to  mobilise

support  for  the  100-odd  people  who  had   been

detained,  they  could  not get  a  single  protest

meeting.  They  held  a  protest  meeting  at   the

Badminton Hall where over 40 per cent of those  who

attended  were school children. In fact,  Sir,  the

Member  for  Upper  Serangoon made  an  observation - over  40  per cent were school children, the  same

kind  of school children whom they used during  the

Malaysia  debate as a cover to precipitate conflict

between the police and school children in order  to

work  up  indignation. At that protest meeting  the

same  school children were there, so much  so  that

the   Member  for  tipper  Serangoon  said,  "Well,

friends,  at  this meeting we can  see  very  young

people.  It is only the old people who support  the

Government." What he meant was that they could fool

only  infants. And perhaps there will come a  time,

Sir, when at a mass meeting of the Barisan Sosialis

we  would  see  hundreds of perambulators,  because

they  would have stopped deceiving school  children

of 15 and 16 years of age and would have to deceive

children of 5 and 6 years.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> From the kindergartens.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> So that is the reason, Sir - not

because they are our political opponents, since  we

were  prepared to tolerate them - but  because  the

moment   they   entered  into  a  conspiracy   with

foreigners  and  racketeers to sell out  Singapore,

they  had  become  the stooges  of  racketeers  and

foreigners. It was then that the I.S.C. felt  that

the time had come to call a halt to people who were

using the democratic system to stage not a national

revolution  or even a Communist revolution  but  to

sell out Singapore to foreign elements.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we had confirmation yesterday of the real

role  of  the  Barisan Sosialis -  that they  are  no

longer  a national Party. We always said they  were

anti-national,   but  nobody   believed   it.   But

yesterday the Member for Queenstown came out with a

startling  statement. After  nearly  two  years  of

saying  that at least the Barisan Sosialis supports

the  concept of Malaysia, he yesterday argued  that

there  was  now  no  affinity  between  the  Borneo

territories, Singapore and Malaya. He said that the

Borneo  territories  have nothing  in  common  with

Singapore and Malaya, but that they should  instead

forge  a  link  with Indonesia. That fits  in  with

another  statement which they denied - a report  made

over  a  year ago in the Bintang Timur, a Communist

paper,  that  Lim  Ching Siong  had  said  that  he

preferred a merger of Singapore with Indonesia to a

merger  of Singapore with the Federation. When  the

report    was   made   known,   some    of    their

representatives here denied that such  a  statement

was  made. But now it fits, in again with a  remark

the  Member  for Thomson made in this  Chamber.  He

said  he  opposed Malaysia unless Malaysia included

Indonesia,  which  was, he said, the  heartland  of

Malaysia.  And  the  Member  for  Queenstown   said

further that Malaysia should exclude Singapore  and

Malaya, and the Borneo territories should be handed

to Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Sir, the Barisan Sosialis have now been

reduced to being traitors, of acting as stooges  of

foreign  elements. Their only hope today is  for  a

real  open  conflict,  a violent  conflict  between

Indonesia  and Malaya. They have a vested  interest

today  in a warfare between the peoples of the  two

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I would suggest that the 13 Barisan

Sosialis   Members  have  today   ceased   tot   be

representatives  of the people of  Singapore.  They

are  not  the representatives of those who  elected

them.  They  have become representatives  of  alien

racketeers and of foreign Communist Parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the communist position is such that they

can only save their political skins by the betrayal

of their country and their people to foreign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



racketeers  amid  by pleading in this  chamber  the

cause  of alien Communists. Therefore, I say it  is

the  Barisan  Sosialis who are today real  colonial

stooges - stooges of new colonial masters. This  is

the   shameful   state  to  which   the   Singapore

Communists have been reduced, and they have been so

reduced  because  they  have  underestimated   the

strength  and  the intelligence of  the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Member for Queenstown warned that

blood  would be shed if Malaysia was pushed through

by  31st  August. I would like to  ask  him:  whose

blood  is  going to be shed? If the blood  that  is

going to be shed is that of the 14 Barisan Sosialis

Members, well, that is their own business.  But  if

they are planning to shed other people's blood,  if

they  are planning to use school children, as  they

have  done  in  the  past,  as  cover  tot  protect

themselves and get blood to flow, or use workers or

other innocent victims, then let us tell them  that

the  Government and the people are ready to  ensure

that  if any blood flows, it will not be the  blood

of  innocent  people.  Or, knowing  full  well  the

Barisan  Sosialis  tactics over  Brunei,  are  they

hoping  for foreign volunteers to shed their  blood

for them, as the Brunei workers shed their blood to

sustain  the Barisan Sosialis? Obviously,  what  is

quite  clear  is  that  the  Barisan  Sosialis  are

preparing  to  go  down with  a  bang  before  31st

August. The threats of violence and bloodshed  that

have  been uttered by Barisan Sosialis leaders from

lime to time may be intended as a bluff to frighten

the  people, to show how tough they are.  Well,  if

that  is all that they are doing, we wish them good

luck.  But  if  they  are contemplating,  or  their

masters behind them are contemplating  - one thing we

are  quite  sure,  the people who are  manipulating

them  regard  the Barisan Sosialis  Assemblymen  as

expendable  material - to shed the blood of  innocent

people,  then I warn them that they will  not  find

this  Government wanting in resolution and  courage

to deal with Communist violence and subversion.

<br><br>7.52 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Parliamentary Secretary to  the  Minister  for

Home  Affairs  expressed  surprise  and  hurt  that

Members  of  the Opposition did not pay tribute  or

commend  the P.A.P. Government for having  done  so

much  for  the people of Singapore. May I ease  his

conscience   by   telling  him  that   the   P.A.P.

Government  have done so much and so well  for  the

people of Singapore that when the general elections

take  place  in 1964, they will be well  and  truly

buried.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> That is what you think.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, they feel that they have

done  so  much for the people of Singapore and  yet

they are worrying as to holding the by-election  in

Sembawang.  Even  after  the  visit  by  the  Prime

Minister,  the  by-election is  still  not  in  the

books. It could be June, it could be July, it could

even  not be held at all. It is left to the  P.A.P.

Government - a  Government, according  to  their  own

claim,  that has done so much and so well  for  the

people of Singapore!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Prime Minister in his speech yesterday,

in  moving the motion that is now before the House,

said  this - and I quote page 34 [col.  169]  of  the

first  copy of the first half of Hansard.  He  said

this:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We must never make the grave error of the last

Government in believing that the neutralisation  of

a  few united front activists could mean the end of

the Communist capacity to organise and agitate when

the  time  comes  for elections. This  has  been  a

temporary setback for them in what is a grim

long-term struggle for power.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, talking of a grave error, I do not know what

they  mean.  Perhaps it was a grave error  for  the

previous   Government  to   stand   up   to   their

responsibilities and declare that the action  taken

against the Communists was an action taken  by  the

elected  Government  of  Singapore,  although   the

responsibility  for internal security  rested  with

the Chief Secretary who was a colonial official. We

need not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



have to declare that it was our responsibility, but

because  we  believed, and honestly believed,  that

the  security  of the people of Singapore  demanded

such  an  action  on  our part,  we  stood  up  and

declared that it was on our own initiative that  we

put  the  Communists in gaol for the  good  of  the

people  of Singapore. When we compare that -  talking

of  a  grave error now - the P.A.P. Government, under

the   Constitution:  "Internal  security   is   the

responsibility of the Government," and yet, in  the

motion that is to come very soon, "No, no, net  the

Singapore   Government,   the   Internal   Security

Council."  Well, that could be a grave error.  They

are  clever now; it is better for them to deny that

they  are  responsible or that  the  responsibility

rests  with  them. It was foolish for the  Lim  Yew

Hock   Government  to  say  that  they  were  fully

responsible  when  they need  not  have  to  accept

responsibility.  So, on the one  hand,  you  had  a

Government   that  need  not  have   accepted   the

responsibility but accepted it, and, on  the  other

hand,  you have the P.A.P. Government that  has  to

accept the responsibility, and denying it. It could

be  a  grave  error. Another grave error  could  be

this.  I  think  it  was  a  grave  error  now,  on

reflection. It was a grave error that the  previous

Government  did not arrest the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar. I would have done it if I had known that the

Member for Tanjong Pagar consorted with the Plen in

1956   and  1957 - as  confessed  by  him;  a

self-confessed  collaborator with the Communists.  If  I

had  known, I would have taken him in. That  was  a

grave  error. That, I am prepared to admit,  was  a

grave error. [Interruption] But next time, we  will

know how to correct the grave error.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now here again, the Minister for Culture said,

"Oh, in 1956 when the silly Lim Yew Hock Government

took  action  against the Communists  there  was  a

reaction. But now, peace and tranquility."  Let  me

explain. In 1956 when we put the Communists in, the

Member for Tanjong Pagar, using his position  as  a

Member of the Opposition,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



became  so irresponsible that he fought the  battle

of the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, if you see the 14 men behind me, I am

sure  they  themselves will admit that they  cannot

measure up to the stature of the Member for Tanjong

Pagar,  who  is now the Prime Minister.  The  Prime

Minister,  who  was  then the  Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar,  was  prepared to fight  the  cause  of  the

Communists in order to win the battle, and  to  sit

there  as the Prime Minister. That is what he  did.

That  was  why  there was so much trouble,  because

there was someone with ability who was prepared  to

sell the interest of Singapore for the interest  of

his  Party and himself. At present, if these people

were  as capable as the Prime Minister, I think  he

would  have  a  more miserable time,  but  for  the

present  I do not think they could be that capable.

At that time, was it not true, Sir, when I arrested

these  people,  up  jumped the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar,  "Motion of censure"? Now he arrested  them,

but  there is no motion of censure. And yet we  are

supporting him. We say his action was right. All we

say is that he should have done it earlier. What he

did  wrong  was  in  not doing it  earlier  and  he

allowed the interest of the people of Singapore  to

be  jeopardised, because he wanted to play the game

of  "confrontation" -  that is the word used  by  the

Indonesians  too, "confrontation" - and zugzwang.  He

wanted  to fiddle and play a zugzwang confrontation

while Singapore burned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> That is why you are still

safe here, you know that.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I will not touch on the next

motion. Action has been taken and we are waiting to

hear  why  action has been taken. He will  have  to

explain away ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> I thought we told you.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I suggest to the Prime

Minister  that we have had a period of  comparative

peace until now?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> There is peace and tranquility.

Peace and tranquility because the Opposition, apart

from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



Barisan   Sosialis,   are  a   really   responsible

Opposition.  It does not believe in thumping  their

chests here, putting up motions of censure, calling

the  Government all sorts of names,  and  demanding

all  sorts  of things. In due course,  I  shall  be

quoting  all  these  things  to  the  great   Prime

Minister  who  was then the great champion  of  the

Communists in 1956 and 1957. I will touch  on  that

later on, Sir, when he comes to the other motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after the referendum, the Assembly went to

sleep in September. Why did we go to sleep? Because

the  P.A.P. knew that they had nothing sensational

to  offer in a policy speech. Therefore, they said,

"Let  us  wait  until we can conclude an  agreement

with  the Federation to join Malaysia, then we  can

reconvene  the Assembly." If they had succeeded  in

concluding the agreement, their policy speech would

have been a very stirring one, "We got this; we got

that;   we   got  everything  for  the  people   of

Singapore."  And why it took such a long  time  for

them   to  succeed,  for  them  to  conclude   that

agreement?   it  was  not  because  there   was   a

deliberate delay on the part of, shall we say,  the

other  party,  but it was due to the cleverness  of

the  Prime Minister, who is sometimes far, far  too

clever. He thought that it was a wonderful thing to

negotiate  in  the Press. He told the Press  first,

"This is what I want to do. This is our stand," and

lie  left  the Federation alone. It was because  of

that that hurt their feelings. You cannot negotiate

important  matters of that kind in the Press.  Next

time  they  should  do it on television!  No,  Sir,

because  they did it, that caused the  delay.  That

caused  the  other party to stand up and  say,  "If

that is the way that man is going to do it, let  us

tell  him a few home truths." And that is too  bad.

If  he  had not shown his cleverness but kept quiet

and  not  talked as much as he wanted, thumped  the

table  as much as he wanted in the Conference Room,

things  would have been solved by now.  As  it  is,

they have not solved it. Tomorrow he is going again

tot  talk and I wish him luck. But I bet they would

have delayed the reconvening of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



this Assembly had it not been for the fact that His

Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara has to  visit

Cambodia  and go on his pilgrimage to  Mecca.  They

were  caught.  Therefore  they  produced  a  policy

speech.  It  is  no policy speech  at  all.  I  can

sympathise  with the Government, and  generally  we

extend  sympathies to people who are going to  die,

or  to  people  who are already dead and, to  that

extent, I extend our sympathies to the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me come to the speech of the Minister

for  Culture. He was saying how clever  the  P.A.P.

was:  beat the Communists in every round, at  every

count,  the opening encounter; they won, yes,  they

won.  They won because they are mare adept  in  the

art of double-talk. Definitely double-talk, Sir! To

take  a very simple illustration. According to  the

Referendum Ordinance, blank votes should be counted

together  with votes for A. That was the  law.  But

because  they  found out that,  "Oh,  blank  votes,

tidak  apa,  lah.  Let us have some  fun  with  the

Barisan.  Count separately." If they had  meant  to

count  separately, why did they resist an amendment

from  me  and  from  the Barisan that  blank  votes

should  be  declared separately?  They  dared  not.

Because  they  were not so sure. Because  if  blank

votes were to be declared separately, it would turn

the  tables  on them. But because they  found  that

blank  votes meant nothing to them, and they  could

use  that  to  twist the tail of the Barisan,  they

said,  "Count  blank  votes!"  And  they  called  a

special  sitting of this Assembly just to  ridicule

the  Barisan. "Oh, you can have the blank votes  in

any  way  you want - B, C, or whatever you like.  All

the  blank votes. Never mind, "whereas the law says

blank  votes mean A. In this double-talk, they  are

more adept, they are cleverer. The Barisan are poor

innocents and do not come up to the standard of the

Prime  Minister. Sir, I would have  exposed  this - I

cannot  use the word "trickery" - double-talk had  it

not  been  that  the  cause  was  a  sacred  cause,

Malaysia ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Hear, hear!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock</b> - and to beat the Communists, we would never lend ourselves to defend them and to break



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



Malaysia.  Because it was Malaysia, we kept  quiet, and

let them win the day. If they won the  day  at the  expense of their poor

ex-comrades,  it  is  no loss  to us. In fact, all I can say is, "Next

time if they try to he too clever and say that ---"



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> They found a hatchet man.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> A hatchet man is usually a very short man,

Sir, not a man of stature. Maybe  there is a hatchet man there.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is why they said, "Oh, this confrontation!" They are sure to win, because they are more clever. In fact, when the P.A.P. came in, what did they say? "Ban rock and roll!" But now they are indulging in a new dance - the twist. And they twist so cleverly that the twist is a first-class dance with the P.A.P. Government. Every time they twist. They know how to twist all the words they use. First-class double-talk! These poor ex-comrades of the P.A.P., left behind, do not know how to twist the P.A.P., whereas the P.A.P. keep on twisting their tail, and there is no response. It is not for me to try and save them from any dilemma that they are now in. But what I want to say to the P.A.P. is this, "Do not crow. The fact that you are able to get this quiet, this peace, was because men of responsibility side with you." If we had wanted to play politics in the way that they have been playing when they were here, there would have been merry hell. But that is not our way of looking after the interests of the country. We will support them on their motion. Sorry, Sir, I should not anticipate the debate on the next motion. We have said we are with them so long as they do the right thing. But at any time when they do the wrong thing, we will chop them. In fact, in this Assembly, after Sembawang, it will be the Alliance who will declare the funeral day of the P.A.P. and not the Barisan Sosialis who, now that all their ghost-writers have been taken away, do not know how to reply to all the twists and double-twists rind treble-twists of the P.A.P. Ministers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I forget, there is a wonderful twist here. Sir, you

remember that when the  P.A.P. came  to power,  they created Parliamentary

Secretaries  and Political Secretaries, and the question was  asked, "What

is  a  Parliamentary Secretary?  What  is  a Political  Secretary?" And the

Prime  Minister,  in Hansard,  Volume  11, No. 9, dated  2nd  September,

1959, column 536, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Parliamentary Secretary, as the term designates,

carries the burden of  the  Minister's parliamentary  duties, and

to the extent  that  the Minister  designates or delegates, he  carries

the burden of the Minister's ministerial duties.'



<br><br>That   means  he  is a  junior  Minister  in   the Government.  Sir,  the Acting Minister  for

Labour stood  up yesterday and said how good their  policy is,  how well they look after labour, and how  much they  allow trade unions to run on proper lines.  I have  said  in  this Assembly that a  Parliamentary Secretary can never be a Secretary-General  of  any trade   union,  and  what  is  worse  is   that   a Parliamentary Secretary is the Secretary-General of a  union of Government employees. And yet they talk of yellow unions, and all sorts of things. I do not know  what  to call it. I warned them. I told  them that  it  could  not  be  done.  I  did  tell   the Parliamentary  Secretary concerned to  declare  his loyalty. He is either with the Government  or  with the  workers. He cannot have dual loyalty.  It  has now  happened. The Parliamentary Secretary  to  the Minister  for  Culture  said,  "The  Minister   for Finance  is  all  wrong. The A U.P.E. will  go  on strike." The Minister for Finance said, "The  Union is  all rotten. It is bad. It should wait till 31st August before it presses on with its claim."  There was   so   much  argument  that  the  Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture had a  ballot taken and his union is going on strike. And that is not  too  bad. But what came out in this  morning's Malayan Times at page 5, takes the cake. "Kandasamy Accuses  P.A.P.  Government".  Sir,  Kandasamy   is accusing himself! "The Amalgamated Union of  Public Employees  yesterday  accused the  People's  Action Party  Government of cowardice, and Radio Singapore of  slanting the news." Radio Singapore, Sir? Under his Ministry? He is the Parliamentary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



Secretary to the Minister for Culture. The  control of  Radio

Singapore is under his  Ministry.  Radio Singapore  distorts the news!

I do not know.  Well, maybe  Kandasamy,  the  Secretary-General,

accuses Kandasamy,  the  Parliamentary Secretary.  This  is what  I

mean by P.A.P. first-class twist and  turn. They know how to twist.

This is what he said. Fancy the  Parliamentary Secretary saying that!

This  is terrible,  Sir, if what he said is  right.  I  hope somebody

in the Malayan Tunes is not going  to  be put in under the P.P.S.O.

This is what he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Apparently the Government has only the nerve and courage to fight

and threaten the young  girls  of the midwifery service who are prepared

to fight for their  rights.  They have no guts [I  do  not  know whether

it is parliamentary, but it is all  right; it  is in the newspapers] to

tackle the postal  and telecommunication workers.'



<br><br>That  is  what Kandasamy said. Now, I do  not  know whether  Kandasamy will get the sack or whether

he will sack the Government. I do not know. Maybe this is  P.A.P. style

which I find very  difficult  to understand. And then he accuses Radio

Singapore  of distorting news. He says that Radio Singapore tells all

sorts of things:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Touching on Radio Singapore, Mr Kandasamy, who is also Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Culture,  whose portfolio includes Radio

Singapore, said,  "Radio  Singapore has been  announcing  that only  the

unresolved claims would be  directed  to arbitration,  thus giving the

impression  that  the other  claims are settled. If Radio Singapore would

care  to compare the Gazette notification [I  would say  if

the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Culture  would  care to

compare  the  Gazette notification] and the strike notice,  it  would  be

very obvious that all claims, with the exception of the  claims  for  the

midwives,  were  directed  to arbitration."'



<br><br>Sir,  this  is  just putting the  Government  in  a ridiculous position.

A Parliamentary Secretary,  in the  words  of  the Prime Minister, shares

in  the ministerial responsibility of the Minister, and  he shares  in the

responsibility of controlling  Radio Singapore. And now he says that

Radio Singapore  is distorting  his  own news! Well, I  would  ask  the

Government to solve it the P.A.P. style.  They  can only  solve it in the

P.A.P. style! I do  not  know how to solve it myself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few things here I would like to touch on. The Yang di-Pertuan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 358</b></font><br><br>



Negara's  speech  contains this little  passage  at column 5, "Because of

the careful budgeting and the economy  measures taken in 1959-60 --- ".

What  are the  economy  measures?  An arbitrary  slashing  of salaries

imposed on the civil servants!  And  they were  told  that  if

they started  squealing  they should go down on their bended knees and

thank  the gods  that nothing worse had happened to  them.  At that  time,

there were 43 of them. Therefore,  they put out their chests and said,

"You had better take it,  brothers, or you get worse." So they took  it.

Then  when  three of their numbers went  over,  and another 14 went over,

they felt that something  was wrong; so they restored the allowances of

the civil servants  but then they restored them  only  for  a certain

period. So there is a period  between  the time   when   the   cut

was   imposed   and   the restoration - that  little  bit.  Is  the

Government going  to wait until election time and say,  "Okay, civil

servants! I give you back this salary cut  of yours.  You  know that

the P.A.P. is  a  very  good Government.  Vote, lah."? Do not do  that.

If  the salary  cuts  had been restored because  they  were wrongly

imposed, then come out into the  open  and say,  "We did it. We thought

that we were facing  a deficit.  But now we find that we have  a

surplus. Okay,  we  will  repay it to you  because  that  is rightly your

money." It is most immoral to try  and say  that  they have got a very good

balance  when they  took  that money arbitrarily from  the  civil servants!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I talk on housing? The Government are very fond of showing off.

Look at what the Housing Board have  done. We have done so much now. My

questions have  elicited,  Sir, that insofar  as  housing  is concerned,

3,098 units were vacant on  31st  March this year. That is not such a big

figure, but if we are  to  consider it in terms of money lost to  the

Housing Board - the amount I worked out is $165,510 a month - that  is  the

revenue lost  to  the  Housing Board,  because these Units are vacant.

That  I  am sure the Finance Minister would not and should  not tolerate.

Houses are built to be occupied. This  is a  waste  of $165,510 a month.

I did ask  how  many units  were  vacant for a year and more,

how  many were vacant for six months



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 359</b></font><br><br>



to a year, and from three months to six months. And the  amount worked out  - even on a very conservative estimate - is  that they lost half a million

dollars in   rents  last  year,  because  the  houses  were unoccupied.

Therefore, in order to get  people  to occupy  those  houses, what did

they do?  Yes,  the Crawford Street reverted property suddenly occurred

to  them. Wonderful! If we could tell the residents of  Crawford Street,

"This is reverted property. We want  to  rebuild this area. Come  on,  go

to  the Housing  Board  houses."  "Sixty  dollars?"  "Never mind,  you

pay.  These are wonderful  flats."  The tenants there appealed to the

Government that  they could  not  afford  a rent of $60  nor  could  they

afford  the rent of $40. But they were prepared  to move. From the figures

I got from the Minister  for National  Development,  the  Government,  it

would seem, are forcing people to take up Housing Board flats because

they are empty, and because they  are losing  revenue. That is why they

have  told  these people they are going to build. Why are they  going to

build? Where are they going to get the money to have  a  big housing estate

around Crawford Street? You cannot do that. They have less than year before

they  are buried. What are they trying to do?  They are trying to force

people to go into Housing Board flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is this. In Henderson

Road, that  is Tiong Bahru Road, the previous much-maligned S.I.T. built

houses  prewar and rented  those  houses  at $7.00 a month. After the war,

I think the rent  has been  increased to $11.00. The Government  says

to the  occupiers of these houses - a few  hundred  of them   - that the

maintenance cost is very  high  and "You  had  better go; we have a lot

of  houses  for you." They are forcing them to give up cheap houses to

take  up  Housing Board houses that  have  been vacant for nearly a year

in order to cover up their over-zealousness in housing, although there is

less demand  for it. The supply is more than the  demand now.  On  the

ground that the Trust flats in  Tiong Bahru  require a lot of maintenance

and  are  most uneconomical, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 360</b></font><br><br>



Housing  Board offer them new flats but  at  higher rent.

But the tenants say, "If it is uneconomical, we will bear the cost of the

maintenance." I do not know  how they are going on with this. This is  the

kind of housing they have. In their desire to prove that  they  are doing

something, they put  up  more houses  than  required. And half-a-million

dollars has gone down the drain, Mr Finance Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the other point. The Prime Minister's visits to the rural areas. At the bottom

of column 11:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Prime Minister's visits to the rural

constituencies have helped get closer co-ordination between Government

planners and the rural people...'.



<br><br>This  is what the Government says. What

the  people know is this. Before the prime Minister goes on his visits,

the names of a good number of  people  who are  of  some influence there

will be taken to  the Prime  Minister's Office, and invitations  will  be

sent  out, and they will be invited to Sri Tamasek. There will be a very

friendly discussion. They will come  back  to the rural areas and try to

get  the people  to  appreciate the importance of the  Prime Minister's

visit. And they will say, "Oh, you know, on  Sunday  the great Prime

Minister is  coming.  I think  we should do something about it. I think

we should  give $30.00." So the poor shopkeeper  says, "What  am  I

to do? If I say no, mati, my  licence might  be stopped. If I say yes,

why should I waste $30.00?"  Take  the line of least resistance,  give

$30.00. So, big fireworks, crackers and what-not to welcome  the  Prime

Minister.  It  looks  well  on Television  and in photographs. It could

have  got the  Barisan people all stumped. But what  happened as  soon as

the Prime Minister stepped down? People were  cursing. There were loud

curses.  "Never  saw such a man; never came to us. And now come to us to

offer what? Sweets, with poison inside?" "You  want a community centre?

O.K., it will be there. What do you  want, a school? It will be there;

I will  even come and build it. Do not worry." And they have  to accuse

us of corruption. That is worse, Sir.  That is nothing but political

corruption. They lay plans for the next general



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



election that is going to come next year. That kind of  making use of

the public money to go round  and get  the  people  to say how good the

great  Prime Minister  is.  The great Prime Minister  was  never good

before because he never saw them; and now  he goes round. He even went

to Sembawang, the scene of the  by-election  to  come. He shed  tears.

"Ahmad Ibrahim  was  a brave man with guts." I  feel  like shedding tears

and saying, "Thank God, poor  Ahmad, you  had died. If you had remained,

you would  have died  of shock at the way the P.A.P. is now doing." Anyway,

a good man always gets gathered  unto  the Father much earlier. It

could be that he was  taken back to heaven ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is why he had lived so long.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Because he had joined the wrong Party! And God

said it was better for him to  come up  before  the  smash that was

coming.  That  the people who slept with the Communists will now  turn out

to  arrest Communists. That is the shame  that Ahmad  Ibrahim would have

suffered if  he  had  not died.  And  it was because of them that  maybe

the Prime  Minister cried. And I could cry if I  really wanted to feel

sorry for Ahmad Ibrahim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Crocodile tears!



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> So he described the Prime Minister's tears as crocodile tears.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Your tears.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I have no tears, but the Prime Minister had. I could have cried but I did not. And the Prime Minister says in column 19:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The implementation of these arrangements after 31st August will

require a great deal of tact  and patience.'



<br><br>A great deal of tact and patience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are confident that with understanding and brotherly give-and-take,

temporary dislocations can be kept to a minimum.'



<br><br>Would  you call it tact, Sir, if what I read in  a newspaper

published in Kuala  Lumpur  is  correct? Here  you  have  a  great

Prime Minister  going  to declare the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



Jurong  Wharf  open.  That is  grand - all  pomp  and grandeur.  Was

there tact when  he  said  that  he invited  the  Prime Minister of

the  Federation  of Malaya  to  come  to witness this  opening  but

he declined?  He  preferred to go to the races.  Would you  call it

tact - the P.A.P. style of tact? And yet as  far  as  I  know no invitation

had  ever  been issued. That is tact, that is the wonderful  P.A.P. style

of  tact. Let us have less of  that  and  it would   be  better  for  the

relationship  between Singapore and the Federation. That is not the  kind

of  tact  we  want.  That  does  not  help  in  the relationship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am sorry if I take time because I am trying to cut down on this.

Column 6:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Honourable Members of the House must have known of the deep

regret  the  people  felt  over  the differences that have arisen between

the Federation of Malaya and the Republic of Indonesia.'



<br><br>And further down:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`So whatever minor differences may arise from time to

time  between Singapore and Kuala  Lumpur  over chickens  and  eggs, or

pigs and paints,  we  stand solidly  with them on all the vital questions

that affect Malaysia,...'.



<br><br>I  support  that. But against that,  what  did

the Prime Minister do? You know, in one of his tours in the  rural

constituencies he said, "Our policy with Indonesia  is  the  right

policy.  The  Federation policy is the wrong policy." So much so that

there has  been talk in town. Is it because Lee & Lee are the  legal

advisers  to the Indonesian  Government that their policy is the right

policy? And yet here they  say  that in everything they support  Malaya.

That  again is P.A.P. culture, P.A.P. twist, P.A.P. double-talk. Let

them mean what they say.  We  will always  support  them in what they mean - what  they say, or to mean what they want to mean to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will come to the Communist one later. I do not think I

should worry about the Communist  one.  I support this one. Column 8:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Borneo territories need capital for development.

The Central Government has promised to do  its  utmost  to provide

the necessary  finance. Singapore must be prepared to make its contribution

in loans and other



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 363</b></font><br><br>



assistance  to  help  the  Central  Government   in helping development

of the Borneo territories.'



<br><br>I   strongly  support  this.  And  it  would  be  a wonderful  gesture

on the part  of  the  Singapore Government  if  we  could have  one

road  in  each territory and name it "Singapore Road". That  would forever

be  a reminder to the peoples in  Sarawak, Borneo  and Brunei that we in

Singapore share  with them  their  hopes, their aspirations and  will  do

what we can to help them in their development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, all this talk about the Internal Security Council saying such a

thing as at column 4:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But we must always be vigilant. There are still some in our midst actively

trying  to  disrupt national  security  and  sabotage  our  plans

for Malaysia.'



<br><br>Who is to be vigilant, the P.A.P. Government or the I.S.C.?

I agree we all must he vigilant. We call on the  Prime Minister to be more

vigilant. If he  has not  yet disclosed who the Plen is, where he lives,

tell  it to his Special Branch. If a Prime Minister can do that kind of a

thing, who knows who the Plen is,  and where he is, and hides it; and yet

the law says, if  I know where a Communist lives and  know that he is

wanted, and if I do not go and tell  the police,  I will go to gaol.

But the Prime  Minister is   above  the  law,  especially  a  P.A.P.

Prime Minister. He is well above the law. If he wants the public to

co-operate and work, and be more vigilant so  that the Communists are

totally wiped out,  let him  show  an  example. Do not turn  round  in

his Battle  for Merger, "I talked with the Plen in  the Legislative

Assembly." If I had known in  1956  and 1957  that the Member for Tanjong

Pagar could  have been keeping company with Lim Ching Siong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would not like to take up too much time on this. I have tried to get

across the views  of  my Party  on  the  Negara's speech. What  we  are

all waiting for and what the Barisan people are waiting for  is  the next

motion to get cracking, and  then let  us see what kind of stuff the P.A.P.

Ministers are made of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on motion moved by

the Prime Minister and on the  amendment moved by the Member for

Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> We will get on with the debate on item No. 3

of the Order Paper, the debate to range over  not  only the main motion

hut also  over  the amendment. Dr Goh.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I wish to confine  myself  only  to

certain  remarks made by the Member for Queenstown

in  his  speech  on  the Yang  di-Pertuan  Negara's

speech.  I  am concerned with that portion  of  his

speech dealing with Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Barisan Sosialis, as the leading

Communist  front  organisation  in  Singapore,  has

"fought"  Malaysia,  though the campaign  conducted

has  not  been as skilful as it should  have  been.

They   have  lost  the  open  confrontation   which

culminated  in  the referendum last September.  The

Member for Queenstown is now trying to pretend that

they  did not really lose the referendum.  He  said

yesterday  that  if only Members of  this  Assembly

would accept the result of the Nanyang students'

so-called  academic research project  carried  out  in

Tanjong  Pagar  and Kreta Ayer, then  we  would  be

persuaded that the people of Singapore were  indeed

against  merger and Malaysia. But, Sir,  I  am  not

going  to  waste the time of the House in rebutting

arguments  as feeble, as foolish and as  futile  as

the  Member  for  Queenstown has advanced  on  this

issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to the main substance of his argument, and

it consists of this. He said that for the immediate

future, the constitutional development in Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



would  consist  of the immediate and  unconditional

release  of  the Communist agents and  sympathisers

who  were detained by the Internal Security Council

last  February.  Then after the  release  of  these

persons, the general elections should be held.  The

elected Government which he actually hoped would be

the  Barisan Sosialis Government would then re-open

with  the  British Government the whole subject  of

the   constitutional  future  of   Singapore,   and

Malaysia presumably would then be abandoned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, that is his idea of democratic,

constitutional progress in Singapore.  Needless  to

say,   that   is   not  our  idea  of   democratic,

constitutional progress in Singapore.  The  subject

of detainees will be debated in a subsequent motion

and I shall say no more about this. But I think  it

is fair for me to remind him of certain words which

I said to him more than a year and a half ago, when

I  warned  him  of  the consequences  of  willingly

supporting  the Communist cause. It is no  use  for

the Member for Queenstown to pretend that there are

no  Communists  in Singapore or that,  in  his  own

words, "the whole thing is a myth and a bogey".  We

are  entitled to assume, in view of his age and his

apparently  sober and sane demeanour,  that  he  is

capable of rational judgment on the basis of  facts

which  are known and acknowledged by everyone.  If,

on  the  face of all this, he continues  his  fairy

tale  that he does not know that his Party was  and

still  is the major open-front political instrument

for  the Malayan Communist Party, then we must draw

the inevitable conclusion that of his own free will

and choice he supports their cause.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as I have said, the next stage of

Singapore's political development, as he  envisages

it,  is the unconditional and immediate release  of

the Communist agents and sympathisers, and this  is

to be followed by the general elections and the

re-opening of the whole issue of merger and Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he knows, and any sane man in Singapore must

know, that this is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



going to happen - merger and Malaysia will proceed as

scheduled, namely, on the 31st of August this year.

The  newly  independent State of the Federation  of

Malaysia will be proclaimed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what will then happen? In the words of the

Member  for Queenstown  - and here I quote from  page

52 [col. 196] of yesterday's Hansard:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Should Britain so unwisely still impose Malaysia

on  the people against their will it can only  last

so  long  as  there are British bayonets  and  jets

around.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, let us ponder on the meaning and

significance of these words. There are  two  points

which  come to the mind. The first is that Malaysia

is  to  be  imposed by force upon  the  people.  We

already  know  that this is completely  untrue.  In

Singapore  a  referendum  has  been  held  and  the

judgment  of  the  people is  clear  beyond  doubt.

Elsewhere  the Parties in support of Malaysia  have

won  a  great majority of seats contested in  local

elections  and the constituted governments  of  all

the   territories  which  constitute  Malaysia  are

committed  to  bring  about  the  establishment  of

Malaysia  on  schedule.  Therefore,  to  say   that

Malaysia  will have to be imposed against the  will

of  the people is literally untrue. But there is  a

most  sinister significance of these words which  I

shall explain later.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that this possible imposition

of  Malaysia  can only be carried  out  by  British

force  of  arms.  If I understand  the  meaning  of

words, what the Member for Queenstown is saying  is

that  there would be violent opposition to Malaysia

and  violence of such a nature that it  has  to  be

restrained by the use of military power.  And  this

is  the only possible construction that one can put

on  his  words, for just in the succeeding sentence

after the one that I quoted, he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But this will mean a heavy price in blood...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Queenstown is the Chairman of

the  Barisan  Sosialis. We have the Chairman  of  a

major  political  Party in Singapore  saying  quite

bluntly  and  in so many words that bloodshed  will

follow  upon  the establishment of Malaysia.  These

are serious



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 367</b></font><br><br>



words.  They  are not words uttered by students  or

intellectuals or ordinary men in the  course  of  a

carefree  conversation. They are not words  uttered

in  the  heat  of discussion. They  are  not  words

spoken  under  the influence of alcohol.  They  are

words openly and solemnly uttered in the course  of

an  important debate in the Legislative Assembly on

matters   of  national  policy.  We  are  therefore

entitled to draw the inevitable inference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, as we read further on in page 52 [col.

198] of Hansard we find in the penultimate sentence

the Member for Queenstown saying:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the last door to constitutional struggle is

closed to the people, then there can remain but one

final answer.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, the last door to the constitutional

struggle  - Malaysia - has been closed. There is no  way

by   which  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  or  any  other

Communist   front  organisation,   can   stop   the

formation  of  Malaysia by constitutional  methods.

Therefore,   in  the  words  of  the   Member   for

Queenstown,  there can remain but one  answer,  the

final  answer. What answer, Mr Speaker?  The  only

final  answer  in  this  context  is  quite  clear,

namely,  the  unconstitutional methods of  violence

and bloodshed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the threat is unmistakable. He is saying in

effect, "Stop Malaysia now or else he prepared  for

violence and bloodshed," and these are words spoken

in  a  solemn  policy statement  in  the  Singapore

Legislative  Assembly by the Chairman  of  a  major

political Party. We are therefore entitled to  take

his words at their face value.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a curious feature that in the newspaper

reports  of  his  speech this morning  very  little

prominence was given to this part of his speech  in

the   English  language  newspapers.  Perhaps   the

English language newspapers may not he aware of the

full  implications  of  this  statement.  But   the

Chinese language newspapers did not miss the  point

and  published this part of his speech  practically

verbatim. There was even a minor headline  attached

to the report.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



And so we can take it that the strong and tough men

behind the Barisan Sosialis, the shop stewards  and

the  tough  characters in the  pro-Barisan  unions,

will  read  this speech in the Chinese  papers  and

will draw their conclusions, and that conclusion is

that   if   Malaysia  proceeds,  then  the  Barisan

Socialis and all the other open front Communist, as

well  as underground Communist, organisations  will

resort    to   violence.   Now,   Sir,   if    this

interpretation is incorrect, let the other  Members

of  the  Barisan  Sosialis in this Chamber  say  so

unequivocably, let them denounce the  Chairman  for

his criminal stupidity in threatening violence.  It

is  no use for them to say that what the Member for

Queenstown is saying is that there might be a  risk

of a spontaneous outburst of violence. Outbursts of

violence  in  Singapore, as  we  all  know  through

bitter  experience,  have never  been  spontaneous.

Violence   is   calculated   and   organised    and

prearranged. In this instance, it is very clear, on

the  admission  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  himself,  where the centre  of  organised

violence will be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me tell the Member for

Queenstown - unfortunately he is not here but perhaps

his  colleagues  will pass on the message  intended

for  him -   the  great import of his  words.  If  he

resorts to violence, he must expect the constituted

Government  of  Malaysia  to  resort  to   adequate

counter  measures to contain such violence  and  to

apprehend  the  criminals  responsible   for   such

violence and bring them to justice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So long as the Barisan Sosialis and other

Communist  front organisations are content  to  use

non-violent methods of subversion, then  the  worst

penalty  that they can expect will be a  period  of

detention until such time as they are persuaded  of

the  follies  of their ways. But when  there  is  a

resort   to  violence,  punishment  is  not  merely

detention  in  gaol  either  in  Singapore  or  the

Federation,  punishment is death  by  hanging.  Not

only  the  immediate perpetrators of violence  will

suffer this fate, but those who are responsible for

inciting and organising them will also have to  pay

this ultimate price.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 369</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not for the Member for Queenstown to

say that death by hanging meted out te perpetrators

of  violence  constitutes Fascist  or  undemocratic

methods.   Armed  revolt  against  any  constituted

government  amounts to treasonable action,  and  in

any  democratic government the penalty for  such  a

crime of treason is death.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have to accept also that with such

momentous words being uttered, the policy statement

of  the  Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis has  been

cleared and has been accepted by all his colleagues

in  the Party leadership. Therefore, both they  and

he  will  be jointly and severally responsible  for

the  consequences  of such a policy.  I  make  this

observation,  Mr Speaker, Sir, because  there  are

moments when I tell that the Barisan Sosialis  open

front  leadership, as distinct from  the  real  and

effective   underground  direction,   consists   of

eccentric   lunatics  or  ill-tempered  maladjusted

social  misfits,  or just downright  imbeciles  and

idiots. Sometimes I gather the impression that they

behave  like  Little  children  playing  with  sand

castles  on the beaches, not knowing what they  do,

why they are doing it, nor the serious consequences

that  could follow from their action. It is because

I  get  the impression that they sometimes  do  not

understand the grave implications of their  actions

that  on various occasions I bring upon myself,  at

grave  risk  of being misunderstood,  the  duty  of

pointing  out  to  them the dire consequences  that

must follow upon their proposed line of action.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, the referendum

held  last  year  is now seven months  old.  It  is

accepted  in the minds of the people that  Malaysia

will be established on 31st August, in spite of the

Barisan Sosialis conspiracy to abort Malaysia  with

the  assistance  of foreign opposition.  Therefore,

when the Member for Queenstown keeps on talking  of

Malaysia  as  an  imperialist  and  neo-colonialist

plot,  and  that  the  Borneo territories  have  no

affinity  with  Malaya and should  be  returned  to

Indonesia, he betrays the mental groove into  which

the  Barisan Sosialis has fallen. It is  a  tragedy

for Members of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



Barisan   Sosialis   when  their   leaders   cannot

reorientate their political thinking and persist in

playing  a  worn-out  record of  Malaysia  being  a

camouflage for British colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prediction of the Chairman of the Barisan

Sosialis that there will be bloodshed when Malaysia

is established will no doubt be duly noted by those

who are responsible for the safety and security  of

this country. It is said that "prevention is better

than  cure",  and I have no doubt that prophylactic

measures  will  be taken to prevent such  bloodshed

occurring.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown talks of poverty,

disease,  ignorance and want. There is  no  one  in

Singapore  who is so poor that he cannot  have  his

daily  meals  of  rice. The per  capita  income  of

Singapore  is $1,300, which is the highest  in  the

Far  East. There is no epidemic which afflicts  the

people:  the  standards of our  public  health  and

hospital  care  have  made  Singapore  one  of  the

healthiest places to live in. There is free primary

education  for  children of all races  and  we  are

already  expending 23 per cent  of  our  budget  on

education. If there are poverty, disease, ignorance

and  want,  they  exist only  amongst  the  Barisan

Sosialis.  But here I must make a clear definition.

I  cannot  say  that  the leaders  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  are materially poor. Their poverty  is  a

mental  poverty caused by their inability  to  free

themselves  from  Communist  cliches,   and   their

blindness  to  the real political  situation  which

faces  us  today.  The poverty of  their  political

thinking  and  ignorance of the real needs  of  the

people  have brought upon them a disease  in  which

everything they see is only of one colour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After merger and Malaysia have been established,

the  anti-colonial cry will only be an echo of  the

past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are entering into a new phase in which is

required leadership with positive ideas and  plans,

which will advance not only the material welfare of

the people of Singapore but also the development of

Malaysia.  A  country  which  has  previously  been

subject to colonialism inevitably throw up a type



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



of  militant leadership which is uncompromising  in

its tight against foreign domination. With Malaysia

this  phase of the battle is past and gone.  A

re-adjustment  of political thought becomes necessary.

The  old anti-colonialism war cries will not  cause

manna  to  fall  from heaven or  turn  stones  into

bread.  Nor  will  cries of "Bersatu"  create  more

jobs. Only by careful planning and by the sweat  of

our  brows can we hope to maintain the high  living

standards  that we enjoy in Singapore and generally

in Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The climate of Singapore is now one of

construction. Energy and time previously  frittered

away  in political excitement have been devoted  to

intense work and construction. The fruits of  these

labours  have been detailed in the Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's  speech. The intense building activity  of

the Housing and Development Board, the Public Works

Department  and  private builders is  changing  the

skyline of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jurong, once upon a time an evil-smelling marsh,

has  been converted into an industrial estate. Land

is  being  reclaimed  in the East  lagoon  and  new

wharves will be built. Television Singapura  though

barely  two months old has been a whacking  success

and  will  no doubt in time to come make an  impact

upon the pattern of living in Singapore. These  are

indeed  achievements of which we can be  proud  but

they have been made possible by the technical skill

and ability of Singapore's workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the number of students who leave secondary and

primary   schools  increases  year  by  year,   the

pressure of jobseekers must cause concern among all

these who have the welfare of our society at heart.

The problem is being tackled in two directions. The

first  step  is to stimulate capital investment  in

industrial  enterprises so that new factories  will

be  built and ancillary services expanded. In order

to  achieve  this  object, not only  a  climate  of

confidence  in  the political future  of  Singapore

must  be  created but also there must be industrial

peace. With



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



the  participation of Singapore  in  Malaysia,  the

unsureness of our political future will disappear.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board has been the

spearhead  in our industrialisation programme,  but

if  industrialisation is to succeed it is essential

that  there  must  be  available  in  Singapore   a

reservoir for skilled technical manpower. For  this

reason, emphasis has been placed on the development

of  technical education. The Polytechnic is now  in

its fifth year and the time has now come to develop

it  into an institute of advanced technology. Steps

are being taken to remove the Craft Courses out  of

the Polytechnic to Balestier and they will form the

nucleus  for  a  future vocational  institute.  The

scope  for undergraduate courses at technician  and

professional   level  will  be  expanded   in   the

Polytechnic   and  past-graduate   work   will   be

introduced.  The  graduates which  the  Polytechnic

have  produced have shown their worth, particularly

to  employers in industry. It is now time to  carry

the   development  of  the  Polytechnic  one  stage

further.  We intend later in the year or next  year

to   introduce  a  Bill  which  will   enable   the

Polytechnic to confer degrees upon those  who  hold

professional diplomas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are confident of maintaining the present

pace  of  construction, we must be equally vigilant

that the prosperity of Singapore now enjoyed is not

destroyed  at  one fell stroke by an  unpredictable

slump  in  trade or a fall in the price of  rubber.

The  reserves  that have been accumulated,  and  to

which  considerable reference has been made by  the

Opposition  during this debate, are a useful  asset

for the wintry days should there be a short-fall in

revenue  and  development funds which are  hard  to

come  by. I am quite sure Members of the House will

agree that we ought never to live like Micawber - �10

income, �11 expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, may I add that it is not

because of impiety that we have failed to thank God

in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech, as the Lady

from  Mountbatten would have us do. I am  sure  God

will be more pleased if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



we  spend  less  time  thanking  him  in  political

speeches  and more time rolling up our sleeves  and

getting down to work.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Prime Minister in reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just

formally  to  close the debate  on  the  Motion  of

thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech. Over

the  last two days I think the Assembly itself  has

reflected  a new mood and Members find it difficult

to  get exuberant or really angry over anything.  A

certain  finality  prevails over everything  and  I

think  it  is  to the good that everybody  in  this

country,   including  Members  on  the   Opposition

Benches,  understands that there is a  finality  in

the state of things in Singapore and in Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the way we have discharged our duties in

Singapore,  I  leave it to concrete evidence - and

literally concrete, bricks, stones, cement,

girders - to  bear testimony to some of the work we have done

over  the  last  3� years and will continue  to  do

between now and 31st August. After 31st August, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, a new phase opens and  perhaps  when

that time comes we will chart briefly, again before

you,  what  we think lies ahead. But I think,  like

all  good thrillers, one must never anticipate.  We

have  enough to keep everybody happy and  contented

between now and 31st August. I hope Members on  the

other side will take my words to heart that the 1st

September really settled a lot of things  and  that

it  will be utter folly to go on - as the Member  for

Queenstown   yesterday   went   on - fighting   that

verdict.  For  him  to suggest that  North  Borneo,

which  does  not belong to him but belongs  to  the

people  of Malaysia, should be given away  to  some

foreign power. I think that is the sign of reckless

foolhardiness which is bound to end up with a great

deal  more unhappiness all round. All I can say  is

that,  every time after the event, like  Cassandra,

more  in  sorrow  than in anger, we  have  pleaded,

albeit in vain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the words proposed to be

added, be there added."

<div align="center"><b>INTERNAL SECURITY COUNCIL'S</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>DECISION AND STATEMENT ON</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>COMMUNIST CONSPIRACY</b></div>



<br><br>10.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

move the motion,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House supports the decision of the

Internal  Security Council made by  representatives

of   the   three  Governments - the  United  Kingdom.

Singapore and the Federation of Malaya - on the  1st

February. 1963, ordering that certain persons known

to   the   security  authorities   of   the   three

Governments   to  be  deeply  implicated   in   the

Communist  United  Front conspiracy  to  jeopardise

national defence and security of Singapore and  the

territories of the proposed Federation of Malaysia,

should  be  arrested immediately and not left  till

after  31st August, 1963, and that it endorses  the

statement made by the Internal Security Council  as

contained in Paper Misc. 2 of 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 1st of February, the Internal Security

Council met in Kuala Lumpur. It decided that action

should  be taken immediately to safeguard  national

defence and security of Singapore and of the  other

territories   of   Malaysia.   It   decided    that

certain - not  all - of  those  known  to   the   three

Security Authorities to he deeply implicated in the

United  Front  working  for Communist  and  foreign

interests must be arrested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early hours of Saturday morning, the 2nd

of  February, operations were launched from  Johore

by Singapore and Federation Special Branch officers

and  a  number of persons were detained. I  do  not

think the public were surprised at the action taken

against  these  Communists and their  United  Front

workers.  For that matter, the Communists were  not

surprised either.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps a word of explanation, Mr Speaker, Sir.

Since  it  is  rather late in the  evening,  it  is

inadvisable to drink tea and it is better to  drink

water.  To those Members of the Opposition  Benches

who find it difficult to keep awake in the evening,

I  recommend Chinese tea, particularly  the  Member

for Queenstown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1956, when Mr Lim Ching Siong and his

Communist United Front friends were taken to  gaol,

the action was accompanied by riots and civil



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 376</b></font><br><br>



commotion. This was because the Communists had then

succeeded   in  creating  an  issue  over   Chinese

education  and in exploiting a series  of  strikes.

Thousands of Chinese students camping at the  Chung

Cheng and Chinese High Schools  - Eton and Harrow for

a  lot  of Chinese parents in Malaysia - were broken

up  by tear-gas. They marched down Bukit Timah Road

with arms linked, in tears particularly because  of

the  tear-gas. The action against the students gave

the  Communists  a chance to claim that  they  were

defending   Chinese  civilisation,  education   and

culture.  As  a  result, an air  of  martyrdom  was

assumed by these Communist detainees. They appeared

to be defenders of Chinese culture and champions of

the  workers.  This  time,  on  the  contrary,  the

detention  of these Communists has not  caused  any

surprise,  let  alone  consternation,  amongst  the

public.  On the contrary, there is an air  of  calm

and tranquility. Instead of broken shop-windows and

barbed wire and troops, there is peace and business

as usual.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Communists wanted an emergency meeting of

their  United  Front  cadres, wanted  an  emergency

sitting of this Assembly in the hope of whipping up

excitement  and  tensions,  all  under   cover   of

privilege.   However,  because   the   Member   for

Cairnhill, for his own reasons, also asked for  it,

we  agreed.  Unfortunately, as you have  ruled,  no

emergency  sitting  could be  held  until  the  new

Session opened. We offered them radio forums.  They

declined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are always prepared to meet them in the

open  and join issue with them. We have nothing  to

hide,  nothing to fear, and, as Members  know,  for

nearly two years now, we have had a continuous  and

open  debate  with the Communists over  merger  and

Malaysia  and Singapore's non-Communist  future  as

part  of  Malaysia  or,  as the  Internal  Security

Council says it, "whether it should become a Cuba."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Lim Ching Siong, leading the open front

organisations, embarked on this reckless  adventure

of  trying  to make Singapore a Cuba, even  at  the

risk of selling it to foreign powers in this region,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 377</b></font><br><br>



he  took  instructions  from  the  Communist

underground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day following the Anson by-election - Sunday,

16th  July, 1961 - Lim Cling Siong made contact  with

the  underground  Communist  Party  of  Malaya  for

instructions. This contact was made in the Nee Soon

area at the 7� mile, Upper Thomson Road, in a house

off the main road. A number of other senior cadres,

including  Chok  Koh  Tong and  Tan  Hee  Kim - being

leading   members  of  the  Barisan   Sosialis - were

gathered  at the place when discussions were  held.

Arrangements   for  the  meeting  were   completely

clandestine. At 1927 hours, Lim left the  Singapore

General  Employees  Union in Middle  Road  for  the

corner  of Outram Road and Seng Poh Road,  opposite

the Chung Khiaw Bank Branch there. He walked to the

five-foot  way,  and at about 1938 hours,  a  black

Morris Minor SR. 5222 drew up. There were two  male

Chinese in the vehicle ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Bani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bani:</b> He did not ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Perhaps the Member for Thomson

could contain himself. He will know that from  time

to time that car - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> - is seen in the precincts of

this House. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Yes, indeed. I do not think

the Member for Toa Payoh thinks it is very funny.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Soon Fong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Soon Fong (Toa Payoh):</b> No.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> There were two male Chinese

in the vehicle, one of whom was Chok Koh Tong. Lim,

by  this time, had put on a pair of dark glasses in

the evening. He got into the car quickly which then

drove  off at great speed. He and Chok were dropped

off at the bus-stop, 7� milestone Thomson Road, and

the  car  drove  off to the Work Brigade  Barracks,

Andrews



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



Avenue,  Sembawang. The meeting  in  the  house  at

Sembawang went on throughout the night and into the

early hours of the morning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this important discussion, these senior

cadres,  including Lim, held a series  of  meetings

amongst  themselves to work out the  details  of  a

plan to be implemented straightaway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Communists preferred Singapore not to

merge  with the Federation. They wanted to make  it

into  a  Cuba  from which they hoped  to  mount  an

offensive  against the Federation of  Malaya.  When

they  lost  the referendum last September  and  the

overwhelming   majority  of   us - the   people - voted

decisively  for merger, for a peaceful  and  stable

future  in Malaysia, they knew that their fate  was

sealed.  They knew that after the 31st  of  August,

they  will face security action. The first team  of

open leaders were well known and could not withdraw

and  go into hiding. Also, if they had done  this,

their  rank  and  file would have  lost  heart  and

melted  away.  So their first team of  open  united

front  cadres  in  the political  Parties,  unions,

rural  associations and cultural organisations  had

to  be  sacrificed. The Communists treated them  as

expendables to be sacrificed. However,  there  were

other   less  well-known  expendables - the   reserve

team - cadres  whose names and faces were  less  well

known  to  the  public. These, the  Communists  had

hoped, could escape action when the first team  was

removed. They could go into hiding, since they were

not  so  well known. Their plan was that  when  the

first team had gone after the purge, and some  time

had elapsed and things looked safe, they could come

out and take over the key positions left vacant  by

their  first  team,  and carry on  the  conspiracy,

restarting  and  re-forming the  united  front.  Of

course, the three Governments knew of this  and  as

the   reserve   team  withdrew  and   took   cover,

intelligence men followed to keep track of them. In

some  cases,  however, they have not  as  yet  been

found. No doubt after some time, when they think it

is  safe,  they  will  come out  and  resume  their

activities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lim Ching Siong and his friends prepared for

trouble. They knew what they were doing was  wrong.

They  knew they were deliberately defying the  will

of  the  people expressed clearly in the referendum

and  they  were plotting with Azahari to  frustrate

Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they failed to stop Malaysia through

Singapore, they began to look around for  ways  and

means to stop Malaysia through fellow Communists in

the S.U.P.P. in Sarawak. They even plotted with  an

anti-Communist adventurer like Azahari  in  Brunei.

They  knew that without the Borneo territories  the

Tunku  would not agree to Malaysia. So they plotted

in  various  was to create trouble  in  the  Borneo

territories  to stop merger between  Singapore  and

the  Federation. To achieve this,  Said  Zahari,  a

former editor of Utusan Melayu, who was banned from

the  Federation  in 1961 after the  Utusan  strike,

played a great part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three Governments knew that Said was Lim

Ching Siong's closest Malay associate. Said was  in

touch  with  an  intelligence agent  of  a  foreign

power.  In  fact, he was in their  pay.  The  three

Governments  also  knew  that  Said  was  Azahari's

adviser and contact man in Singapore. Said arranged

several  secret meetings between Lim  and  Azahari.

Their  last meeting was four days before the revolt

broke out in Brunei. Lim Ching Siong had previously

discussed  a  request by Azahari for money  to  buy

arms.  In  fact, Lim and his friends were  debating

whether to give Azahari the money for this purpose.

But  they  had their misgivings about  whether  the

money  would be spent for the purchase of  arms  or

whether it would he spent on women for Azahari.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.   Members  will  understand  from  the  brief

summary   of   these  facts  that  the   Communists

knowingly took the risk of action upon themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the 16th of December last year, when action

had  been  taken in Sarawak and the  Federation  of

Malaya, they took special preventive measures. They

knew  that security actions were usually  taken  in

the early hours of the morning



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



when   people  were  at  home.  Lim  Ching   Siong,

therefore, gave instructions to all his first  team

united  front  cadres to stay in a different  place

each night, so that the largest number of men might

escape  when the purge came. It took the  police  a

great  deal  of  trouble and men to  mark  out  the

different places where each of these people  stayed

in the course of one week. Some of them had as many

as four or five different places in a week.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lim himself and some leading lights in the

Barisan Sosialis, including several hon. Members on

the  other  side,  took special  precautions.  They

believed  that  since the security  action  in  the

Federation and Sarawak had been taken in the  early

hours  of  Sunday morning, so every Saturday  night

they  went  to a midnight show, so that they  would

not  get  home till well after two or three o'clock

on the Sunday morning. In this way, they would hear

of  any  action that may already have been  started

and  so  have time to dive for cover and elude  the

police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operations were mounted with great secrecy

from  Johore. Yet, in spite of the strict security,

partly  because  of  their early counter  measures,

like  withdrawing  their reserve team  and  getting

their  first  team to change their sleeping  places

each  night, some 18 of their important first  team

members  could not be found, and quite a number  of

their reserve team who had taken cover could not be

traced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Members may ask why security action was

taken  on 1st February, 1963, instead of some other

time,  like  after 31st August, 1963.  Well,  there

were  urgent reasons why it had to he taken in  the

early  hours  of  the morning of 2nd  February.  An

important  member  of the Communist  united  front,

Said  Zahari, was leaving that morning for  Jakarta

where Azahari had just arrived the day before  from

Manila.  The  last  time when intelligence  reports

came to the notice of the Federation Government  of

an impending revolt in Brunei by persons trained in

Indonesian Borneo, no action was taken.  The  Tunku

said  that, although he informed the British,  they

did  not  take sufficient preventive steps. British

Intelligence did



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



not  altogether accept the imminence of the danger.

In  retrospect now, had the report been  acted  on,

perhaps the Brunei revolt, which has cost a lot  of

money,  involved  movements  of  troops  and  arms,

caused  deaths and built up an atmosphere of crisis

with some of our neighbours, may not have happened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time, however, none of the three Governments

on  the Internal Security Council was willing to be

caught  napping.  And partly because  the  security

action  has been successful, the things which  were

being  planned have not taken place. A part of  the

plan   was  to  mount  demonstrations  and  violent

protests in Singapore at the same time as so-called

"volunteers"  were  moved to renew  the  revolt  in

Brunei.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three Governments on the Internal

Security  Council, and the Intelligence information

available to the Security Council was derived  from

three intelligence agencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in a position to disclose only information

collected  by  the Singapore security  organisation

and  part  of  the  information  collected  by  the

Federation  security organisation. The  British  do

not    wish    to   disclose   their   Intelligence

information,  particularly information  from  their

Intelligence sources in the capitals of  South-East

Asian  countries. They have their reasons  for  not

wanting   to   disclose   information   which   may

jeopardise their sources and may, even worse,  make

their  position vis-a-vis certain powers in

South-East   Asia  more  difficult.  Each  of  the  three

Governments  on the Security Council has  different

immediate interests, and the British have different

long-term objectives from the Federation Government

and us. But nevertheless, all of us were agreed  on

the  need for immediate action. For one thing, Sir,

at  that time, the Singapore Communists were making

veiled threats to resort to violent struggle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As recently as the 1st January this year Mr Lim

Ching Siong, in his New Year message, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The ruling clique in the Federation is heavily

committed  to the imperialists and will  pursue  an

anti-democratic policy in the hope  of  maintaining

themselves in power indefinitely'.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



Then he ominously said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The Left forces must then make the necessary

judgment on the matter.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what is the meaning of this? Members will

remember  that every now and then Barisan  Sosialis

leaders  have  made similar statements.  They  have

done so many times in this Chamber and did so again

yesterday. To us who have known the Communists  for

so  long,  and  studied their  thinking  and  their

methods,  the  meaning  is  clear.  They  will  use

constitutional methods as long as these are  useful

to  them. At the same time, they are ready  to  use

more  violent methods - strikes, riots, and,  in  the

last  resort, armed insurrection. These  considered

statements were made by persons of authority in the

Communist  front  movement  and  were  intended  to

prepare  their cadres for stronger action when  the

time was ripe.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 2nd February, immediately the arrests were

known, the Member for Queenstown issued a statement

in which he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is the time for the people to consider

seriously  whether  the present  arrests,  and  the

repressive actions have not already closed all  the

doors to constitutional struggle,'



<br><br>He repeated that again yesterday:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If the last door to constitutional struggle is

closed, then there remains but one final answer.'



<br><br>He  goes  on to talk of bloodshed if Malaysia  were

pushed through.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question for the Internal Security Council

was  when  will  violence  be  mounted - before  31st

August,  1963, or after 31st August,  1963?  It  so

happened  that events in Brunei gave  them  another

opportunity to try and stop Malaysia. Let  me  give

hon. Members the main outline of how the Communists

in Singapore tried to exploit the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheik Azahari is not a Communist. He is too fond

of  the  good life. Nor are the persons immediately

around  him Communists. But for different  reasons,

he  was opposed to Brunei entering Malaysia, unless

it  was  on  his terms. And the Communists  saw  in

Azahari  and  the  few thousand Malays  be  led  in

Brunei a convenient cover for their conspiracy. The

revolt would be made to appear as the forefront  of

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



liberation  movement in Borneo and so  prevent  the

Borneo   territories  from  joining  Malaysia   and

without Borneo, the Tunku would not have Singapore.

As  luck  would  have  it for the  Communists,  the

Filipinos,  also  known to be anti-Communists,  had

made  claims  on North Borneo. Some  Filipinos  had

discussions with Azahari last November and  certain

Filipino   personalities  established  links   with

Azahari  and settled a deal on mutually  profitable

terms.  Here was the perfect blind, for nobody  can

accuse   Azahari's   revolt   to   establish    the

independent  State of Kalimantan  Utara,  otherwise

known  as the United States of Borneo, as  being  a

Communist  conspiracy,  for  Azahari  was   not   a

Communist and the Filipino personalities who backed

him  were also known anti-Communists. But the irony

is that the Communists made good use of them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, no one will ever know how lucky we were that

Azahari's  revolt  went off at half  cock,  earlier

than  originally  planned,  and  flopped.  Had  the

original  plan which was co-ordinated  to  coincide

with  events outside Borneo succeeded,  the  Sultan

captured  and made to proclaim the independence  of

Kalimantan  Utara,  as may well have  happened,  we

would  all have been in a very dangerous situation.

But  as  things  turned out Sheik  Azahari  was  no

Ferhat Abbas of Algeria. Nor was he made of sterner

stuff of men like Ben Bella or Ben Khedda.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I am sorry to interrupt the

Prime  Minister,  but I think one  hon.  Member  is

using  his  ear-phone  as a loud-speaker.  Could  a

check  be made? [Pause] It is not here. It must  be

up  in  the  Strangers' Gallery. If it  is  in  the

Strangers' Gallery, I ask the Serjeant at  Arms  to

try   and   trace  that  loud-speaker.  Mr   Prime

Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I do not want to

introduce unparliamentary language in this Chamber,

but  I  think I am fair in quoting Azahari's lawyer

in saying that he is a liar and a "bum".



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long before the revolt actually took place, Lim

Ching  Siong bad been in regular and secret contact

with  Azahari.  On all the visits Azahari  made  to

Singapore  during last year, Said was  his  closest

associate and confidant.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Perhaps the Prime Minister

would  like to take his seat again. I am told  that

it  is probably the loud-speaker in the Member  for

Anson's seat - he is not here. Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> On several occasions Said

arranged  meetings between Azahari  and  Lim  Ching

Siong. Lim Ching Siong met Azahari at 11.15 on  the

night  of  4th  March,  1962,  in  secret  at   118

Tembeling  Road.  They met again  on  the  12th  of

April.  On  the  3rd of December,  just  four  days

before the revolt, all the three, Messrs. Lim Ching

Siong, Said Zahari and Azahari met at the Tiong Hwa

Restaurant in Prinsep Street. Then within less than

24  hours after the outbreak of the revolt  on  the

8th,  the Barisan Sosialis came out in open support

of the revolution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early as May last year, Mr Lim Ching Siong

was already aware of the plans for an uprising.  He

was  then actively considering an offer of  weapons

being made either in Singapore or in Borneo through

his  links with the S.U.P.P. He was not quite clear

about  the situation then prevailing in Brunei  and

the  offer  of weapons "to his side". He feared  it

might  be  a trap because he was worried  that  top

level  "fellows may betray him". He also knew  that

there was a promise for troops to be sent from  the

border at the time when the revolt was mounted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this while the Communists in Singapore knew

what  was  being  hatched. In  October  last  year,

several   weeks  before  the  revolt,   the   three

Governments  knew  that even Mr  Mahadeva  of  the

Straits  Times, now detained, knew of the impending

revolt  and had told some people that Malaysia  may

not  come  off as there was going to  be  an  armed

revolt in Brunei.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Captured rebel leaders in Brunei have revealed

that Azahari had told them that he had arranged for

a  simultaneous uprising in Singapore at  the  same

time as.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



they attacked in Brunei, Sarawak and Sabah. Lim and

Said  had  promised Azahari that they  would  mount

demonstrations  and hamper British troop  movements

in  Singapore when counter action was taken by  the

British,  and  they promised to rally  support  for

this so-called "revolution".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a number of reasons they did not succeed. A

pending  retrenchment  of  over  a  thousand   Army

civilian  workers made the climate  unsuitable  for

getting  Army  civilian  workers  to  take   action

against  base installations. Civilian employees  of

the  Army are employed in order to keep these bases

ready  for  an  emergency.  The  workers  were  not

prepared  to  jeopardise their rice bowl  just  for

Communist  tactics. They failed to get the  workers

to do things against the workers' own interests. In

anger Lim issued a statement condemning the use  of

the  British bases in Singapore in crushing the

so-called  "liberation" struggle of Kalimantan  Utara.

They  also  got  the President of  the  Naval  Base

Labour  Union, Mr De Cruz, to condemn the  use  of

the  bases  in  putting down the revolt.  This  was

immediately echoed in all their other united  front

publications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They called two so-called "mass rallies" at

Hollywood  Park, rather inappropriately  named  for

mass  rallies,  the first by the  Barisan  Sosialis

directed at the Chinese, the second by Party Rakyat

directed at the Malays. Both meetings were cold and

drew small crowds. Again they failed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier they had even tried to get arms for the

rebels. On 6th December last year, two days  before

the revolt broke out, Azahari went in Said's car to

Jalan  Spencer,  off West Coast  Road,  to  meet  a

contact to get stolen arms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, the link between Lim Ching Siong and

Azahari, was all this while in the pay of an  agent

of an Intelligence agent of a foreign power. He has

now,  under interrogation, admitted his links  with

them.  Some  time  ago his agent was  arrested.  He

disclosed  that Said was in his pay. The agent  was

released  and  he  returned  to  his  own  country.

Shortly  afterwards another man came to  Singapore.

He became Said's "handling agent", a technical term

to describe a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



person  who  keeps contact with  an  agent  for  an

intelligence  agency.  The  first  agent  who   was

arrested  and released obviously did not report  to

his  organisation  that  he  had  already  revealed

Said's connections with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Azahari was last in Singapore just before he

fled  to Manila, he was in constant touch with  the

leading  conspirators in Singapore  and  also  with

certain  persons connected with foreign consulates.

Surveillance was kept on all the key conspirators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after the revolt in Borneo, Said secretly

tried  to start a movement for volunteers to  fight

for  the liberation of Azahari's Kalimantan  Utara,

just  like the volunteers who were going  to  fight

for the liberation of West Irian.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, all this may sound a little bit ambitious now

in retrospect, if  not  comic,  but these  men take themselves seriously,

and we  would have  made a grave mistake if we did not take  them seriously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These men knew that they had lost the battle in

Singapore  against Malaysia. So  they  resorted  to

every   available   device,  and  exploited   every

opportunity   to  create  trouble  in   the   other

territories, particularly in Sarawak and Brunei, in

order  to  stop  Malaysia. Honourable  Members  may

recall  reading  in the newspapers  of  the  sudden

increase  in  the  number of Barisan  Sosialis  and

other united front cadres who began to tour Sarawak

and Brunei in the last few weeks before the revolt.

Some  will also remember that when the revolt broke

out,  they  were immediately detained and  expelled

from  Brunei  and  Sarawak. I do  not  think  their

capacity  for harm was very great but  the  Sarawak

and Brunei Governments did not think that they were

just sight-seeing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the experience of the Brunei revolt, it

would  be  a  mistake  to  underestimate  Communist

intention  or capacity for harm. They had  said  in

the past that there would be bloodshed and violence

and  they said again yesterday, through the  Member

for  Queenstown, that there would be  bloodshed  if

Malaysia  came about or was pushed through,  as  he

put  it. This was said by some of their leaders now

in detention,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



Mr  Lim  Ching Siong, Mr Fong Swee Suan  and  Mr

Sandra   Woodhull.   Yesterday   the   Member   for

Queenstown repeated this threat under the cloak  of

privilege. Some people did not take them  seriously

in  the  past.  Events have shown  that  they  were

prepared  to  use  the Brunei  Malays  and  involve

themselves  in  conspiracy with foreign  groups  to

precipitate  armed revolt in the Borneo territories

to  stop  Malaysia. Action could  not  be  delayed.

Already   relations  between  the  Federation   and

neighbouring countries are gravely strained, and we

can  only  hope that goodwill from all sides,  with

the   help   of   conciliation  and  mediation   by

disinterested     officials    of     international

organisations, will ease the situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Communists did their calculations

carefully. They knew that on or after 31st  August,

their  united  front would be disrupted.  In  their

eagerness  and  recklessness to escape  this  fate,

they  involved themselves with persons who ii  turn

were   involved  with  foreign  powers.  They  have

brought  retribution  upon themselves  sooner  than

they had expected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would have been easier for the Singapore

Government  to  leave them alone until  after  31st

August,  for  then  the  Central  Government  would

assume  complete  responsibility  for  defence  and

security,  and  take  over direct  control  of  the

Police  and  Intelligence. But when the  Communists

threatened  the  security of Malaysia,  we  had  to

agree  to  take  immediate  action  to  curb  them.

Probably,  as far as Singapore alone was concerned,

they  could  not have created much trouble  because

they had already been discredited. After nearly two

years  of open confrontation and public debate  the

ground  was  growing  cold for  them.  The  Chinese

education  issue  they  mounted  had  failed.  Last

December  they  had  to  abandon  their  plans  for

another  examination boycott.  Their  strikes  were

failing,  and  in fact only a few days  before  the

arrests,  after  fierce talk and strike  action  at

Metal  Box,  Mr  Fong Swee Suan had  to  tell  the

workers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



to  go back with very little benefits gained and  a

lot  of face lost. Their unions were breaking  away

from them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been able to hold the Communists down

because we had exposed their deceit and selfishness

in  opposing merger and Malaysia and isolated them,

by  public  debate  and  the  open  argument.  They

suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands  of  the

people in the referendum last September. Since then

we  have  been spared a great deal of this bragging

by  the  Communists  and their supporters  in  this

Assembly  that they had the masses behind them.  We

have not heard of the masses, Mr Speaker, Sir, for

the last few days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons why the purges of the last

Government were accompanied by riots and arson, and

troops had to be called out, was that Ministers  of

the  last  Government were unable or  unwilling  to

meet  the Communists in the open and argue it  out.

The result was that they lost the argument and lost

the  battle  for  hearts and minds.  So  when  they

detained  leading figures, a lot of public sympathy

was  for the Communists and against the Government.

We  must never make this error. We are prepared  to

join issue with the Communists at any time, and all

the  time, here in this Assembly, on the radio,  in

T.V.,  in public forums, in public rallies, a,  the

United    Nations,   in   Moshi,   in    Afro-Asian

conferences, anywhere and everywhere. We have  even

invited  the Chairman of the Movement for  Colonial

Freedom  in  London, Mr Fenner Brockway,  to  come

here,  investigate  and satisfy himself  about  all

this  rubbish of so-called torture that the  Member

for  Queenstown had told him about  in  his  recent

trip  to London. I am happy to say that he will  be

coming, not as early as I hoped he would be able to

come in April, but some time in May. The Member for

Queenstown  should  remember this  before  he  goes

around spreading rumours and falsehoods, that  this

is  a  Government that never flinches from the open

confrontation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is they who fear the public debate. The

Indonesian  Communists  and  other  Communist  bloc

delegates   at   the   Afro-Asian   Conference   in

Tanganyika feared



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



the arguments of our delegates. As Members know, on

1st   February  we  sent  a  delegation   to   this

conference.  We  knew  that  this  conference   was

controlled  by  a Communist-dominated  Secretariat.

Azahari  himself  had  said  in  Jakarta  that  the

Conference was dominated by Communists and that  he

was  not  going on that account. We knew  that  the

Communist  bloc  led  by  the  Communist  Party  of

Indonesia would try to move a resolution condemning

Malaysia  as neo-colonialist and giving support  to

Azahari  as  the leader of the so-called revolution

in Kalimantan Utara.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian and other Communists were afraid

of  our  facts  and arguments, so  they  stubbornly

opposed our delegates from even presenting the case

for Malaysia before the Afro-Asian delegates.

Mr Lim Shee Ping, I fear to say, was no match when

it really came to the open argument between him and

the gentlemen that we sent - Mr Devan Nair, Mr Jek,

Mr Rahim Ishak, Othman Wok. He went to the

Polytechnic to meet the Minister for Finance and we

have a tape recording of what happened, the ground

went cold on him. Doctrinaire, half-baked Marxist - [Interruption].

proper way; not from his seat. Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

always allow him to intervene. I will never refuse

him an opportunity as long as he is with us to

debate, to argue, as long as he behaves himself in

a constitutional manner. I think the Member for

Thomson ought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



to  be  grateful that he has a Government in  power

that  is anxious to see that the decorum of  public

debates,  public  assemblies is somehow  maintained

despite very trying circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at Moshi they knew that if our delegates

were  allowed to speak, they could have shown  that

it  was nonsense to claim that Azahari's revolution

of  2,000  out  of 40,000 Malays in Brunei -   40,000

Malays  in Brunei, meaning men, women and  children

and  babes in arms, Mr Speaker, Sir, half the size

of  the  Member  for Geylang Serai's  constituency;

half   the   population - entitled  him  to  proclaim

himself Prime Minister, not just of Brunei, but  of

the  1.2  million people of Sarawak and Sabah.  The

Indonesian  Communists wanted to  rally  Afro-Asian

opinion against Malaysia. They will try hard  first

in conferences like that in Tanganyika, and if they

succeed,  then finally in the United  Nations.  The

very  fact that they have made no mention  of  this

attenuated   resolution  that   has   been   passed

supporting  Azahari's Kalimantan Utara,  either  by

the  Indonesian Communists in Jakarta or  by  local

agents in Singapore, is an indication of the defeat

they suffered at Moshi. Sir, if they could get  the

non-aligned  countries  of  Afro-Asia  to  denounce

Malaysia,  it would provide for them  a  cover  for

intervention without the danger of a world war. For

once  non-Communist Afro-Asia supports a liberation

movement,  as it did in Algeria, to aid  rebels  in

the  way of arms and volunteers by other Afro-Asian

powers,   it   cannot   be  easily   countered   by

intervention by a major Western power.  Then  there

will  be no danger of its provoking a world war  or

leading to United States intervention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was what happened in the case of West Irian.

Once   Afro-Asia  solidly  backed  Indonesia,   the

Americans  being practical persuaded  the  stubborn

Dutchmen  to give up West Trim rather than  risk  a

war  in which Afro-Asia would be against them. Sir,

I  do  not say that Sarawak and Sabah is like  West

Irian.  In  fact,  the  Indonesian  Communists  are

rapidly  finding  that this  is  a  very  different

proposition.  Sarawak, Brunei and  Sabah  were  not

part  of  the Dutch empire. They belong to us,  the

people



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



of  the territories which together were part of the

British  empire  in South-East Asia.  They  do  not

belong  to the Member for Queenstown alone, and  it

is  not his to give away to the Indonesians,  as  I

heard  he wanted to do yesterday. If Azahari claims

the  support of 40,000 Malays in Brunei, then there

are  1.2  million people in Sarawak and  Sabah  who

oppose  him. However, we must expect the Indonesian

Communists  to keep on trying. Our business  is  to

defeat their diplomatic and propaganda offensive at

every turn.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent security action was taken in a

different  situation from 1956. In 1956,  when  the

Communists were purged, they were part of an

anti-colonial united front when we nationalists  in  the

P.A.P. were together with them fighting  a  common

colonial  enemy for our freedom. The last time,  in

1956, they were purged by a Chief Secretary who was

a   British   official.  It  was  a   semi-colonial

government  whose understanding and  grasp  of  the

Communist problem in an anti-colonial situation was

feeble,  and  whose  ability to  counter  Communist

tactics  was pathetic. This time they were arrested

on   the  decision  of  the  three  Governments - the

Federation  of  Malaya, an independent  nationalist

Government, the Government of Singapore, consisting

all   of   elected  Ministers,  and   the   British

Government,  which has a defence  treaty  with  the

Federation  of  Malaya and is also responsible  for

the  external  defence of Singapore. Sir,  we  have

different    immediate   policies   and   different

political attitudes and different methods.  But  we

all  agreed  with  the  decision  of  the  Internal

Security  Council  because it  was  vital  that  no

chances  should he taken that would upset  Malaysia

and  because we in Singapore share vital  long-term

objectives  with the Federation Government  on  the

defence and security of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The persons detained were known not just to one

but  to all three security authorities of the  thee

Governments   to  be  deeply  implicated   in   the

Communist conspiracy. So there was no question of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



political  victimisation or personal vendetta.  The

decision  on  who  were  to  be  detained  was   an

impersonal    one,    dispassionately    made    by

professional  security officers whose  instructions

from their respective Governments were to blunt the

Communist   capacity  to  mount  trouble,   leading

perhaps  to violence, and to break their  lines  of

conspiracy with foreign groups. The decision of the

I.S.C. was not immediately to destroy all Communist

united  front  organisations. The operation  had  a

limited objective, for a specific purpose, to  meet

a  particular situation. So no political  Party  or

trade  union or rural association has been  banned,

although  they are known vehicles of the  Communist

united front. Only those persons who were known  by

the  three  different security  authorities  to  be

deeply implicated in the conspiracy - in other words,

the  key activists in the political Parties, unions

aid rural organisations, who were their open points

for   mobilising   support   to   violent   action,

mobilising their workers of farmers who  belong  to

these organisations, were detained. Because of this

directive, certain other persons, although known to

the  security organisations to be Communist  united

front cadres, were not detained in this action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1956 after the purge, the Communists and their

supporters felt that victory was around the corner.

The  P.A.P. had been fighting with them in an

anti-colonial united front. They knew that when  we  won

the  general elections in 1959 and got the keys  to

Changi  Prison,  we would have to open  the  prison

gates  for  them.  Otherwise  we  would  have  been

accused of being traitors to fellow fighters  in  a

common anti-colonial cause. This time, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  they  know  the  e is no victory  around  the

corner.  Whoever  wants to open  the  prison  gates

either   of   Changi - there  would  not  be   Outram

anymore - Pudu,  Taiping  or  Johore,  must   conquer

Malaya    and   Malaysia   by   force,   or    must

constitutionally win the majority of the  seats  in

the Malaysian Parliament. Neither of these two ways

appears even remotely possible.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think the most dangerous aspect of this

limited purge of Communist front organisers is that

the  country  may be lulled into a sense  of  false

security.  Without  the  leading  Communist   front

figures  in the open, without their wild  postures,

their   fierce   statements,  their   strikes   and

inflammatory  speeches, people may be  lulled  into

believing that the Communist threat is gone. Let us

never  deceive  ourselves  that  this  action   has

removed  the Communist threat. Even if the Internal

Security Council had arrested all the other  united

front  cadres  and banned their organisations,  the

problem  would  only  be slightly  diminished.  The

basic threat remains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two reasons for this. First, the

underground  party  is still  there.  Our  security

organisation  has  not succeeded  in  locating  and

breaking  up  the underground network  as  yet.  In

Communist   plans   and  calculations   they   have

anticipated  the  removal  of  their  united  front

organisers.  These are the "expendables",  the  men

who pay the price of detention in the hope that the

Communist  revolution may eventually  triumph.  Any

man who is really valuable to the Communists and is

not  yet  known to security intelligence, is  never

put  to  work  in  the  open to  run  the  risk  of

detention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second reason why the threat is there is that the united front framework is left intact. They have arranged the temporary withdrawal of their reserve team in the united front. A number of these men cannot immediately be traced. After some time, they will come out and

carry  on  where the first team left off.  And  the

underground leaders can always throw in a few  more

trained  cadres to help the reserve team reactivate

and  revitalise  the united front, particularly  at

the  time  of elections after election  writs  have

been  issued. Members will remember that in several

major  pronouncements  after  the  referendum  last

year, when they knew that they had decisively  lost

in  the fight against merger and Malaysia, Mr  Lim

Ching  Siong warned of the difficult struggle ahead

and of the need to conserve their strength and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



carry on the struggle. Well, they have done exactly

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A considerable number of the leaders involved in

the  Communist united front are men who  have  come

from  the Federation. Because of conditions  during

the  Emergency in the Federation and because of the

sterner   measures   there   taken   against    the

Communists,  some  of their best  Communist  cadres

have come to Singapore. One of our problems is that

not  only  do  we have our own share  of  Communist

cadres, but that we also have in our small island a

considerable number of Federation Communist cadres.

This  time some 20 of them, key organisers, all  of

Federation origin, have been ordered by the  I.S.C.

to  be sent hack to the Federation; and there  they

will remain. They will not be allowed to return  to

Singapore  to frequent their old haunts  and  cause

trouble again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those detained and those still not detained

engaged  in the conspiracy should remember that  it

is up to them to decide if they want a decent place

in  our  society.  If they give up  this  dangerous

nonsense of revolution for a Communist Malaya,  and

now  a  Communist Malaysia, and stop  taking  their

directives  from  foreign  groups,  they   can   be

released  immediately. We have no  desire  to  keep

anybody  out of a fair share of the fruits  of  our

society,  whether Chinese-educated, Malay-educated,

Tamil-educated, or English-educated. Everybody  can

share  in  the fruits of freedom and  join  in  the

building of our nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me remind those who are still determined

on  violent  revolution and the  setting  up  of  a

Communist   society,  that  this  time  they   face

nationalism,  a much more formidable  and  enduring

opponent   than   colonialism.   Colonialism,   Mr

Speaker,  Sir, is on the way out. Nationalism  will

stay and triumph.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.19 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

as expected, the Prime Minister's speech is full of

trite,   evasive  and  irresponsible   pro-colonial

statements that one normally sees in speeches



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



of  Colonel  Blimps  and  colonial  governors.  The

phraseology  used and the sentiments expressed  are

no  different  from the phraseology and  sentiments

expressed by Governor Waddels and whoever they  may

be.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What are they?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The pathetic thing about our

Prime  Minister  is that today  he  can  no  longer

pretend to be an anti-colonial and anti-imperialist

fighter.  He has already been totally exposed,  and

now he can only shed crocodile tears. If I were  to

compare  what  the Prime Minister says  today  with

what  he used to thump his chest about not so  very

long   ago,   it  would  provide  very  interesting

reading.  And I did tell the Prime Minister  during

the  Anson  by-election that I was running  through

all his past speeches and he laughingly admitted at

that  time  that  what he said  in  July  1961  was

entirely different from what he had previously said

in   1954,   1955,  1956,  1957,  1958  and   1959.

Therefore, today we see in the Prime Minister  only

a  contrast,  a shell of what he was. He  does  not

spout  anti-colonialism any more. He does not spout

the cause of the exploited and of the oppressed any

more. He does not hurl defiance at the imperialists

any  more.  But  now  he cows before  the  colonial

master. He belly-crawls to his colonial master.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I ask the hon. Member to

remember  that he is speaking in an Assembly  where

unparliamentary  words are  disallowed.  I  do  not

think the term "belly-crawls" is parliamentary.  He

should withdraw it.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Withdraw.

Bench are just as disorderly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister, in his

opening  statement, talks of having  won  the  open

argument. But even in this Assembly, Sir, they  are

so scared of talking about it that they want to run

away  from the argument. So how can they ever  talk

of  winning the argument? How can they talk of ever

winning  any  argument'? He talks of his  uninvited

representatives to Moshi, hoping to gate-crash into

the Afro-Asian Conference in Tanganyika. Somehow or

other  they managed to get some country to  sponsor

them.  But,  as  I will say a bit more  later,  the

moment  they  failed they turned  round  and  said,

"Sour  grapes." The very referendum  itself,  which

the  Prime Minister has tried so very much to boast

about,  showed  that the P.A.P. had lost  the  open

argument. Now the Prime Minister talks of  midnight

shows,  meetings in Nee Soon. As in July 1961  when

he  talked of Russian bears and British lions,  now

he  tells  us the same stories. [Interruption]  How

different  is  this story from the  twelve  Arabian

Night talks?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister talks of

colonialism on its way out. Surely ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I ask the Ministers on

the  Front Bench not to behave with such frivolity?

The  Prime Minister was allowed to make his  speech

with  very  little  interruption,  and  I  ask  the

Ministers  to  try  and listen to  the  Member  for

Queenstown with all seriousness.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister talks of

colonialism  on its way out, but surely  he  should

know - if he claims to know anything about the  basic

fundamentals of any theory on socialism  - that today

Malaysia  does not mean the end of colonialism.  In

fact, it means just the opposite, and it means  the

prolongation  of colonialism only in another  form.

But,  however, I shall refer to all this  a  little

later.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister talks of our trying to sell the interests of Singapore and Borneo to a foreign power. Later on in my speech I will touch on many of these points, and you will be able to see that it is not us in the Barisan Sosialis who are selling the interests of our country to a foreign power. It is those people opposite who are traitors

of our country and who are selling the interests of

our people to a foreign power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the call for freedom in the Borneo

territories.  We support the hopes and  aspirations

of   the  people  in  Borneo,  and  if  the  P.A.P.

Ministers were ever genuine in what they say,  they

would have done the same, as I will try to prove to

you,  Sir,  because at one time  they  talked  very

grandiloquently of their help and support  for  the

Algerians. The Prime Minister referred to it just a

little while ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the Prime Minister waxes eloquent

whenever  he talks on the subject of Communism.  He

always  talks of the united front organisation;  he

talks  of  the  Communist plot, and  he  refers  to

Mahadeva having known of the revolution in Brunei a

few  months  before. If the memory of  the  P  A.P.

should  not  be  so  short, they  would  also  have

remembered  that  we  in  this  Chamber  have  been

talking of revolutions in Brunei and in the  Borneo

territories   many  months  before  that,   because

Malaysia  is a plan meant to subjugate the  people.

And  people  are ever ready to fight  for  justice,

equality and freedom and will not submit easily  to

plans imposed on them against their will.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people in Brunei are fighting with shotguns

against jets and warships. Yes, with blowpipes too,

and  that  shows  our Ministers opposite  that  for

freedom  people are willing to sacrifice  anything,

even their lives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Prime Minister talks of decisions having

been taken dispassionately by security officers. By

that,  of  course,  the Prime  Minister  means  the

Special Branch. I will refer to the Special  Branch

a little later. And he also refers to the wisdom of

the  P.A.P. in having the concurrence of the  three

Governments in the arrests. On this question



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



too,  I  will  touch a little later, but,  at  this

stage,  may  I  ask the Ministers sitting  opposite

whether they remember what they used to say before?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Sir, I do not wish to quote

extensively  from the mouthings of  those  who  now

stand discredited in the eyes of the people and who

have  to use Government power and position in order

to  coerce other people into putting up a semblance

of   "supporting"  the  P.A.P.  If  they  were   so

courageous, let them have the Sembawang by-election

straightaway. Why are they scared in spite  of  all

the   tours  of  the  Prime  Minister  to  all  the

constituencies,  with  all the  beautiful  pictures

taken?  With the so-called "support" of the people,

why  should they be scared? They had ample time  to

prepare  the electoral registers. I have worked  in

the  Ministry of Home Affairs before,  and  I  know

exactly  how  long  it takes to get  the  electoral

registers  ready. It is a patent falsehood  on  the

part of the Ministers to say that they have not  as

yet got ready the electoral registers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, I shall just mention the so-called

constitutional  methods  that  the  Prime  Minister

waxes  so  eloquent  about. I do  not  speak  under

privilege  in  this  Chamber,  Sir,I  have   been

speaking  on  many occasions outside this  Chamber,

and  when  I went to London recently, I  also  told

Labour   M.P.s.  trade  unionists  and  responsible

organisations that if the British Government really

wanted the people to oppose constitutionally,  then

the  British  Government must make sure  that  they

allowed the Opposition a chance to oppose.  If  the

Opposition  has  no  chance to oppose,  it  is  the

British   Government  that  is  encouraging   armed

struggle, and all responsibility must lie with  the

British  Government and with their  P.A.P. stooges

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to hear that the Chairman of the

Movement for Colonial Freedom. Mr Fenner Brockway,

is  coming,  because  I have with  me  his  written

opinion  on Malaysia and on the referendum,  but  I

will not say more at this stage. I am sure that Mr

Fenner Brockway, when he does come here, will  tell

the Prime



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



Minister  what he thinks of Malaysia and  the  sham

referendum  that was imposed on the people  by  the

P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we all know whit the P.A.P. Government is.

We  know what the P.A.P Ministers are - just a  bunch

of   reactionaries,  opportunists   and   ruthless,

repressive, selfish individuals.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Words only!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister has

repeated  again and again some of the o!d  choruses

of  his  old  colonial masters,  talking  of  links

between  Azahari  and  Said  Zahari  and  our  open

support of the Brunei uprising. I will come to  all

this  by and by. I would like, Sir, at this moment,

before  I venture to speak fully on the motion,  to

move an amendment to the Prime Minister's motion as

follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 1, to leave out from "House" to the end

and insert -  `condemns the Internal Security Council

and  the  People's Action Party Government for  the

arbitrary  arrests and detention without  trial  of

anti-colonial stalwarts and political opponents  of

the  People's  Action Party in  political  parties,

trade  unions, universities and civic organisations

and   te   banning   of   publications   of   these

organisations   in   suppression   of    legitimate

opposition to the neo-colonial Malaysia scheme; and

demands   that  they  forwith  stop   all   further

repressive  measures, release  unconditionally  all

those  detained  under the Preservation  of  Public

Security Ordinance and restore to the people  their

inherent  democratic rights and liberties,  freedom

of   speech   and   publication,  association   and

assembly.'



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I have the amendment?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House condemns the People's Action

Party   Government  for  the  cruel   and   inhuman

treatment  of  political detainees, in  particular,

solitary  confinement and denial of newspapers  and

other  reading materials and demands that detainees

now  in  the  Federation of Malaya  be  immediately

brought  back  to Singapore; and that the  People's

Action Party Government forthwith stop all tortures

and  implement the recommendations of the  People's

Action   Party-appointed   1960   Prisons   Inquiry

Commission Report as contained in Paper Cmd. 17  of

1961.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I take it then that the hon. Member

wishes  to move by way of an amendment the deletion

of  the words from "House" to the end of the  Prime

Minister's motion and there to insert the substance

of his own motions which appear as items 5 and 6 of

the Order Paper. Is that correct?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The amendment is in order. The hon.

Member may continue his speech.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first

refer  to  the  black day of Singapore?  The  Prime

Minister  spoke very lightly of the 2nd February - he

used  the words "1st February" - but to us. Sir,  the

2nd  February  is  a black day for Singapore.  What

happened  on that day - the black day of Singapore -

is  now  history. In the early hours of the morning

of 2nd February, sudden repressive action was taken

against leaders of political Parties, trade unions,

rural    organisations,   hawkers'    associations,

universities, old boys' associations, intellectuals

and   other  progressive  individuals.  All   those

arrested  were,  and still are,  anti-colonial  and

anti-Malaysia  stalwarts  and  bitter  and   strong

opponents  of  the PAP. The mass arrests  were  all

carried  out  with an intimidatory array  of  armed

might.  Accompanying  plainclothes  officers   were

fully   armed   police  with   combat   troops   in

battledress  standing  by  and  on  the  ready.  It

reminds  us of the days of the Gestapo of  dictator

Hitler  and of the Japanese Kempetai. The  Japanese

Kempetai did exactly what the P.A.P. Government has

done today.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Deputy SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>





<br><br>11.42 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis bore the brunt of the

onslaught  and  has suffered the  most  casualties.

From  our  Central Executive Committee alone,  nine

members  have been arrested and detained. They  are

our  Vice  Chairman,  S. Woodhull,  the

Secretary-General Lim Ching Siong the Assistant General,  Mr

Poh Soo Kai, Committee members, Chok



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



Koh  Thong, Fong Swee Suan, Dr Lim Hock Siew,  Lim

Shee  Ping, Dominic Puthucheary and Tan  Yam  Seng.

From  our  Central Cultural sub-committee,  Central

Organisation   sub-committee,   Publication

sub-committee  and  Branch Committees, altogether  more

than   40  from  the  Barisan  Sosialis  have  been

detained.  I will table a list of names of  Barisan

members  recently detained. The total number  under

detention,   together   with   those   from   other

organisations, we now learn, is 133. Nine have been

released,  leaving 124 still under  detention.  124

innocent  persons,  deprived  of  their  individual

freedom   and   kept  behind  walls   in   solitary

confinement, and given treatment worse than that of

convicted  criminals. Why? All because they  oppose

imperialism  and neo-colonialism. All because  they

oppose  the British-sponsored Malaysia, and because

they,  oppose  the P.A.P. The powers  that  be,  in

order  to give an excuse for locking them up,  made

them  out  to be dangerous men. The Prime  Minister

says,  "These  are the people who  will  mount  the

barricades." Yet, not so very long ago, he used  to

ridicule  them  as beer-hall revolutionaries.  Now,

because  4  suits the purpose of the  P.A.P.,  they

have suddenly become dangerous men. And, of course,

it  suits  the Prime Minister. But let us ask:  Did

they steal or rob? No. Did they kill or murder? No.

Did  they take part in riots? No. Did they take  up

arms  against the Government? Again, no!  Yet,  all

these  124  persons have been arbitrarily  arrested

and  detained without charge or trial, and  treated

worse than convicted criminals! Why? Why, Mr Prime

Minister? Why, Mr Deputy Prime Minister?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, as a result of the arrests, threats and

intimidations a change has come over Singapore. The

people  prefer  not  to  talk  so  very  loudly  of

politics  these days. Many clam up on politics  the

moment  they  see  strangers around.  There  is  an

atmosphere  of  suspicion,  uncertainty  and  fear.

There  are so many spies and informers around  that

no one can be certain that what he says will not be

carried  back  to  the ears of the  fearful  P.A.P.

Without doubt, Singapore has become a Police State.

Those in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



authority  can resort to arbitrary arrests  at  any

time. The only law in the State seems to be the law

of the Police, the Special Branch and the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has taken place and is taking place today

merely confirms what we have all along been saying,

namely,  that  the P.A.P. is endangering  democracy

and  that parliamentary democracy under the  P.A.P.

has already become Fascist dictatorship. If such  a

Police  State  is  going  to  be  the  blessing  of

Malaysia, then we must be prepared for worse things

to come. We need only see from how the arrests were

carried out the things to expect with the formation

of  Malaysia. Innocent people engaged in legitimate

pursuits  have been arrested and some very  quickly

whisked  off to the Federation without the families

even  notified  where they were sent.  It  is  like

being  shanghaied, or kidnapped, and that,  by  the

powers   that  be  in  the  country.   It   is   so

unbelievable. The brutality and callousness of  the

people  have to be seen to be believed.  And  I  am

very glad that Mr Fenner Brockway will come  ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> - and see what is happening in

Singapore today.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> And you did not even have the

decency to - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Inquiries from anxious parents

and  families  were  put off, and  in  the  anxious

moments  after  the arrests, no attempt  whatsoever

was  made  by  the  police to give any  information

concerning  the detainees in order to  allay  their

anxiety.  There seems to have been a conspiracy  to

inflict  mental agony and torture on the wives  and

families  of  the  detainees  simply  because  they

happened  to  `be  the wives and  families  of  the

detainees.    Has   the   P.A.P.   Government    no

humanitarian  principles  left?  Repeated  attempts

were  made  by us in the Barisan Sosialis,  in  our

capacity as Legislative Assemblymen, to enquire for

news  of the whereabouts of detainees and how  they

were  being detained, but our efforts were  all  in

vain.   Our   requests  for  news  were  completely

ignored. Wives and families were not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



allowed  to  see  the  detainees  until  after  six

days - six agonising days of anxious waiting. Is this

what the people of Singapore had elected the P.A.P.

in  1959 for - to inflict on them mental torture  and

agonising anxiety, and fear of spies and informers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Sir, there was the question of detainees

being  sent  to  the Federation.  As  citizens  and

residents  of Singapore, why have they to  be  sent

outside Singapore? The talk of "those of Federation

origin  to  be  sent  back  to  the  Federation  of

Malaya", smacks too much of the imposition of

extra-territorial  rights by the Federation on  Singapore

today.  In  so  transferring  persons  detained  in

Singapore  to  the Federation, the two  Governments

have  already  violated and trampled underfoot  the

fundamental human rights of the individual. Already

bad  enough in the case of Singapore residents,  it

becomes   worse  in  the  case  of  the   Singapore

citizens. A person becomes a Singapore citizen with

great difficulty. Yet his rights of citizenship are

summarily  swept  aside. Under  the  circumstances,

what  legal and constitutional safeguard  is  there

left  for  the common man? The arrest of  Lim  Shee

Ping  is  a case in point. This is a good case  for

the   attention   of  international   jurists   and

constitutional experts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Secretariat in

Cairo sent an invitation to the Barisan Sosialis to

send  an  observer  delegate to the  Conference  at

Moshi, Tanganyika. It was decided by us to send Lim

Shee  Ping  as  our delegate. He left Singapore  on

Friday, 1st February, 1963, and was on his  way  to

Moshi when his Federation passport was withdrawn at

Nairobi.  The  Straits Tunes of the  4th  February,

1963, says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Authoritative sources disclosed tonight that he

was  intercepted at Nairobi, Kenya, on his  way  to

Dar-es-Salaam.   There  the   British   authorities

withdrew his Federation passport...'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me emphasise, Sir. The British authorities

withdrew his Federation passport at the request  of

the  Federation Government. He was then  put  on  a

plane  hound  for Malaya. It is not  that  he  went

voluntarily by himself. But he was bodily put on  a

plane bound for Malaya.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is not known when he left Nairobi and whether

he  will  be  flown  back  to  Singapore  or  Kuala

Lumpur."   This  is  the  high-handed   action   of

arbitrary  arrest carried out across the high  seas

and  across international boundaries. And for  what

reason?  Did  he  commit  murder  or  some  serious

international  crime that needed  the  services  of

Interpol? Lim Shee Ping committed no crime. He  had

been seen off only the day before at the Airport by

many  of  us,  and he was then on  his  way  to  an

International  Conference. Yet he  was  arbitrarily

stopped, arrested and sent back to Malaya! A  cable

was   received  from  him  informing  us  that  his

passport had been withdrawn and that he expected to

arrive  back in Singapore at 12 midnight on Monday.

4th  February,  1963. We made several  attempts  to

meet  him, but of course they were all to no avail.

The truth of the matter is - and here I challenge the

Minister for Home Affairs in his answer to me  only

yesterday - Lim Shee Ping was secretly transferred en

route  in  Bombay, or at Calcutta,  from  a  Qantas

flight to an Air India flight. If, according to the

Minister  for  Home  Affairs,  he  came  back  just

because   he   did  not  have  his  passport,   the

authorities would not have transferred him from one

flight to another. And instead of arriving back  in

Singapore  at  12  midnight as expected  or  on  an

earlier Qantas flight at 7 p.m. he arrived back  in

Singapore at 5 p.m instead. Instead of 12  midnight

or  instead  of  a  bit earlier at  7  o'clock,  he

arrived  back  at  5  o'clock. This  was  specially

arranged by the British authorities to ensure  that

we   would  not  have  a  chance  of  meeting  him.

Newspapers next morning headlined, "In and out  and

nobody knew". "Detainee Lim expected on one plane .

.  . He came by another." This is the Machiavellian

plotting  of  pro-colonial stooges  and  agents  in

order to deprive people of their freedom.



<br><br>(00.01 a.m., 10th April, 1963)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Wednesday, 6th February, 1963, the Straits

Times, at column 4, page 5, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Reporters who were waiting near the V.I.P. Room

to  interview  Dr  Subandrio, Indonesia's  Foreign

Minister,  did  not see him [Lim Shee  Ping]  being

hustled [I wish the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



Minister for Home Affairs will listen to this] from

the  plane  to a police land rover. He  was  driven

from  the  Airport through a little used gate  near

the site of the new terminal building. Later he was

transferred  to another land rover  and  driven  to

Kuala Lumpur under a strong police escort.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, such is the cloak-and-dagger story of the

arrest   of   Lim  Shee  Ping,  Central   Executive

Committee  member  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis   and

adviser to the Singapore Business Houses Employees'

Union.  Yet  the arrest which was done  in  such  a

secretive manner (like the arrests of the others in

the  small  hours of the morning)  shows  that  the

P.A.P. knows  how objectionable and  hateful  such

arrests are in the eyes of the people of Singapore.

The  arrest of Lim Shee Ping shows clearly too  how

the  abhorrent police work in Singapore.  It  shows

that  persons  can  even be arrested  in  far  away

countries in Africa. Lim Shee Ping was arrested  by

the  British authorities in Nairobi, Kenya, not  in

Singapore. This again shows that it is the colonial

octopus,  stretching  across  countries,  seas  and

continents, that is the real monster in Malaya. The

British  still  control all, behind the  facade  of

independence in Malaya. The Federation merely  acts

as  British  agents, protecting British  interests.

The  P.A.P. are  only  the flunkies  of  both  the

British  and  the Federation Governments!  Did  the

people  of  Singapore elect the P.A.P. in  1959  to

become   flunkies   to   colonialists  and

neo-colonialists?  No,  Sir.  The  people  elected  the

P.A.P. to carry on the anti-colonial struggle.  But

now  that  the  P.A.P. leaders have become  willing

stooges of colonialism, no amount of so-called good

work  and  social  reforms, like  the  building  of

flats - which  are white elephants - clinics, creches,

post offices and community centres, will be able to

save  them from the wrath of the people. It is only

a  matter of time, and time is fast running out for

the P.A.P. `colonial stooges. Though arrests by the

P.A.P. were not unexpected, and I shall enlarge  on

this  a  little later, nevertheless, the suddenness

of the so-called "dawn swoop" and the extensiveness

of  the  arrests surprised the whole of  Singapore,

especially   when  there  was  not  the   slightest

justification for the arrests. Many just could  not

bring  themselves to believe that  the  P.A.P. had

really



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



gone  to  the  extent  of repaying  past  help  and

support  with  such gross ingratitude and  outright

treachery.  Measured by any moral standard,  it  is

difficult  to  believe  that  anyone  could  be  so

ungrateful. Even a dog will not bite the hand  that

feeds it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> That is right, thirteen dogs

in front of us.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Immediately after the arrests,

we  demanded the immediate recall of the  Assembly.

We  telephoned, and we wrote letters to the  Leader

of  the  House after he had refused to  see  us  on

important Assembly business. I do not know  who  he

thinks he is. Maybe because he is the Deputy  Prime

Minister!  But surely, as the Leader of the  House,

he  has no right whatsoever to refuse opportunities

for  Members  of the House to see him on  important

Legislative  Assembly business. It is the  business

of  the  Leader  of the House to be ever  ready  to

speak to Members of the House. Yet we have a Leader

of the House who puts on airs and says, "You cannot

see  me unless you have an appointment." I am  sure

when  he takes up courage enough to go hack to  the

people of Rochore, the people of Rochore will  give

him a re-sounding answer.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> And you go back to Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He will lose his deposit.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> You will lose yours too.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, Sir, it was obvious

that  the P.A.P. had no intention of recalling  the

Assembly   immediately.  The  Prime  Minister   has

admitted that the issue was too hot. The P.A.P. no

doubt  preferred to wait for the heat to  cool  off

before   embarking  on  a  debate  on  the  matter.

Attempts  were  made  to  use  Radio  P.A.P. as  a

substitute for the Legislative Assembly. The P.A.P.

had  hoped to manipulate the radio and the  meeting

for  P.A.P. propaganda. The Government had prepared

for a very long Assembly holiday.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



The  Budget, you will remember, Sir, for the  first

half  year of 1963 was passed in 1961 in  order  to

allow  the  Government  to  skip  holding  Assembly

sittings until the end of June. And, however  brave

and  courageous, whatever front the Prime  Minister

may think of putting up, we all know that it is the

pressure   of  public  opinion  that   forced   the

Government  to reconvene the Assembly.  We  realise

that  the P.A.P. today will do its best to make  it

difficult  for us. But knowing full well that  they

have  to  depend on the Lim Yew Hock group to  prop

them  up in office, they dare not offend the Member

for Cairnhill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a little while back, the Prime Minister

admitted  that  he  had to reconvene  the  Assembly

because the Member for Cairnhill had also asked for

it.  Does  it not show how much the Prime  Minister

and  the P.A.P. have to crawl down before the  very

people  whom  they  used to  ridicule  and  despise

before? What a sorry plight to see P.A.P. Ministers

grovelling  before  those whom  they  had  not  the

slightest  opinion of only a short while ago!  They

have  had  no  sitting for the last  eight  months,

since the middle of July, except for a

Gilbert-and-Sullivan  affair on the 5th of September after  the

referendum. Many people in the United Kingdom  find

it  very  difficult  to  believe  that  we  have  a

Legislative  Assembly in Singapore today.  All  are

shocked  with  amazement at the  complete  lack  of

parliamentary practice under the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must not forget that today there is a

news-gag  on us in the Barisan Sosialis. I  touched

on  this yesterday. The Government wants to  create

the   impression,   inside  as  well   as   outside

Singapore, and the Borneo territories as Well, that

there  is  very little opposition to  Malaysia.  In

fact,   there   is  a  news-gag  on  anything   and

everything that is against Malaysia. On  the  other

hand,  the  slightest bit of pro-Malaysia  news  is

played  up  and given big headlines.  Not  only  is

there a news-gag on the Barisan Sosialis and on all

who  are  anti-Malaysia,  but,  as  you  know,  ten

publications  of  trade unions,  universities,  and

even political Parties, have also been banned



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



since  the  arrests. There is  now  no  freedom  of

association  and assembly. On top of all  this,  we

are now denied the freedom of publication.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis has not been proscribed, and

the  organs  of our Party - the Chinese Barisan,  the

English  Plebeian,  and the Malay  Rakyat - have  not

been banned, hut attempts have been made to ban our

organs  indirectly, as I mentioned  yesterday.  Our

printers had their licences suspended and they were

forced  to  go out of business for ten  days.  They

have   - been given back their yearly printing  press

licences,  but  they no longer dare  to  print  our

Party organs. This is the type of democracy we have

in    Singapore   today:   arrests,   banning    of

publications,  cruel  and  inhuman   treatment   of

detainees, and a complete denial of the fundamental

rights  of  mankind. How can the P.A.P.  Government

still  pretend to practise parliamentary  democracy

in  Singapore?  No,  Sir,  this  is  the  death  of

democracy. Singapore has become a police State. The

selfish interests of P.A.P. leaders and their  lust

for  power  have  turned them into Fascists.  Power

tends   to  corrupt  and  absolute  power  corrupts

absolutely. This dictum is self-explanatory. It  is

clear  too that State power in Singapore has fallen

into  wrong  hands, and the earlier the  P.A.P. is

removed  from  office, the better it  will  be  for

Singapore and for every one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are a number of allegations in the

Internal Security Council's statement issued  after

the arrests on 2nd February, chief among which are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) that the Barisan Sosialis and other

organisations   are  under  control   of   the Communists;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) that the three Governments concur in the

arrests:   (this,  according  to   the   Prime Minister,   is  the  wisdom  of   the   P.A.P. Ministers)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) that the persons were arrested to

safeguard  the security of Singapore  and  the

territories of the proposed Malaysia;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) that they were arrested because of their open

support  of the uprising in Brunei  and  their

resorting to violence and bloodshed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us examine these allegations one by one,

as  well  as other points in the Internal  Security

Council's  statement  and  see  whether  they   are

justifiable allegations. Let us first deal with the

subject of Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communism is the pet subject of the Prime

Minister and is an accusation that is always raised

by  the  colonialists to justify  every  repression

against anti-colonial forces. Ever since the Second

World   War,   and   even  before  that,   national

liberation  movements,  which  the  Prime  Minister

nowadays  speaks so slightingly of, in all colonial

countries have been daily gaining in momentum,  and

colonial powers have always used this accusation to

deny   the  people  their  legitimate  rights   and

aspirations  in  the colonies and semi-colonies  in

Asia, Africa and Latin America. The Communist bogey

has always been used to frighten and intimidate the

people. Almost all nationalist leaders in countries

that have now gained their independence had at  one

time  or  another been accused of being Communists,

pro-Communists  or Communist-front men.  This  has,

however,  not  prevented  their  helping   in   the

liberation of their own countries from the yoke  of

foreign domination, nor the inevitable collapse  of

colonialism. Many were imprisoned for their beliefs

and for the part they played in their just national

struggles. But, in almost every case, the  colonial

powers had been compelled ultimately by pressure of

public  opinion and the inevitable march of history

to  release  them  and to recognise  them  as  true

national leaders of their countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our country, all anti-colonial stalwarts, all

who   wage   an  uncompromising  struggle   against

imperialism and colonialism, and all true patriots,

have   at   one  time  or  another  been   labelled

Communists  of  one hue or another. Even  Lee  Kuan

Yew, the McCarthy type anti-Communist of today, and

ironically     the     self-professed     Communist

collaborator



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



of   yesterday,  was  at  one  time  also  labelled

Communist.  He was then wearing the mask  of

anti-colonialism and he was pretending to fight  against

imperialism and colonialism. Of course, he  is  now

completely unmasked. He is now exposed through  and

through - he is now seen in his true colours - an

out-and-out  colonial  stooge, a  running  dog  of  the

imperialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this charge of Communism is not new. In

fact,  so long as colonialism in whatever shape  or

form  exists,  and  so long as we struggle  against

colonialism, so long will this charge of  Communism

hang over us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This business of the Communist conspiracy is so

widespread that it haunts even the countries of the

sovereign  powers themselves. I was informed  by  a

British  Member of Parliament, Mr William  Warbey,

when  I was in London recently that the stories  of

the  Communist conspiracy in Singapore reminded him

very much of the stories put out before the war  by

the British Government in Britain itself. Thus, one

can see that this Communist bogey is something that

is  not confined to the colonial territories alone.

It  is  also present in the very heartland  of  the

colonial  power  itself. In  fact,  it  is  present

wherever privileged groups exist and when they  try

to prolong their oppression and exploitation of the

people.  It is especially used by Fascist dictators

and tyrannical oppressors who find in the Communist

bogey an excuse for all sorts of repressive actions

and  terror. Hitler made use of this bogey, and  we

know today what the world thinks of him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In British territories the world over today,

wherever there is a national liberation movement or

some  strong Opposition to colonial rule  there  is

this Communist label bandied around. So, in Malaya,

when  the  Federation  politicians  and  the  Prime

Minister make this same accusation, they are merely

echoing  the words of British colonialism  in  many

parts of the world. Indeed, they are merely joining

the  chorus  of  men like Chiang Kai-shek,  Syngman

Rhee  and Ngo Dinh Diem - Fascist dictators  who  use

anti-Communism as an excuse for all



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



sorts  of  repressions. We have  already  seen  the

Minister for Education making friends with Ngo Dinh

Diem,  a  person  whom the Prime Minister  used  to

condemn not so very long ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember, when we talk of Communism, that

the M.C.P. has been an illegal organisation for the

last  15  years, and every effort has been made  by

the  police and colonial troops to hunt down  every

Communist.  It  is convenient to label  all  strong

opposition as Communists, as it paves the  way  for

the  colonial power to invoke the law against  such

opposition.  But  what  is  the  result   of   such

Communist-labelling?  It  does   Snot   solve   the

problems  of  poverty.  It  only  results  in   the

crippling  of  all democratic forms  Of  expression

that  exist.  Already  we see the  Communist  label

being  used in Singapore to deny workers and  trade

unions  their  fundamental  rights  of  freedom  of

association  and  assembly. Even political  Parties

have   been  similarly  denied  their  freedom   of

assembly.  I do not need to mention the banning  of

the  ten  publications  and journals  of  political

Parties,  trade  Unions,  universities  and   other

organisations.  Those who wish to  oppose  Malaysia

constitutionally, like our comrades and friends  in

the  Barisan Sosialis and other political  Parties,

trade  unions  and civic organisations,  have  been

arbitrarily arrested and detained. This  Government

simply  hangs  the Communist label  on  them.  This

label  of  Communism is, with few exceptions,  only

applied  to  persons of Chinese origin.  The  Party

Rakyat  and  the people of Brunei revolted  against

the imposition of Malaysia, but being mostly of the

Malay race, the charge of Communism is not levelled

at  them. Of course, this is only an example Of the

colonial   policy   of   divide   and   rule.   The

colonialists  hope  to  fan the  flames  of  inter-communal  suspicion and discord. The Prime Minister

himself  played  the  some colonial  game  when  he

"advised"  the  Chinese in Sabah  to  quickly  join

Malaysia  by  emphasising that the Brunei  uprising

was mainly a Malay revolt. This is only one example

of the communal policies of the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the opposition to Malaysia has a genuine

basis  and  has  nothing to do with  any  Communist

plot,  indeed,  this opposition is because  of  the

imperialist   plot.  Instead   of   answering   the

injustices  of  the  Malaysia  Plan,  the  British,

Federation and Singapore Governments run away  from

answering  by calling us Communists and by  putting

leaders,  who  oppose  Malaysia,  in  prison.  They

cannot   answer   our  proof   that   Malaysia   is

unacceptable  to the majority of the people.  Their

answer  is  the answer of Fascist dictators - arrest,

imprisonment  and torture. By crying Communism,  of

course,  they  hope to side-track the attention  of

the  people  from their oppression and exploitation

and to confuse them. By arresting the leaders, they

hope  also  to intimidate the people into  abjectly

accepting   Malaysia   and   to   prevent   further

opposition  to the Malaysia Plan. As I  have  said,

they  want to create the impression to the  outside

world  that  there  is  very little  opposition  to

Malaysia,  and that the majority support  Malaysia.

Of   course,  the  reverse  is  the  case  but   so

frightened  are they of the true facts being  known

to  the outside world that they have to arrest  Lim

Shee  Ping,  our  delegate to the Moshi  Afro-Asian

Conference, before he arrived there. And  when  the

uninvited  P.A.P. delegation failed  to  gate-crash

into the conference, they turned round to cry "sour

grapes"   and  accused  the  conference  as   being

Communist-dominated.  This alone  shows  how  ready

they  are to use the Communist label on those  who

do not accept their policies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is clear, therefore, that no weight can be put

on  the allegation in the Internal Security Council

statement  that the Barisan Sosialis is  controlled

by  the Communists. As I have said on many previous

occasions,   the  Communist  label   means   strong

opposition.  To  say that the Barisan  Sosialis  is

under the control of the Communists only means that

the  P.A.P. recognise  the  strength  and  popular

support of the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>00.32 a.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch a little on why the P.A.P. is so

fond  of this Communist line. Why is the P.A.P. so

fond  of  the  Communist bogey? The Prime  Minister

delights  in  talking  about Communism.  He  enjoys

talking  Communism and for very good  reasons  too.

Why? Let us analyse why. The Prime Minister and his

opportunistic friends like the Communist line. Why?

Because  with  this Communist bogey, they  hope  to

deceive  the  people  and  frighten  them.  I  have

already  mentioned  that.  They  hope  to  use  the

Communist  bogey  as  a  tool  by  which  to  crush

political  opposition  and if political  opposition

could  be crushed, then, of course, there would  be

no great difficulty in their maintaining themselves

in office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis today offers the greatest

effective  opposition to the P.A.P. Therefore,  the

first  objective of the P.A.P. is to  identify  the

Barisan  Sosialis  with the  Communist  bogey,  and

through the excuse and pretext of dealing with  the

Communists,  the P.A.P. hope to hit at the  Barisan

Sosialis  and  all other organisations  that  offer

effective  Opposition to the P.A.P. That is  reason

No. 1.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is the Prime Minister uses the

omnipresent Communist as a ready-made scapegoat for

all  the  sins  of commission and omission  of  the

P.A.P.  Thus blames the Communist for  all  the

P.A.P. mistakes and failures, for all  the  P.A.P.

broken  promises,  for all the P.A.P. undemocratic

and  Fascist  repressive actions,  for  all  P.A.P.

reactionary  and  pro-colonial policies.  In  fact,

everything  that  goes  wrong  is  indiscriminately

blamed on the omni-present Communist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason is this. It follows from this

that since all mistakes and faults are laid at  the

door-step   of  the  Communist  bogey,  the   Prime

Minister   and  his  P.A.P.  Ministers  can   claim

themselves  to  be  always  right,  to  be   always

infallible. They then hope to absolve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



themselves  from all blame under all circumstances,

and  on all big vital issues that have aroused  the

indignation of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth reason is this. The Prime Minister

also  uses  this Communist bogey with the  hope  of

silencing  opposition  to P.A.P. undemocratic  and

Fascist  ways. As the M.C.P. is an illegal body  in

Singapore and the Federation, no one will  be  able

to  speak up in public on its behalf without at the

same  time  being  smeared  as  Communist  or

pro-Communist. Thus the Prime Minister hopes to silence

even the uncommitted into not daring to openly  and

publicly  oppose or criticise P.A.P. leaders.  With

luck,  the  Prime  Minister  also  hopes  even   to

intimidate them into "supporting" the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reason No. 5 is this. With this Communist bogey,

the  P.A.P. hopes also to alienate certain sections

of  the people from us in the Barisan Sosialis  and

thus  restrict and limit the growing  strength  and

influence of the Barisan Sosialis. Thus,  from  the

very beginning, since our break with the P.A.P., we

in   the   Barisan  Sosialis  have  been   labelled

Communist   and  pro-Communist,  and  the   Barisan

Sosialis  and other anti-P.A.P. organisations  have

been labelled Communist front organisations, and so

on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 12 radio talks and the publication of

thousands  and thousands of The Battle  For  Merger

booklets  were all designed to scare  and  frighten

people away from us in the Barisan Sosialis.  Thus,

the  Communist  bogey becomes the  useful  tool  by

which   P.A.P. leaders  hope  to  crush  political

opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All through the past two or three years, we have

seen  how  the  P.A.P. work this  bogey  line.  For

instance:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) In an attempt to crush political opponents

and  to  salvage their personal political fortunes,

the  P.A.P. leaders support the  British-sponsored

Malaysia  Plan. They strain every sinew  and  exert

the utmost effort to sell the Plan to the people of

the five territories and proclaim that all this  is

meant to fight Communism.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Similarly they claim that the obnoxious clause 29 and the whole sham referendum itself were meant ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already indicated to

the Member for Queenstown that on no account can he

cast any reflection on a decision of this Assembly.

When  he  refers  to  clause 29 of  the  Referendum

Ordinance as obnoxious, that is certainly casting a

reflection on a decision of this Assembly. He  must

not do that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I withdraw the word

"obnoxious".  Sir. As I have said,  similarly  they

claim that clause 29 of the Referendum Bill and the

whole  referendum itself were meant  to  fight  the

omnipresent Communist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) The P.A.P.'s unreasonable and Fascist

actions against the People's Association employees,

Work Brigade employees, striking office workers and

Chinese school students were attributed to fighting

so-called Communist infiltration and subversion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) The interference with the practice of

academic  freedom  of  the  universities,   unequal

employment opportunities for Nanyang graduates  and

the  suppression of the freedom of publication were

again attributed to fighting Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) The break-up of the former T.U.C. and the

failure  to  keep  the  P.AP, election

promises   - especially of the promise of the unification of the

trade  union  movement - the P.A.P.'s  sponsoring  of

splinter unions and the so-called N.T.UC., and  the

denial  of the freedom of association and  assembly

to  trade  unions and political parties,  have  all

been also attributed to fighting Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) The withdrawal of citizenship from

anti-colonial  stalwarts  and the  denial  of  jobs  and

employment  to certain persons are also  attributed

to fighting Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) The restriction of travel of Singapore

students  and  teachers and  the  unreasonable  and

unjust  terms  of the White Paper merger  proposals

are also because of the fear of so-called Communist

infiltration.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(viii) The failure of the P.A.P.'s

industrialisation programme has been blamed on  the

Communists. Even the dissatisfaction and  anger  of

farmers  for  their being evicted from their  homes

with  inadequate  and  unsatisfactory  compensatory

terms  in  Toa  Payoh and Geylang Serai  and  other

places have been attributed to the Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ix) The retention and use of the P.P.S.O. and

the recent arbitrary arrests and detentions without

charge  or  trial  are  again because  of  fighting

Communism. And



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(x) The cruel and inhuman treatment of detainees -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> On a point of elucidation.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He can wait, Sir. And the

cruel  and inhuman treatment of detainees that  has

been  condemned by the whole world is also  because

they are alleged to be Communists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us ask the two Ministers over there: how

silly can the P.A.P. get? What further examples  do

we  need to see P.A.P. machinations in the  use  of

anti-Communism   for  selfish  ends?   The   P.A.P.

Ministers  have used the Communist  bogey  to  good

purpose;  all to serve their own personal interests

and,  of  course, the interests of  their  colonial

masters. All this Communism business, of course, is

linked  up with the Special Branch and the P.P.S.O.

And  since  the  P.A.P. leaders have  served  their

colonial masters so very faithfully, they  are,  of

course,  entitled  to  full  encouragement  of  the

colonialists.  The P.A.P. now have the  active

co-operation of the organs of repression used  by  the

colonialists  and imperialists for  the  oppression

and  exploitation  of the people.  Their  so-called

Intelligence  Department  of  Singapore   is   this

Special  Branch. The Special Branch is one  of  the

main  organs of colonial repression. It is the most

noxious  organ of imperial rule, and  in  a  colony

like Singapore, it can be said that the real rulers

are not the P.A.P. Ministers but the Special Branch

of the Police.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the Emergency in June 1948, repressive

laws  have turned our country into a police  state.

When  the  Emergency Regulations were withdrawn  in

Singapore  in  1955,  they  were  replaced  by  the

P.P.S.O. and under the P.P.S.O., large numbers  of

our  patriots and anti-colonial stalwarts have been

arrested and detained without trial. Many are still

languishing  in  prison after seven  years  without

charge  or trial, detained at the pleasure  of  the

colonial masters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

Articles  18 and 19 have this to say. This  is  the 1945

United Nations Universal Declaration of Human

Rights. Article 18 says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Everyone has the right to freedom of thought,

conscience and religion. The right includes freedom

to change his religion or belief and freedom either

alone  or  in  company  with others  in  public  or

private  to  manifest  his religion  or  belief  in

teaching, practice, worship and observance.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 19 says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and

expression.  This right includes  freedom  to  hold

opinions without interference and to seek,  receive

and  impart information and ideas through any media

and regardless of frontiers.'



<br><br>This   is  our  Universal  Declaration  of   Human

Rights, Articles 18 and 19. But what do we find  in

Singapore,   the   Borneo   territories   and   the

Federation?  It  is  entirely  different  from  the

recognised United Nations Universal Declaration  of

Human  Rights. The Constitution lays it  down  that

there   is   freedom  of  speech  and  publication,

association and assembly. But it is not the  rights

that  exist  on paper that count. It is whether  or

not  these rights can be exercised and enforced  in

practice  that really counts. Voltaire  many  years

ago said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`I detest your views. But I am prepared to die for

your right to express them.'



<br><br>Can  the  Prime Minister and his Ministers rise  to

just one-hundredth of the stature of Voltaire?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today to deny these rights to the people,

subterfuges  and cover-up charges are laid  at  the

door-steps of the people. And under the pretext  of

safeguarding   the   "security   of   the   state,"

repressive  action  has been  extensively   carried

out! The mere fact that these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



allegations  are made and no charge  and  trial  is

given shows the hollowness of the allegations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the Special Branch? I had worked in the

Ministry of Home Affairs for a short period  and  I

have  come  to learn a number of detestable  things

about  the  Special Branch. We all  know  that  the

Special  Branch in Singapore is merely an off-shoot

of  the secret police started in the middle of  the

19th  century in England itself. Spies  and  agents

were  employed by the Government at the  time  when

the   struggle  between  the  capitalists  and  the

workers were assuming significant proportions.  And

these  spies and agents were employed to deal  with

the working class in the land of the very heart  of

imperialism itself. This secret police very rapidly

expanded its influence all-pervadingly to  all  the

government  departments, not  only  in  the  United

Kingdom, but very quickly also to the colonies. Its

powers  are  extensive.  Even  Parliament  and  our

Assembly  have no say in the running of the  secret

police,  and  I  dare say even the Ministers,  more

often  than not, know nothing of what is  happening

inside   the  Special  Branch  in  Robinson   Road,

Singapore,   to   say   nothing   of   Assemblymen,

Backbenchers and other people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned the other day, when one of the

Ministers  was  asked why there should  be  arrests

this time, that he said he knew nothing of what was

happening. He did not know a single thing  and  yet

he  is  a  Minister of the Government  today!  This

merely proves my point, Sir, that even Ministers do

not know what is happening in Robinson Road Special

Branch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Branch is there to serve not the

interests  of  the  people  of  Singapore  but  the

interests  of  colonialism  and  imperialism.   The

Special  Branch is directly linked with the  United

Kingdom  Commissioner in Singapore and the big-wigs

of  the British Military Forces who are here not to

serve the interests of the people of Singapore, but

to serve the interests of people outside Singapore.

They  are  here,  not to give us  freedom,  but  to

oppress  and to deny the people of Singapore  their

legitimate  hopes and aspirations. The wide  powers

of arrests



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



and detention given to the Special Branch under the

P.P.S.O. surprised even the people of  the  United

Kingdom  itself. There in the United  Kingdom,  the

powers of the secret police are strictly limited by

the  safeguards in the habeas corpus. This  is  not

possible in Singapore today under the P.P.S.O.  And

from this alone, Sir, we should be able to see what

a  repressive instrument the P.P.S.O. is  today  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the Special Branch, being merely a

colonial  organ  of repression, maligns  all

anti-colonial   political  Parties,  organisations   and

progressive individuals as Communists and those who

oppose  the  P.A.P. are, of course,  automatically

Communists. The Prime Minister tells us  there  are

only  300  Communists  in  Singapore.  But  because

hundreds  of thousands in political Parties,  trade

unions  and civic organisations oppose the  P.A.P.,

these  hundreds  of  thousands  have  all  suddenly

become  Communists.  The  Prime  Minister  used  to

ridicule  them and called them all sorts  of  fancy

names. They were all beer-hall revolutionaries,

arm-chair revolutionaries and what-not. But because  he

fears  their  opposition today, he has  arbitrarily

arrested  them, detained them. Now he has a  chance

to  pose  to  the  people again, not  as  an

anti-colonialist, but as an oppressor of the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Branch, of course, is served very

well  with  spies and informers. We see  them  very

frequently  nowadays. They are  always  waiting  in

lanes  and all sorts of odd places. In our  Barisan

Sosialis  headquarters, we have  spies  and  agents

opposite us, around us, below us ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Above us.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- and there are Special Branch

officers who are permanently stuck to coffee shops,

and just do not budge. Some of them, of course,  do

it  very  openly. They know that we know  them  and

they  do not even bother to cover up the fact  that

they are undercover agents. Sometimes they pose as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



loving  couples. But, of course, it does  not  make

much  difference as to how they pose. We  can  deal

with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very few people understand how the Special Branch

works.  That they open letters, tap our telephones,

censor our communications coming into and going out

of  the country and tail people around like dogs is

an open secret. But how spies, informers and agents

provocateurs work is not so well-known. But however

the spies and informers work, they have been proved

to be the most unreliable of witnesses. The case of

Tommy Koh is still fresh in our minds. I have  read

how  the Un-American Committee works in America and

I  have  read  also how thousands and  millions  of

pounds have been put aside for the secret police in

the  United Kingdom. But all of us know that  these

informers do not speak the truth. They cannot speak

the  truth and all of them mix a little truth  with

lots of falsehood. The very nature of spying itself

requires that they keep on lying. They spy and  lie

all  the  time. An undercover agent has to  deceive

associates  into  thinking  him  to   be   one   of

themselves. And the longer the spies and  informers

are  at  their jobs the greater is the blurring  of

the  thin  line between truth and falsehood.  These

spies,  in order to gain the good favours of  their

superiors, very, very often have great imagination.

The  imagination turns to beautiful embroidery  and

fabrication of events that did not take  place  and

of  words that were never said. Moreover, there  is

no  possibility of verifying the reports  of  spies

and   informers.  The  mistakes  of   doctors   and

accountants can be checked, but the only witness to

so-called conspiracy is the victim the spy wants to

punish. Under those circumstances, how can we  ever

believe the words of these spies and informers  the

weight  of  whose information the P.A.P. Government

depends on so heavily?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obsession about anti-Communism and so-called

security  have  merely  degenerated  into  outright

attacks  on  freedom  of  speech  and  publication,

association  and  assembly.  For  those  who   seek

employment,  there is the screening  apparatus  and

the P.A.P. has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



made full use of this to deny many innocent persons

of  their  means  of livelihood. There  are

scare-headlines of the Communist menace like the  Straits

Times  poster headline this morning of "inquiry  of

Reds   in  trade  unions."  I  am  sure  tomorrow's

headline   will  carry  further  dangers   of   Red

infiltration  in Singapore. These are all  intended

to  strike fear into the hearts of the ordinary man

in  the  Street and to restrain him and to  silence

him  and  to  caution him, if he  should  be  brave

enough to oppose the P.A.P., to be careful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore today, because of the Special Branch

and  the  exploitation  of  anti-Communism  by  the

P.A.P.,  there  is, as I have said,  fear  in  many

places - fear of being named by the Special  Branch

to be linked with the Barisan Sosialis, so much so'

that  there  is also fear of coming out  boldly  in

support  of  just  causes  and  movements  for  the

improvement of the livelihood of the workers ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Who wrote that for you?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- and fear of being seen by

Special Branch informers attending Barisan Sosialis

rallies.  The Prime Minister himself said a  little

while  back  that  it was to see who  attended  our

rally  that he gave us a permit for our rally.  The

Special Branch men were there to intimidate all who

attended  our rally. Then again, there i5  fear  of

openly  buying  anti-P.A.P. newspapers,  like  the

Plebeian,  and  there  is fear  of  buying  reading

material, books and literature which are considered

undesirable  by  the Special Branch;  the  fear  of

being  seen to be chummy and friendly with  Barisan

Sosialis leaders, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now deal a little bit with the so-called

concurrence  of the three parties and the  security

of   the   State.  The  I.S.C. statement  stresses

concurrence  of the three parties - the British,  the

Federation  and  the  Singapore Governments - on  the

arrests  on  2nd February, 1963. It  was  not  just

because the United Kingdom wants to take repressive

action,  not just because the Federation  wants  to

arrest  anybody, not  - just he cause  the  Singapore

Government wants



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



to  lock  someone up, not because any  one  of  the

Troika of the I.S.C., but because all the three - the

British,   the   Federation,  and   the   Singapore

Governments - concur  and  want  to  take  repressive

action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister calls this the wisdom of the P.A.P. But why this emphasis? The answer is simple, it is obvious that none of the three alone would like to face the music of (he wrath of the people. But let us first find out why the British and the Federation Governments want to take repressive action. The British are cunning and experienced

colonialists.  They  have  been  at  the  game  for

hundreds  of  years and from past  experience  they

know  that repressive action of any sort will  only

engender  resentment and bitter  hatred  among  the

people.  If  the  British alone were  to  take  any

repressive  action,  they alone  would  become  the

object of opprobrium and hatred of the people, They

would  therefore prefer that repressive  action  be

taken  by stooges, if possible. It would take  away

the  sharp  edge  of  criticism  of  world  opinion

against them. The stooges would then have to  share

and  even  take the brunt of resentment and  hatred

that  such repressive action would cause. Moreover,

it  would  allow the British to present  themselves

still  as  democrats. And if embarrassing questions

are  asked in the British Parliament, for instance,

they could pass the buck on to the local Government

and   their   stooges,  and  let  them   fend   for

themselves.  Thus we see the pantomime  enacted  in

the   British  Parliament  immediately  after   the

arrests. In the U.K. Hansard of 4th February, 1963,

col. 37, Mr Warbey is quoted to have said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Secretary of State said that the people who

have  been  arrested  were  all  known  Communists,

engaged  in subversive activities. Can we take  it,

then,  that all of them will he immediately put  on

trial?'



<br><br>And then Mr Sandys replied:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That will be for the Government of Singapore.'



<br><br>Just  one small sweet sentence: "That will  be  for

the Government of Singapore." [Interruption]



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes, the British imperialists

are  the  arch  enemies of the  people,  but  their

stooges,  the  P.A.P. Ministers of Singapore,  will

have  to answer to the people. Here we see how  the

British  work:  they  always leave  the  unpleasant

things  to be answered by their stooges,  like  the

Minister  for Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister

opposite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this aim in view, the British had for a long

time cajoled and egged the P.A.P. on, praising  the

cleverness,  intelligence,  ingenuity,  brilliance,

and  what-not, of the P.A.P. leadership and leading

them  on by the nose and soft-soaping them all  the

way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959, fearing the strength of the working

class  support  for the policies  which  the  Prime

Minister  then pretended to adhere to, the  British

had done everything they could to prevent the P.A.P

from  gaining power. But the popular will  at  that

time  could  not be thwarted, and in spite  of  the

British  the  P.A.P. came to power in  1959.  Since

they  could not prevent the P.A.P. from coming into

office,   they  did  the  next  best  thing.   They

manoeuvred and engineered a situation such that the

personal  interests of the P.A.P. leadership  would

coincide  with  the interests of the British.  Once

their interests coincide, they would then goad  the

P.A.P. into taking repressive action  as  part  of

their desperate efforts to check the advance of the

growing strength of the anti-colonial movement.  In

this manner the British would achieve the objective

of protecting and preserving their interests in the

area and, of course, getting the stooges to do  the

dirty work for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this situation that has been engineered

and  manoeuvred by the colonial master? It  is  the

situation  that has arisen with, and is the  result

of,  the  development of Malaysia. It  has  already

placed the P.A.P. in the most absurd and ridiculous

position of a political Party that professees to be

anti-colonial having to fight instead  the  battles

for  the  colonial  master  and  having  to  defend

colonialism against the masses. It is not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



the  British that has to sell the idea of Malaysia,

but   their  No.  1  salesman - the  Lee   Kuan   Yew

clique - that travels all round the world  hoping  to

deceive other countries about Malaysia. It  is  Lee

Kuan  Yew and Company and not the British  who  are

the   most  vociferous  and  demonstrative  in  the

propaganda promotion and defence of Malaysia. It is

the  P.A.P. that had to rig the referendum and  not

the  British,  though with British  connivance,  in

order  to give a false and distorted impression  of

the  wishes  of  the  people of  Singapore  to  the

outside  world. And inflated indeed was  the  Prime

Minister   with   artificial  colonial   pomp   and

prestige.  He  was showered with  praise  from  the

colonial master.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally today the ridiculous position in which

the  P.A.P. has found itself has caused it to  take

repressive  action against the people of Singapore,

a  treachery  which  will condemn  the  P.A.P. for

generations to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British lion indeed has very seductively and

cunningly  manoeuvred the P.A.P  into  a  situation

where  the P.A.P. willy-nilly becomes the  handmaid

and  errand boy of British imperialism. The British

want  to  protect and preserve their  interests  so

that they may continue to exploit the resources  in

the   region:   and   this  they  have   apparently

temporarily  succeeded in so doing, thanks  to  the

mass  arrests. Thanks to the collaboration of their

minions and stooges in the P.A P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the British, therefore, to concur with the

repressive action on 2nd February, 1963, or at  any

time   for   that  matter,  is  not  difficult   to

understand.  The history of the United Kingdom  and

the  history of the British Empire abound with such

repressive actions. Pick up any history book,  even

a British one, and we see repression and oppression

written on every page - repression which they  have

euphemistically   called  "the  glory   of   Empire

building".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what of the Federation Government? The

Federation  Government is a Right-wing, feudalistic

Government.  It  represents the  interests  of  the

feudalists,  the Right-wing reactionary compradores

and the privileged few. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>



U.M.N.O.   Alliance,  catering  for   opportunists,

communalists  and political careerists,  have  long

been  schooled and nurtured by the British as their

faithful ally, collaborator and agent, so that they

may continue to look after British interests. In so

doing,   they  of  course  look  after  their   own

interests as well, the privileged and the  selected

few.  The  interests of the vast  majority  of  the

people  -  of the workers, farmers and

fishermen  - are but of secondary importance to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reactionary Government in the Federation

fears  the growing strength of the socialist forces

and,   dominated  by  the  communal  and  sectional

interests,  it has already from time to  time  made

arrests  of  anti-colonial forces to  prevent  them

from  reaching and enlightening the masses  in  the

rural  areas. The Alliance would prefer  to  benumb

the  masses  with communal propaganda  and  prevent

them from knowing the real causes and root of their

poverty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation in Singapore is different compared

to  that in the Federation. Here the masses through

years  of  anti-colonial  struggle  have  gained  a

better   insight  into  the  workings  of  colonial

propaganda. They know that their interests coincide

with  the interests of the working class as a whole

and,  with the guidance and leadership of a  strong

Left-wing movement, they are daily marching forward

with the advance of socialist forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Government, being reactionary and

feudalistic,  therefore, fears a  strong  Left-wing

movement    in    Singapore.    Communally-inspired

politicians  in  the  Federation  fear   that   the

influence  of Left-wing forces will extend  to  the

Federation. They fear that Singapore will become  a

"Cuba",  as  the Prime Minister says, and  just  as

President  Kennedy  wants to remove  the  so-called

subversion  of Cuba, so the Federation  politicians

today want to contain and control and, if possible,

completely  suppress  the  Left-wing  movement   in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Emmanuel Pelaez, Vice-President of the Philippines, had said in London that they were given to understand that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



the  primary purpose of the proposed Federation  of

Malaysia  is, as it were, to "sterilise"  Singapore

as  a  centre of so-called Communist influence.  In

addition, should Malaysia really be imposed on  the

people against their will through the use of  brute

force  and  in  complete disregard  of  the  danger

signals,  the  Left-wing forces in Singapore  could

still become a constant headache, to say the least,

to  whatever  Grand  Alliance the  Tunku  and

pro-Malaysia  forces may be able to form in Malaya  and

in the Borneo territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the circumstances, the Federation most

certainly   would   like  to  remove   all   strong

opposition in Singapore whenever possible.  So  the

Federation's  concurrence with the arrests  on  2nd

February is also not unexpected. The British  agree

to  the  arrests and the Federation agrees  to  the

arrests; and what does the P.A.P. do? Being stooges

and  lackeys  of  the British, the  P.A.P. has  to

listen  to  its  master's voice and carry  out  its

master's instructions. Moreover, the P.A.P. has its

own selfish reasons for joining the British and the

Federation Governments in their dirty work. I  will

come to more of this by and by.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But fearful of repercussions following the

arrests  and  hoping to confuse public opinion  and

hoping  to  deceive a section of  the  people,  the

P.A.P. comes  out with those high-sounding  words,

"security of the State". And according to the Prime

Minister,  repressive actions had to be  taken  and

mass  arrests  carried out on 2nd February  because

the  so-called Communist front men in  the  Barisan

Sosialis  constitute a danger to  the  security  of

Singapore and to the other territories that  go  to

form Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason which the Straits Times, the

mouthpiece    of   the   colonialists    and    the

imperialists,  praised  so  forcefully   that   its

editorial on the 4th of February states:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Justification for their arrests could hardly be

argued more powerfully than that.'



<br><br>"More  powerfully than that". What a  pat  on  the

back for the P.A.P. - and from the mouthpiece of  the

colonial master



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



too - like  the  pat on the back of a dog  from  its

master!  But  let us take a look at  the  so-called

powerful argument and see what the argument  really

amounts   to.   "A  danger  to  the   security   of

Singapore" -  such a high-sounding justification  for

the  arrests.  But under the cloak  of  these  four

magical  words,  "security of the State",  all  the

sins  in  the world have been committed  throughout

the  ages. On the excuse to safeguard the  security

of the State, the most blatant cases of imperialist

aggression,   exploitation   and   enslavement   of

countless weaker nations have been perpetrated  and

so-called "justified".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To safeguard the security of the State, the

tyrants  and  Fascist dictators  have  resorted  to

repressive actions at home and abroad: at home,  to

preserve  the  privileges of the tyrannical  ruling

class;  and  abroad, to exploit and  oppress  other

weaker and less developed nations. For the security

of  the  State,  demands of the people  for  urgent

reforms  have been rejected out of hand, and  their

legitimate   rights  and  aspirations  denied   and

suppressed.  In  the name of the  security  of  the

State, the most fundamental rights of man have been

violated,   justice   denied,  democracy   trampled

underfoot.  Under  the cloak of this  high-sounding

phrase,  the  four magical words "security  of  the

State",  millions and millions of people have  been

tortured  and  enslaved, oppressed  and  exploited.

Under  the cloak of the security of the State,  the

foreign  master  rules  over an  unwilling  subject

people  with  an iron hand, and they are  not  even

given a chance to determine their own future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, history abounds with lurid examples of the

grave  abuse  of these four simple words  in  every

country, in every epoch, and in every age. Thus, to

safeguard   the  security  of  the  State,   Hitler

unleashed  the  world war on  the  people  and  had

millions  of Jews murdered. Similarly, to safeguard

the  security  of  the State,  South  Africa  today

practises   apartheid,   racial   segregation   and

discrimination,  and denies the true  sons  of  the

soil  of  their  most basic and  fundamental  human

rights.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years go, to safeguard the security of the

State, Eden ordered the invasion of the Suez  Canal

and the United Arab Republic.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- under the cloak of the

security  of  the State, democracy  being  trampled

under-foot with millions of people subjected to the

most  humiliating  tortures  and  denied  the  most

fundamental  of  human rights. In  Malaya  and  the

whole  of  South-East Asia during the war. Japanese

Fascist   warlords  committed   the   most   brutal

atrocities,  again under the cloak of the  security

of  the  State. In our own Singapore, on  the  same

excuse  of safeguarding the security of the  State,

the most repressive actions had been perpetrated by

the  colonial  forces and mercenary troops  against

the  people  of Singapore, with the  loss  of  many

innocent lives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tun Lim Yew Hock Government followed the path of the colonial master and similarly gave the same trite excuse in the 1956 and 1957 purges, and was roundly condemned by the people of Singapore. Indeed the Prime Minister himself was one of those who most roundly condemned the Lim Yew Hock repression. Now, of course, the Prime Minister

sings a different tune. Since 2nd February, the Lee

Kuan  Yew  Government has been  treading  the  same

desperate path. Even the Prime Minister is mouthing

the  same  time-worn excuse, with the forlorn  hope

that,  if  it was repeated often enough,  it  might

exonerate  the P.A.P. from all blame and  save  the

P.A.P. from  the  wrath and  condemnation  of  the

people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since so much force is given to this trite phrase

and  since  the  persons  now  detained  have  been

alleged  to  have  constituted  a  danger  to   the

security  of  Singapore, let us ask:  what  do  the

British,  the  Federation and the  P.A.P. mean  by

these words?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they mean that the Barisan Sosialis and the

other  arrested persons constitute a danger to  the

security  of  the vested interests of  the  foreign

overlord  and colonial master, of foreign

monopoly-capitalists and the privileged few, then we say  it

is  true and correct. If they mean that the Barisan

Sosialis  and  the  arrested persons  constitute  a

danger to the security of the capitalist system  of

oppression and exploitation and to the security  of

the  forces of reaction and repression and tyranny,

then, again we say it is true and correct. If  they

mean  that  the Barisan Sosialis and  the  arrested

persons  constitute  a  danger  to  the  system  of

discrimination, inequality, injustice, Fascism  and

enslavement,  then  again we say  it  is  true  and

correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis, Sir, is pledged to

eradicate  colonialism and foreign domination  from

whatever  source. We pledge ourselves  to  removing

the    capitalist   system   of   oppression    and

exploitation. We dedicate ourselves to the struggle

against  the  system of discrimination, inequality,

injustice,  Fascism, and enslavement.  And  we  are

proud  of  all  this. We feel elated that  we  have

constituted  a danger to the security  of  all  the

hindrances and obstructions to progress and to  the

forward development of society. We want to get  rid

of all these hindrances and obstructions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> All words.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But if they mean that the

Barisan   Sosialis   and   the   arrested   persons

constitute a danger to the basic interests  of  the

workers,  peasants,  fishermen, intellectuals,  and

national businessmen, then we emphatically  say  it

is  not  true.  And if they mean  we  constitute  a

danger   to  the  oppressed,  the  exploited,   the

is not true.

man  by  man.  We  are pledged to the  struggle  to

just  society.  Their interests are our  interests,

and their struggle is our struggle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Barisan Sosialis, therefore, constitute

a  danger  to  no  one except the colonialist,  the

imperialist, the exploiter, the oppressor  and  the

Fascist  tyrant and their hangers-on and parasites.

We   constitute  a  danger  only  to   imperialism,

colonialism and their stooges, and to the enemy  of

the  people. Ours is a tough and hard struggle, but

we are proud of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



our  struggle.  Millions of  people  all  over  the

world - in  Asia, Africa, Europe  and  America - are

similarly  embarked on the same  struggle.  We  are

therefore not alone. We have friends all  over  the

world who give us solidarity support. It is only  a

matter  of  time  before all our  efforts  will  be

crowned with success. No one can stop the wheels of

history  from  moving forward. The advance  may  be

slow or fast, but we advance. We struggle today for

what,  not  so  very long ago, the  P.A.P. leaders

themselves  had also claimed to struggle  for,  and

had  pretended  to  struggle for.  Yet  the  P.A.P.

Ministers  allege  that we are dangerous  men.  How

could  our struggle, which the P.A.P. also  claimed

not   so  very  long  ago  to  be  their  struggle,

constitute  a danger to the security of  Singapore?

It simply does not add up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel honoured indeed that we constitute a

danger  to  imperialism and colonialism. It  merely

shows  our  strength. But if the  Barisan  Sosialis

constitute  a danger to colonialism which,  not  so

long  ago,  was  also the professed  enemy  of  the

P.A.P.,  should  not the P.A.P. then  be  satisfied

that  at  least  others have  succeeded  where  the

P.A.P. has  failed?  Is  not  the  eradication  of

colonialism what the vast majority of the people of

Singapore,  in  the Federation, and in  the  Borneo

territories, are struggling for, and are  thirsting

for? How then could this danger to imperialism  and

colonialism constitute a danger to the security  of

Singapore  which,  after all, belongs  to  all  the

people  in the island? Does the Prime Minister  not

see how absurd and ridiculous and contradictory  he

is?  One would have thought that any action by  any

political  Party  that  constitutes  a  danger   to

imperialism  and colonialism would be  welcomed  by

other  political Parties that have anti-colonialism

as their main objective. Only the colonialists,

pro-colonialists, and their stooges need  be  perturbed

by  strong  anti-colonial action from any  quarter.

Only  the enemies of the people need fear our

anti-colonial  struggle. We can understand  the  British

colonialists  and  their feudalist  allies  in  the

Federation  being  perturbed  by  our  action.  Our

struggle is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



directed  against  the  vested  interests  of   the

colonialists and the feudalists ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I draw the attention of

the  hon.  Member to the fact that he is, in  fact,

repeating  his arguments? He has been on one  theme

for  about  half an hour now, and I  would  suggest

that  he  has  made  his point on  that  particular

theme, and that he pass on to the next.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But I have yet quite a lot to

develop  on the theme, it follows in the arguments,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I can only suggest to the hon.

Member  his  course, and if his repetition  becomes

tedious, he knows the action the Chair must take.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> It is not repetitious, Sir.

You  will find that it is different at every  stage

of  the  argument.  As I have  said,  Sir,  we  can

understand  the  British  colonialists  and   their

feudalist  allies in the Federation being perturbed

by our action. Our struggle is directed against the

vested  interests  of  the  colonialists  and   the

feudalists,  and  we have openly said  so.  But  it

appears  the  P.A.P. too is most perturbed  by  our

anti-colonial action; so perturbed and so  alarmed,

in  fact,  that the P.A.P. has to join the colonial

forces to take urgent repressive action against the

Barisan  Sosialis and other anti-colonial stalwarts

immediately  and  not be left  until  the  31st  of

August.  Are  these really justifiable reasons  for

taking repressive action against the people? No.  A

thousand times no.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let there be no doubts in our minds as to what we

stand  for.  Lest  I  be  accused  of  again  being

repetitious,  let  me just say once  more  that  we

stand  for  the  rights of the  exploited  and  the

oppressed,  and  we  stand for  justice,  equality,

democracy,  self-determination and  freedom.  These

are  the  hopes  and aspirations not  only  of  the

Barisan  Sosialis but also of the vast majority  of

the  people, not only in Singapore, the  Federation

and  the  Borneo  territories, but also  the  world

over.  No  one need fear the realisation  of  these

hopes  and  aspirations. The only forces that  need

fear and oppose the realisation of these hopes  and

aspirations  are the forces of the enemies  of  the

people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today because the colonialists want to retain the

vested  interests and deprive the people  of  their

legitimate  rights and aspirations, they  have  not

hesitated  to  resort to arrests and detentions  of

anti-colonial stalwarts in a desperate  attempt  to

slow  down  and impede the advance of the  movement

for  colonial  freedom. But these  are  only  their

death   throes   before   final   destruction   and

elimination. This has been proved many  times  over

in  history. For an elected Government now to forgo

the  interests  of  the  people  and  instead,  for

selfish  reasons, now to go into cahoots  with  the

colonialists and imperialists in order  to  further

exploit  and  oppress  the  people,  is  absolutely

unforgivable.   There  can  be   no   justification

whatsoever for the arrests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of Singapore today, when Singapore

is  still  a  colony, a danger to the  security  of

Singapore can only mean a danger to the security of

colonial  interests. For an elected  Government  to

use  the  trite phrase of - "a danger to the security

of  Singapore"  as  a  cloak  to  arrest  political

opponents,  merely shows how bankrupt and  ruthless

the P.A.P. leaders have become.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repressive action should never have been taken

against persons who fight for the interests of  the

vast  majority of the people. "Political  detainees

are and indeed should be regarded as an anomaly  in

a  democratic society." So say Devan Nair  and  Jek

Yuen  Thong,  both top brass of the P.A.P.  From  a

P.A.P. admission,  it  is  clear  that  repressive

action  should never have been taken. If repressive

action must be taken, let it be taken against those

who   wax   rich   through  the  exploitation   and

oppression  of  others, and those who  continue  to

help impose foreign rule over us in Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To stress on the three Governments concurring in

the   arrests  does  not  add  any  weight  to  the

argument.  It  only shows that they are  trying  to

prop  up weak and untenable arguments by the weight

of  numbers. It might allow one party to shift  and

manoeuvre,  and to pass the buck to  others  in  an

attempt  to  escape the justifiable and  inevitable

hatred and opprobrium of the people.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



It  can  show how closely allied is the  P.A.P. to

reaction,  feudalism, colonialism and  imperialism.

But  it  adds  nothing  to the  strength  of  their

arguments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the P.A.P. to gloat over the fact that the

decision for repressive action was not the P.A.P.'s

alone,  but  of  three Governments  together,  only

further  shows  that  the  P.A.P. does  not  truly

believe  in  the  so-called justification  for  the

arrests!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not need to go into the shameful episode of

the  P.A.P. trying to pass the buck to the  British

and  the  Federation for the arrests.  Knowing  how

abhorrent  such  repressive action  is  the  P.A.P.

leaders do not even have the guts to stand up to

so-called  "justify" -  the unjustifiable  arrests.  The

verdict  of the people indeed is a terrible  thing.

It frightens the insides of the P.A.P. Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we in the Barisan Sosialis have too often

been accused of being anti-national. And because of

the  P.A.P. control of the radio, Rediffusion  and

the  Press,  the voice of the Barisan Sosialis  has

not  been easily heard. Just what is meant by being

a  nationalist?  When we talk of a person  being  a

nationalist,  we  mean  that  he  places   national

interests  above sectional and personal  interests.

On the other hand, if a person places sectional and

personal  interests above national interests,  then

he becomes anti-national.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal interests are interests of the

individual; for example, the personal ambitions  of

power  and  wealth  of P.A.P. Ministers.  Sectional

interests are interests of small groups of  people,

for   example,  the  vested  interests  of  foreign

monopoly-capitalists  and of  the  compradores  and

feudalists.   But  what  are  national   interests?

National interests are the basic interests  of  the

country  and of its people. They are the  interests

of  the  vast  majority of the  people.  And  these

interests   are  the  interests  of   the   toiling

masses - the   workers,   peasants,   hawkers,   shop

assistants,  intellectuals, small  businessmen  and

national businessmen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been under colonial rule for 150 years.

We  are still under the heel of foreign domination.

The country's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



wealth   has   been  taken  away  to   enrich   the

colonialists and the imperialists. And we are still

being oppressed and exploited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A true nationalist, therefore, is he who looks

after the interests of the exploited and oppressed,

and  he  who  fights to eradicate  colonialism  and

imperialism.  A nationalist is he who struggles  to

strengthen   the  unity  of  the  people,   without

distinction of race, colour or creed,  to  rid  our

country of foreign domination. A nationalist is  he

who  struggles  to  improve the livelihood  of  the

toiling masses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who helps the colonialists and the

imperialists  to  enslave  the  people   is

anti-national. He who seeks to destroy the unity of  the

people by playing on their communal fears is

anti-national.  He who collaborates with the  foreigners

and the colonialists, and promotes colonial schemes

to  enslave the people is anti-national. And he who

helps  to  keep  foreign  troops  on  our  soil  to

suppress  the legitimate aspirations of the  people

is anti-national.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, some politicians try to equate

personal  and  sectional  interests  with  national

interests.  In this way, opportunities, like  those

in   the   P.A.P.,   would  then  call   themselves

nationalists  in order to confuse and  deceive  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us now ask the Prime Minister and his other

Ministers   a   few   simple  questions.   Who   is

collaborating with the colonialists today?  Who  is

the  errand boy of the imperialists today?  Who  is

promoting the British-sponsored Malaysia today? Who

is  selling  our country to a foreign power  today?

Who  is  collaborating to subjugate the peoples  of

the  Federation,  Singapore,  Sarawak,  Brunei  and

Sabah  under  colonial domination and denying  them

their fundamental rights of self-determination  and

independence? Who wants to keep foreign  troops  on

our  soil  for  the suppression of  the  legitimate

aspirations  of the people? And who  is  trying  to

justify  the  use  of  the British  bases  for  the

suppression of the national liberation struggle  in

Kalimantan Utara? The answer is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



clear  to  all in Singapore. It is none other  than

the Prime Minister and his traitorous clique. It is

the  P.A.P. that is collaborating with the  foreign

powers.  It  is the P.A.P. that is running  errands

for  the  imperialists. It is the  P.A.P. that  is

promoting  British-sponsored Malaysia.  It  is  the

P.A.P. that  is  collaborating  to  subjugate  the

peoples  of  the  Federation,  Singapore,  Sarawak,

Brunei and Sabah under colonial domination.  It  is

the  P.A.P. that is denying them their fundamental

rights of self-determination and independence.  And

it  is  the P.A.P. again that wants to keep foreign

troops  on  our  soil  for the suppression  of  the

legitimate aspirations of our peoples.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister in his tour of the constituency in Sembawang spoke very lovingly of the British bases now in Singapore, and he tried to impress on the people of Singapore that unless they have the bases they would lose their jobs. Who then is trying to keep foreign troops on our soil?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-colonial elements are, therefore, as can

be  seen  from my arguments, in the P.A.P. We  here

and  now  charge the P.A.P. as the anti-nationalist

elements of our country, collaborating with foreign

colonialists to control and dominate our country at

the  expense of our people! The P.A.P. clique  are

the  out-and-out anti-nationals, the  traitors  who

have  sold  the rights of our people  - the  workers,

peasants,  hawkers, taxi-drivers and  students  -

down  the drain! Yes, the P.A.P., the anti-national

traitors masquerading as nationalists. That answers

this anti-nationalist allegation of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let me turn to the question of the allegation

that  the Barisan Sosialis wants to resort to armed

struggle, violence and bloodshed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our open support for the Brunei uprising has

been mentioned as one of the immediate reasons that

had led the Internal Security Council to decide  on

repressive action. The I.S.C. statement reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`They have professed to be working

constitutional1y  for democratic  ends.  But  their

open  support for armed revolt in Brunei and  their

close  connections with leaders of the revolt  show

that they are ready when the opportunity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



occurs to depart from constitutional methods

and  to jeopardise national defence and Singapore's

security  by  joining  with  groups  resorting   to

violence   and   blood-shed  as   in   the   Borneo

Territories.'



<br><br>With  this  they attempt to establish the so-called

connection between the uprising in Brunei  and  the

Barisan  Sosialis  and other  persons  arrested  in

Singapore. The Straits Times especially gave  great

prominence  and  front page headlines  to  what  it

called  the "link" between the uprising  in  Brunei

and  the  Barisan Sosialis and arrested persons  in

Singapore.  Because Lim Ching  Siong  had  met  the

Brunei  leader,  A. M. Azahari, in  Singapore  four

days  before  the  uprising, so  according  to  the

colonialists, this  is  proof  of   some   hidden

conspiracy between the two. But let us ask: What is

so  secret about this meeting for which the Straits

Times gave such prominent headlines? Can the P.A.P.

inform  us  what took place at this meeting?;  what

was said at the meeting?; what actually transpired?

A  little while back the Prime Minister also talked

of the meeting in Nee Soon and people travelling in

Car  SR. 5222. What is wrong with people travelling

in  cars?;  what is wrong with people going  about?

What is all this that they are trying to bring out?

Sir,  I have always thought that the Prime Minister

had  some  originality in him when he talked  about

the  "Plen"  and  things  like  that.  But  to   my

surprise, I see that he has been plagiarising  what

has  been published in the book called "The  Jungle

is  Neutral". At page 203 of this book called  "The

Jungle  is Neutral", written by F. Spencer Chapman,

D.S.O.,  a  person who was sent into the jungle  to

fight  the  Japanese. I see this  very  interesting

paragraph. It is only a few lines and I  will  read

it  out  to you. Sir. At page 203 under the chapter

"Force 136", it says that "when Chin Peng first met

Davis  at Sigari in September, he agreed to convene

a  conference with a plenipotentiary from  Guerilla

General  Headquarters. Owing to  the  tardiness  of

their  communications, it was  not  until  the  1st

January,  1944, that this man reached our  camp  at

Blantar.  He became known to us as the  "Plen"  and

that is the name which I shall use for him in these

pages."  Now that I find this, I am just  wondering

what our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



Prime Minister has been doing? This book says  here

in  the  first page, even before you start  reading

the  story: "This book is copyright. No portion  of

it may be reproduced in any process without written

permission."  I  do  not  know  whether  the  Prime

Minister has had permission from Mr Chapman  about

the  name of the "Plen". He has been having stories

broadcast over the radio, but at least let us  hope

in  future  that our Prime Minister will show  more

originality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding this meeting between Mr Lim Ching

Siong  and  Azahari, we ask: What is  so  peculiar,

what  is  so  unusual about that? If  plotting  or

subversion  is  discovered, what is the  plot -   and

what is the subversion? Why do they not inform  the

people of it? All these stories of wanting to  buy

arms  and  what-not are stories given to our  Prime

Minister  by informers and spies - people who  cannot

be  trusted,  people who will even sell  their  own

fathers in order to earn some extra money. Can they

really  be  trusted? The Legislative Assembly,  the

radio.  Rediffusion and the Press are all available

to  the  P.A.P.  Let them give us all  the  stories

about the true "links" and the connections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as leaders of political Parties with common

objectives,  like  our common  opposition  to

neo-colonial Malaysia, and being co-members of the same

socialist  conference, from which  the  P.A.P. was

ejected,  it is only natural and normal  that  they

should meet frequently and whenever the opportunity

occurs,  for  the  exchange of views  and  opinions

about  political developments, as well as  for  the

promotion   and  strengthening  of   friendly

co-operation and friendly ties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. M. Azahari is the President of the Party

Rakyat  of  Brunei, the Party that won all  the  55

seats  in the recent elections in Brunei. His views

definitely   carry   weight.  Even   the   colonial

mouthpiece, the Straits Times, said so. It is  only

to  be  expected, therefore, that we in the Barisan

Sosialis should meet him for the exchange of  views

whenever  possible and indeed many of us  have  met

Azahari and discussed political events with him  on

many  occasions.  Azahari  attended  our  inaugural

meeting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



and  spoke at the rally in the Happy World  Stadium

in September 1961. He also signed a joint statement

together   with  the  Chairman  of  the  Federation

Socialist  Front,  Mr Ishak,  and  myself  on  the

occasion of that visit. Other political leaders too

had visited us in Singapore at various times in the

past  and we on our part had also visited political

leaders in the Federation, Sarawak and Brunei,  not

with those sinister motives as alleged by the Prime

Minister. The Prime Minister went to Moscow,  I  do

not know whether he went there to conspire with the

Communists or what. Surely, no one should be  hound

to  his  home.  Surely,  as political  leaders,  we

should  have  a chance to go about and meet  people

who  deal  with the same subject and have the  same

common   objectives.  Similarly  today,  Federation

Ministers,  P.A.P.  Minister  and  other  political

leaders too have many times been to see politicians

in Kuching and Jesselton. Our meetings with Azahari

in  Singapore were therefore nothing unusual.  Such

meetings take place in the normal course of events.

On  the  contrary, it would indeed be  unusual  and

abnormal  if  there  were  no  such  meetings.  For

obvious  reasons, the P.A.P. and the Straits  Times

have  now  gone out of their way to paint innocent,

open and normal events with loud and lurid colours.

Ordinary   everyday  happenings  are  twisted   and

distorted  into  something furtive,  secretive  and

mysterious.   Yet  all  the  so-called   mysterious

meetings were open secrets. Even the Straits  Times

again  admitted  so  in  their  editorial  of   4th

February,  1963. Azahari had been  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis'  headquarters on  several  occasions  and

many  of us had met him and talked to him. But,  of

course,  the P.A.P. concocts mystery thrillers  out

of  such normal meetings. And because of Lim  Ching

Siong meeting Azahari four days before the uprising

in  Brunei. There has grown from it this  so-called

"link"  through Said Zahari. This so-called  "link"

is  dramatised and given a sensational  front  page

play-up.  All in order to create the impression  of

some super front page conspiracy very luckily and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



very  timely  discovered, of course, by  the  sharp

prying  eyes of the Prime Minister and the  Special

Branch.  But  for  which a major catastrophe  would

have befallen the people of Singapore! Such is  the

fairy tale of the British lion and the P.A.P.

dog - the running dog!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits Times representing vested interests

can of course, be expected to help the British, the

Federation   and   incidentally  the   P.A.P.,   to

influence  public  opinion  against  the   arrested

persons.  But  in spite of all the efforts  of  the

Straits  Times  to spotlight this so-called  "link"

and  this so-called "conspiracy", the people

of   - Singapore  still cannot understand why the  arrests

were necessary. Even the Straits Times editorial of

4th  February, 163, complained that the  Government

case  was weak and unconvincing. The Straits  Times

editorial of 4th February states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The statement issued by the Internal Security

council  has little in it that has not been  hashed

and  rehashed  in  the newspaper for  months  past,

except  perhaps for the dealings which Azahari  had

with   Barisan  Sosialis  leaders  and  even  these

contacts were an open secret.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The editorial went on to hope for the publication

of



<br><br>"the full [I am reading from a few lines above what

I  have just quoted] or at least a fuller story  of

the  circumstances which forced the I.S.C. to  take

strong measures before it was too late."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, even the Straits Times admitted

that  there  was no justification in fact  for  the

arrests!  Yes,  there  was  no  justifiable  excuse

whatsoever   for   the  arrests.   What   are   the

circumstances  which,  according  to  the   Straits

Times,  "forced  the I.S.C. to take strong  measure

before  it was too late"? Was it because we held  a

rally in support of the Brunei uprising?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, we held a rally in Tanjong Katong Road two

weeks  after the uprising in support of the  Brunei

National   Liberation  Movement.  We  applied   for

permission  for  the  rally,  clearly  stating  the

reason  for  the rally in the application  for  the

permits,  and the permit was granted  for  a  rally

clearly staged to support the national uprising  in

Brunei.  So  it  was  all  open  and  lawful.   The

Government had given us lawful permission to hold a

rally in support of Brunei.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



So  obviously  there  was nothing  wrong  with  the

lawful  rally for which a permit was issued by  the

P.A.P.  Government.  We  have  not  taken  up  arms

against  the Government. We merely held a rally  to

voice our support in a legitimate democratic manner

for  an  anti-colonial struggle in Brunei. Just  as

the  P.A.P. and the Alliance Government had  voiced

their  support  for the anti-colonial  struggle  in

Algeria  only  two years ago. On  that  occasion  a

rally was held in front of the Padang in which even

the employers were specifically told to let workers

get off earlier so that they could go to listen  to

Dr  Ferhat Abbas and the Prime Minister.  In  that

mass  rally,  the  Prime Minister had  spoken  with

staged  feelings  and had exhorted  the  people  of

Singapore to learn from the anti-colonial  struggle

of   the   Algerian  people  against   the   French

imperialists.  Of course, the Prime  Minister  then

was only trying to deceive the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, if you will remember, Sir, in this very

House a few weeks later the Government went a stage

further and moved a motion to contribute $10,000 to

the  Algerian  fund  as  a token  of  sympathy  and

support   and  asked  the  House  to   record   its

admiration for the determination and courage of the

Algerian  people  in  their  struggle  for  freedom

against  the  tyranny  and  oppression  of   French

colonialism;  and  on  behalf  of  the  people   of

Singapore  expressed its wholehearted  support  for

the  cause  of freedom for the Algerian people.  In

the  ensuing debate all P.A.P. leaders spoke brave,

inspiring  words.  Even Members of  the  Right-wing

S.P.A. joined in the chorus. Let me refer you, Sir,

to  Hansard,  Volume 14, No. 13 of  22nd  February,

1961. May I refer you to column 1020? It is a  pity

the Minister for Culture is not here because he had

spoken in paragraph 4 at column 1020 of "the rising

tide  of  nationalism" and the "dyke of  repression

against  the tidal wave of nationalist revolt,  and

how  the dyke broke and colonialism was swept  into

the  sea." Very inspiring words, Sir, and  at  that

time  I  was  taken  in myself.  I  have  mentioned

paragraph 3. It was paragraph 4.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in column 1021 on the next page, the third

paragraph,  somewhere in the middle,  the  Minister

for Culture said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Therefore, when confronted by the assertions of

Algerian  nationalism  and  Algerian  demands   for

freedom,  the  French  colons,  backed  by   French

generals,   are   trying   to   counter    Algerian

nationalism with repression and terror.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was French extremism which forced a moderate

and  conciliatory  Algerian nationalism  to  resist

French repression and violence with violence of its

own.'.



<br><br>Sir, these are words which nobody who calls himself

an  anti-colonialist can can quarrel with. And they

are inspiring words. But let us just substitute the

word  "British" for the word "French" and the  word

"Brunei" for the word "Algeria", and the quote  now

reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Therefore, when confronted by the assertions of

Bruneian  nationalism  and  Bruneian  demands   for

freedom,  the  British colons,  backed  by  British

generals,   are   trying   to   counter    Bruneian

nationalism  with  repression and  terror.  It  was

British  extremism  which  forced  a  moderate  and

conciliatory Bruneian nationalism to resist British

repression and violence with violence of its own.'



<br><br>It is a pity, Sir, that the Ministers do not listen

to  their own words because if they did they  would

see   how  ridiculous  they  have  been  in   their

accusations and allegations that we are  supporting

the  Brunei uprising and resorting to violence  and

bloodshed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then in column 1030 - this time the Deputy Prime

Minister talked of the "mutual feelings of sympathy

between  the Provisional Government of the Algerian

leaders   and   ourselves  in   Singapore   because

Singapore  is still a colony, a semi-colony."  Then

he said in the second paragraph, near the end:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is because of this understanding of peoples

who have in the past been under colonial domination

that  we,  the P.A.P. Government, have  moved  this

motion in support of the Algerian people's struggle

for independence against French imperialism.'



<br><br>Again   beautiful  words,  words  which  no

anti-colonialist could disagree with. But, again, let us

substitute the word "Brunei" for the word "Algeria"

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



the  word "British" for the word "French"  and  the

meaning again is very clear. It would read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is because of this understanding of peoples

who have in the past been under colonial domination

that  we,  the P.A.P. Government, have  moved  this

motion  in support of the Brunei people's  struggle

for independence against British imperialism.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go just a little further ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. May I suggest to the hon.

Member that he is labouring on a point which he has

already made. He has made the point. Can we proceed

a little quicker with this debate?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I understand your impatience,

Sir.  Similarly, have I not wanted to stay up until

this late hour ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The complaint is not the late

hour.  The  complaint is that the  hon.  Member  is

labouring a point which he has already made. And in

a  debate,  once a Member, or once any debater  has

made a point, surely he should be satisfied and not

labour the point.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Very well, Sir, I thought of

just quoting the Member for Tanglin, but anyway, he

is  not  here.  However, I  must  quote  the  Prime

Minister.  In column 1032 the Prime Minister  talks

of  the necessity to make a gesture in the forum of

world  debate to show what we think of  the  French

imperialists. He says in column 1032:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`But it is significant that in a world in which

total war means total annihilation, the conflict is

reduced to a secondary plane of a limited war  with

unlimited world support. There is pressure  in  the

United  Nations. There are expressions of  sympathy

and solidarity and we throw in our voice in support

of  the  chorus  on behalf of the  freedom  of  the

people of Algeria.'



<br><br>All  I  need  say, Sir, is to substitute  the  word

"British"  for "French" and the word  "Brunei"  for

"Algeria" and we see that there is fundamentally no

difference  between  the  situation  then  and  the

situation today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you will remember that debate, the Government

finally  asked  the Assembly to pass  a  resolution

which, if you were to leave out the second part  of

money contribution and if we substituted the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



appropriate words to fit in with the context of our

present situation, would read as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Assembly records its admiration for the

determination and courage of the Brunei  people  in

the  struggle for freedom against the  tyranny  and

oppression of British colonialism and on behalf  of

the people of Singapore expresses its whole-hearted

support  for the cause for freedom for  the  Brunei

people.'



<br><br>Wholehearted support for the freedom for the Brunei

people!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our rally at Tanjong Katong held on the 23rd

December,  1962, did not have the  support  of  the

Legislative Assembly, and we could not  presume  to

speak on behalf of all the people of Singapore. But

we  did  hold the rally to demonstrate  our

whole-hearted support for the people of Brunei openly and

for  all to see. It was not done furtively. In  our

rally we did exactly what the P.A.P. had previously

done in another rally as well as officially in  the

Singapore  Legislative Assembly on  behalf  of  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we in the Barisan also admire the courage

and determination of the people of Brunei' in their

struggle  for  freedom  against  the  tyranny   and

oppression  of  British  colonialism.  We  in   the

Barisan  call  on the people to give  whole-hearted

support  for the cause of freedom of the people  in

Brunei.  Can  it be that support for the  cause  of

freedom  against  the French was correct  and  that

against  the British is wrong? Can it  be  that  we

must  condemn  French colonialism, but  must  love,

admire  and  protect British colonialism?  Is  that

what the P.A.P. want? If our support today for  the

Brunei   people   was  wrong  and  unlawful,   then

similarly the P.A.P. and Assembly support  in  1961

for the Algerian people was wrong and unlawful.  If

the admiration for the courage and determination of

the   Brunei  people  to  be  free  was  wrong  and

unlawful,   then   similarly  the  feigned   P.A.P.

admiration for the courage and determination of the

Algerian  people  was  wrong  and  unlawful.  There

cannot  be two different standards of moral values.

No one has suggested that feigned P.A.P. admiration

for  the  courage and determination of the Algerian

people to be free and feigned P.A.P. support of the

Algerian   struggle  for  freedom  was  wrong   and

unlawful.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, only a few months back, the P.A.P. took

great  pride  in, and gave full publicity  to,  its

past so-called support of the Algerian struggle. So

how   can  anyone  suggest  that  our  support  and

admiration for the courage and determination of the

Brunei  people's struggle for freedom is wrong  and

unlawful? Or is it seriously suggested that what is

done by the P.A.P. is right and lawful, but what is

similarly  done by other people becomes  wrong  and

unlawful?  Is  there  one law for  the  P.A.P. and

another  law  for the rest of the people?  Is  that

what is troubling us today in Singapore? Does being

the  Government make the P.A.P. right in everything

the P.A.P. does? Does being the Government make all

the  difference between right and wrong, lawful and

unlawful, loyalty and subversion?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister himself had feigned support for anti-colonial struggles before, that is, until

he  had been unmasked as a mere opportunist  and  a

stooge. But why this apparent turnabout, this volte-face.

The I.S.C. statement goes on to  say  that "their open

support for armed revolt in Brunei  and

their  close connections with leaders of the revolt

show  that  they  are  ready when  the  opportunity

occurs to depart from constitutional methods and to

jeopardise   national   defence   and   Singapore's

security  by  joining  with  groups  resorting   to

violence   and   blood-shed  as   in   the   Borneo

territories."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have shown that the so-called "connection" and

"link"  are but fanciful concoctions of the fertile

imagination of the colonialists and their  stooges.

The  most  unconnected events and  happenings  have

been interlaced with "link" and "connections".  The

imagination  is allowed to run riot. Everything  is

dominated  by  one obsession, namely, to  prejudice

public  opinion against the persons whom the P.A.P.

wants  to  fix  and to destroy. We in  the  Barisan

Sosialis want to struggle constitutionally for  our

political  aims.  But  it has  become  increasingly

difficult  to continue the constitutional struggle.

I  have  already said that door after door  of  the

constitutional  struggle has been  slammed  by  the

Fascist  and  arbitrary actions of the P.A.P.,  and

the latest spate of arbitrary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



arrests has forced the people to consider seriously

whether  or  not  all means of such  constitutional

struggle  have  been  completely  closed   to   the

Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constitutional struggle, Sir, can only be

undertaken when there are constitutional means left

for the people to do so. At the present moment just

when  the  Opposition has become strong  enough  to

overthrow the Government through the democratic

one-man-one-vote   process,  the  powers-that-be   have

resorted  to the most unconstitutional  methods  of

arbitrary  arrests, in order to  crush  strong  and

effective  opposition and to prevent the Opposition

from gaining State power. They resort to repressive

action under the cloak and excuse of our wanting to

depart from methods of constitutional struggle. But

all   Singapore,  all  South-East  Asia,  know  the

opposite  is  the  case. We who are  genuinely  and

consistently conducting a constitutional  struggle,

are  continuously thwarted by those who  resort  to

the    most   undemocratic   and   unconstitutional

repressive  measure. We are accused of  wanting  to

depart from the path of constitutional struggle  by

those  who  resort  to Fascist and unconstitutional

methods  of repression. It is like a robber,  after

he  has  committed a robbery, calling out,  "Thief!

Thief!"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the argument put forward by the

I.S.C. one  stage  further. Because  of  our  open

support  for the Brunei uprising, so it is  alleged

that   we   want  to  depart  from  the   path   of

constitutional  struggle! I have already  mentioned

the  feigned P.A.P. support of the Algerian  people

in  their struggle for freedom. There was a hot war

going  on  in  Algeria with half a  million  French

colons  in  the war. Did feigned P.A.P. support  of

the Algerian people in their war of liberation then

make  the  P.A.P. depart from  the  constitutional

struggle?  Could we then say that  the  P.A.P. had

embarked  on the path of armed struggle? Of  course

not! No one would dream of saying so. Similarly our

Barisan  Sosialis  support  for  the  struggle   of

liberation in Brunei does not mean we are  embarked

on  the path of armed struggle. It was only a token

support to show our sympathy and admiration for the

courage of the people of Brunei who refused to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



be  cowed by the superior might of a nuclear power.

And we might add here that, as an Opposition Party,

we  in  the Barisan Sosialis just cannot  have  the

same opportunities and facilities for helping armed

struggle anywhere. Now with bow and arrow, parangs,

wooden-spears  and shotguns, the people  in  Borneo

are  fighting  against jets and  warships  for  the

cause  of self-determination and freedom! And  they

are   ready  to  fight  against  overwhelming  odds

because  their will to be free cannot be suppressed

by  threats  and  superior  force.  If  the  P.A.P.

support for the Algerian people's struggle  is  not

regarded as embarking on unconstitutional and armed

struggle, so is the Barisan Sosialis' open  support

for the Brunei people's struggle cannot be regarded

as   embarking   on  unconstitutional   and   armed

struggle.  Indeed,  we  maintain  it  is  the  only

correct  and proper thing to do if we are genuinely

anti-colonial, and if we are truly dedicated to the

struggle for justice, equality and democracy, peace

and freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us take the argument just one stage

further.  When the West Irian issue  was  at  fever

pitch, and peace was threatened in South-East Asia,

volunteers from Singapore were ready to go  forward

to  help  Indonesia recover West Irian. The  P.A.P.

had  at  first  ridiculed the idea of resorting  to

armed  struggle  to  drive out  recalcitrant  Dutch

Imperialism  in  West  Irian,  simply  because  the

initial  call  in  Singapore  for  support  of  the

Indonesian  demand for the recovery of  West  Irian

had  come from the Barisan Sosialis. But the P.A.P.

soon  found  itself  in  an embarrassing  position.

Realising  that the vast majority of the people  in

Singapore  had  responded  to  our  call  and  were

supporting  the  demand for the  recovery  of  West

Irian, the P.A.P. was compelled to put on the

anti-colonial mask. The P.A.P. was forced to support our

motion   calling  for  support  of  the  Indonesian

struggle to recover West Irian. Later in an attempt

to make capital out of the anti-colonial fervour of

the  people in Singapore, P.A.P. Ministers went  so

far as to review volunteers about to fly off



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



for further training in Indonesia. P.A.P. Ministers

gave  them  blessing and a rousing  send-off.  Full

publicity was given to the Minister for Health  and

Law   wishing  the  volunteers  good  luck  at  the

Singapore  Airport.  If  there  was  any  talk   of

encouragement given to armed struggle, this was it.

We  do -   not  have to look any further.  By  I.S.C.

standards,  it could be said that encouragement  to

armed  struggle  was so blatant in this  case  that

there is no point in the P.A.P. even trying to deny

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the people of Singapore have never accused

the  P.A.P. of encouraging armed struggle.  Neither

have  the  British for that matter, so  far  as  we

know. It would have been silly, foolish and useless

for  them  to do so. Yet today, without seeing  any

volunteer off, without in any way urging the people

of  Singapore to armed struggle, without in any way

instigating disturbances, strikes or riots, we have

been charged with wanting to resort to violence and

bloodshed! How absurd and ridiculous can the P.A.P.

become?  What explanation can the P.A.P. give?  As

genuine    anti-colonialists,    we    know    that

intransigent  imperialists will never budge  unless

they  are  forced to do so. This was the case  with

Goa.  This  was the case with what was once  called

French  Indo-China; and with what was  once  called

the  Dutch East Indies. And this again was the case

with  the  West  Irian issue. The intransigence  of

colonialists  is  proverbial.  Look  now  what  has

happened in Brunei.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Brunei people have been deprived of all means

of  constitutional struggle. In spite of the  Party

Rakyat  gaining  all  the 55 seats  in  the  recent

elections  in Brunei, showing overwhelming  support

of  the  people, the elected representatives  could

only play the role of the Opposition. They were not

permitted  even  to table a motion in  the  Council

Negeri  against Malaysia. Nor were they allowed  to

declare for independence. There were no longer  any

constitutional means left for the people of  Brunei

to  oppose Malaysia. Under the circumstances,  what

else  could  the  people of Brunei  do?  Submit  to

further oppression? No, Sir, there can be no doubt,

no  argument  about it! All means of constitutional

struggle were denied the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



people  of Brunei. There was but one way  out.  The

Brunei  uprising was the inevitable result.  Is  it

then  wrong to support such a heroic struggle under

the  circumstances? How can our support be  twisted

to  mean  our resorting to violence and  bloodshed?

Have   not  other  Afro-Asian  countries  similarly

supported the struggle of the people of Brunei?  Of

the people of Kalimantan Utara?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all such talk of our wanting to resort to

armed  struggle  is therefore so much  hocus-pocus,

meant only to confuse and deceive the people and to

give  an excuse to the British, the Federation  and

the  P.A.P. to  resort  to  repression.  There  is

nothing  that the Barisan Sosialis has  done  which

the  P.A.P. itself has not done but a  short  time

ago.  For  the  P.A.P. now to claim that  what  the

Barisan  Sosialis  has done is  unlawful  is  sheer

unadulterated  bunkum. It will not deceive  anyone.

This  is only the colonial way of giving us  a  bad

name  and  hanging us for it. So long as  effective

opposition  to  the  P.A.P. can  be  removed,  what

matters  what reason is given for its  removal  and

how   the   P.A.P. does  it?  The   ruthless   and

unscrupulous  nature of the P.A.P. is already  well

known.  The  Barisan haunts the Prime Minister  and

his  Ministers day and night. The Barisan  has  too

much support for the comfort of the Prime Minister.

Therefore, knocking out the Barisan has  become  an

obsession with him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all this, it is clear that excuses given by

the  I.S.C. and the P.A.P. for the arrests  do  not

hold   water.  The  Prime  Minister  said  on   4th

February:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If it were an action by the Singapore Government,

we  would never have contemplated it. It would  not

be  necessary because we would have carried on till

after 31st August, 1963.'



<br><br>In  this  statement alone, Sir, the Prime  Minister

admits,  albeit inadvertently, that there  were  no

justifiable  reasons whatsoever  that  necessitated

the  arrests. "It would not be necessary," he said.

And  this  is  confirmed  in  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's  speech which admits that "all  was  peace

and tranquility" for the last seven months. Yet  he

now  tells  a  story  of Said  Zahari  having  left

Singapore on 1st February.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us ask, then why did the P.A.P. carry out the

arrests?  I have already explained earlier  on  why

the  British and the Federation Government want  to

carry  out the arrests. They want to protect  their

imperial vested interests. They want to destroy the

Left-wing  movement, if possible. But what  of  the

P.A.P.?  There  is mention in the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's  speech  of the vested  interests  of  the

P.A.P. Government. What are these vested interests?

What  role  do these vested interests play  in  the

arrests?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recall that the Prime Minister made some

Press  statements on his return from  Kuala  Lumpur

after the arrests. The Member for Cairnhill had put

the  Prime Minister on the mat for having tried  to

pass  the  blame for the arrests on to the  British

and  Federation  Governments. He  asked  the  Prime

Minister,  "Why did the P.A.P. Ministers  not  vote

against the other members of the I.S.C. if they did

not  support  the  arrests?"  And  the  poor  Prime

Minister  had to eat humble pie and climb down  and

make  a  second statement to the Press,  this  time

correcting  his earlier statement and  agreeing  in

toto with the I.S.C. decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no wish to go into details, but it is

already  on record that all three parties concurred

with  the  arrests. So the P.A.P. cannot  possibly

escape  censure  by trying to pass  the  buck  this

time. To understand P.A.P. vested interests and why

they want the arrests, we must first understand the

desperate  situation  in  which  the  P.A.P. finds

itself today. Soon after the assumption of power on

the  support of the workers in 1959, the arrogance,

dictatorship,  exposure and Rightist  deviation  of

P.A.P.  Ministers quickly alienated the Party  away

from  the  masses. Originally 43 in an Assembly  of

51, their number soon dwindled to 40 in 1960; 39 in

July  1961;  and finally to 26, when 13 Assemblymen

walked   across  the  Floor  to  form  the  Barisan

Sosialis.



<br><br>3.28 a.m.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Deputy SPEAKER (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</b></div>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 43 to 26, and all in a space of two years.

Who could have predicted such a complete change  of

fortunes for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



the P.A.P. in 1959? Today with only 25 seats in  an

Assembly  of 51, the P.A.P. Government exists  only

on sufferance. It has to be propped up in office by

the  Right-wing of the Opposition. That is why when

the  Member  for  Cairnhill  also  pressed  for   a

reconvening of the Legislative Assembly, the  Prime

Minister dared not offend him. Otherwise, he  might

find  that  overnight he is no more Prime Minister.

And  so terrified is the Government of meeting  the

people  that it has not dared even to hold the

by-election  in Sembawang which seat was vacant  since

the  middle of August 1962, more than seven  months

ago.  There  is  no  justifiable  reason  for  such

delays,  but I will have more to say on this  later

on  other motions if there is opportunity for me to

do  so. However, I might add in passing that if the

Sembawang by-election should be further delayed, as

I  have indicated to the Press some months back, we

would  have  to  consider  seriously  bringing   in

amendments  to  the Constitution to make  good  the

lacuna  in the law which has allowed the P.A.P. to

make a mockery of parliamentary democracy. Everyone

can  see that the P.A.P. Government is a very shaky

Government. The people in the whole of Malaya  know

it and the P.A.P. Ministers themselves know it, but

unfortunately for the P.A.P. leaders, in  spite  of

all  their desperate efforts at merger-peddling and

Malaysia-selling,  in  spite   of   their   bending

themselves   backwards  to  please  the  Federation

Government, in spite of their frantically trying to

buy  support with bribes and trying to  please  all

those   whom  they  had  previously  despised   and

ridiculed, in spite of all their attempts at staged

constituency  visits to bolster their  own  sagging

morale  and  that of opportunistic supporters,  the

P.A.P. nevertheless has failed  to  win  back  the

support it has lost from the people. And indeed  it

is daily losing whatever support that still exists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pathetic indeed to see the arrogant P.A.P.

leaders today doing everything they can, kowtowing,

in  fact, to ingratiate themselves with the various

organisations,  clan  associations  and   exclusive

clubs. What a climbdown from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



days  of yore for these arrogant men! When in spite

of  all  these efforts, no improvement is made  and

instead  they are daily sinking lower and lower  in

the eyes of the people, it becomes obvious that the

desperate P.A.P. will resort to desperate measures.

The  main reason why all their efforts have not got

them  very far is that the Barisan Sosialis  stands

in  the way. All the sympathy and support is  given

to  the  Barisan Sosialis. Very little is left  for

the  P.A.P. What terrifies the P.A.P. more is  that

while  its  own strength and influence is shrinking

and  diminishing, that of the Barisan  Sosialis  is

rapidly  expanding and growing! And that, in  spite

of  its so-called "defeat" at the referendum! It is

common  knowledge that Barisan has the most popular

mass support in Singapore. And it is even generally

accepted  that the next Singapore State  Government

will he a Barisan Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the circumstances, it is not difficult to

guess  the  P.A.P.'s next move.  The  fear  of  our

growing strength and influence is the urgent reason

for  the  P.A.P. decision to try and  cripple  and

paralyse the Barisan as much as possible. Hence the

decision  to arrest immediately and not after  31st

August, 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. leaders hope that, with the Barisan

crippled  and generally disabled, the people  would

again  be faced with a situation analagous to  that

existing at the time of the sham referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will remember that the original referendum

plot was to offer unacceptable alternatives to  the

people.  They  were to be compelled to  choose  the

lesser  of  two or more evils. Similarly  with  the

arrests,  The P.A.P. leaders hope that a  political

vacuum,  so  to  speak, would  be  created  in  the

Singapore  arena. And if there were  no  adequately

organised  political parties with  sufficient  mass

support  to  eclipse  the  P.A.P. completely,  the

P.A.P. would still stand a chance of having some of

their   leaders   again  being   elected   to   the

Legislative  Assembly. With luck, the P.A.P. might

even   win   enough  seats  to  form  a   coalition

Government and so still remain in power. Of course,

to achieve this, the trade unions, cultural



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



organisations,    rural    associations,    hawkers

associations,  etc., will have to be  dominated  by

pro-P.A.P. elements. That is why all the  prominent

leaders  in these organisations have been arrested.

The  P.A.P. hopes by temporarily paralysing  these

organisations  to  be  able  to  create  conditions

through bribes, threats and intimidation for P.A.P.

stooges to infiltrate into these organisations  and

so dominate them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already the P.A.P. has a nucleus in the N.T.U.C.

There are certain other unions already dominated by

P.A.P. stooges.  The P.A.P. hopes  to  extend  the

sphere  of  P.A.P. influence into the other  unions

and  organisations. This move is important for  the

immediate future. But it is more important  in  the

long-term  view,  as it is only by domination  over

these  organisations that the P.A.P. can ever  hope

for a comeback in the political arena of Singapore.

But, of course, these are only P.A.P. pipe-dreams.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is already trouble ahead. The

Secretary-General  of the A.U.P.E., namely, the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Culture, has  already

openly attacked the P.A.P. Government  - a matter  of

a  P.A.P.  Parliamentary  Secretary  attacking  the

P.A.P.  Government! So what is the future going  to

be? We can only say that all the pipe-dreams of the

P.A.P. will remain pipe-dreams. They  go  up  like

soap bubbles, and burst.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, because of these arrests, certain

other  Parties are already thinking of  filling  in

the  vacuum. They talk of possible arrests in order

to  give  the impression that they are  the  forces

that   represent  the  people.  That  is   entirely

erroneous and foolish. The force remains  with  the

Barisan Sosialis. We still have the support of  the

workers  and  the  civic  organisations.  And  this

support  will enable the Barisan Sosialis  to  bury

the P.A.P. when the time comes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have now outlined the Machiavellian

thinking  of  the  P.A.P. This  is  the  result  of

selfish  thinking of the P.A.P. leaders.  They  are

trying  to  look  after the political  fortunes  of

P.A.P. leaders - the  vested   interests   of   the

political leaders. Today, we see frantic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 454</b></font><br><br>



efforts to erect "standing monuments", according to

the  Prime Minister, in order to remind the  people

of the good work of the P.A.P. Government. And when

the  elections  come along, they  hope  that  these

"standing  monuments"  will  help  to  deceive  the

people and to win them their support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must remember that, though the P.A.P. leaders

might  get away with not holding the Sembawang

by-election, they will not be able to skip the general

elections,  that is, unless more funny  things  are

cooking.  The  P.A.P. was elected for  a  five-year

term.  We have seen how desperately their Ministers

cling to power on the slightest excuse. Their  lust

for  power is so great that, if they could get away

with it, they would most certainly do away with the

coming  general elections. But, alas, the gods  are

not  with  the Prime Minister. He cannot  get  away

with  it  and  there  will have  to  be  a  general

election  at  the latest in early  1964,  and  with

every indication of it being held much earlier.  We

still  know nothing though about how the 15 Central

Parliament  seats  are  to  be  filled.  The  Prime

Minister particularly chose to be vague in order to

keep us in the dark as to what is happening to  our

constitutional future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can understand now why the P.A.P. leaders want

to   arrest  political  opponents  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis. Hence the arrest of all our able leaders,

organisers  and  prospective  candidates  for   the

general elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anti-colonial stalwarts have long struck fear and

panic  into the entrails of P.A.P. leaders.  It  is

well  known  that  the desperate politicians  would

soon   resort   to  desperate  measures   to   keep

themselves in office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, of course, a second reason why the

P.A.P. want  the  arrests. We may  call  them

by-products.  Arrests  and police action  cause  fear,

instil fear into people, especially those who would

fight shy of the police and ---



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

think  we  have no quorum. There are about  six  or

seven of us here.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 455</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice taken that thirteen Members were not

present,  Members  summoned as if  for  a  division

pursuant to the Standing Order, and meeting resumed

upon a quorum being then present.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I must ask both the

Government side and the Opposition side to see that

at  least thirteen Members remain in the Chamber so

that  we  can  finish  the  debate  as  quickly  as

possible. Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

have given the first reason why the P.A.P. want  to

make  the arrests. I now come to the second reason.

Arrests  and  police action cause and  instil  fear

into  the people, especially those who would  fight

shy  of the police and the courts at all costs. The

Prime  Minister remembers his success in  the  last

days  of  the referendum campaign. When he realised

that the vast majority of the people were going  to

cast   blank   votes,   he   unleashed   the   most

unprecedented   scare - propaganda   campaign    with

threats  and intimidation to the people about  loss

of   citizenship.  With  the  help  of  the  radio,

Rediffusion,   the  Press  and  police   vans,   he

succeeded in coercing large sections of the  people

into  voting for the White Paper merger  proposals.

Similarly this time, since he has failed to win the

support  of the people in spite of all his  tricks,

he  now attempts to intimidate them into supporting

him.  The ruthlessness of the P.A.P. is well known.

If  a  P.A.P. member comes to ask for contribution

towards  the  erection  of welcome  arches  on  the

occasion  of  the  Prime  Minister's  visit  to   a

constituency, who can refuse and say no? Who  would

dare  say  no? If you were invited to subscribe  to

and  attend  a  function in  honour  of  the  Prime

Minister by a fearful P.A.P. branch official or  by

some  Government official, would it not be, to  say

the least, indiscreet to refuse, even dangerous  to

refuse?  Thus  we see, Sir, staged  photographs  of

people  "welcoming"  the Prime  Minister  and  many

"attending"  the  Prime Minister's  functions.  The

P.A.P. tries to buy support. When that fails,  the

next  weapon is intimidation, and with the arrests,

the Prime Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 456</b></font><br><br>



hopes  to  intimidate large sections of the  people

into  supporting the P.A.P., especially after  they

have  been  given  a  dose of  bedtime  stories  of

Russian  bears and the Twelve Arabian  Nights.  But

let us all say here and now, it is a forlorn hope.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still a third reason for the arrests is the

settling  of old scores. It is well known  that  in

spite of laughters, handshakes and beer-drinking in

the  C.P.A. room, P.A.P. leaders have not forgotten

that  their  predicament today is  largely  due  to

those,  now detained, withdrawing their support  to

the P.A.P. We see the settling of old scores in the

punitive  and vindictive treatment of detainees  in

Singapore  today. I will enlarge  on  this  when  I

speak  on my amendment concerning the treatment  of

detainees.  But  this  alone shows  that  the  P.A.P.

leaders  also want the arrests because of vengeance

against those now under detention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all this, we see that the main reason for

the arrests, so far as the P.A.P. is concerned,  is

the approach of the time for general elections, and

the  P.A.P. leaders want to safeguard the  security

of  their personal vested interests. Many had known

that  the Prime Minister was only waiting for  some

excuse,  some incident, in order to give a  pretext

for  repressive action. The Brunei uprising and the

increased international tension that followed  gave

him just the excuse and pretext he had been waiting

for.  Those  now  detained  had  talked  frequently

enough   of   the  Prime  Minister   using   agents

provocateurs  to create incidents, and consequently

they  had  remained sharply vigilant and  on  guard

against  all provocations from the P.A.P. and  its

mercenary   stooges.  The  mass  arrests   on   2nd

February,   1963,   were   therefore   not   wholly

unexpected.  Those now in Outram Prison  knew  that

the  more desperate the P.A.P. got, the greater the

likelihood of repression. As the P.A.P. was sinking

further  and further into the quagmire, all  of  us

knew  it was only a matter of time before the Prime

Minister would remove the velvet glove and bare his

iron claws. That has happened today. And to protect

the vested interests of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



the  P.A.P., action had been taken immediately  and

not left until after 31st August, 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me speak on the amendment concerning the

treatment   of  detainees.  Recently   some   press

publicity  has been given to the cruel and  inhuman

treatment of detainees by the P.A.P. Government  in

Singapore. You might also have noticed a small item

in  the  Straits Times on the 2nd of  April,  1963,

about  families  of  detainees "squatting"  in  the

Prime Minister's office. The Prime Minister himself

has  referred to the incident. From this small item

of  news  one  can understand that  there  must  be

something  pretty serious before aged  parents  had

been  compelled to go and brave the  fearful  Prime

Minister of the ruthless P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dawn swoop of the Internal Security Council

and  the P.A.P.'s "Operation Cold Store" took place

in  the small hours of the morning of 2nd February,

1963. It is the 10th of April today, and they  have

been  nearly  ten  weeks in  "Cold  Store"  and  in

solitary   confinement.   69   days   in   solitary

confinement.  I  am not competent enough  to  speak

about  other  countries, but so fat  as  Malaya  is

concerned, this is unprecedented in prison history,

even   including  the  worst  periods  of  colonial

oppression   and   for  the  worst   of   convicted

criminals. I shall enlarge on this later.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the arrests on 2nd February, repeated

requests   had   been  made  by  Barisan   Sosialis

Assemblymen to find out, first, where the  arrested

persons were detained and, second, when we could go

to  see  them.  Many of us telephoned  the  Special

Branch a number of times, but always the same stock

answer   came   back,   "No,   interrogation    not

completed."  One  of  us, the Member  for  Thomson,

telephoned the Director of Prisons, and he told  us

that we could go and see the inmates, the convicted

prisoners, but we would not be allowed  to  go  and

see  the political detainees unless permission  was

granted by the Special Branch.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr SPEAKER in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>3.58 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a little surprised at this because I myself

had  spoken to the Director if Prisons only  a  few

days  before  the arrests, when  I  met  him  at  a

consular reception, and he had indicated to me that

there  is  nothing  in the law to stop  Legislative

Assemblymen  from seeing persons  detained  in  the

prison.  This polite refusal from him was therefore

a   little  unexpected.  But,  of  course,  I  also

realised that this refusal was not because  of  his

own  doings  and it would be unfair to  find  fault

with  him.  I  mention this not  to  embarrass  the

Director  of Prisons who, so far as we know,  is  a

man of integrity, but to show how the P.A.P. itself

always breaks the laws of the land, and yet accuses

other  people of doing so. It is a case, as I  have

already said, of a robber crying "thief". Since our

repeated   verbal  and  telephone   requests   were

refused, we were forced to write to the Director of

the Special Branch instead. Accordingly, I wrote to

Mr Bogaars, Director of the Special Branch, on the

21st  February, 1963. My letter reads  as  follows,

and I intend to table it, Sir, for the record:

<pre>

 `Mr Bogaars,

  D.S.B.,

  Singapore.

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We Assemblymen have repeatedly asked to be allowed

to  see the detainees arrested recently. So far  we

have not been permitted to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now three weeks since detention. We want to

see for ourselves how the detainees are being kept.

Please let us know when we may be permitted  to  go

and see them.'



<br><br>And  I  signed myself as Assemblyman for Queenstown

and  on  behalf  of 13 Assemblymen in  the  Barisan

Sosialis. We waited for a reply, but no reply came,

not  even  an  acknowledgment.  Meanwhile,  further

verbal  requests to see the detainees were made  by

us.  But  the answer that came back was always  the

same,  "Not possible now, but will let you know  as

soon  as possible." We waited for one week. Finally

we wrote our second letter on the 27th of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



February.  It  reads as follows. (This  is  another

letter which I intend to table for the record):

<pre>

`To the D.S.B.,

 Singapore.



 Sir,

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is 3� weeks since the arbitrary arrests.

Repeated  attempts  have been made  by  us  in  our

capacity  as  Assemblymen to see  our  friends  and

comrades now detained. We had also written  to  you

on 21-2-63 asking when we would be permitted to see

the detainees. We have received no reply so far.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile we are gravely disturbed by the unduly

harsh  restrictions that have been imposed  on  the

detainees,  which apparently are meant  to  further

punish both detainees and families alike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although a few detainees in the Federation have

already been allowed to read newspapers, no one  in

Singapore  is  as yet allowed the same "privilege".

No hooks are allowed and only a half-hour period of

relaxation  permitted although convicted  criminals

are  allowed to play basket-ball. [I understand the

time is actually 20 minutes, not half an hour.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tin biscuits and tin foods are barred. An]

detainees  are  given no drinks the whole  day.  In

cases where the detainees have no parents, wives or

husbands,  brothers  or other next-of-kin  are  not

allowed to see the detainees. In addition, in cases

where  husband and wife, or brother and sister  are

both  detained, each is not permitted  to  see  the

other.  Is  it  necessary to further  inflict  such

cruel and inhuman treatment on the detainees?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We learn also that some detainees have been

informed  verbally that they have been served  with

Detention Orders. How are they to object  to  these

Detention  Orders, as provided under  the  law,  if

they  are not allowed to communicate with the legal

advisers immediately?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a few years ago, the Prime Minister, Mr Lee

Kuan Yew, himself, as a lawyer and Assemblyman, was

able  to see Lim Ching Siong only three days  after

detention.  It is now 3� weeks since detention  and

no  legal adviser or Assemblyman has yet been given

permission to see the detainees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We demand to see the actual conditions of

detention  of the detainees. Some of  them  are  in

poor  health.  We demand to see for ourselves  that

there  is no breakdown in their health as a  result

of maltreatment by the P.A.P. Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to see the detainees immediately. Solitary

confinement for political detainees is inhuman. May

I  draw  your attention to the Report of the Prison

Inquiry   Commission.   1960,   which   unanimously

recommends as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"POLITICAL DETAINEES are, or indeed, should be

regarded  as  an  anomaly in a democratic  society.

While we shall not permit ourselves any judgment on

the justice or necessity



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



of  detaining  persons  for political  reasons,  we

might   observe  that  disagreement  with   current

political policies and ideas does not constitute an

anti-social offence and does not call for  measures

of social rehabilitation. It follows that political

prisoners,  if  and when there are any,  should  be

kept away from institutions for convicted prisoners

and be provided with all the facilities of ordinary

living. Political Detainees should therefore  enjoy

conditions  [of  detention]  as  near   normal   as

possible under confinement, and they should be free

from  penal restrictions and discipline.  Political

Detainees  should, in our opinion, be eligible  for

as  many visits from relatives and friends  as  are

administratively   feasible;   they   should   have

complete  liberty  to organise  their  lives  under

detention  in any manner they choose and should  be

provided  with  adequate  facilities  for  reading,

writing, study, cooking and recreation.".'



<br><br>That  is  the  end  of the quote.  Then  my  letter

continues:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`If there is no immediate improvement to

conditions  of detention, we shall further  protest

to the United Nations Committee on Human Rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindly let me know what arrangements may be made

for  Assemblymen  and  legal advisers  to  see  the

detainees immediately.



<div align="right">Yours faithfully,

<br>Dr Lee Siew Choh

<br>on behalf of 13 other Assemblymen

<br>in Barisan Sosialis.'</div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still nothing happened. Just before I left for

London  on  the  2nd of March, I received  a  short

letter  from the Special Branch informing  us  that

they  would  let us see the detainees  as  soon  as

possible. But this "as soon as possible" became "as

late as possible.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We paid visits to the Outram Prison for the first

time  on the 26th and the 28th of March. No  thanks

to the P.A.P. The Member for Anson had on Saturday,

23rd  March,  visited  Outram  Prison.  His  report

appeared  in  the  Straits Times  on  Monday,  25th

March. Under the circumstances, the Special Branch,

the  prison  authorities, and  the  P.A.P. had  no

longer  any  valid reason to stop  us,  and  so  on

Monday  arrangements  were  made  with  the  prison

authorities  for  us to visit the prison  the  next

day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go further, Sir, let us ask the P.A.P.,

why  did  the  P.A.P. Government  and  the  Special

Branch prevent us from seeing the detainees in  the

prison when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



it is clearly stated in the law that all

Assemblymen have the right to visit prisons at any

time? The Prison Ordinance, section 68, reads as

follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`68 (1) . Every Judge Magistrate or Justice of the

Peace  having jurisdiction in the place  where  any

prison  is  situate may, whenever  he  thinks  fit,

enter  into  and  examine  the  condition  of  such

prison,  and of the prisoners therein, and  he  may

question any prisoner or officer, and he may  enter

any  observation he thinks fit to make in reference

to  the condition of the prison in a visitors' book

to  be kept for that purpose by the Superintendent,

which  book shall be duly produced to the  visiting

Justices at their next ensuing visit.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the second relevant part is (2) :



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(2) Any member of the Council of Ministers or of

the  Legislative Assembly may at any time visit any

prison in the Colony and may exercise all or any of

the powers specified in sub-section (1).',



<br><br>which I have just read.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to ask the P.A.P. Government, why did the

P.A.P. Government knowingly contravene the law? Why

did    the    Special   Branch   prevent    elected

representatives  of  the  people  from  seeing  the

inmates  of  prisons? Why have they denied  elected

representatives  of the people their  rightful  and

legal  powers? Whatever excuse the P.A.P. may  give

there is no denying that the P.A.P. had broken  the

law,  and  knowingly  broken  the  law.  Would  the

Ministers  care to punish themselves for it?  Would

the  State  Advocate-General care  to  take  action

against  the P.A.P. culprits? Of course, Sir,  this

is  not  the  first time the P.A.P. has broken  the

law, but let us continue the story.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even before we went to see our friends and

comrades  in  Outram Prison, we had learnt  of  the

inhuman treatment they were receiving at the  hands

of  the P.A.P. Government. Wives and families  were

permitted to see their loved ones but once a  week,

and  that  only for 20 minutes. No food or material

was allowed to be sent to the prison. All detainees

were kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours  and

40 minutes in the 24-hour day. They were allowed to

come  out of their cells for 20 minutes a  day  for

bath and exercise. That was all. But I will enlarge

on this a little later, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What surprised us greatly was that detainees were

even  denied access to counsel until more than  one

month after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



arrest.  Whatever  arithmetic or  addition  of  the

Minister  for Home Affairs, the P.A.P. cannot  deny

that  counsel  were  only  permitted  to  see   the

detainees  more  than one month after  arrest.  The

exact dates can be ascertained, and assuming that a

person  can be served a detention order  within  16

days of arrest, and a further two weeks allowed for

grounds  of detention, it only adds up to 30  days,

but counsel were allowed to see the detainees, this

time  in Outram Prison, only five weeks, six weeks,

seven weeks, after arrest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every detainee or prisoner, as far as we know,

has  the  right to be represented by  counsel.  Why then  were  detainees denied this right until  more than   one   month  after  arrest?  Why   did   the Government,  again  knowingly,  violate  the  basic rights  of detainees? The Minister for Home Affairs tried  to  be  equivocal  in  his  answer.  He   is

obviously trying to hide something.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of our friends were sent up to the

Federation  and confined in different  centres,  in

Kuala  Lumpur,  Ipoh, Penang and Johore  Bahru.  We

learnt that some were treated not so badly, but  it

would be ridiculous to say that treatment was  good

in  any way. We know the treatment of detainees  in

the  Federation has improved considerably,  and  is

many  times better than the treatment of  detainees

in  Singapore today. But lest we forget, let me put

on record the inhuman treatment given to our friend

and  comrade,  Fong  Swee Suan,  Central  Executive

Committee  member  of  the  Barisan  Sosialis,  and

Secretary-General of the Singapore  Association  of

Trade  Unions, during the first few  weeks  of  his

detention in Kuala Lumpur. We do not just follow  a

line,  as  alleged  by the P.A.P.,  to  depict  the

Special Branch as inhuman. No, Sir. We merely  call

a spade a spade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Fong went to see her husband, who is of frail physique and in poor health, and she was shocked

at the appalling treatment he suffered  at the  hands

of the Special Branch in Kuala  Lumpur.

These are some of her complaints:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) He was in solitary confinement. The cell was

lit  by  a very powerful electric bulb 24  hours  a

day.  He  could  not have a chance,  therefore,  to

sleep in darkness.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) There was ringing of a bell at frequent

intervals  to  jar his nerves, and to  prevent  him

from sleeping or even relaxing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) He had no bed and he had to sleep on a cement

bench.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) He was handcuffed like a convicted criminal

every time he was brought outside the cell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) He was allowed only five minutes for his

meals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no wish to go into more details. But such

was  the  treatment Mr Fong Swee Suan received  at

the hands of the Special Branch. We learnt that the

treatment improved after protests were made to  the

Federation Government by Mrs Fong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some time now detainees in the Federation

have  been  allowed  newspapers and  other  reading

materials  and  may now have a  chance  to  lead  a

collective  and  social  life  though  still  under

detention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what of the detainees in Singapore? How are

they  being  treated after 10 weeks  of  detention?

Incredible as it may sound, after 10 weeks, 69 days

to  be  exact, of arrest and detention, our friends

are   still  being  treated  worse  than  convicted

criminals. Sir, we visited them, as I have  related

on  26th  and  28th March, and we  have  written  a

report  on  what we found in our visit. I  wish  to

table  it for the record, and I might as well  read

it  out here to make sure that all of us know  what

the  report is. This report was written on the 29th

March,  1963,  immediately after our  visit  and  I

wrote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Report of visit to Outram Prison



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Together with 3 other Barisan Sosialis

Assemblymen I visited the Outram Prison on  Tuesday

25.3.63  and  on Thursday 28.3.63.  We  were  shown

courteously round the prison and we saw  altogether

98  political detainees in their individual  cells.

86 were in the male A Block, 9 in a separate female

block, and 3 in the prison hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. This is the first time Barisan Sosialis

Assembly have been permitted to visit the political

detainees  despite  repeated  verbal  and   written

requests to the Government since the arrest on  the

2nd February, 1963.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were all shocked by what we saw. The conditions

of   detention  are  in  direct  contrast  to   the

recommendations of the P.A.P.-chaired  1960  Report

of Prison Inquiry Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. We were particularly shocked at the prolonged

solitary  confinement of political detainees.  This

appears  to be a deliberate punishment of political

opponents of the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since arrest, all detainees have been put in

solitary confinement. They are all locked  in  tiny

cells.  They  were permitted to come  out  to  wash

themselves for only 20 minutes in 24 hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 20-minute period for bath and exercise has,

since  about  one  week ago, been  extended  to  45

minutes. And thus today the political detainees are

still kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours and

15 minutes in a 24-hour day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Detainees are not permitted newspapers or any

form  of  reading material. It is only very  lately

that  some  childish reading material is  given  to

some  detainees, and ironically, English books  are

given  to those who read only Chinese. At one  time

even   dictionaries,  Malay,  Medical   and   other

textbooks were not permitted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The heat is oppressive especially in the

afternoon. There is no through ventilation and  the

atmosphere inside the cells is stuffy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Already solitary confinement in the tropical

heat  has  given  rise to unhealthy appearances  on

many  of  the detainees. Many look definitely  ill.

Some have sallow appearances. Others are pale. Some

look  swollen and "bloaty" in the face. Then  there

is  one who talks a little irrationally. He advised

us to be careful of our wallets being picked inside

the  prison! It is our view that he is on the verge

of  a mental breakdown. Then again many complain of

weakness  of  legs  because of  prolonged  solitary

confinement.  There  are  some  who  complained  of

backache as a result of having to sit for hours  on

non-mattress spring beds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. There is the case of one (already suffering

from pulmonary tuberculosis and referred to by  Mr

Marshall)  who complained on Saturday. 23rd  March,

1963,  of  a boil in the back and had asked  to  be

sent  to  the  Prison Hospital on  the  morning  of

Monday. 25th March. 1963. This was refused but  the

authorities changed their minds and sent him to the

Prison Hospital in the same afternoon. When we  saw

him  on Thursday, 28th March. 1963, he had an ulcer

on  his back between the shoulder blades, measuring �" X 1�",    with   ragged   angry   edges,    inflamed

surroundings and pus and gangrenous slough  in  the

centre.  This ulcer could easily have been  due  to

improper  care  following trauma inside  the  cell,

lack of exercise and undernourishment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Contrary to what Marshall has said, the food is

far from satisfactory. The fish sometimes is stale,

and  no  fruit is provided. The salt fish is hardly

edible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Families can send in fresh fruit and tin food now.

But even eggs were not permitted three weeks ago.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. A major complaint is that many have to defecate

and  micturate into chamber pots inside the  cells.

There  is no means for proper washing of the hands,

to  say  nothing  of  proper ablutions  for  Muslim

detainees.  Any washing would mean wetting  of  the

cell.  Detainees are not permitted out of the  cell

to  wash and clean themselves after defecation; nor

to  empty  the  chamber pots,  which  if  uncovered

sometime after, would emit faecal odours that  foul

and   "poison"   the  atmosphere  in   the   poorly

ventilated cells.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. This has resulted in some detainees not

willing  to wash their hands and mouths  the  whole

day,  as  such washing must be done into  the  same

chamber  pots  and  uncovering these  chamber  pots

would  mean  fouling the whole cell. For  the  same

reason  some  detainees  have  been  deterred  from

cleaning  the  mouth and brushing the teeth  before

breakfast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Detainees are now permitted pen and paper to

write letters once a week. But no table or chair is

provided  for  such  writing excepting  the  female

detainees. We saw one male detainee kneeling on the

floor   and  writing  a  letter  in  that  kneeling

position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Many complained that close relation and near

and  dear  friends have not been permitted  to  see

them. Brothers and sisters who are both detained in

the  same prison are similarly debarred from seeing

each other.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Many have been interrogated a number of times.

Some were interrogated once soon after arrest,  but

that  was all. There are two who have not even been

interrogated at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. During our visit, certain requests were made

by  detainees, for example, hand fans;  chairs  and

tables  for  writing letters; two baths  every  day

instead  of  one,  better reading material,  better

food    and    daily   newspapers.   (The    Prison

Commissioner, Major James, said he had instructions

not to give newspapers to detainees).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no request is more urgent than that they must

have   more  time  for  exercise;  more  time   for

breathing the fresh air and seeing the sun  outside

the cramped cells; time and opportunity for meeting

fellow detainees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. It does look as if the P.A.P. Government locks

political detainees in solitary confinement  purely

for  the  sake  of  punishment  and  vengeance   on

political opponents. Their excuse that this is  the

period  of  interrogation is balderdash  and  sheer

nonsense.  Many have been interrogated,  once  soon

after  arrests  and  they  have  been  in  solitary

confinement  ever since. A few have not  been  even

interrogated at all!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long is the period of interrogation? If

interrogation should take months and  months,  does

it  mean that solitary confinement will go  on  for

months and months?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How silly and ridiculous can the P.A.P. argument

become?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. There is no doubt that this sort of solitary

confinement   is  savage,  barbaric  and   inhuman.

Political detainees are not convicted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



criminals  and  must not be treated as  such.  Even

convicted  criminals  are  not  given  such   cruel

treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. Solitary confinement of convicted criminals is

only  given  as punishment for breaking of  certain

rules  and  regulations  whilst  in  prison.   Such

solitary confinement is given only for a period  of

1 day (for the lighter offences) to a maximum of 30

days  (for the heavier offences). And at least  one

full  hour is permitted for exercise and fresh  air

outside the cell.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.Today political detainees, who are not

convicted  criminals,  have been  put  in  solitary

confinement  for 8 weeks, i.e., double the  maximum

period of 30 days given as punishment for the worst

offences of convicted criminals!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, for more than 6 weeks the detainees

had  only 20 minutes in 24 hours outside the cells.

Only  recently has the period been increased to  45

minutes. This is still short of the minimum of  one

full   hour  in  24  that  is  permitted  convicted

criminals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. Today even P.A.P. backers and supporters are

shocked   at   the  cruel  tortures  of   political

detainees.  The P.A.P. Government stands  condemned

in the eyes of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must warn the P.A.P. Government. If the health

of  the  detainees,  whether  mental  or  physical,

should  break  down  as a result  of  such  inhuman

solitary confinement, the P.A.P. will have to stand

full responsibility for all the consequences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We appeal to the people of Singapore and other

countries to take serious note of and condemn these

inhuman   atrocities  committed   by   the   P.A.P.

Government.'



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> On a point of order. There is

no quorum, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is the Member insisting? Is it

necessary  at this time of the day to  call  for  a

quorum?



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member insists. It is a waste of

time. Anyway, ring the Division bells.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice taken that thirteen Members were not

present,  Members  summoned as if  for  a  division

pursuant to the Standing Order, and meeting resumed

upon a quorum being then present.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Lee.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Since, Sir, our first visit,

more  of our Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen have also

visited  our  friends in Outram  Prison,  and  more

detainees have been seen by their counsel, both  in

prison and in the Central Police



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



Station  lock-ups. All available information  shows

how  callous, brutal and cruel the P.A.P. and  the

Special  Branch  have been in  their  treatment  of

those now under detention in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have now mentioned here but a few instances of

P.A.P. inhuman treatment of detainees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The callousness and unreasonableness of the

P.A.P. and  the Special Branch can  be  seen  from

their  attitude  to the reasonable  and  legitimate

requests of detainees. Take, for instance, the case

of  the  three Nanyang graduates who  asked  to  be

allowed  to  attend  the Convocation  on  the  30th

March, 1963, at Nanyang University to receive their

diplomas  on  this big day. They were ready  to  go

under escort and abide by any condition the Special

Branch  might  impose. This request of  theirs  was

made  by their counsel to both the Director of  the

Special  Branch and to the Minister.  But  did  the

Minister  and  the Special Branch accede  to  their

reasonable  and understandable requests?  No,  Sir.

All  the requests were refused. It looks as if  the

Special  Branch  is completely insensitive  to  all

persuasion. The three graduates - their names are Ong

Sujo Kook, Tan Kok Fang, Chua Siew Chuan - had to  be

punished with solitary confinement instead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case of Peh Tian Guan shows the cruelties and

tortures  the P.A.P. and Special Branch inflict  on

detainees.  Peh Tian Guan was interrogated  by  the

Special Branch on 5th March, and because he did not

give answers that pleased the interrogator, he  was

squeezed  on  the  mouth  by  the  Special   Branch

interrogator.  Then  when he refused  to  admit  to

things  which he knew nothing about, he was ordered

by the Special Branch interrogator to stand up, put

his  hands on top of his head, and squat  down  and

get  up  160 times, himself counting the number  of

squats at the same time. The next day Peh Tian Guan

could  hardly  walk  as  a result  of  this  unjust

punishment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was reported to the Prison authorities who

saw  the poor man in his terrible condition. He was

not able to walk



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



properly to his bath. He could not even squat  down

at  the toilet, as he had not had exercise for  the

past  one  month. But what has the Government  done

about  this? On the 16th of March, counsel for  Mr

Peh   wrote   to   the  Commissioner   of   Police,

complaining to him of ill-treatment and manhandling

of  detainees. Counsel also complained, at the same

time,  of  another  Nanyang  student  having   been

slapped  in  the  face,  apparently  by  the   same

interrogator.  But  what has  the  Commissioner  of

Police done about this complaint?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Nothing was done. There was no

truth in the allegation.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister for Home Affairs

says,  doing  nothing. Is that the way  the  P.A.P.

Government  treats detainees? Counsel suggested  an

identification parade as Mr Peh can recognise  the

Special Branch interrogator who so ill-treated him.

There   is,   however,   no   response   from   the

Commissioner of Police. I hear that Peh  Tian  Guan

has been threatened with the punishment of death if

he should pursue the matter further. What sort of a

Commissioner   of  Police  do  we  have?   Is   the

Commissioner  of  Police  going  to  shelter   this

culprit?  And is the P.A.P. also going  to  shelter

this  culprit? I would like to hear some words from

the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the police are meant to protect the people,

not  to:  knock them about, still less to  threaten

them  with  death. A man died mysteriously  in  the

C.I.D. lock-up only two years ago, Sir, as a result

of manhandling by some so-called "unknown persons".

Is  the PAP, going to connive at such ill-treatment

of  detainees  until  there is  another  mysterious

death?  Why does the P.A.P. not immediately  punish

the  culprit  and give the House an assurance  that

there  will  be no such repetition of ill-treatment

and  manhandling of detainees? Instead, Sir, I  see

the  Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries  think

that  it  is a good thing for detainees to be

ill-treated in this manner. But, anyway they will  have

to answer for all this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another matter which I want to touch on

before I come to solitary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



confinement of detainees. The Government  must  not

forget  that many of the arrested persons were  the

sole breadwinners in their families. What does  the

Government intend to do about assistance  to  these

families  that need assistance? I saw one  detainee

in  the  prison  hospital  (he  who  has  pulmonary

tuberculosis and a large ulcer on his back) crying.

He  was extremely worried about his family and aged

dependants, as he was the sole breadwinner. I asked

the  Special  Branch  officer  who  accompanied  us

throughout our visit to the Prison as to  what  the

Government was doing about financial aid  to  needy

families.  He said the families must apply  to  the

Social  Welfare for assistance. Let us ask:  is  it

not  the duty, the responsibility of Government  to

see   to   the  welfare  of  families  whose   sole

breadwinners the P.A.P. Government has arrested and

detained?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am at this, Sir, let me bring out another

instance of the injustice of the P.A.P. Government.

Mr  Chang  Chan Chuan, a teacher of the Nan  Chiau

Girls  High School, who has an old mother and  four

younger brothers and sisters dependent entirely  on

him,  was paid only four days' salary for the month

of February. Why? Even temporary staff are paid one

month's  salary  in  lieu  of  notice.  Why  should

Government be so harsh on Mr Chang?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it was the practice for Government to pay

detainees  who had employment before, e.g.  Cyprus,

surely  the P.A.P. could do the same? Why  has  the

P.A.P. to go out of its way to be harsh and  cruel

to   detainees?  All  the  hardships  suffered   by

families  of  detainees are  due  to  the  P.A.P.'s

repressive  action.  The  Government  is  therefore

responsible    and    should    not    shirk    its

responsibility. Some proper scale of  allowance  to

the   detainees'   family  is  urgent.   Will   the

Government give immediate attention to the matter?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are those who are detained in the

Federation.  Every  time visits  are  made  to  the

Federation,  it eats into the savings  of  families

who can ill afford the expenses incurred in travels

away from home. In this instance again,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



it  is the Government's duty and responsibility  to

see  that free transport and free accommodation  be

provided  for  the families. Detainees  should  not

have been sent out of Singapore in the first place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the health of political

detainees.   Imprisoned   in   stuffy   cells   and

oppressive  heat, with no sunlight and  fresh  air,

inadequate  exercise  and  poor  food,  it  is  not

unexpected that we saw so many who looked ill  when

we visited the prison two weeks ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Tay Kee Chuan and Kee Swee Ban. It

is my firm belief, Sir, that but for their original

good  health and high morale that cannot be crushed

by threats and intimidations and ill-treatment, the

punitive and vindictive treatment would have caused

grave  illness amongst many of the detainees.  Many

of  the detainees look "bloaty" in their faces. For

example, Teo Siang Oon, Chen Ee Fong. Many complain

of   weakness  in  their  legs.  Many  had   sallow

appearances. For example, Wang Yuen Peow, Chua Siew

Chuan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some who have been confined in the Central Police

Station lock-ups have lost considerable weight. For

example, Poh Choon Seng has lost 10 lbs, since  his

arrest,  and Chok Koh Thong, our Central  Executive

Committee member, and one who was mentioned by  the

Prime Minister a little while ago, has lost 19 lbs.

This  loss  of weight is a result of the detention,

and their solitary confinement and cruel treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just comment slightly on Mr Ghouse. He was

seen  by  his  counsel on the 2nd of April  and  he

complained  of  chronic constipation since  arrest,

which,  was  not  relieved by Agarol,  a  laxative,

which  was given to him. He complained Of  pain  in

the  ears  and  stomach, and he  reported  that  he

vomited  at  about 9 p.m. on 3rd  April,  1963.  He

appeared   nervous  and  was  sweating   profusely,

wetting in no time two handkerchiefs given  to  him

by his counsel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such, Sir, are but a few examples of how solitary

confinement  has  affected  the  detainees.   Today

detainees  at  Outram  Prison  are  still  kept  in

solitary  confinement in cells 5 feet  by  11  feet

with tiny barred windows near the ceiling.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



They are still permitted only to come Out  of

their  cells for only 45 minutes in 24  hours,  and

during  these  45  minutes they must  bathe,  wash,

defecate  and exercise. This is the only time  when

they  can breathe the fresh air outside the  stuffy

cells and enjoy the sunshine. All in 45 minutes! If

they  do not feel the urge for bowel action at this

time, they will have to defecate in the cells!  And

until about three weeks ago, the period allowed for

bath  and  fresh air, as I have already  mentioned,

was only 20 minutes!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newspapers are still not permitted and, until

recently,  even  books  and  tin  foods  were   not

allowed.  Sir,  we  can imagine how  the  detainees

feel, all alone  - 23 hours and 15 minutes out of  24

hours a day inside a tiny cell, with no one to talk

to,  no  newspapers to read, not  knowing  what  is

happening  outside the cell, seeing no  one  except

uniformed  prison  guards,  all  the  time  in  the

stuffy, suffocating atmosphere and oppressive heat,

gazing  at the walls around them, and looking  into

space but seeing nothing!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the P.A.P. Ministers imagine what it means

for  a  man  to  be in solitary confinement  daily,

having only a single non-mattressed spring-bed  and

the  thick drab walls as company? Would the  P.A.P.

Ministers  like to have a taste of what  they  have

given  the detainees? Would the Ministers  like  to

change places with the detainees just for one  day?

Sir,  a man is a social animal. He is horn to  live

amongst   men.  He  is  brought  up  in  a   social

environment.  He  lives, works  and  plays  amongst

fellow  human beings. Until death, he  is  all  the

time  associated  with  his  fellow  human  beings.

Excepting for hermits and recluses, man cannot live

alone. He can exist alone, but he needs the company

of  fellow  human beings in order to live.  Without

social  company, a man's faculties do  not  develop

and function. He rapidly degenerates and atrophies.

Ultimately he becomes the shell of a man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me, Sir, refer you to the Prison Ordinance,

section  58  (1), and see what the law  says  about

solitary confinement;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



it talks of the punishment by the Superintendent of

minor prison offences. Section 58 (1)  reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Superintendent may punish any prisoner found

after  due  inquiry to be guilty of a minor  prison

offence as hereinafter specified by ordering him to

undergo one or more of the following punishments:'



<br><br>And (a)  says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Confinement in a punishment cell for a term not

exceeding  seven days on a diet of bread and  water

or rice and water;'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will see, Sir, this is a punishment inflicted

by  the Superintendent for people who are convicted

prisoners and it says, "not exceeding seven days".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, may I refer you, Sir, to section 59 (1) ,

which talks of the punishment by the Superintendent

of   aggravated  prison  offences.  These  are  for

heavier  offences of convicted prisoners  while  in

prison. It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Superintendent may punish any prisoner found

after  due  inquiry to be guilty of  an  aggravated

prison offence as hereinafter specified by ordering

him  to  undergo  one  or  more  of  the  following

punishments:'



<br><br>And I just refer you to (b), which states:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Confinement in a punishment cell for a term not

exceeding  seven days on a diet of bread and  water

or rice and water.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these are punishments inflicted by the

Superintendent on convicted prisoners and  it  says

nothing  of  any punishment of solitary confinement

that exceeds seven days. Let me now, Sir, refer you

to   section  62  (1) ,  and  section  62  talks  of

punishment  by  Visiting Justices. This  refers  to

more  aggravated  offences committed  by  convicted

prisoners, and it reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`62 (1) Where a prisoner is accused of any

aggravated prison offence and the Superintendent is

of  opinion that, in the circumstances of the case,

the  power  of  punishment which  he  possesses  is

inadequate, he shall forthwith report the matter in

writing to the Visiting Justice or Justices.'



<br><br>And (2)  reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Visiting Justice or Justices shall, upon

receipt  of  such  report,  attend  at  the  prison

without undue delay and investigate the charge, and

may punish any prisoner whom after due inquiry upon

oath  he  or  they may find guilty of such  offence

with one or more of the following punishments:-'



<br><br>And (a)  reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Confinement in a punishment cell for a term not

exceeding 30 days upon such prescribed diet  as  he

or they may think fit.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to impress upon you, Sir, that these

punishments  are only for convicted prisoners,  and

the  maximum that could be inflicted is seven  days

by   the  Superintendent  and  30  days  after  due

investigation  by  Visiting  Justices.  Today   our

friends  and comrades are not convicted  prisoners,

but  they have been put in solitary confinement for

70 days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me refer you, Sir, to the penal law of India,

6th  edition  of  1955, and it tells  how  solitary

confinement will affect a man. This is a law  book.

I  refer,  Sir, to section 73 of the  Indian  Penal

Code  which  is  on page 227. Section  73  under  a

heading called "Analogous Law" reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Under English law, solitary confinement, though

at  one  time  legal, was rarely  awarded  and  was

finally abolished by the Statute Law Revision  Act,

1893.'



<br><br>This  section  prescribes the  limit  within  which

solitary confinement may be awarded. It repeats  an

old English rule, now obsolete as a form of torture

which fails in its effect on the public.' And  this

is a very important sentence, Sir:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When unduly prolonged it leads to mental

derangement.'



<br><br>And   following  this,  under  the  next  paragraph

"Principle" it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Solitary confinement is isolation of the prisoner

from  human  intercourse and society. It  causes  a

feeling   of   oppression  due  to  the  gregarious

instincts  of man. Prolonged isolation  from  human

communion  becomes intolerable and often  leads  to

mental derangement.'



<br><br>And then it reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The sentence has been, therefore, reserved for

hardened criminals and as a punishment for atrocity

or brutality. It should not be ordered unless there

appear  in the evidence some special features  such

as  extreme violence or brutality in the commission

of the offence.'



<br><br>Of  course,  it  talks  of the  convicted  prisoner

committing  some brutal offence whilst  in  prison.

There is only one more quotation here, Sir, and  it

is in section 74. It reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`In executing a sentence of solitary confinement,

such confinement shall in no case exceed 14 days at

a  time,  with  intervals between  the  periods  of

solitary confinement of not less duration than such

periods,  and  when the imprisonment awarded  shall

exceed three months, the solitary confinement shall

not exceed seven days in any one month of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



whole  imprisonment awarded, with intervals between

the  periods  of solitary confinement of  not  less

duration than such periods.'



<br><br>And  under  the  same heading "Analogous  Law",  it

says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`This section has been enacted on medical grounds.

Continuous  solitary confinement  is  conducive  to

physical deterioration and mental derangement.'



<br><br>Sir,  you can see even the law book tells  us  that

solitary  confinement has serious  effects  on  the

health  of a person, and because of that,  solitary

confinement  is  only given to the worst  and  most

hardened of convicted prisoners and does not exceed

14  days. But our friends now in Outram Prison have

been  confined in solitary confinement for 69 days.

Is that what the P.A.P. Ministers want? Are they so

vindictive  and  punitive in  their  punishment  of

political  opponents that they only allow  them  to

exist  but  not  to live - and may  not  even  exist?

Solitary  confinement is a terrible punishment  and

it  is normally, as I have already indicated, given

as  punishment  to  convicted  prisoners  who  have

further committed grave offences while in prison. I

understand. Sir, even the High Court Judge does not

normally   sentence  or  convict  an  offender   to

solitary confinement. But today the P.A.P. punishes

innocent  persons arbitrarily arrested and detained

with  solitary confinement. This indeed, shows  the

Fascist   and   sadistic  nature  of   the   P.A.P.

Ministers!   This  cruel  and  vindictive   inhuman

treatment  given  to detainees in Singapore  breaks

all  records. There was nothing like  this  in  the

worst  of the worst colonial days. It does look  as

if  the Prime Minister has aped his colonial master

so  well that in the art of cruelty and tortures he

is now master of his master.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to the United Kingdom recently and there I

visited  some organisations that concern themselves

with the treatment of prisoners of conscience, i.e.

political   prisoners.   One   of   them   is   the

organisation  Amnesty, whose aims  include  seeking

the  release of those imprisoned for their opinions

and  seeking  for  them fair and  public  trial.  I

visited  the  Amnesty  on  11th  March.  1963,  and

explained  to  its officials what is  happening  in

Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



They   were   very  sympathetic  and   helpful.   I

understand  that Amnesty has written to  the  Prime

Minister  a  letter  asking him  to  answer  a  few

questions. But so far as I know the Prime  Minister

has  not even bothered to reply to this letter from

Amnesty.  I have brought back with me a leaflet  of

the  Amnesty  International, the  code  of  conduct

towards prisoners of conscience. I table it for the

information  of hon. Members. It is a Minimum  Code

of conduct towards political prisoners and has been

approved by a committee of lawyers from the  United

Kingdom,  Australia, Belgium, France,  Germany  and

Sweden.  We  can  see straightaway  that  what  the

P.A.P.  Government  is doing  today  is  in  direct

conflict  with  the  Minimum  Code  of  conduct  to

political  prisoners,  as  recognised  by   Western

countries.  Let us skip through just a few  of  the

articles  in  this Minimum Code and see  what  they

say. Article 5 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The authority arresting a prisoner of conscience

shall  immediately  notify his next-of-kin  or  his

legal representative of his arrest and of the place

where he is kept in custody.'



<br><br>The P.A.P. and the Special Branch took six days  to

notify the next-of-kin and, in fact, did everything

they  could to deny information to the next-of-kin.

Article 6 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(a) Upon arrest a prisoner of conscience shall

have  the right to be assisted by legal counsel  of

his own choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) He shall be informed of this right and

provided  with facilities to communicate  with  his

lawyer.'



<br><br>But  we  know, Sir, that our detainees  today  have

been denied access to legal counsel until more than

one  month after arrest. Neither were they informed

of  this  right  and  provided with  facilities  to

communicate with their lawyers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 9 (a) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A prisoner of conscience shall not be induced to

give  information  by violence or  threats  or  any

unfair means.'



<br><br>But,  as I have related, the detainees have already

been threatened with death.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 10 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A prisoner of conscience shall not be required to

stand  except when his cell is inspected or  during

the first five minutes of any interrogation.'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



But, as in the case of Peh Tian Guan, the detainees

have  been ordered to stand and squat 160 times  as

punishment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 11(a) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A prisoner of conscience on remand shall not

suffer    any    unnecessary    restrictions     or

deprivations. In particular he shall  be  permitted

to   receive  visits,  letters,  parcels  of   food

clothing, reading and writing material.'



<br><br>We  know  how  our  friends in Outram  Prison  were

denied all these things until only very recently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 12 (a) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A prisoner of conscience shall not be required to

work during remand, nor shall he be required to eat

or  drink anything contrary to his wishes except on

the advice of a medical practitioner.'



<br><br>We  know one detainee in the Central Police Station

lock-up,  whose name is Foo Chee Zee, who has  been

asked  to scrub the lavatory attached to his  cell.

We  are  glad to learn that he has refused  to  dot

this and has stood up for his rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also understand that other detainees now in

Outram Prison have been asked to sweep the floor!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 13 (a) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A prisoner of conscience shall be brought to

trial as soon as possible. If he is not brought  to

trial  within six months, he shall be deemed to  be

acquitted  and shall be free from further  arrests,

custody,  imprisonment, trial or other sanction  on

the ground on which he was originally arrested.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know what has happened. There are persons

who  have  been  detained for  nearly  seven  years

without charge or trial. Does the Government intend

to give all the arrested persons a fair trial in an

impartial court?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then Article 25 (a) reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A prisoner of conscience shall not be subjected

to:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) physical violence:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) forced labour;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) cruel or inhuman punishment: or.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) a collective punishment.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know what sort of punishment the detainees

are  getting. They have been subjected to  physical

violence,  forced  labour, and  cruel  and  inhuman

treatment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote one more Article. Article 32 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`During the period of his detention the state

shall be obliged to pay an allowance in cash to any

dependant  of  a prisoner of conscience  unable  to

support himself.'



<br><br>But   the  Government  has  done  nothing  in  this

direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the P.A.P.'s inhuman treatment of political

detainees  has  been condemned by  friend  and  foe

alike,  by those who oppose the P.A.P. as  well  as

those who actively back and support the P.A.P. Even

the  good friend of the P.A.P. Ministers, Mr  John

Strachey.  Labour  M.P., has  openly  condemned  the

inhuman treatment. He asked why the detainees could

not be sent to St. John's Island as in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have to refer again to Paper Cmd. 17 of

1962,  the 1960 Report of the Commission of Inquiry

on   Prisons.  The  Report  recommends  that   "all

political  detainees should enjoy  as  near  normal

conditions  of detention as possible."  The  P.A.P.

Ministers  had  accepted  and  implemented  certain

recommendations in the Report, like the  change  of

name  from  the  "Commissioner of Prisons"  to  the

"Director  of Prisons". But for reasons best  known

to   themselves,   they  do   not   implement   the

recommendations   concerning  the   conditions   of

detention of political detainees. The excuse  given

by  the  P.A.P. for  the solitary  confinement  of

detainees is that it is necessary during the period

of  interrogation. Yet, according to  the  Minister

for  Home  Affairs, so far only  one-third  of  the

detainees  have been interrogated. Only  statements

have  been  taken  from all.  This  is  a  shocking

revelation,  Sir. More than two months have  passed

and  the Minister says that only one-third  of  the

detainees have so far been interrogated. When  will

interrogation  be  over? At this rate  of  progress

interrogation  will not be completed until  another

four  or  five  months. And judging from  the  past

practice,  the interrogation will not be  completed

until  after  months  and years.  Does  the  P.A.P.

intend  tot lock up political detainees in solitary

confinement  and with no access tot newspapers  for

six or seven months or even years?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



With   all  their  self-professed  brilliance   and

ingenuity,  the  P.A.P.  Government  today   cannot

invent  a  better  excuse for these  cruelties  and

tortures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The health of the detainees is the responsibility

of  the  P.A.P. Government. Already there are  some

who  talk a little irrationally as mentioned in  my

report.  Does  the  Government really  intend  that

these people be detained until they become mentally

unbalanced?  Sir, according to Price's Textbook  of

Medicine,   illnesses  could  be  produced   during

solitary confinement, and they can be grouped  into

three   categories:  (1)   mental   disorders,   (2)

psychosomatic illnesses, and (3)  somatic illness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mental illnesses that can be produced as a

result  of  solitary confinement are: (1)  Affective

disorders like (a)  excitement, (b)  depression,  (c)

anxiety;  (2)   Schizophrenia;  (3)   Paranoia;   (4)

Hysteria. Those who have a familial pre-disposition

to  these  illnesses are more susceptible to  these

diseases than others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me finally quote from this medical book,

Clinical Psychiatry, by Dr Mayer-Gross, Slater and

Roth of Cassell & Company, Limited, London 1960. On

page   169,   whilst  discussing  the  psychopathic

personality of neurotic reactions, in the paragraph

under the heading of "Precipitation", there is this

very small paragraph, paragraph 5:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The isolation in prison and especially in

solitary  confinement is a most  fertile  soil  for

paranoid reactions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Birnhaum (1908) has made a study of such cases.

Some  prisoners  developed fantastic  delusions  of

being  pardoned or acquitted and indemnified, which

disappeared  when  they were allowed  to  mix  with

others  or  when  the sentence had been  concluded.

Paranoid reactions in prisoners of war, isolated by

language  from  their environment, have  also  been

observed.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have learnt that even the Government

Prisons  Doctor, Dr Leong Hon Koon, has complained

of  the  solitary confinement. I understand he  has

already seen the Minister for Home Affairs and  has

told  him  that  as  a  doctor  he  would  not   be

responsible for the health of the detainees if they

should be further detained in solitary confinement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would only ask the P.A.P. Ministers since none

of  them  are here, it could he conveyed to them - to

remember  the  fate that overtook all  the  Fascist

dictators of the past. The verdict of the people is

a  terrible thing and it is especially terrible  to

those  who  go out of their way to inflict  inhuman

tortures on the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now, Sir, conclude and finish with what I

have  taken considerable time to inform  the  House

of. There are still one or two points mentioned  in

the  I.S.C. statement which I have not as yet dealt

with  adequately. For example, there is still  this

irresponsible  talk of the sham  referendum  having

indicated  the wishes of the decisive  majority  of

the  people in Singapore. It has indicated  nothing

of  that sort, of course. But suffice it to say now

that  the  referendum on the 1st  September,  1962,

never  at  any  time reflected the  true  will  and

desire  of  the  people  of Singapore.  The  I.S.C.

statement  has  sought  to justify  the  repressive

actions of the three Governments taken against  our

anti-colonial and anti-imperialist stalwarts. But I

have now exposed the shallowness and falsity of all

these   so-called  "justification".  There  is   no

justification whatsoever for the arrests.  All  the

excuses  put forward by the colonialists to

white-wash  their cruel and repressive action do not hold

water. Let me summarise:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Communist story is the usual accusation

used  to  suppress  and  deny  the  people  in  the

Colonies  their legitimate rights and  aspirations.

It  is  an  excuse  for  repression  against

anti-colonial forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The British. Federation and Singapore

Governments   cannot  answer  our  proof   of   the

injustices in the Malaysia Plan, and, instead, have

resorted to arrests and imprisonment without charge

or trial, and to tortures of detainees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) There is not the slightest evidence of

violence and bloodshed. Nether is there evidence of

their  wanting  to resort to armed struggle.  There

were no violent demonstrations, no riots, no window

broken and no stones thrown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Our open support for the popular national

struggle of the people of Brunei



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



and  Kalimantan Utara is justified. It is an

anti-colonial struggle. And support of a similar  nature

was  given  by  the Federation Government  and  the

P.A.P Government in the past.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) The allegation that we constituted a danger to

the  security of the State is another trite  excuse

for  the  suppression  of the  fundamental  freedom

rights and aspirations of the people. This has been

the same excuse given by the powers-that-be for all

the  worst tyrannies and repressions throughout the

ages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) The P.A.P. leaders have, in fact, collaborated

with the colonial and imperialist forces to prolong

foreign  domination  over our  country.  Therefore,

they are colonial stooges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) By their selfish actions. P.A.P. leaders have

shown  that  they  are indeed the detestable

anti-national elements in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) P.A.P. leaders hope that the arrests at this

juncture  would  give  them  a  better  chance   to

preserve their personal vested interests.  Fear  of

the  growing strength and influence of the  Barisan

is the main reason for the repressive action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) The emphasis on the concurrence of the three

Governments   taking  repressive  action   on   2nd

February,  merely confirms the fact that all  three

Governments are undemocratic Governments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) The banning of the publications is an

attempt to deny the people their fundamental rights

and  freedom of speech and publication, association

and assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) The sending of detainees to the Federation

is  unnecessarily cruel and vindictive.  It  denies

the citizens and residents of Singapore their basic

rights as citizens and residents of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many who have asked how we may discover

if  there is freedom in a country, democracy  in  a

country. There are four basic conditions. According

to  John  Dewey, the American philosopher,  if  you

want to establish some conception of a society,  go

and  find  out  who is in gaol. This is  the  first

condition and we see today a large number of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



people  in gaol. The second condition as to whether

or  not there is democracy In a country, freedom in

a  country,  is: Is the Press allowed to  criticise

the  Government?  There  is  a  certain  amount  of

criticism, criticism of sorts, but it is clear that

the  Press  today  has been under  heavy  pressure.

Third,    does    Government   prevent    political

opposition? From what we have seen, it looks as  if

the  Government  wants  to  prevent  all  political

opposition.  And,  fourth,  do  those  accused   of

offences  against the State receive  a  speedy  and

public  trial  before  an impartial  court?  It  is

curious  that  one of the M.P.s in London,  a  good

friend  of  the P.A.P., Mr John Strachey,  frankly

admitted  that there is no democracy in  Singapore.

Sir, it is obvious that parliamentary democracy has

failed in Singapore. Parliamentary democracy cannot

work if the people in power do not want it to work,

and do not allow it to work. If those in power were

sincere  in  their talk of parliamentary democracy,

then they themselves must first practise democracy.

They must not preach democracy and instead practise

dictatorship, oppression and tyranny. If  those  in

power  were  sincere in their talk of parliamentary

democracy,  the  basic minimum is  that  they  must

allow the Opposition the facilities to function  as

an  Opposition.  They must allow the  Opposition  a

chance  to oppose. If the Opposition is not allowed

to oppose democratically and constitutionally, then

it is tantamount to encouraging and even urging the

Opposition  to oppose unconstitutionally.  If  they

close  all doors of constitutional struggle to  the

people,  they  are guilty of urging the  people  to

resort to armed struggle, forcing them to resort to

armed struggle. Let us hope that the powers that be

see where they are going, what they are doing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.P.S.O. is an undemocratic instrument used

for  the  suppression of the legitimate aspirations

of the people. We condemn the three Governments for

the  arrests. We demand that the people be restored

their inherent democratic rights



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



and liberties of freedom of speech and publication,

association  and assembly. We demand that  all  the

repressive  measures  be  immediately  stopped.  We

condemn  the  P.A.P. for  the  cruel  and  inhuman

treatment  of  detainees,  in  particular  solitary

confinement and the denial of newspapers and  other

material.  We  demand  that detainees  now  in  the

Federation   be   immediately   brought   back   to

Singapore.  We  demand that the P.A.P. immediately

stop   all  tortures  of  detainees  and  forthwith

implement  the recommendations of the  1960  Prison

Enquiry  Commission Report. And we demand that  all

detainees   be   immediately  and   unconditionally

released.
