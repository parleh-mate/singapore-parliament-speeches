<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Kim Keat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1101 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

(*  The same amendment also stood in the names  of Messrs Tay Boon Too and Cheong Yuen Chee.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, during the debate two days ago on the

Ministry  of Communications, I managed to  obtain,

in   principle,  support  from  the  Minister  for

Communications to my suggestion that  private  bus

operators   contribute  financially  towards   the

provision  of bus shelters. I will talk about  bus

shelters again today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I fully agree in principle with the

Minister  for  Communications  that  this   is   a

question of priority, and that the profits of  bus

operators should at present be ploughed  back  for

the purchase of new buses and other rolling stock,

I  still  feel that there is a lot yet to be  done

for our bus commuters generally. I would therefore

like   to   turn  to  the  Minister  for  National

Development  and urge his Ministry  to  look  into

these questions again to see if his Ministry could

expedite  the provision of bus shelters  to  those

bus  stops  which do not as yet have any  form  of

shelters  at  all  at  the moment,  especially  in

highly populated residential areas created by  his

Ministry.  First,  I would like to  suggest,  Sir,

that  the Ministry should try to secure additional

funds for the construction of as many bus shelters

as  possible  within the shortest  possible  time,

especially  in  existing Housing  and  Development

Board  estates. Toa Payoh New Town is  a  case  in

point,  where  bus  commuters  have  been  put  to

unnecessary inconvenience for the last few  years.

Second,  Sir,  is  the transfer  of  part  of  the

executive functions of the PWD to the Housing  and

Development  Board. I would like to  suggest  that

the  Housing  and Development Board  should,  when

constructing new housing estates or new  towns  in

future, be responsible for the construction of bus

shelters,  instead of the present  practice  where

the PWD



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 874</b></font><br><br>



constructs these shelters years after the  estates

were  completed.  This  is  to  ensure  that   bus

shelters are provided for bus commuters as part of

essential  facilities,  just  as  car  parks   are

provided  for  private car owners in  Housing  and

Development Board estates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   as   a  Member   of   Parliament

representing a rural constituency, I would like to

touch  upon  the pressing problems of the  kampung

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are all very glad that over the recent

years  there  have  been  political  and  economic

stability,  commercial and industrial  prosperity,

as  well  as  an  improvement in the  standard  of

living.  The Government has one unchanging policy,

i.e, to try its best to narrow the gap between the

rich  and  the poor, and to do away with  all  the

slums.  According to the results achieved  by  the

Government  in  the past decade, we are  confident

that  one day our people will be able to enjoy  as

good  a  life as possible. In fact, the people  in

the  suburban  areas  are now  enjoying  the  same

standard of living as those in the urban areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are still some people living in

dilapidated  attap  huts;  the  whole  family   is

crammed  in  a dilapidated attap hut.  Of  course,

they  also  want to save up and move into  Housing

Board  flats  so as to enjoy better conditions  of

living, and where sanitary and other amenities are

better.  However, the policy of the Housing  Board

in  the  allocation of flats is "first come  first

served". There is no favouritism. Of course, I  am

not  disputing this. However, I must say  that  in

spite  of  the high building rate of  the  Housing

Board  in  the  past few years - one housing  unit

every 40 to 50 minutes - there is still a shortage

of  flats. This means that the supply is less than

the  demand,  and so for the immediate  future  we

cannot meet the housing needs of the people. Under

these  circumstances,  the  people  in  the  lower

income group have no alternative



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 875</b></font><br><br>



but to continue to live in dilapidated attap huts,

which are like dungeons. This is a fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, attap huts differ widely from brick and

cement houses. An attap hut is built of plank  and

attap,  and therefore gets damaged easily after  a

period of inclement weather. So from time to time,

it  needs to be repaired, for which the consent of

the  landlord  will have to be sought.  There  are

many dilapidated huts and houses, with the pillars

and  beams  in a state of near-collapse.  However,

without  getting the sympathetic approval  of  the

landlord,  the tenant simply cannot or  would  not

dare  repair  such  a  house.  Some  tenants  have

approached the Planning Department, or the  proper

authority, for permission to repair the house, but

without any success. In the meantime the holes  in

the roof are growing bigger, the pillars and beams

less firm, and the walls begin to crack. Living in

such  a structure is not only unhygienic, but also

dangerous. While there is prosperity in all fields

of economic activity and our standard of living is

improving  every  year,  the  existence  of  these

dilapidated   houses   is   a   blemish   to   our

environment. It is a smear in the rosy picture  of

our   economic   progress.  So   the   authorities

concerned should try to remedy this situation  for

the  sake  of our people, and thereby  erase  this

blemish.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite the fact that the Housing Board is

going  all out to build as many flats as possible,

many  applicants still have to wait for  at  least

three  years or more before any flat is  allocated

to  them. Sir, immediate needs cannot be solved by

long-term  plans or measures. Since landowners  do

not  allow  tenants  to repair  their  dilapidated

houses,   the  Government  should  exercise   some

flexibility in the control of repairs  to  houses.

Of  course, Sir, I do not mean that these  tenants

should  be  allowed to rebuild their  houses  with

materials other than the original, so as to change

the structure entirely. What I have in mind



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 876</b></font><br><br>



is  that tenants should be allowed to repair their

attap  roof  with  attap  material.  This   is   a

reasonable  request, and the landlords should  not

be  unreasonable. They should not deny the tenants

the  permission  to  carry out  repairs  to  their

houses because in the first instance the landlords

had  given their consent to the tenants  to  build

houses on their property. The landlords should  he

more  humane and reasonable. The Government should

look  after the affairs of the people.  It  should

sympathise with their predicament and try to solve

their problems.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder whether the suggestion that I am going

to  make  is  practicable. I think  this  sort  of

application  can  be  referred  to  the  Citizens'

Consultative    Committee   of   the    respective

constituency.  Perhaps they can be entrusted  with

the  task  of helping these people. The  Citizens'

Consultative    Committee   can    consider    any

application  for  the repair  of  an  attap  house

because they are in close contact with the  people

in  the  locality. They are in a position to  know

what  kind  of  material is  to  be  used  in  the

building  of  the  house in question.  If  such  a

procedure  can  be  devised by the  Government,  I

think  it  will go a long way towards solving  the

problem  of the rural people. The Government  will

also get their full support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not mean to say that we should supervise

the  work  of the department concerned, for  which

the  Minister is responsible. I have  raised  this

question in this House because I have come  across

many  such instances and have consulted  with  the

department  concerned  but  without  any   result.

Therefore I have raised this matter in this House.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in the Housing and Development Board  Annual

Report  it was stated that (a) the Board has  been

directed mainly towards planning and building more

and  better houses in an improved environment; (b)

that  with  effect  from  1st  January,  1972  the

defects liability period assumed by the Board  has

been  extended  from  six  months  to  12  months.

Furthermore, the Board has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 877</b></font><br><br>



also  taken  steps to ensure that contractors  can

carry   out   their   contracts  efficiently   and

satisfactorily.  All these are indeed  commendable

moves  on  the part of the Housing and Development

Board. We all agree, Sir, that over the years  the

Housing  and Development Board has made tremendous

progress in the field of public housing and  urban

renewal. Prices and rentals of flats built by  the

Board  have  remained static for many years.  This

has   in  no  small  measure  contributed   to   a

successful  check on inflation. However,  Sir,  as

stated  in  the  report there is  still  room  for

improvement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to touch

on  some problems which, I hope, will receive  the

consideration of the Minister. On the question  of

the  quality  of flats constructed by the  Housing

and  Development Board, I would like to  bring  to

the notice of the Minister the poor quality in the

construction   and  finishing  of   the   recently

constructed  six-storey blocks  of  flats  in  Toa

Payoh  Central. The windows in these flats are  of

the  old-fashioned wooden louvred types  that  are

very  common  in Chinatown. Many of these  windows

cannot  be properly closed as the latches are  not

properly  aligned. The floors are uneven  and  the

doors  cannot be properly closed. In  one  of  the

flats,  two  doors have had to be replaced.  These

defects  show up only after some time has elapsed,

usually  12 months after the occupiers have  moved

in. These defects may be caused by the weather  or

negligence on the part of the contractors. I  hope

the  Housing and Development Board will conduct  a

survey  of  these flats and put right the  defects

mentioned  and,  if  necessary,  take  appropriate

action against the contractors responsible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the system of tendering rentals

for  shop houses and hawker stalls in the  Housing

and    Development   Board   estates   has    some

disadvantages. This is especially evident  in  the

tendered  rentals for eating houses.  The  minimum

rental for an eating house set by the Housing  and

Development Board is usually $770 per month, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 878</b></font><br><br>



it  has  been tendered for as much as  $3,000  per

month. In order to recover the costs and also make

a  profit,  the tenants sub-let as many stalls  as

the  shop  houses can accommodate, at  rentals  of

$100 or $300 each per month, depending on the type

of  food  sold. As a result, the tenants and  sub-tenants

often encroach on public areas, like five-foot

ways  and  even car parks. The  Housing  and

Development Board is therefore compelled  to  take

action  against such offenders much to the chagrin

of the stall-holders and the residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of hawker centres, the rentals

are  fair and there is no distinction. It  is  $35

each  per month for all categories of food-stalls,

irrespective  of  whether the  tenant  sells  ice-water,

kachang  puteh, or runs a mini-restaurant.

Previously  the rental was $55 for  a  stall,  but

this was reduced on account of a subsidy given  by

the  Government. Sir, I would say that the subsidy

is  not  utilised to best advantage. I would  have

thought that the money so allocated should be used

to  build  more hawker centres to accommodate  the

many  hawkers who are still plying in the streets.

Some hawkers are very affluent. However, I am  not

against successful hawkers as such, In fact,  this

is  a  good sign of progress. They can send  their

children  for  higher studies and enjoy  the  good

things in life. However, they should not be  on  a

subsidy.  Subsidies should only be given to  cases

of  hardship, for example, those receiving welfare

assistance, those affected by resettlement, widows

and  physically handicapped persons. To illustrate

my point, I would inform the House that near Block

18   in  Toa  Payoh,  which  was  formerly  in  my

constituency  but  it  is  now  in  the  Kim  Keat

constituency, there are two stalls selling Hokkien

mee.  They are barely ten feet apart. One  pays  a

monthly rental of $150 to the eating-house tenant,

and  the  other pays only $35 to the  Housing  and

Development  Board. Both stall-holders  are  doing

very  well.  Therefore, I would suggest  that  the

Housing  and  Development Board should  in  future

consider building hawker centres of various  sizes

and fix



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 879</b></font><br><br>



the  rentals according to the type of  food  sold.

This  will  minimise  the anomalies  that  are  so

evident now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the development of new satellite towns,

the  Housing and Development Board has endeavoured

to    provide   adequate   facilities   for    the

recreational  needs  of  the  residents,  such  as

playgrounds,  sports complexes and other  communal

facilities. As an illustration, I would quote some

projected population figures as stated in the  HDB

annual  report:  Queenstown  150,000;  Toa   Payoh

190,000;  Telok  Blangah 120,000; Bedok  New  Town

150,000; Kallang Basin New Town 100,000. With more

and more people moving into these housing estates,

there is also a need to provide facilities for our

youths.  Other than community centres, the  youths

have  no  other  place to go to  for  guidance  on

recreational  and social matters. There  are  many

youth organisations and voluntary organisations in

Singapore  which  are prepared to  participate  in

community activities in housing estates.  But  due

to  the lack of proper premises they are not  able

to  perform their community work effectively.  The

Government  has  rightly  identified  the  various

problems  faced by our youths, e.g, drug addiction

and juvenile delinquency, hence, the setting up of

a special committee to look into these problems. I

think the Housing and Development Board can play a

useful  role  in this direction. The Board  should

allow  the  various youth organisations and  other

recognised  voluntary  organisations  to  set   up

branches in housing estates. This could be done by

converting  a  portion of the void  areas  in  the

various  blocks of flats in housing  estates  into

premises  and  leasing them to these organisations

at nominal rentals.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (River Valley):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  can  I  be permitted to raise a  very  small

point  in  regard  to the Housing and  Development

Board  policy? I was thinking of raising it  under

Head  1401, Ministry of Finance, but I believe  it

may  be more appropriate to mention it under  this

Head?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 880</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang:</b> Sir, while the Housing and

Development Board flats cater for the lower income

group,   there  is  a  particular  group   in   my

constituency  where this housing scheme  does  not

apply.  I refer, Sir, to the middle income  group.

At  the  moment the combined family income of  all

applicants for Housing Board flats must not exceed

$1,500  per  month. In the debate  on  the  Budget

statement  last week, many Members in  this  House

spoke  of  the  rising  cost  of  living  and  the

speculative rise in prices of private  houses  and

flats.  Since it is now simply impossible for  the

middle   income  group  to  keep  pace  with   the

spiralling  prices, I would like  to  suggest  and

plead  that  the  Housing  and  Development  Board

should begin to cater for the middle income group.

The  ceiling  of  $1,500 per  month  total  family

income  should  therefore  be  raised.  This  will

certainly  add  on to the waiting list  of  60,000

applicants,   and  the  period  of  waiting   will

probably  be  longer  than  two  years  for   many

applicants. But I am sure those applicants in  the

middle  income group would not mind the long  wait

so  long  as they know that finally they  will  be

able to own a flat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise one or two

points on this subject. I sympathise with what the

Member  for Paya Lebar has said just now,  namely,

the  plight of unauthorised house dwellers.  There

are  many  illegal structures in the rural  areas.

The  reason is that the rural people were not able

to  get  the  approval of the Planning  Department

when  they  built  their houses. Therefore,  their

houses are now regarded as unauthorised. It  would

seem  that the authorities concerned have not been

looking into their problems. The tenants of  these

unauthorised  houses  were  able  to  build  their

houses  because at first there was no interference

from  the  Government. Then after a long lapse  of

time,  these houses have fallen into  a  state  of

disrepair, and it is only natural that they should

want to carry out repairs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 881</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, when they make applications for

repairs   to   their  unauthorised   houses,   the

authorities  concerned wanted to know  whether  or

not  building permission was granted in the  first

place.  Otherwise their applications  for  repairs

would  not  be  approved. If it is possible,  they

would like to rebuild their houses, but they could

not do so if they had no money. Therefore, after a

lapse of one or two years, more and more parts  of

the  house would dilapidate and perhaps a  portion

of  the  building might collapse. So when they  do

something  about  it, the authorities  would  turn

round  and  say,  "Your building  is  illegal  and

unauthorised. You must pull it down." Hence,  many

Members from the rural constituencies have  raised

this  matter  again and again. The occupiers  have

said  that they have lived there for more than  10

years and that they only need to do minor repairs.

It  is not a newly constructed unauthorised house.

We  are put in a very difficult position when  our

constituents, who have lived there  for  so  long,

approach  us. But there are some newly constructed

unauthorised houses too. I think it is  not  right

to  allow  such a situation to drag on. We  should

find ways and means to help them. I would like  to

suggest  to the Minister concerned whether  it  is

possible   for  him,  in  conjunction   with   the

Citizens'    Consultative   Committee    of    the

constituencies,  to  find  out   the   number   of

unauthorised  houses  in the rural  constituencies

and their condition. I hope the Minister concerned

would consider this matter sympathetically.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion is with regard to flats.

Nowadays, many people hope to purchase flats. Many

of  them  apply  to purchase three-  or  four-room

flats.  This shows the success of the Government's

home  ownership scheme. Sir, I have come across  a

case  where  a block of four-room flats  had  been

allocated to the purchasers, but more than 90  per

cent  of them did not move into their flats within

the first three months or more. They wanted to lay

mosaic  on  the floor and carry out some  interior

decorations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 882</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question I would like to raise is this.

In  future, just before the completion of a  block

of  flats,  will the Government consider allotting

the  flats to the purchasers in advance? Inquiries

could then be sent out to them to find out whether

they  want to have any interior decorations  made.

Or can permission be granted for the purchasers to

carry  out decorations during the final stages  of

the  building  construction? I  think  this  is  a

reasonable  request  and a  practical  suggestion,

particularly at a time when we are experiencing  a

shortage  of  building materials and labour.  This

will   save   a  lot  of  unnecessary   additional

expenditure.  Otherwise,  in  the  cases  I   have

referred  to, the flat owners would  have  to  get

their  own contractors to lay the mosaic  flooring

or  other  interior decorations.  In  some  cases,

cement floors have to be chipped in order that the

new  flooring  material  could  be  laid  out.  If

everybody uses the lifts to carry heavy  loads  of

cement   and   other   building   materials    for

reflooring, the lifts could be damaged. This is  a

waste  of labour and material. Therefore, I  hope,

in  future, the Housing Board will allow  interior

decoration and flooring to be done just before the

completion of a block of flats, as in the case  of

private housing. Arrangements can be made for  the

Housing  Board contractors to lay the new flooring

material  and  carry  out the interior  decoration

required, at the expense of the purchasers.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I first

attend to the request of the Member for Kim  Keat?

Like  him, I would be happy if we could  get  more

money  from  the  Minister  for  Finance  for  the

construction  of  bus shelters.  Certain  sums  of

money  have  been allocated for bus  shelters  but

there are priorities. And we have to make the best

use  of  these monies according to the  priorities

for bus shelters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present policy is to provide bus shelters,

firstly,  near  clinics and  hospitals;  secondly,

near schools and, thirdly, in housing estates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 883</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also made the suggestion that the

building  of  bus shelters should  be  transferred

from  the  Public Works Department to the  Housing

and   Development  Board.  This   will   lead   to

complication  because as soon as a housing  estate

is  built  and the roads are completed and  become

public   roads,   they   then   come   under   the

responsibility  of  the Public  Works  Department.

Many  Members have made requests for bus  shelters

in  their  constituencies and have  not  got  them

within  the time they want them. I myself  had  to

wait  one or two years before getting bus shelters

in  Tanglin. But there are priorities - priorities

between   constituencies   and   also   within   a

particular constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members for Paya Lebar and Bukit Panjang

have   almost  the  same  grouses.  This   is   in

connection  with  building  permits  and  planning

permission. They should be interested to know that

the Building Surveyor's Department was reorganised

and  set up as the Building Control Division under

the Public Works Department on the 1st of February

last  year. The procedures for obtaining  approval

for effecting urgent repairs and minor alterations

to  attap houses and similar structures have since

been simplified and the application forms revised.

If  the  Members are interested, I have copies  of

the  application  forms in my file  for  them.  To

provide  on-the-spot service  and  advice  to  the

public, sub-offices have been established at Bukit

Panjang  District  Office (Rural West),  Serangoon

District Office (Rural Central) and at the  former

Midwives' Maternity Centre (Rural East)  in  Jalan

Eunos.  To further assist the public, the Building

Control Division will shortly be issuing a booklet

on  the  do's  and dont's of building activity  to

inform  the public of the procedures to  be  taken

before any building works are carried out. If  you

put  up  an unauthorised house five years ago  and

then  want  to  renew or repair it, naturally  you

would  not  get permission because your  act  five

years ago was illegal in the first place. You



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 884</b></font><br><br>



have  got  to put that right before you  ask  for

permission  to carry out repairs. But  there  have

been  many  cases where the original building  was

authorised and application is made for repairs  or

minor  alterations and at the  end  of  which  the

building  becomes larger or even taller. Then,  of

course, the builder is in trouble and runs to  his

Member of Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to accept the suggestion that the Citizens'

Consultative  Committee  be  given  authority   to

approve  or  disapprove building plans either  for

building repairs or renewals might lead to  chaos,

as  far  as  planning and building  is  concerned.

Either we have control, or we do not have control.

My  sympathies are with the Members of  Parliament

complaining.  I  have  similar  problems   in   my

constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can now deal with the other matters raised

by  the  Member  for  Bukit  Panjang.  This  is  a

question  of additions and alterations to  Housing

Board  flats before the purchasers move in.  As  I

understand   him,  balloting  should  take   place

perhaps  one,  two  or  three  months  before  the

building is completed so that alterations  can  be

effected   with  the  least  inconvenience.   This

appears  to be an admirable suggestion.  This  has

been  done  in  the past. But this also  leads  to

complaints from those who do not want  to  put  in

any  additions or alterations or those who do  not

want mosaic floors. They grumble and say, "What is

the  use  of  selling  me a  flat  if  it  is  not

completed?"  So  either way we hear  grouses.  The

Member  himself suggested that, whilst people  are

in  occupation of the flats, the lifts are used to

carry  cement  or  mosaic,  common  corridors  are

thereby  littered, the lifts themselves get  dirty

and  even go out of order. This is the reason  why

the Housing and Development Board wants to control

alterations   to  Housing  Board  flats.   Without

control,  your neighbour upstairs may  be  hitting

the  ceiling  down to you. This is why  the  Board

must  have some sort of limited control. Otherwise

tenants  of  other  floors and  other  units  will

complain.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 885</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can go on to the suggestion by the Member

for  River  Valley, he suggests  that  the  income

limit  for  buying a Housing Board flat be  raised

beyond the present $1,500 a month. Sir, the income

limit for home owners was, in fact, increased from

$1,200 a month to $1,500 a month with effect  from

1st July, 1971. A few thousand people applied, but

they  could only apply for 5-room flats. They have

waited more than 18 months. They have not got  any

flat.  The  first of these few thousand will  only

get  their  flats  at the end of this  year,  when

about  192 units at Farrer Road will be completed.

To  increase the income limit would appear  to  be

desirable so as to look after the middle class, or

the  lower middle class if you like, but this will

only lengthen the waiting period and waiting list.

However,  I  agree with the Member that  something

should be done for this group of people. All I can

say  is  that at the moment we cannot do anything.

There  are  priorities. The Member for Paya  Lebar

complains that some of his constituents  have  had

to  wait nearly three years before getting housing

accommodation. If we were to increase  the  income

limit,  I think more Members will grumble  because

their constituents in the lower income groups will

have to wait a longer time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps Members are interested in the numbers

registered to purchase Housing Board flats. As  at

last month, there were 56,000. But I wish to point

out that of the 56,000, approximately 20,000 or 36

per  cent  are  already in occupation  of  Housing

Board flats. In other words, they are tenants now.

They  want  to  better themselves. Their  families

have  grown  probably. They are at the  moment  in

occupation  of  one  or two-room  flats.  So  with

rising  affluence they get more money, the  family

grows,  and  they  want to buy a  bigger  flat.  A

further breakdown of these 20,000 or 36 per  cent,

who are already in flats, is as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 per cent are existing owners wanting to change

their purchased flats.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 886</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24 per cent are existing tenants wanting to

purchase, instead of renting Housing Board flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 per cent are immediate relatives now staying

with registered tenants or owners in Housing Board

flats,  but  they  want  to  purchase  their   own

separate accommodation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining 64 per cent or 36,000 applicants

are  not living in Housing Board flats. If you add

this  figure  to  the 25,000 applicants  who  have

registered to rent, the total would exceed 50,000.

We hope to build 25,000 or 30,000 units this year.

If  we  complete 30,000 units, we would have  done

well.  But  then  there is still  the  balance  of

20,000 and more will register throughout the year.

Though my sympathies are with the suggestion  made

by the Member for River Valley, all I can tell him

now is: be a little patient; their turn will come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Toa Payoh has registered some

valid complaints. He complains about certain  six-storey

blocks  of flats in Toa Payoh  which  have

been  badly constructed. First, I am glad to  note

that the Member has pointed out that these defects

were not immediately apparent but only arose after

some  time. The Member will be happy to note  that

remedial  action is being taken on the  six-storey

blocks  referred  to, and the doors,  windows  and

floors will be put right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Toa Payoh also suggested that the

system of tendering sometimes does not work out to

be  fair  or perhaps practical. Sir, in  order  to

give  everybody  a fair chance to  obtain  Housing

Board  shop  premises, the lettings of  the  shops

must  be  by competitive public tender,  otherwise

you will have complaints of bias and corruption. I

would  be  happy to consider any alternative  fair

form  of letting out that can be suggested by  any

Member   of  Parliament.  Because  of   the   keen

competition   for  shops  in  certain   locations,

tendered rentals are higher than elsewhere. As for

the rent of $35 of certain stalls, the subsidy was

given at the persistent request of some Members of

Parliament. I am glad to hear one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 887</b></font><br><br>



Member saying now that he is not in favour of this

subsidy because it does not work out to be fair in

all cases. He pointed out the case of two hawkers,

both  doing well and one paying $170 a  month  for

space  in  a shop and the other paying $35  for  a

stall  space.  To  withdraw  this  subsidy,  after

having   given  it,  would  only  lead   to   more

complaints.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member's other suggestion was to let youth

organisations  -  perhaps he is  thinking  of  boy

scouts and girl guides -- occupy some space within

housing  estates  so that they  can  organise  and

carry  out their activities. This is a good  idea.

But  can  I point out that we have been approached

by  many  organisations - religious organisations,

charitable  organisations and other  organisations

like the boy scouts - for space within the Housing

Board  estates.  Frankly, we have not  got  enough

space.  To  allow one would be to let in  all  the

others.  That would mean less units of  flats  for

the people. There is, of course, the suggestion to

let them use the open space at the ground floor of

every   multi-storey  block  of  flats.  But   the

practice  of  the Housing Board is to  leave  this

space  open and free, and for a good reason: there

is  fresh  air  and children may move  around.  To

block up the space would only be a step backward.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have dealt with all the queries, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first I

would  like  to offer a suggestion, as invited  by

the   Minister  just  now,  with  regard  to   the

tendering of shop houses in Housing Board estates.

In  my  question, I was referring to eating houses

only.  As  far  as  shops  or  other  trades   are

concerned,  the  present system is  working  quite

satisfactorily.  But for eating houses,  will  the

Minister consider restricting the number  of  sub-lettings?

In  other words, if the minimum  rental

for an eating house is $770 per month depending on

the  floor space available, the tenant should  not

be allowed to sublet, say, more than four



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 888</b></font><br><br>



or  five  hawker stalls. This will then discourage

them  from tendering high prices, because it  will

be at the expense of the consumer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is a matter of clarification

with  regard to the void area at the foot of  each

block of flats in Housing Board estates, which  is

now the common practice to leave it open. I am not

suggesting  that we block up the  whole  area.  In

fact, most of the blocks are very large, and there

is  ample space. What I was suggesting is to allow

a  small  portion of space, sufficient  for  these

organisations  to use it as a base of  operations.

This  will  help  to encourage  them  to  organise

activities which can be conducted in the remaining

void areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Boon Too -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tay Boon Too</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the Minister

said  just  now that the procedure for repairs  to

attap houses and so on has been simplified. I want

to   find  out  from  the  Minister  whether   the

simplified procedure has removed the need for  the

consent  of  the  owner for  repair  works  to  he

carried  out. Some landlords are very unreasonable

and  they simply refuse to sign the form  for  the

repairs. They just simply refuse to sign. In  some

other  cases,  the  landowner  may  be  away  from

Singapore. So if the tenant were to wait  for  the

landlord  to  return to sign the form,  what  will

happen  to the attap house which is in a state  of

disrepair?  My question is, can the  procedure  be

revised  in such a way as to remove the  need  for

the  landlord's signature so that repair work  can

be carried out immediately?



<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Moh Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tuan Haji Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampung Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

interested  in the reply given by the Minister  in

regard  to  the question raised by the Member  for

Kim Keat. The Minister has said that the money for

bus  shelters would have to be spent on a priority

basis. He also said that priority was to he  given

to   bus  shelters  near  clinics,  hospitals  and

schools. Sir, I had made a request three years ago

for  bus shelters near Still Road Clinic, near the

Telok Kurau Secondary School, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 889</b></font><br><br>



the  Jalan  Daud and Jalan Eunos primary  schools,

but I wonder why they have not been erected. These

are places which the Minister has considered to be

priorities.



<br><br>3.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only that, the roads in these places are

also  in a state of disrepair. When it rains,  the

water  is splashed by passing vehicles on  to  bus

passengers.  So pedestrians or bus commuters  have

to  avoid standing near these puddles of water,  I

want  an assurance from the Minister as to whether

or not he will give priority to erect bus shelters

at the places I have mentioned just now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I fully sympathise with the  Member

for  Paya  Lebar in connection with his complaints

against  the necessity for landlords to put  their

signatures  on  applications  for  repairs  to  be

carried out. Sir, since you are not there  to  see

for  yourself,  it is very difficult  for  you  to

understand  the hardships suffered by the  people.

Some   landlords  simply  refuse   to   sign   the

application, as indicated by the Member  for  Paya

Lebar. Sometimes the landlords resort to extorting

money  from tenants who want to carry out  repairs

to  their houses. They demand exorbitant  sums  of

money  before  they  put their  signature  on  the

document. So if the poor rural people have not got

enough  money, the landowners will  not  sign  the

papers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister also mentioned

just  now  that  buildings must be  controlled.  I

agree  with  him that there must be some  form  of

control.  But, at the same time, we must not  only

look  at  the legal side of the matter,  but  also

think of the human side of it. Some of these attap

dwellers are living under difficult conditions. In

fact, I have come across one such case. So I  took

a  picture of this house which was in a  state  of

great  disrepair and dangerous for people to  live

in. I then wrote to the Minister about it and,  in

the end, some arrangements were made. There can be

other similar cases, or cases



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 890</b></font><br><br>



where  the house is badly damaged. There may  also

be  cases of attap dwellers who, with better means

would  want to provide their families with  better

amenities.   So   they  ask  for   permission   to

reconstruct  the  building and to  partition  more

rooms   within   the  same  space.   But   usually

permission is not granted. So they have no choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are cases where about 30 people live

in  a  house occupying only 1,000 square  feet  of

land.  The  place is definitely overcrowded.  They

have  no choice but to stay in it. So they  extend

the existing house illegally to get more rooms.  1

hope   the  Minister  will  consider  such   cases

sympathetically. In the case where the size  of  a

family   has  increased  considerably,  permission

should be granted to them to partition more rooms.

Their lot should be improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister also said that if the CCC is

given  the  power  to deal with  applications  for

repairs   and  so  on,  there  may  be  chaos   or

confusion.  However, I think  the  CCC  should  at

least  be permitted to do something, such  as  the

responsibility of certifying the existence of  the

unauthorised  houses, some of which  were  put  up

years  ago.  So the CCC would be able  to  certify

this  fact.  I  think  that is  quite  proper  and

adequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned by the Member for Paya Lebar, CCC

members  are supposed to be the community  leaders

who  have  been living in the area for many  years

and  they are quite acquainted with the conditions

there.  They  know  what is going  on.  So  if  an

unauthorised house has been in existence for  many

years, and if it is certified by the relevant CCC,

then  I  think their applications should be  given

sympathetic consideration.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like  to  refer  to my earlier remarks  about  the

construction   of  bus  shelters.   I   was   only

suggesting that the Housing and Development  Board

should,   in  future,  be  responsible   for   the

provision of bus shelters in new satellite  towns.

This is because I cannot under-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 891</b></font><br><br>



stand  why millions of dollars had been  spent  by

the Housing and Development Board on the provision

of  car parks in Housing Board estates, and not  a

single cent has been spent on the provision of bus

shelters.  In this respect, I wonder  whether  bus

commuters  are regarded as second-class  Citizens.

Why  do we look after the haves, who own cars, and

neglect the have-nots who have to depend on public

transport   and   whose  continued   support   and

patronage of public transport services is much  to

be  welcomed? I think they deserve the comfort and

convenience I have suggested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My plea is to ask the Ministry to make the lives

of  bus commuters less miserable than what  it  is

today.  I  believe a senior member of the  Housing

and Development Board sits on the Board of the Bus

Services Licensing Authority, and therefore  there

should   be   no   difficulty  in   planning   and

establishing   bus  routes  and   allocating   bus

shelters in new public housing estates. I do  feel

that  the  Housing  and Development  Board  should

provide  bus shelters as they have been  providing

car  parks in Housing Board estates. I would  like

to ask if the Minister concerned is satisfied with

the  present  state of affairs in respect  of  the

provision of bus shelters in Housing Board estates

created  by  his Ministry, and if  he  would  take

steps to improve the situation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I will deal with the last Member

first.  I  think he has got the wrong end  of  the

stick. I explained earlier why it was the PWD that

built bus shelters. It is because bus shelters are

on  public  roads,  the responsibility  for  which

falls  on the PWD. Hence, car parks within housing

estates  are  the responsibility  of  the  Housing

Board.   The   Housing   Board   also   does   not

discriminate between the haves and the  have-nots.

Otherwise  they  would not  be  building  so  many

flats.  To  suggest  that  tenants  with  cars  in

Housing  Board  estates  are  the  haves  is  also

perhaps  not true. Otherwise they should also  not

be living in Housing Board estates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 892</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for permits to renew or repair premises the

rule is that if you want to build a new house,  or

to  reconstruct a house, or to effect  substantial

alterations  to  a  building,  you  must  get  the

owner's  permission.  If the  repairs  are  merely

repairs  to  the  roof, you will not  require  the

owner's  permission. We realise that  some  owners

will  not  give permission. There is a  law  which

says that you cannot build on someone else's land.

To  get  rid of this law will not be fair  to  the

owners.  If  you  build an unauthorised  house  on

someone's land, he will not put his signature to a

permit either to renew, repair, or rebuild. But we

do  enforce  the law with humanity. As the  Member

for  Jurong has pointed out, he has referred cases

to  me.  We  have  been rather  lenient.  We  have

postponed   demolitions.  We  have  extended   the

periods. But it is part of the Member's job to get

these extensions, and it is part of my job to  run

the   department,  and  sometimes  we   agree   to

postponements of demolitions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I can now briefly deal with the Member for

Toa  Payoh. The proposal of his, if accepted, will

mean  going  back  again to the various  voluntary

organisations,  charitable and otherwise,  wanting

to  use  portions  of the empty ground  floor.  We

could try it out, but I hope there will not be too

many applications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Member for Kampung Kembangan, I am

not aware of his applications for bus shelters, He

said  that  three  years have passed  and  no  bus

shelters have appeared. To cut this matter  short,

would  the  Member  send his  request  in  writing

either  to  my Parliamentary Secretary or  to  me,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1104 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1001*.

(* The  same amendment also stood in the name  of Mr P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this amendment, I would like to

express my appreciation of the Government for  the

firm  answer  to the suggestion I made  last  year

when the House debated on the Motion of Thanks  to

the President for his Address to Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my speech, I urged the Government to pay more

attention  to the development of the rural  areas.

Sir,  Changi village is required by the State  for

development. The clearance exercise  by  the  Land

Office has been carried out recently. Hundreds  of

families and shops will be affected. Sir,  no  one

in his right mind will go against the Government's

policy  of development of this village.  Sir,  the

conditions  set  out  in the Temporary  Occupation

Licence  state  that  holders  of  TOLs  are   not

eligible   for  any  compensation  or  alternative

accommodation on termination of the licence.  Sir,

my  plea is that in the process of clearance,  the

Land  Office  should give the least  inconvenience

and  hardship as possible to the affected families

and   shopkeepers,   and  try   to   arrange   for

alternative  accommodation  for  them  either   in

Housing and Development Board flats or shops.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to appeal to the Minister to

consider  the  cases  of  those  people  who  have

prepared  themselves  for  this  eventuality,   by

buying  small  plots of land  in  other  parts  of

Changi  long  ago. These people  should  be  given

permission to erect their own dwelling  houses  or

small cottage factories on their land so that they

can   continue  their  business  of  manufacturing

bread,  potato chips, and other products.  Sir,  I

would also wish that the competent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 894</b></font><br><br>



authority will accord all their applications  with

great speed.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have  received  many  complaints  that  structures

which  had  been erected many years  ago  are  now

considered as unauthorised structures by the  Land

Office,  and  have  to be pulled  down.  I  wonder

whether  the Minister will consider allowing  such

structures to stand until such time as  the  whole

locality  is  taken  over  by  the  Urban  Renewal

Authority.  After  all, the structures  have  been

there for a long time, and it is only a matter  of

time  before  the area will be taken over  by  the

Urban Renewal Authority. Can the Minister consider

giving  alternative accommodation to the occupants

of  those  unauthorised structures, who have  been

living there for more than seven years now, should

the Government decide to take over their place?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> It is guillotine time, Sir,I am

wondering how much time you are going to give me.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I will give you seven minutes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Of the seven minutes, five minutes

for the Member for Changi, and two minutes for the

Member for Anson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the clearance of any area regrettably

involves  the dislocation of persons,  but  it  is

unavoidable and is undertaken only if  it  is  for

the general good of the community. Officials in my

Ministry  are  under directions to deal  with  the

problem  arising  from  re-development,  including

resettlement  and rehousing, in a manner  that  is

likely to cause the minimum of inconvenience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Changi Creek, every assistance has been

given to Singapore citizens, who are eligible,  to

be  provided with alternative accommodation.  Sir,

in  the  first phase of re-development  of  Changi

which  has  been completed, three acres containing

clusters of houses were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 895</b></font><br><br>



cleared  on  both sides of Nicoll  Drive  and  the

eastern  side  of Changi Creek.  A  total  of  234

families have been cleared; 162 families have been

offered     and    have    accepted    alternative

accommodation  by  the  Housing  and   Development

Board;   72   families  have   found   their   own

accommodation; 64 families have been  accommodated

in  ex-War  Department artisan quarters  at  Telok

Paku.  Of the remaining 98 families, approximately

70  per  cent have been re-housed at Kampung  Chai

Chee,  and  the  rest at Toa Payoh, MacPherson  or

Tanjong Rhu. The Member will be interested to know

that  ex-gratia payments totalling  $331,463  have

been   paid  out  to  the  234  families  in  this

clearance exercise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Anson's question, it has

been  the practice of the Land Office to summarily

demolish  any unauthorised structures  erected  on

State  land  after 1st April, 1960. This  was  put

into  practice years ago. Unauthorised  structures

erected before that date have been regularised  by

the issue of Temporary Occupation Licences. As for

his suggestion that unauthorised structures should

not be disturbed until the Urban Renewal Authority

moves in, this has, in fact, been the practice  of

the    Authority,   which   saw   no   point    in

inconveniencing or causing hardship to people  who

occupy    structures,   whether   authorised    or

unauthorised, if no redevelopment is to take place

in the near future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> In view of the not very

unsatisfactory answer, I beg leave to withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 896</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1107 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1101*.

(* The  same amendment also stood in the  names  of Messrs Sim Boon Woo and P. Govindaswamy.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Primary Production Department has done

a  lot  to  promote  the poultry  and  pig-rearing

industry.  To  a certain extent it has  helped  to

lower  the cost of living and to make poultry  and

pigs  an  export  commodity. We  have  been  self-sufficient

in  these  two  items  of  production.

Recently  orchid growing has been  encouraged  and

promoted,  and people in the rural areas  are  now

growing  orchids and exporting them. In this  way,

we  have  been  able to earn considerable  foreign

exchange. However, the cultivation of orchids  has

given  rise  to  the  question  of  land.  I  have

received  complaints  from the  farmers  that  the

Primary Production Department does not allow  them

to cultivate orchids around the Sembawang Research

Station  because the Department itself is carrying

out  a  large  scale experiment on orchid  growing

there.  Therefore, the farmers are not allowed  to

grow orchids around that area. I feel that this is

not   right.   Although  the  Primary   Production

Department has other plans too, I feel that before

they  are implemented, the farmers should be given

temporary permits to carry on with their  business

of orchid growing so that their income will not be

affected. When the Department decides to carry out

its  programme, it will then not be  too  late  to

stop  the farmers from growing orchids around  the

station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel that the Primary Production

Department  should  implement  a  scheme  to  grow

vegetables  on a big scale. Most of the vegetables

we  consume are imported from abroad. The cost  of

vegetables   is  rising.  Formerly   a   kati   of

vegetables  costs only 20 cents; now it  costs  80

cents  per  kati.  It  seems  that  the  price  of

vegetables will continue to rise. This will affect

the  livelihood of the people. Since  the  Primary

Production Department has done quite well  in  the

rearing  of  pigs and poultry, I think  it  should

carry  out  research to find out the best  way  in

which to grow vegetables. It should encourage our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 897</b></font><br><br>



farmers  to  grow vegetables on a big  scale,  and

should give them more land to grow vegetables.  If

more  vegetables are grown locally,  their  prices

will come down to normal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point I would like to raise is that I

have  received many complaints from farmers  about

the  drastic increase in the price of animal feed.

It  has gone up as much as 100 per cent. This  has

resulted in higher costs to the farmers, and  they

therefore suffer a loss of income. Has the Primary

Production  Department taken  steps  to  help  the

poultry and pig-rearing farmers by finding out the

reason  for  the increase in the price  of  animal

feed, and whether such a price hike is justified?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  draw  the  attention of the  Minister  to  the

unscrupulous  inshore illegal trawlers  along  the

east  coast. These trawlers started their  illegal

operations  a few years ago. It is regrettable  to

note  that even now they are still operating; thus

destroying  the fishing nets, crab  nets  and  the

pupus, or fishing traps, of our inshore fishermen.

Sir, even the spawns of fish were destroyed in the

process.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Citizens' Consultative Committee,

through   the  Katong  District  Office,   and   I

personally  too, have written several  letters  of

complaint  to the Head of the Fisheries Department

about   this,  but  we  have  failed  to   get   a

satisfactory   reply.   Although   the   Fisheries

Department, in conjunction with the Marine Police,

have  mounted more than ten raids but only a  very

few of them were arrested. Even among the very few

who  were arrested, one of them managed to  escape

under the very eyes of the Fisheries officers  and

the  Marine Police. This happened on the night  of

25th  June,  1972, when two illegal trawlers  were

arrested and while they were being towed  back  to

the depot, one of them escaped. Sir, this incident

shows us how efficient the Department is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Citizens' Consultative Committee have

been very helpful. Although it is an honorary job,

they have helped the Fisheries Department to stamp

out



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 898</b></font><br><br>



these  illegal operations. As a result,  they  are

now  being  threatened by the  illegal  operators.

Sir, I wish to draw the attention of the House  to

the  fact  that whenever the Fisheries  Department

conducts  a  raid of this nature on  a  particular

night, the illegal trawlers would stay away. I  am

very suspicious of this and perhaps there has been

a  leakage  of information. This is  a  matter  of

great  importance,  and I hope the  Minister  will

look  into  this  matter  with  urgency.  If  such

illegal  operations are not stopped, I  am  afraid

that the inshore fishermen might take the law into

their  own  hands,  as they have  lost  faith  and

confidence  in the Fisheries Department.  In  that

event  I  want  to  make it  very  clear  that  my

Citizens' Consultative Committee and I myself will

not  be  responsible for any eventual consequences

that  may  happen, and at any moment now,  Sir,  I

hope  I  will  get a satisfactory reply  from  the

Minister.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the recent

outbreak  of  foot  and mouth  disease  at  Jurong

Abattoir has resulted in the unnecessary slaughter

of  animals imported from overseas. As  a  result,

the  price  of fresh mutton and beef has  gone  up

enormously.  Further,  I  understand  that   these

animals  are  inspected en masse, and not  singly.

With  this type of inspection sometimes  a  single

animal  suffering  from this  disease  may  escape

detection.   Can   more  stringent   measures   be

introduced   to  ensure  that  our  citizens   are

protected  from  consumption of  unwholesome  meat

accidentally? The press has reported  that  before

the  detection  of the foot and mouth  disease  of

animals,  meat from a few slaughtered  heads  were

sold in the market. It is fortunate that there has

been  no  outbreak of disease among those who  had

consumed the infected meat.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with increasing urban renewal projects

taking  place all over Singapore, what  steps  are

being  taken to introduce flatted farming for  the

rearing of pigs, poultry and fish? There was a lot

of talk about the feasibility of rearing pigs



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 899</b></font><br><br>



in   flatted  buildings.  But,  up  to-date,  what

progress  has  been  made  besides  conducting   a

feasibility study?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

have  your  permission to speak on this  amendment

now,  so  that I do not have to move my  amendment

(3) *, which is on Fisheries?



<hr size="2" noshade>

* The amendment reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) That the sum to be allocated for Head 1107 be reduces by $10 in respect of subhead 1261.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Thank you, Sir. With regard to

illegal  trawling,  I fully share  the  sentiments

expressed by my good friend, the Member for Changi

and  I would also like to make a similar complaint

to  the Minister for Law and National Development.

The  Member  for  Changi just now  mentioned  that

there  has been illegal trawling operations  along

the east coast of the Republic, but I think it has

extended  to the north-east sector too, i.e, into

the Straits of Johore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, illegal trawling has caused considerable

harm  and is threatening the livelihood of a  good

number of inshore fishermen in my constituency.  I

believe   complaints  have  been   made   to   the

Department  concerned. Action, in fact,  has  been

taken,  but  somehow these illegal  trawlers  come

back.  Members  of this House have  just  heard  a

vivid  illustration  of what may  eventually  take

place  if  no stern or proper action is  taken  to

deprive  these  illegal trawlers of  trawling  not

only in the Straits of Johore but also in the east

coast. I am told that these illegal trawlers prowl

the  Straits of Johore only in the early hours  of

the  morning between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. I must make

it  clear  that  I  was told  that  the  Fisheries

Division of the Primary Production Department  has

been watchful over this matter and that the Marine

Police has also come into the picture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to give an idea of how the illegal trawlers

operate,  allow  me to say this. These  boats  are

pretty  small, but quite highly powered. They  are

unlicensed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 900</b></font><br><br>



boats  and  each is manned generally by  three  or

four  young  men. When they are Out trawling,  the

boats  are completely without lights. That is  why

in  the  process  of this illegal  trawling,  they

damage  the  surface nets and other  fishing  gear

belonging  to  the inshore fishermen.  Of  course,

when  such things happen, tempers rise.  And  when

tempers  rise,  you  can bet  that  violence  will

result.  Therefore I echo the plea of  the  Member

for  Changi  that the Fisheries Department  should

take   stronger  measures  to  eradicate   illegal

trawling.  I  suggest that when the  operators  of

illegal   trawlers  are  caught,  the   Department

concerned should press for stiffer sentences,  not

only   to   impose  heavier  fines  but  also   to

confiscate  both the boat and fishing  gear.  This

will, I hope, deter them. Thus, we would not  only

protect  the  livelihood of the inshore  fishermen

against  threats  but  also  prevent  any  serious

consequences  from arising, which the  Member  for

Changi has rightly pointed out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another point I wish to raise is in regard

to   the  United  Nations  Development  Programme-sponsored

Fishing Training Centre and the  Fishing

Training School Vessel. Members will notice  that,

in  fact,  a  lot of money has been spent  on  the

running  of this project. The Government  together

with the T.JNDP have jointly organised courses  to

encourage more of our youths to take to the sea. I

am told that there is good response to the courses

run  by  the training centre. But when  those  who

have  attended such courses go out to fish, a good

number  of  them simply leave the boats  on  their

return. The main reason may be attributed to their

having  to stay for a long period away from shore,

and  sea-sickness. In this respect,  after  having

spent  a  lot of money on training them,  the  net

result  is that only a handful really stay behind.

This is therefore far from satisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also told that a few companies are involved

in offshore and deep-sea fishing activities. But a

large proportion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 901</b></font><br><br>



of  their boats are actually otter trawlers.  Most

of  these  otter  trawlers are based  in  Kangkar,

which  is  part of my constituency. I am happy  to

say   that   the   complaints  about   piracy   in

international   waters,   especially   near    the

Horsburgh   Lighthouse,  have  somewhat   reduced.

Thanks  to the relevant Government department  for

their prompt action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of all this, I wonder what the Minister

has in mind to overcome all the problems.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Members  for  Changi and  Punggol  have  both

raised  the problem of illegal trawling operations

in  the  east coast and the Straits of  Johore.  I

would  now like to tell the Minister that  similar

activities are going on in the west coast, namely,

Jurong.  The  Members for Changi and Punggol  have

already   given  a  detailed  account   of   these

operations  and the harm they have caused  to  our

inshore  fishermen.  When these  illegal  trawlers

operate  along the coast, they destroy  or  damage

the   nets   and  fishing  gear  of  our   inshore

fishermen.   And   when  this   happens,   certain

consequences will result. That is why the  inshore

fishermen  hate  these illegal trawler  operators.

Hence,  I  urge  the Minister to  adopt  stringent

measures  to stop such illegal trawling operations

along our coast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter which I would like to bring up

has  already  been  mentioned by  the  Member  for

Sembawang.   Although   the   Primary   Production

Department  has  done a lot for our  farmers,  the

livelihood of the farmers has not improved.  There

are various reasons for this. For example, the pig-rearers

in our country have been leading  a  very

miserable  life. Last year, there  was  a  drastic

drop in the price of pigs, and they lost a lot. At

the   beginning  of  this  year,  there   was   an

improvement  in  the price of pigs.  However,  the

prices  of  animal feed have gone up.  Thus  their

gains have been set off. The prices of animal feed

have gone up because of the increase in the prices

of   raw  materials  in  the  supplier  countries.

However, the price at source has come down but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 902</b></font><br><br>



the  prices of animal feed have not come  down.  I

would like the Minister to investigate this matter

and help our pig farmers.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Anson touched on the

foot  and  mouth disease of animals. This  disease

has posed a grave threat to our livestock farmers.

As a result the Malaysian Government has imposed a

ban  on  imports of our poultry to Malaysia,  thus

causing hardship to our poultry farmers. I do  not

know  whether our Government can help the  farmers

to  petition the Malaysian Government to lift  the

ban.  According  to  the  experts,  this  kind  of

disease will not spread to poultry and I therefore

hope  that  our  Minister will  help  our  poultry

farmers in this respect.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, starting with the Member for

Sembawang.  He  complains  about  the  banning  of

orchids   being  grown  around  the   experimental

station. I find this hard to believe. One does not

need   permission  from  the  Primary   Production

Department  to  grow  orchids  in  Sembawang,   or

Tanglin,  either  in  your  house  or  even  on  a

commercial scale. But if you want to grow  orchids

on  a  commercial scale, then it must be  on  land

properly  zoned "agricultural". So it is not  true

that  the  Primary Production Department does  not

allow  people  to  grow  orchids.  In  fact,   the

Department  has  been encouraging  the  commercial

growth of orchids in the Republic because it is  a

valuable foreign exchange earner. Figures for  the

last  three years show a steady increase in  total

value. 1970, $1.2 million; 1971, $1.8 million; and

1972, $2.6 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the price of feed-meal, about which two

Members   complained,  unfortunately   we   cannot

produce  feed-meal  for pigs in Singapore  without

importing  the necessary raw materials.  The  rise

and  fall  in  prices of feed-meal is  subject  to

world  competitive  prices.  As  we  get  our  raw

materials for animal feed-meal from abroad, we are

subject  to world prices, depending on demand  and

supply. At present, the prices have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 903</b></font><br><br>



gone up and, unless we subsidize the price of  raw

materials for feed-meal, there is nothing  we  can

do except to pay what foreign sellers demand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang wants the Primary

Production  Department to  grow  vegetables  on  a

large  scale.  Several Members  want  the  Primary

Production to chase illegal trawlers.  But  it  is

refreshing to hear the Member for Jurong say  that

the  Primary Production Department has done a  lot

for the farmers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for trawlers, the Member for Punggol has

pointed  out,  it  is  difficult  to  catch  these

illegal trawlers. The Department together with the

Marine Police, have done their best. Some trawlers

have  been  caught, and some have  escaped.  Early

this  year,  the  Member for Changi  informed  the

Department that there was a resurgence of  illegal

trawling activities. The Department, together with

the  Marine Police and the District Office  (Rural

East),  immediately carried out a number of raids.

In  the  month of February alone, a  total  of  12

raids  were conducted between the hours of 8  p.m.

and 4 a.m. However, no trawlers were sighted. I do

not  know what the answer is. Perhaps there  is  a

leakage  of  information, either  in  the  Primary

Production Department, or the District Office,  or

the  Marine Police, I do not know. But if you have

evidence of leakage, your proper course is to make

a  report  to  the Corrupt Practices Investigation

Bureau.  To  press for heavier fines or penalties,

this  would  really depend on what  the  Judge  or

Magistrate  will  impose.  But  perhaps   we   can

consider revising existing legislation to  provide

for  heavier penalties against offenders. But  let

me  assure all three Members who complained,  that

whether  it  is  Jurong, Changi  or  Punggol,  the

Primary  Production Department would  welcome  any

information  and advice as to the effective  means

to  catch  and deal with offenders. I  agree  with

them  entirely  that illegal trawling  around  our

shores  will lead to considerable damage not  only

to  the fishermen's gear, net, or whatever it  is,

but also to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 904</b></font><br><br>



a shortage of fish. There would not be fish around

our waters unless we stop illegal trawling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Anson, I find it difficult

to  follow  him.  He  talks of  "unnecessary  mass

slaughter"  with  respect to the  foot  and  mouth

disease.  Let  me assure him that  the  slaughter,

however  unfortunate, was very necessary in  order

to confine the disease within the precincts of the

quarantine   station.  The   disease   was   first

discovered amongst cattle. As a result,  400  head

of  cattle  had  to  be destroyed,  some  with  no

symptoms  of foot and mouth disease. At  the  same

time  there  were  4,000  head  of  sheep  in  the

quarantine   station,  completely  free   of   the

disease.  But  soon  after  the  cattle  had  been

destroyed,  the  disease spread  to  some  of  the

sheep. We had no alternative but to slaughter  all

4,000  head  of  sheep.  However  regrettable  and

unpleasant  the action might be, it  was  for  the

safety of the other animals in Singapore that  can

be  infected by this disease. But to say that some

of this diseased meat got out and was consumed,  I

hope   not  in  Anson,  is  bordering  on  rumour-mongering.

Let me assure the Member that  no  such

meat  left  the station. No animal, in  fact,  was

allowed  to leave the quarantine station,  whether

it was dog, cat, horse, cattle or sheep.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will be perhaps interested to know the

present  position.  So  far  we  have  managed  to

confine  and  eradicate this  disease  within  the

station.  There  is no evidence  or  sign  of  the

disease   having   spread  beyond   the   station.

Continued  vigilance  is being  exercised  by  the

staff  of  the Primary Production Department.  All

dogs    and    cats   which   were    quarantined,

unfortunately longer than necessary as a result of

the  outbreak,  were  all  released  on  the  26th

February, last month. It is intended to leave  the

quarantine station as it now is, that is  to  say,

no  animal will be allowed into the station or out

of  the  station,  for about  another  month  more

before operations can go back to normal. But  even

when operations resume, it will begin with only  a

few animals. We do not want another 4,000 sheep



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 905</b></font><br><br>



going  in  and  suffer  another  outbreak  of  the

disease, causing all of them to be slaughtered. So

a  test  period with few animals will have  to  be

undergone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong rightly complains about

the  ban  of poultry, as a result of the foot  and

mouth  disease in Singapore. But foreign bans  are

not within our control. Poultry is not affected by

foot  and  mouth disease, nor are eggs. But  if  a

foreign country decides to ban the import  of  our

poultry or eggs as a result of our foot and  mouth

disease,  there  is nothing we  can  do  about  it

except to appeal to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Changi wanted particulars of the

Fishing  Training Centre. The Member has  not  got

all  his  facts right. The UNDP-sponsored  Fishing

Training Centre runs two courses. One is the  deck

course,  which is to train navigators and  fishing

technicians,  and the other is the engine  course,

which   is  to  train  fishing  vessel  and  shore

engineers. So far two batches comprising  a  total

number  of  60  trainees have graduated  from  the

centre.  Our  records show that out of  the  first

batch  of trainees, about 50 per cent are employed

on fishing and other vessels, whilst the remaining

50  per cent are employed in shipyards and related

establishments.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these one-year courses, the

Centre also conducts short-term courses from  time

to time. So far, a total of four courses of two to

three  months'  duration have been  conducted  for

inshore  fishermen who wish to switch to off-shore

and  deep-sea fishing. A one-week course has  been

conducted  for  captains of fishing  trawlers.  In

addition,  the  Centre also serves  as  the  focal

point for dissemination of technical knowledge  to

fishermen  and fishing companies. The Member  must

realise  that deep-sea fishing means a hard  life,

and  not everyone is prepared to go out for  weeks

or  months  and  then return to Singapore  and  to

their family thereafter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for flatted factories, I have not forgotten

the remarks I made in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 906</b></font><br><br>



House  last  year.  But my  Ministry  has  made  a

recommendation to the Ministry of Finance for  the

setting  up of flatted factories. It has  gone  to

and fro, between National Development and Finance,

and  we have not got their approval as yet. It  is

not my practice to come here and put the blame  on

another  Ministry.  But as I have  to  answer  the

Member, all I can say is that National Development

has  not  slipped on this proposal. We  have  made

recommendations to Finance who are considering the

matter.  It  is again a question of priority,  and

how  much  money they can afford to put aside  for

this project.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would

like  the Minister to listen carefully to  what  I

have to say. He said that it is not necessary  for

anyone  to get a permit to plant orchids. I  would

like  to  tell him that the place in  question  is

somewhere near the Sembawang experimental station.

This  land  on  which the farmers intend  to  grow

orchids is leased to them on TOLs. When they  want

to  grow  orchids on this TOL land, which is  also

some sort of agricultural land, they were told  to

apply  to the Primary Production Department for  a

licence to grow orchids. When they wanted  to  put

up  a  fence, they were also told to apply  for  a

licence.    When    they   made   the    necessary

applications, they were informed that the  Primary

Production Department might not be likely to  give

them  a licence as the experimental station has  a

big  scheme in mind. So the farmers complained  to

me, and I went to see the authorities concerned on

their  behalf.  I  informed them  that  since  the

Primary Production Department had no immediate use

of the land then they could perhaps grant them the

licence  and  later  withdraw it  after  they  had

actually  implemented the scheme. So  perhaps  the

Minister was not informed of this, and that is why

he  does not know about the matter. Actually it is

not   necessary   for   the   Primary   Production

Department to issue any licence at all. If  it  is

the  case  that anybody who wants to grow  orchids

could go ahead with it, then it is very good.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 907</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about the growing of

vegetables  which  I have just  referred  to.  The

Primary  Production Department has done a  lot  in

respect  of  vegetable farming and  I  praise  the

Department  for its efforts. Perhaps the  Minister

did  not listen carefully to what I have said. The

Member  for  Jurong has also praised  the  Primary

Production  Department for what  it  has  done  in

respect of vegetable farming. I mentioned this  in

the hope that the Ministry concerned can encourage

more farmers to go into vegetable farming in order

to  reduce  the  price  of vegetables,  because  I

myself buy vegetables often. But the Minister does

not  buy vegetables himself, and therefore he  may

not know that the price of vegetables has gone up.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sim Boon Woo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sim Boon Woo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am really

surprised the Minister said just now that he would

consider   amending  the  legislation  to   impose

heavier  penalties, jail sentences or confiscation

of  the vessel. However, I remember the hon. Prime

Minister  stated in a function at the Tanah  Merah

Besar  Community Centre on the 26th of June, 1971,

that   illegal  activities  must  be  stopped   by

imposition  of heavier penalties and even  jailing

the  operators, if necessary. This speech was made

two  years  ago, but since then nothing  has  been

done. The Prime Minister's statement has not  been

taken heed of. This is very much regretted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder whether the Minister could assure

the  hon.  Members for Punggol and Jurong  that  a

special  highly secret operation will  be  carried

out  against these illegal operators.  As  I  have

said  just now, I am very suspicious over the fact

that  whenever  a raid is to be carried  out,  the

illegal  trawler is never around. Sir, I hope  the

Minister will listen to the pleas of all the three

Members here, myself included, of course.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, there is a little

misunderstanding between the Member for  Sembawang

and  me.  He agrees with me that there is no  need

for  a  permit.  But in this particular  case,  he

speaks



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 908</b></font><br><br>



of  a  Temporary Occupation Licence,  which  means

that  the land belongs to the State. The land  may

have  been let out on licence not for the  growing

of  orchids, so that if he wants to grow  orchids,

he  seeks  the permission of the Land  Office  who

refers  him  to the Primary Production Department.

And  in this case, the Department recommended that

the licence to grow orchids on the land should not

be  granted  because Sembawang  Station  wants  to

enlarge. That is the reason. It has got nothing to

do with permits generally for orchids.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also wants the Primary Production

Department  to  grow vegetables.  They  are  doing

their  best  not  to  grow vegetables  themselves,

because  if they do then they would be accused  of

competing unfairly with the poor farmers. What the

Department  has,  in  fact, done  is  to  go  into

hydroponics and mushroom cultivation.  This  is  a

subject  on  which some amendments will  be  moved

later. The Department has successfully grown fresh

mushrooms,  and  if this can be  cultivated  on  a

commercial  scale,  it is good  for  Singapore.  I

would invite the Member for Sembawang to buy  some

of  these mushrooms at about $3 or $4 a kati. This

will be the best mushroom he has ever eaten!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, the Minister has not

replied to the Member for Changi's observation  on

heavier penalties.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> The Member for Changi wanted an

assurance from me. I am not prepared to  give  him

that  assurance.  I  did not make  any  speech  in

Changi.  It  was the Prime Minister who  made  the

speech. I did not hear his speech nor have I  been

given  any  directions by him  to  increase  these

penalties. But Members should be satisfied with my

assurance  that  I  will  instruct  the  Attorney-General

to look into this matter with a  view  to

enhancing  penalties,  whether  it  be  fines   or

imprisonment  and perhaps easier  confiscation  of

vessels   which  have  been  caught  for   illegal

trawling.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 909</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am glad

to   hear   the  Minister  say  that  the  Primary

Production  Department has gone  into  hydroponics

and mushroom cultivation. I would like to know how

soon  can the results be made known. If it is made

known  one or two years later, by which  time  the

vegetable prices would have gone up by $1  or  $2,

then  it  will be too late. Can the Minister  tell

this  House  something more about the  hydroponics

scheme?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, there is an amendment in

the  name of the Member for Jurong on the  subject

of hydroponics. I think it is out of order for the

Member for Sembawang to raise it now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, I agree with you. Mr Teong,

you will have to wait until the proper time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I only

asked  the Minister whether he could tell us  more

about  hydroponics, and when will the  results  of

the experiments be made known.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I would rather wait for the

relevant amendment to be moved. So he has  got  to

wait  until  the  Member  for  Jurong  moves   the

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Since I will

be  getting  an  answer  later,  I  beg  leave  to

withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I propose to take the Suspension

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head 1107 (contd.) -



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1107 be reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 1201.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the Minister many

questions on this subhead, Fishing Port and Fish

Auction Markets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, will the Ministry of National Development

expand  the  present fishing port? As I understand

it, the present port facilities are not sufficient

for  us  because there are several ships anchoring

alongside  the  wharf, and it is not  possible  to

cram them. This has caused some difficulty in  the

loading   and   unloading  of  fish.   Since   our

population is increasing, more fish is needed  for

local  consumption. I, therefore, feel that  there

is  an urgent need to expand the facilities at the

fishing port.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is also a need to set up a

permanent office at the Central Fish Market. I had

touched on this question during the Budget  debate

last  year. When I brought up this matter at  that

time, the Minister replied that he would recommend

to  the  Jurong  Town  Corporation  to  set  up  a

permanent  office there for the use  of  the  fish

merchants. He can refer to Hansard, Vol. 31,  col.

1205,  dated  22nd March, 1972. I would  like  the

Minister  to  inform us of the progress,  if  any,

which has been made in this respect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the question of management of the

Central  Fish  Market. Recently  I  have  received

several  complaints  that many  petty  thefts  are

taking  place at the fish market. Sometimes  whole

crates of fish and prawns are stolen. I know  that

there  are about 3,000 people going in and out  of

the  fish market every night. There might be  some

bad  hats among the crowd, and they impose certain

difficulties   in   respect  of   management   and

security. Therefore, there can be no excuse at all

for  relaxation in management and control  of  the

fish  market. Perhaps when we issue entry  passes,

we  should  scrutinise  the  applicants  carefully

before issuing them with passes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 911</b></font><br><br>



At  the same time the authorities concerned should

also  maintain  close  liaison  with  the  Police.

Perhaps  it  might be useful if the  Police  could

send  some officers there during auction  time  in

order to reduce the incidence of thefts.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, judging from the

Member's remarks, the fishing port and fish market

in  Jurong have been successful, and that  is  why

more space is required. First, the Member will  be

glad  to know that a sum of $195,000 will be spent

on   extension  work.  The  work  started  on  8th

February and the completion date is around  August

this   year.  The  extension  work  involves   the

construction of three more bays, each 70  feet  by

120  feet, at the auction area of the Fish Auction

Market.  Secondly,  there is provision  of  proper

accommodation  for  six ice-crusher  stalls  which

will replace the present temporary stalls sited at

the end of the existing market. There will also be

the  installation  of a salt water  pump  to  pump

water  from  the sea to facilitate more  efficient

cleaning of the market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the request of more space for the

retailers,  I am still pursuing that  matter  with

the  Ministry of Finance. I agree with the  Member

that more space should be provided, as some of the

fishmongers are renting space from the  authorised

tenants and paying rather exorbitant rents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for stealing at the market, there are several

officers  on  duty there. At the  peak  auctioning

period  there are about 3,000 people  mingling  in

the   market.  This  is  bound  to  lead  to  some

squabbles  and  arguments between wholesalers  and

retailers.  After all it is a fish  market.  There

have  been  a  few cases of theft of fish  in  the

market.  The gates of the port are manned  by  two

security  guards. These guards are retired  Police

officers,  and  their duties are to check  persons

entering  the  fishing port. However,  as  I  have

said, there are about 3,000 people each night,  in

addition  to about 500 vehicles. It is  impossible

to check each and every person entering the market

without



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 912</b></font><br><br>



causing a long queue and much inconvenience to the

fish  retailers who go to the market to buy  fish.

However,  spot checks are made from time to  time.

The  Member for Jurong can rest assured  that  the

Department  concerned will look into  his  further

suggestion and try to improve the running  of  the

port and the market.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister seems to have omitted  the  point  I

raised  about  the permanent office  in  the  fish

market.  I  raised  this matter  in  the  previous

Budget  debate last year, and he replied  that  he

would negotiate with the authorities concerned.  I

would like to know the position now.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Can I ask the Member this: whom is

the permanent office for?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am

referring  to  the permanent office  in  the  fish

market for the fish merchants. The position is  as

follows. At the moment there are temporary offices

made of wooden planks for the fish merchants. They

are  not satisfied with such facilities. Each unit

is  very  small, and it is very hot  in  the  day.

After  four years certain planks of the wall  have

been  attacked by white ants. They have  therefore

requested  whether the Jurong Town Corporation  or

the  Ministry of National Development can  provide

them with more permanent offices.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> There is some misunderstanding on

this  matter. When the fish market was built,  the

Department erected three blocks of timber  offices

for  the use of the fish merchants. I pursued  the

Member's  request  with the Department  concerned.

Their  reply was that, provided the companies  put

up  the  buildings themselves, they would help  to

find  a  suitable site for them. In fact, a number

of  commercial companies engaged in the  catching,

auctioning and processing of fish have constructed

their own offices in the Jurong fish port.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I heard the same



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 913</b></font><br><br>



answer  last  year. As I had pointed  out  to  the

Minister last year, not all fish merchants are  as

rich  as  he imagines. If some of them  are  rich,

they  would have invested their money in  deep-sea

fishing.   I  would  suggest  that  he   makes   a

recommendation  to  the Jurong  Town  Corporation,

since the land belongs to the Corporation, to  set

up  a  permanent  office for rental  to  the  fish

merchants.  All these suggestions have  been  made

before  and  recorded in the  Official  Report  of

Parliamentary Debates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have sounded the

Jurong  Town Corporation, and they are not willing

to  do so. All that I can do for the Member now is

to put up his request again.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I   will   put  up  the  same  request  with   the

authorities  concerned. However, in  view  of  the

answer, though not quite satisfactory, I beg leave

to withdraw my amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Amendment (3)+, Mr Ng Kah Ting has

spoken. Amendment (4) , Mr Teong Eng Siong.

(+ See footnote, col. 899)



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1107 be

reduced by $10 in respect of subhead 32*.

(* The same amendment also stood in the names of Messrs Ho Kah Leong and Ng Kah Ting.)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision under this subhead is for urban

and  rural  services. There is no doubt  that  the

Government  has  done much in  looking  after  the

welfare  of the rural people. For many  years  now

the  Government has allocated large sums of  money

for   the  development  of  the  rural  areas   by

providing  facilities  such  as  street  lighting,

water  and  electricity supplies and  so  on.  All

these facilities have led to improving the lot  of

the  people in the rural areas. However, this does

not  mean that all the problems pertaining to  the

rural  areas  have  been solved.  There  is  still

plenty of room for improvement. In view of this, I

feel



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 914</b></font><br><br>



that  the provision of $3.2 million for this  year

is obviously not enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past years large sums of money have

been  allocated for the improvement of  the  rural

areas.  For instance, every year the provision  of

$100,000 to $120,000 was allotted to Sembawang for

the  extension of public facilities. But this year

there  is  a reduction in the provision,  the  sum

voted  being only about $20,000. What  can  we  do

with  this meagre sum of money? In order that  the

various   construction  works  in  the   Sembawang

constituency  can be carried out successfully,  we

should  increase this provision. I  remember  that

during  the  Budget debate last  year,  I  made  a

request that, for the financial year 1973-74,  the

provision for the rural areas should be increased.

The  Minister told me then that he would take note

of  my  request. However, after one year it  seems

that  he  has  forgotten about  this  matter.  The

provision for this subhead is actually the same as

that  for  the last financial year.  There  is  no

increase.   The   sum  is  still  $3.25   million.

Therefore, I will continue to request the Minister

for  Law and National Development to appeal to the

Minister for Finance to pay more attention to  the

interests of the rural people and allot more money

next year for the various development projects  in

the  rural  areas  so that the  rural  people  can

achieve  the same rate of progress and  enjoy  the

same  standard  of living as those  in  the  urban

areas.



<br><br>5.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since the vote for the rural areas has not

been  increased, the provision should be  utilised

to   get  the  maximum  benefit.  We  should  also

encourage the rural people and national servicemen

to  do voluntary work or gotong royong the various

Government projects so as to reduce expenditure. I

will  avail myself of this opportunity and mention

a  gotong  royong project that took place  on  the

10th of March and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 915</b></font><br><br>



which  was  carried out successfully. Two  hundred

national  servicemen  from the  Seletar  and  Ayer

Rajah  Barracks toot part. Hundreds  of  villagers

from  Sembawang  also responded to this  voluntary

road  project. According to the PWD,  the  project

was scheduled to be completed in four days. But it

was  completed  two days ahead of  schedule,  thus

saving a lot of expenditure for the Government.  I

would  also  avail myself of this  opportunity  to

praise  the good performance put up by the 200-odd

national  servicemen  from  the  Ayer  Rajah   and

Seletar  Barracks. I must also thank the villagers

and  the  people  from the community  centres  for

their  help in this project. They have  put  up  a

good  performance. They have saved Government some

money  and  also contributed a great deal  towards

the  good relationship between the ordinary  folks

and  the  soldiers. Therefore, we  must  encourage

this kind of co-operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to say that the distribution of

the   vote  for  the  various  projects   is   not

appropriate. For instance, the provision  for  the

construction of agricultural and kampung roads  is

only  $750,000. This is insufficient. One  of  the

problems   facing   the   rural   areas   is   the

construction  of  roads  and  usually  the  amount

provided is inadequate. The vote for the extension

of  water  supply  is $1.5 million.  Though  water

supply  is very important, I feel that in  certain

areas,  more roads should be constructed. I  would

like  the  Minister to pay attention to  this.  If

there  is  any  surplus  from  the  vote  for  the

extension of water supply, I hope it will be  used

for the building of more roads in the rural areas.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I remind hon. Members that the

guillotine time for this Head is 5.50 p.m.?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a rural

Member  of  Parliament,  I  share  the  sentiments

expressed   by  my  colleague,  the   Member   for

Sembawang.  Members may recall that  this  subject

was  brought up for discussion in this House  last

year. If I remember correctly, the general feeling

then was that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 916</b></font><br><br>



amount  of money provided for the construction  of

roads  was  too little, and we hoped that  in  the

next fiscal year more funds would be allocated  to

meet the pressing demands for the construction  of

roads.  However, to the disappointment of  Members

from the rural constituencies, the amount provided

for  road construction for 1973-74 is the same  as

that  for  1972-73, i.e, only $750,000. When  this

meagre sum is divided and allocated to the various

rural constituencies, each rural constituency will

get not more than $60,000. This sum is usually not

enough  to metal one agricultural road, let  alone

setting  aside  a certain amount  for  repairs  of

existing roads. Although the rural areas have been

shrinking    due    to    industrialisation    and

urbanisation,  there are still  many  rural  areas

where roads, drainage systems and social amenities

have  to  be provided. The rural folks  want  good

roads.  No  road is considered good if it  is  not

metalled.  A  laterite road or even a quarry-waste

road  will not resist wear and tear caused by  the

weather.  Therefore,  it is  subjected  to  damage

every  other year. Sometimes the amount  spent  on

repairs is quite sizable. If we add up the  repair

costs of a road over a period of 10 years, the sum

might  well  be enough to metal a road.  Since  we

have a surplus in our budget, I fail to understand

why  the Government cannot set aside a bigger  sum

of  money  to metal all the rural roads. When  all

the  roads are metalled, the Government only  need

to  spend a small sum for the maintenance  of  the

roads, such as the patching up of pot-holes. So in

the  long  run, it is more economical to  metal  a

road than to repair it every now and then. I would

therefore urge the Parliamentary Secretary to  the

Minister for National Development, who is also the

Chairman   of   the  Urban  and   Rural   Services

Committee, to seriously take note of my suggestion

and recommend a bigger sum for the construction of

roads for 1974-75.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also wish to suggest to the Parliamentary

Secretary  that  the  various projects  should  be

adequately supervised.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 917</b></font><br><br>



Otherwise, through lack of supervision  and

the  poor quality of work of the contractors,  the

project  is  ruined as soon as it is completed.  I

have invited the Parliamentary Secretary to make a

site  visit to Jurong to see for himself the  poor

quality  of work of the contractors. I am thankful

to  him for accepting this invitation. He has seen

for  himself  the  standard of work  done  by  the

contractors.   Sir,   to   repair   the   damages,

additional  expenditure has to be  incurred.  This

is,  therefore,  tantamount to a waste  of  public

funds.  I  would urge the Parliamentary  Secretary

concerned to look into this matter seriously.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I should not

take  more than two minutes. In fact, most of what

I  intend to say have already been well covered by

my   two  good  hon.  Friends,  the  Members   for

Sembawang  and Jurong. I merely wish  to  suggest,

for  the  consideration of the Minister concerned,

that the sum of $3.25 million appropriated for the

seven  items be re-grouped as one block  vote  and

allocate it to meet the more urgent requests, such

as the making up of roads.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that there are revotes for items 03, 04

and  06.  According to my calculation, the revotes

amount  to  $1.2  million. If  these  revotes  are

absorbed,  it  will  amount  to  more  than  $3.25

million.  Therefore, I urge that consideration  be

given to re-group the various allocations for  the

seven  items into one block vote for this  subhead

32.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Hwang. But remember that

the Minister will have less time to answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this debate is very important for a rural Member,

and I would like to thank you for giving me an

opportunity to speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(In Mandarin)</i> Sir, I rise to support the rural

Members of Parliament on the allocation of funds

for the rural areas. Over the past few years, the

Government has done something for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 918</b></font><br><br>



the rural areas. Although the performance has been

quite satisfactory in itself, on the whole, it  is

not adequate enough when compared to the high rate

of  progress  and development in the urban  areas.

The  feeling  is  that the rural areas  are  still

backward.  But if we compare the present  rate  of

development of the rural areas with that of a  few

years ago, it could be excusable, because at  that

time  our economy was such that we came to a stage

when the spirit was willing but the body was weak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jurong has said that with the

buoyant  economy and with a surplus budget,  there

are  favourable conditions for the  Government  to

allocate  more  sums of money for the  improvement

and  progress of the rural areas, particularly  in

regard to the metalling of roads, the construction

of  drains  and  the  provision  of  other  social

amenities so as to make it possible for the  rural

people to enjoy the modern facilities in life.  It

is   therefore   regrettable  to  see   that   the

allocation  for 1973-74 is the same  as  that  for

1972-73.  As was pointed out by the other Members,

it  is  also  my hope that a bigger  sum  will  be

provided  for  1974-75.  Even  if  the  amount  is

doubled it may not be enough.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, Mr Lee. May I remind Members

again that this means less time for the Minister

to answer.



<br><br>5.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  various  rural MPs who have  spoken  on  this

amendment  have requested for more funds  for  the

rural   areas.  This  is  a  matter  of   urgency.

According  to  our past experience,  the  sums  of

money  allotted for the construction of  roads  in

the rural areas were not adequate. In fact, I feel

that  if  we  had  really  understood  the  actual

conditions in rural areas, we would conclude  that

there  had been a wastage of funds. First of  all,

because  the  vote was insufficient, metalling  of

the road had to be done in stages. And if the work

was phased out over a matter of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 919</b></font><br><br>



one or two months it would not be too bad; but the

phasing was done over two to three years. So, if a

road  was  metalled in three phases  over  a  long

period  of  time, then a lot of money  would  have

been  wasted. When the first part of the road  was

metalled,  people were quite happy about  it,  but

the  second  and  other parts  of  the  road  were

difficult  to pass. When the second  part  of  the

road  was metalled, the first part began  to  show

signs  of  damage and in need of repair.  When  it

came to metalling the third part of the road,  the

first  part  of the road would have  gone  into  a

state  of  disrepair.  This is  a  very  difficult

situation. Unless the situation is remedied, a lot

of  money would be wasted. We should allocate more

funds to metal the full stretch of the road all at

the  same time. We must think of the interests  of

the  rural  people.  You can speak  to  the  rural

people,  and they will tell you that although  the

Government has spent a lot of money to develop the

roads in the rural areas, the actual situation  is

such  that throughout the whole year or throughout

their  whole  life, they will not be able  to  set

foot  on  a completely metalled road, and  at  the

very best, the road has been partly metalled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pointing out all these matters with the

main  aim  of supporting the appeals of the  rural

MPs,  that  is, for more funds next year  for  the

rural  areas.  The Government must  consider  this

appeal  very seriously and in all earnestness.  In

that  way, we will not let down the rural  people.

Instead  we  will be able to give  them  a  better

life.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I thank Members for their

support. Somehow I feel that their remarks  should

have  been addressed to a different Ministry.  The

Ministry of National Development, like the Members

themselves,  feels  that  more  money  should   be

allocated  for  projects of  the  URSC.  Even  the

Chairman  of the URSC would be happier if  he  had

much  more  money  to divide between  the  various

constituencies and the various



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 920</b></font><br><br>



projects. Whether it is for water, electrification

or  roads,  we  have to divide this sum  of  $3.25

million  amongst the various projects. If they  do

not  think  that the amount of $750,000 is  enough

for  rural  roads, let me assure them that  though

these  divisions are made for the different items,

money  allocated for, say, water, if unspent,  can

be  used  for roads. And if one constituency  does

not use its funds, as Tanglin last year, the funds

are  re-allocated  to another  constituency.  This

goes  round.  Sometimes  we  spend  more  in   one

constituency than what has been allocated  to  it,

and  in  some  constituencies we spend  less.  The

division is a fair one between the constituencies.

We   divide  into  rural,  sub-rural,   urban   or

suburban. Their ratio of 1: 3 : 5 is multiplied by

population and area. Hence the allocation. As  far

as  is  possible,  the rural areas  get  the  most

money. They grouse that this money is not enough -

I am with them on this, and I thank them for their

support in our efforts to get more money from  the

Ministry of Finance.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,   I   thank  the  Minister  for  giving   the

undertaking to this House, particularly the  rural

MPs, that he will ask the Minister for Finance for

more funds. I hope that with his co-operation, the

rural  constituencies will be  able  to  get  more

funds  next  year for development. On  this  note,

Sir, I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum to be allocated for Head 1108 be

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is an allocation of $2.5 million for

the  construction of the Coastal  Expressway  from

Bedok to the City. This is a very good measure for

the  development of our public road  system.  With

the  completion  of  this  Coastal  Expressway,  I

believe  that the traffic problems and  congestion

in the city and rural areas will be relieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to raise one point of clarification

from the Minister concerned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 922</b></font><br><br>



When   will   work   commence   on   the

construction of the Coastal Expressway,  and  when

will it be completed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the project is divided into

three  phases. Phase I, between Fort Road  at  the

7 1/2 m.s. of Upper East Coast Road, is in progress

and is expected to be completed by the end of next

year.  Phase  II, from Fort Road to  Tanjong  Rhu,

will begin sometime this year, and is expected  to

be  ready  by 1975. Phase III, from the  7 1/2  m.s.

Upper  East  Coast Road to Bedok, will begin  next

year. Completion date is around 1976.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  would  like  to ask two  more  questions.

First,   during   the   three   phases   of    the

construction, how much of the project will  be  on

reclaimed land. Secondly, since the land has  been

reclaimed recently, will it be dangerous  for  the

construction of the road?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, the answer to the second

question  is that it is not dangerous because  the

reclamation  was completed some time ago  and  the

earth  is  given time to settle. As to  the  first

question, the road will run more or less  parallel

to  the  coastline, roughly about 150 feet to  200

feet  from  the seashore. It will not  be  exactly

parallel  to  the  coast because,  as  the  Member

knows, some parts, say, near Tanjong Rhu, are very

narrow  and some parts near Bedok are much  wider.

We intend to keep the stretch of land from Tanjong

Rhu  to Bedok, between the road and the sea coast,

completely green and under shade for the  pleasure

of the Member.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I thank the

clear. I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 923</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is an allocation of $900,000 for the improvement

of Sembawang Road (10 m.s. to 13 m.s.) and Upper Thomson Road.

As a result of this Sembawang Road Improvement, which is in my

constituency, some shops will be affected by clearance. So it is

a matter of grate concern to me. I would like ot ask the Minster

three questions: (1) When will the improvement work commence,

and when is it expected to be completed? (2) For those

shopkeepers whoare affected, what kind of arrangements in their

interest will be made? I hope the Minister concerned will

consider the hardship and difficulties of those affected. The best help is to resettle these people before work on imprvement

commences, so as to alleviate their hardship and losses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.







<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Sepaker, Sir , I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sum be allocated for Head 1108 be reduced by $10 in

respect of subhead 34.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I remember that som hon. Memebers of the House have pointed

out that in some places where pedestrain overhad bridges and

underpasses. Sir, I would like to point out to Members of this

House that whilst Government apportions public

funds for the construction of overhaead pedestrain bridges.

This could mean that pedestrians, instead of making use of

such bridges, simply dash across the roads.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I can best illustrate my point by citing the example

of the overhead pedestrian bridge built near the unction of

Tampines Road and Upper Serangoon Road, where there is a

traffic light. There are several schools in the area, and I

notice that, in the evenings oand sometimes in the mornings,

very few students only seem to want to make use of the

overhead crossing. The others will simply dash across to the

middle of the road, stop short at the divider, and continue

with their hazardous way of crossing the road. Sir, in spite

of the safety-first





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 925</b></font><br><br>



campaigns having been mounted on a number of occasions, and for

which our Minister of State for Education had the privilege to

open, it still does not drive home the importanat point that

Government constructs these overhead bridges and underpasses for

the pedestrains to corss roads safely. Perhaps primary and

secondary schools should be told to encourage their students to

make use of such pedestrain crossings, because during peak hours

traffic is very heavy and it is a danger to their safety if they

do not make use of such crossing.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wonder whether the Minister will look into the

possiblility fo condstructiong some shops along these

underpasses so that it will attarct pedestrains to make use of

them. I have been to  countries overseas where they have shops

along subways and underpasses. I see that  a lot of

pedestrains when they wlak along these subways and

underpasses, do look around. It will not be a dull moment. In

the case of Singaproe, whilst it may be ture that some PWD

engineers may say: "look, in Singapore the ground is a it soft

and water-logged", I think Members will agree that there is a

problem to be looked into. If we are to build unerpasses, it

is up to the engineers and planners to think of ways and means

to overcome such problems and ot merely taking the easy way

out by saying, "All right, we build an overhead bridge.

Whether or not the public makes use of it is not our concern.

If they still want to run across the road instead of using the

overhead crossing ro underpass, that is their fault." No, Sir,

far from it. Because a lot of money has been spent on it, this

matter has been brought up several times in this House.







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Sir, there has been talk about introducing

legislation against jaywalking. Id do nto think that that is a

wise move, because I personally believe in relentless

persuaion, especially in our schools, because our adult

population may not pick up that habit easily, as can be seen

at bus stops where instead of lining up they would





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 926</b></font><br><br>



clamber to get into the bus. This habit has got to be inculcated

in the young. I hope the Minister concerned will give it every

consideraton.









<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, let me first assure the hon. Member for

Punggol that the Ministry of National Development is not

looking for an easy way out. At the request of many MPs,

overhead bridges have been built. Having built the bridges,

if pedestrains refue to use them, my Ministry cannot do

anything except to pass legislation, which the hon. Member

considers undesirable.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the constructin of underpasses, this is very expensive

and can be justified only in very special circumstances, e.g.

under Anderson Bridge leading to Queen Elizabeth Walk. Even if

funds are available, the feasibility of building and underpass

will depend on the location and a number of technincal

factors. Beyong that, Sir, I have nothing further to add,

except that in my view it is desirable to build more overhead

bridges. In fact, we intend to do so because some of out raods

are becoming impasable to pedestrains. For example, if you

want to cross Bukit Timah Road or Dunearn Roads, you only hope

is the pedestrain bridge. And there are many schoools along

both roads which require overhead bridges. If overhead bridges

are used, then the number of accidents along roads over which

these bridges are built will be cut down.









<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> sir, if overhead bridges are used, I see the

justification in expendign public funds. But I would like to

clarify the disagreement of the Minister when I say that maybe

his PWD engineers looked for the easy way out. The easy way

out simply means this. If there is a request for an overhead

pedestrain crossing, then some period of time must be given to

evaluate as to the need to put up the overhead crossing. That

is to say, when such a crossing is put up, pedestrains will

definitely make use of them. But if pedestrians do not make

use of them,









<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 927</b></font><br><br>



there  is nothing more anyone can do about it.

However,  I  quite agree with what else  the  hon.

Minister has said just now, and I do not  wish  to

prolong the argument. On that note, Sir, may I beg

leave to withdraw my amendment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, although the object of the Central Area

Expressway is to relieve traffic congestion and to

make the Central Area more easily accessible,  the

consequence  may  quite possibly adversely  affect

the  urban  environment and the  economic  use  of

space.  With the implementation of this Expressway

and improvement of other existing roads, more cars

would  be  attracted  and expected  to  enter  the

Central  Area.  Unless,  of course,  supplementary

policies     and    measures    are     introduced

simultaneously to effectively control the  vehicle

population in the Central Area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the Minister would also be kind

enough to inform the House whether steps have been

or will be taken soon to formulate policies and to

introduce  measures to discourage and control  the

use of private cars in certain congested parts  of

our city.

<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, may I first thank the Member for

his  suggestions. He has expressed some fears over

which  my Ministry is genuinely concerned. As  for

the  Feasibility and Engineering Study for Central

Area Expressway, this study will be conducted by a

consulting firm, or consortium firms, specialising

in  traffic  engineering, planning or  engineering

economics. The study will be in two phases.  Phase

I  involves the updating of traffic projections to

1982  and 1992, preparation of economic evaluation

of   the  expressway  system,  recommendation   of

alignments and interchange layouts, and comparison

of  alternative  schemes. This  phase  would  take

about  seven  months  to  complete.  Phase  II  is

concerned  with  detailed designs,  specifications

and  estimates,  and  will  take  a  further  nine

months.   The  P.W.D, will  offer  a  counterpart

personnel in this phase.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with or without the proposed expressway,

there  will  be  more cars on the  road  with  the

growth  of  our national economy. The Ministry  of

Finance  has taken steps to increase the taxes  on

cars,  but I doubt whether this will prevent  more

cars  being bought and driven on our roads  unless

the   tax  is  further  raised.  But  I   am   not

encouraging him to do this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that we have to do something about

our  transport and parking problems.  The  parking

policy  will,  in  fact,  be  reviewed  when   the

recommendations of the Mass Rapid  Transit  Study,

now   being   conducted   by   the   Ministry   of

Communications,  are  finalised.   Some   of   the

findings  of this Study will be used as  data  for

the proposed Central Area Expressway Project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other suggestion that cars or even

vehicles should not be allowed into certain  parts

of  the  city, we had tried a pilot scheme to  ask

owners of cars to park in Kallang. All they do  is

to park there at night for different



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 929</b></font><br><br>



purposes! However, the day will come, and  perhaps

it  is  not too far off, when we may have to  stop

traffic from going right to the heart of the city.

But  our people are so used to driving up  to  the

office  and driving up to a restaurant  that  this

will be bound to annoy them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may close with a reference :o the National

Stadium.  If  50,000 or 70,000 people  go  to  the

National  Stadium  for the  opening  of  the  SEAP

Games, it is obvious that everyone cannot drive up

there.  It  is also pretty obvious that the  motor

cars or buses in which they travel will have to be

parked  not  immediately next to the  Stadium  but

perhaps a little further away, in Beach Road or in

the   old  People's  Association  ground.  It   is

physically impossible for everyone to drive up  in

grand  fashion and alight at the entrance  to  the

National Stadium at Kallang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Sir, I would like to thank

the  Minister for his very fine explanation. I beg

leave to withdraw.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
