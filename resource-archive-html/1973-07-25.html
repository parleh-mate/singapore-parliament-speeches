<div align="center"><b>METRICATION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Progress)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Science and Technology

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>

what  progress has been made in the implementation

of   the   metric  system,  and  which  Government

departments  and businesses in the private  sector

have converted to metric.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Minister for Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Science and Technology (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since the White Paper

entitled



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>



"Report  on a Study of the Proposed Conversion  to

the  Metric System in Singapore" was submitted  to

Parliament in November, 1970, we have achieved  as

much  progress  as  we could. On  the  whole,  the

measures  we  have recommended in the White  Paper

have  been  adopted.  The  Metrication  Board  has

concentrated  its initial efforts  in  introducing

metrication   to   Government   departments    and

statutory  bodies.  It  has  more  or  less   been

completed,  and  the  Metrication  Board  is   now

directing  its  attention to the  private  sector,

including the industries and the retail trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the measures which have been adopted for

metrication   is  documentation   by   the   Trade

Division,  the Department of Customs  and  Excise,

and  the  Statistics  Department,  which  requires

traders to declare the goods and have their excise

duties  assessed in metric units. The Post  Office

too is currently operating in metric units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another programme implemented and which has great

impact upon the general public is the introduction

of  metric  units to the various aspects  of  road

transport.   The  Public  Works  Department,   the

Registry  of  Vehicles, the Police Department  and

private  organisations,  such  as  the  Automobile

Association  of Singapore and the National  Safety

First  Council, were all involved in the  planning

of  a  programme  for the smooth  introduction  of

speed limits and distance markers in metric units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, motorists came into contact with

metrication  when  they began  to  buy  petrol  in

litres.  A campaign is currently being planned  in

August  to  make motorists accustomed  to  reading

speed  limits  in kilometres per  hour.  For  this

campaign we are seeking the co-operation of petrol

pump stations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many government departments, fees and charges

for the various services rendered are now based on

metric  units.  The  Public Utilities  Board,  for

example,  now  charges for water in cubic  metres.

Care  has been taken to ensure that these  changes

do  not  result in any increase at the expense  of

the general public.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In departments where technical matters are

involved, the change to metric is a little slower.

But  the Public Works Department, the Housing  and

Development Board, and the Public Utilities  Board

have  all finalised their programmes with a target

date  of  1975,  by which time  they  hope  to  he

completely metricated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of the metrication programme is still in

the  planning  stage. Nevertheless,  packaging  of

paints  in  metric units was introduced  in  July,

1972,   and  the  Metrication  Board  is  likewise

looking   into  similar  conversions   for   other

packaged goods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the construction industry, which is affected

to  a  great extent by the building activities  in

the  private sector, metric conversion  programmes

for  bricks,  various  types  of  tiles,  pre-cast

hollow  blocks,  reinforced steel  bars  and  sawn

timber,  were completed. In all cases  it  is  the

policy  of the Government to give whatever support

it could provide, such as restricting the purchase

of materials for use by the public sector to those

designed in metric.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of the metric units to the

retail  trade, however, will be gradual so as  not

to  cause  the  lay  public  any  undue  hardship.

Moreover,  it  will need time to educate  the  lay

public  on  the  metric system. Nevertheless,  the

sale  of  textiles by the metre was introduced  in

March  1972, on the initiative of the Chambers  of

Commerce  themselves.  This  has  now  become  the

widespread  practice among the larger departmental

stores.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to express  my

congratulations to the Minister for the success he

has   achieved  through  his  department  in   the

implementation of the metric system. The  Minister

just now mentioned the adoption and completion  of

metrication  programmes by various departments.  I

would like to ask the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>



whether  he  is  prepared in the coming  weeks  to

introduce metrication to the taxi services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is, whether the Minister is

aware  that certain retailers have not yet adopted

the metric system. Can the Minister see to it that

retailers  do  not try to cheat  the  public  when

measuring  out  the goods to the public?  If  such

cases  are  found  out,  what  measures  will  the

Minister adopt to deal with such retailers?



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I think I made it

very clear that the general public in Singapore is

not  accustomed  yet to comprehending  the  metric

units  used  either for distances, or weights,  or

for  other  measures. Therefore, it  will  require

time to reinterpret how long is a mile in terms of

kilometres; how heavy is a kilogram in terms of  a

kati,  and  so  on. For this reason,  we  have  no

specific  programme to involve the  conversion  of

taximeters   into  the  metric  system.   However,

sometime in the future, by 1975 or a little  later

we  hope that the passenger as well as taxi driver

will  have  been  used to the metric  system,  and

therefore  it will then be possible to change  the

taxi-meter to the metric system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the retail trade, I do not think it is

possible  to abandon customary measures  so  soon.

Amahs  and  housewives who go to market  are  more

accustomed to buying goods in terms of  katis  and

tahils.  It will be very foolish of us if we  were

to   insist  on  an  immediate  change  of   their

purchases  to the kilogram when they do  not  know

how  many kilograms are equal to a kati. It is  in

this  transitional period that we have to exercise

extreme  caution;  otherwise  we  will  find  that

retailers  will  make use of this  opportunity  to

exploit  housewives and consumers. Hence, we  have

deliberately said in the White Paper that  as  far

as  the  private sector is concerned, particularly

in  the  retail  trade area, we will  go  slow  on

metrication until the people of Singapore are more

educated in the metric system.

<div align="center"><b>COMPENSATIONS FOR RESETTLEMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Request for increase)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National  Development, in view of the rising  cost

of   living,  if  the  Government  will   consider

increasing  the  rate  of ex-gratia  compensations

payable   to   eligible   families   affected   by

resettlement.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the rising cost of

living was taken into consideration when the  rate

of  ex-gratia compensation for people affected  by

resettlement  was substantially  increased  by  as

much  as  over  100  per cent in  July  1971.  The

resettlement policy is under constant  review.  At

present  a committee is studying the position  and

is  expected  to make its recommendations  to  the

Government soon.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  Minister  has  said  that   a

committee  will  submit  its  suggestions  to  the

Government.  I wish to ask the Minister  how  soon

will  it be? As far as I know, the farmers do  not

have  enough  funds  to build  their  new  houses.

Therefore, will the Minister be able to give  more

compensations as soon as possible?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I expect the committee to submit

its  report  within  a  week's  time,  when  their

recommendations  will he made to  the  Government.

Whether   or  not  the  committee  will  recommend

increased  rates, I do not know. I  will  have  to

wait for one week.

<div align="center"><b>FARMERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Subsidy for sanitary amenities)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for Law and

National   Development  if  the  Government   will

consider  subsidising the small farmers,  who  are

financially weak, in the construction of  sanitary

amenities according to required specifications, so

that pollution of water



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>



sources can be prevented and the farmers can still

carry on their means of livehood.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, in an open economy like

Singapore's,  with no hinterland,  the  Government

cannot  subsidise  any particular  sector  of  the

economy. Small farmers should get together to form

more  efficient farming units, by sharing the cost

of  sanitary  amenities in order to prevent  water

pollution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large scale pig farming is also more efficient,

as it reduces overheads, that is to say, by buying

animal  feed  in bulk, employing less  workers  to

look   after   pigs,  lower  cost  of   veterinary

services, and other economies of scale, which have

made the big scale pig farmers more prosperous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small scale farming must lose out to more

efficient  large  scale  farming.  So  the   small

farmers  must either get together or face  unequal

competition  and  be relentlessly  on  the  losing

side.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

the  Minister  said  in  his  reply  that  it   is

advisable for small farmers to gang up together to

pay  for  all these sanitary facilities.  I  would

like  to  inform  the  Minister  that  because  of

geographical  and other reasons, it is  impossible

for  small farmers to form larger units.  I  would

like to ask the Minister whether he is prepared to

set  up  a  committee to look into the  matter  of

reducing the difficulties of these small farmers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, in connection with the

Kranji/Pandan Reservoir, a committee has, in fact,

been  set  up about three months ago to look  into

the  problems of farmers who will be  affected  by

this  scheme. This committee comprises some  high-ranking  civil servants from my Ministry  and  the

Ministry  of the Environment, and it is headed  by

the   Minister   of  State  for  the  Environment.

However,  the  committee  has  not  completed  its

investigations and deliberations; but I expect  to

receive another report soon. By "soon", I  do  not

mean  next week; it will probably take a month  or

two.

<div align="center"><b>JURONG TOWN REGISTRATION FOR PRIMARY I ADMISSIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Proximity to homes for resident children)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for

Education  what steps the Government  proposes  to

take to ensure that children living in Jurong Town

and   registered  for  admission  to  Primary  One

classes in 1974 will not be placed in schools  far

away from Jurong Town.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Dr Lee Chiaw Meng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the actual number of children who

have  registered for Primary I classes  in  Jurong

for  1974  will  not  he known until  the  current

registration  exercise  is  completed  in  August.

There   are  more  than  1,200  Primary  I  places

available  in  Jurong area,  and  this  figure  is

estimated   to   be   sufficient   to   meet   the

requirements  of  the  residents  there.  However,

should  there be a further demand, some classrooms

in  the  new  secondary school can be  temporarily

utilised  to  accommodate the  extra  requirements

until  the  new  primary school  for  Jurong  Town

Neighbourhood  II  is ready in  the  beginning  of

1975.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like

to  ask  whether  the secondary school  in  Jurong

could be completed by the end of this year so that

from next year onwards it will be able to take  in

new students.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Chiaw Meng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Chiaw Meng:</b> Yes, Mr Speaker.

<div align="center"><b>APPLICATIONS FOR SINGAPORE CITIZENSHIP</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b> asked the Minister for

Health  and Home Affairs how many persons  applied

for  Singapore citizenship during the  year  ended

28th  February, 1973; how many of the applications

were approved; and how many of them were rejected,

and the reasons therefor.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health and Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Home Affairs (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the total number of

applications  received under all Articles  of  the

Constitution during the year ending 28th February,

1973   was   9,068.  The  number  of  applications

approved  and rejected during the same period  was

3,572 and 139 respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for refusal include the following:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) residentially not qualified;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) failed National Language test;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) character defects;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) of no economic benefit;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) no family roots in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (in Mandarin):</b> Sir, I would

like to ask a supplementary question. What is  the

meaning of "no family roots in Singapore"?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it means what

it  says.  To explain further, if the  Member  for

Sembawang has not understood it, it means that the

applicant  is the only person here, and, that  he

has not got a wife, children, brothers and sisters

who are Singapore citizens.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, may I

know   whether   the  Minister   will   allow   an

applicant's wife and children who are residing  in

other  countries to come and join  him  so  as  to

enable him to apply for citizenship?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, the answer is no, because

he  must  first  have  residential  qualifications

before he can apply for citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, assuming the applicant has

got  residential qualifications, hut  because  his

family  has been staying in other countries,  then

the  Government could use the reason  against  the

applicant,  in  which  case  he  will  never   get

citizenship. Is it not so?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a

hypothetical    question    based    on    certain

assumptions. I would rather prefer the Member  for

Bras  Basah to quote a specific case, when  I  can

deal  with it on its own merits. But having got  a

general question, I will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>



give  a  general answer. The point is this.  If  a

person  is residentially qualified, of course,  he

can   apply.  But  whether  he  will  be   granted

citizenship is another matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy (Telok Blangah):</b> Sir, should

one  have a family to be a citizen? What about the

case of a confirmed bachelor?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I do not know what is the

motive   behind  that  question;  of  course,   we

encourage  only two children per family.  However,

when I say "family roots", I do not only mean wife

and  children,  but  also  brothers  and  sisters,

mother, father, uncles, and so on.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, are we going to deprive a

single  person  of citizenship if he  has  got  no

parents, or no children?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not a

question of deprivation of citizenship.  It  is  a

question of a person applying for citizenship.  If

him of citizenship?



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, assuming a

person   has   got  all  the  qualifications   for

citizenship, can the Minister tell us  whether  or

not he will be granted citizenship?

he will be granted citizenship.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since so

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have

already  said  that if a Member has  any  specific

case in view, he can bring it to my attention  and

I  will consider it on its merits. I do not  think

it  is  helpful  to make a general statement  that

certain applications have been rejected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I am not

satisfied  with one of the reasons  given  by  the

Minister. I hope



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>



the  Minister will reconsider the reason.  At  the

moment  we are encouraging small families.  We  do

not  encourage  more  than  two  children  in  the

family.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Teong, are you asking a

supplementary question, or are you entering into a

debate on this subject?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Therefore, we

should  consider giving citizenship to  bachelors.

Otherwise,  it seems that we are encouraging  them

to marry and to have many children.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, I am here to answer

the Member for Sembawang.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would  like  to take this opportunity to  ask  the

criteria  adopted  in  deciding  on  the  economic

benefit of an applicant.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there has

been   a  change.  If  the  Member  could  recall,

recently there was a statement by the Ministry  of

Labour  to  the  effect that  applicants  who  are

skilled    workmen   and   can    add    to    our

industrialisation effort, and if they could pass a

trade  test  and  possess the 10-year  residential

qualification,  they would be granted  citizenship straightaway.

checks  and raids. The Marine Police also  keep  a

lookout  for suspicious-looking vessels trying  to

sneak  in with illegal immigrants. Members of  the

Police  Force  who  are on  beat  duty  carry  out

frequent checks on suspicious-looking persons  who

may  have  entered  Singapore illegally.  Further,

Immigration  and Police Officers conduct  surprise

illegal  immigrants are detained,  prosecuted  and

removed after serving their sentences.

illegally  can  be  imprisoned  for  a  term   not

exceeding  one  year or fined  up  to  a  sum  not

exceeding $4,000, or to both such imprisonment and

and  fined  up  to  $4,000.  These  penalties  are

inadequate especially for traffickers who prey  on

these illegal immigrants. The Immigration Act will

be  amended to increase the penalties for  illegal

immigrants  and  especially for  traffickers,  who

could be punished by caning as a deterrent against

making    money   out   of   encouraging   illegal

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 2 of the Bill seeks to

amend  section  16  of  the National  Productivity

Board Act to provide for the accounts of the Board

to  be  audited by the Auditor-General  or  by  an

auditor  appointed  annually by  the  Minister  in

consultation  with  the  Auditor-General.  Besides

spelling  out the powers of the auditor,  it  also

<div align="center"><b>EMPLOYMENT (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.05 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during the legislative reform of

1968,  certain  management rights  and  functions,

including  the  right  to  hire  and  fire,   were

restored to employers. Generally, employers have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>



proved  worthy of the trust placed upon  them  and

have  exercised the powers restored to them  in  a

fair  and  responsible manner. There are, however,

some irresponsible employers who are abusing these

powers by dismissing employees without just  cause

or  excuse.  Where  the  dismissed  employees  are

represented by trade unions, adequate  redress  is

provided under the Industrial Relations Act  which

empowers  the  Minister to order reinstatement  or

payment of compensation if, after due inquiry,  he

is  of  the opinion that the dismissal was without

just  cause  or excuse. Such redress, however,  is

not  available  to  non-unionised  employees.   At

present, all that the Commissioner for Labour  can

do  is  to  order the employer to pay a salary  in

lieu  of  notice  of termination  which  can  only

amount  to  a maximum of four weeks' pay depending

on   the   length  of  service  of  the   employee

concerned. This is clearly no deterrent  to  those

employers  bent on maximising profits without  any

regard for the well being of their employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members will no doubt agree with me that  a

non-unionised  employee is  as  much  entitled  to

protection   against  unjust  dismissal   as   his

unionised  counterpart.  Clause  2  of  the  Bill,

therefore, seeks to provide that where an employee

has  been  dismissed by his employer on ground  of

misconduct,  he has a right to refer his  case  to

the  Minister  if his dismissal was wrongful.  The

Minister   will   be  empowered   to   order   the

reinstatement  of the employee  or  to  order  the

employer   to  pay  compensation  if,  after   due

inquiry,  he  is satisfied that the dismissal  was

wrongful.  Responsible  and fair-minded  employers

will  have  nothing to fear, as the  amendment  is

directed against the irresponsible amongst them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is also a need to prevent

exploitation   of  children  and  young   persons,

especially  in  the  context  of  a  tight  labour

market. Presently, a person who employs a child or

young person without a Certificate of Registration

issued  by  the  Commissioner or contrary  to  the

conditions  set  out  in the certificate  may,  on

conviction, be fined a sum not exceeding  $500  or

sentenced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>



to  imprisonment  for  a term  not  exceeding  six

months  or  both. As imprisonment has  never  been

imposed by the Court, the maximum penalty of  $500

is, therefore, not sufficiently deterrent and,  of

late,  there is a growing tendency among employers

to  engage children and young persons to  work  in

factories and other industrial establishments with

scant  regard for their safety and health  at  the

work  place.  Members  will agree  with  me  that,

notwithstanding  the requirements  of  industries,

our   obligation  must  be  to  ensure  that  high

standards   of  health  and  safety   prevail   in

establishments   employing  children   and   young

persons.  Since  employers must be  deterred  from

employing  young workers without regard for  their

health  and  safety,  the  maximum  fine  will  be

increased from $500 to $2,000 by clause 7  of  the

Bill.  Also, where a child or young person suffers

serious   injury   or   death   arising   from   a

contravention of the provisions of the  Employment

Act,  the Court shall, upon the coming into  force

of this Bill, impose a mandatory fine of $2,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last October, my colleague, the Minister for

Health,  outlined in his Ministerial Statement  in

Parliament  the measures to be taken to  encourage

family  planning. One of these measures calls  for

the   curtailment  of  paid  maternity  leave  for

employees  in both the public and private  sectors

from  three  to two confinements with effect  from

1st  August this year. For employees in the public

sector,  appropriate amendments to the Instruction

Manuals have been made by the Ministry of Finance.

As  for the private sector, clause 19 of this Bill

seeks  to provide that a female employee will  not

be  entitled  to any pay when she absents  herself

from  work during a confinement if at the time  of

confinement   she  has  two  or   more   surviving

children.  This  clause also  supersedes  whatever

agreement that may be provided under any  existing

collective agreements insofar as they provide  for

better or more favourable maternity benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, three compensatory aspects of

clause 19 which deserve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>



special  mention. Firstly, maternity  benefits  as

provided  under  Part X of the Act  are  presently

only applicable to female workmen. These statutory

entitlements will now he extended by clause 19  to

all  female employees. This amendment ensures that

all female employees will be well taken care of up

to  two  confinements,  thereby  safeguarding  the

health of both mother and child.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the present Act provides that a female

workman  is entitled to paid maternity leave  four

weeks before and four weeks after her confinement.

If  she  gives birth prematurely, i.e, before  the

estimated date of delivery, she will not  be  able

to  enjoy  the four weeks of paid maternity  leave

before  her confinement. This will now be  amended

by  clause 19 which provides that where  a  female

employee has worked in her employment for any  day

during the period of four weeks immediately before

her confinement, she shall be entitled to receive,

in  addition to her ordinary rate of pay for  that

day,  an  amount equivalent to a day's pay  or  to

absent herself from work on another day at the end

of  her  benefit  period. In  other  words,  every

female  employee is entitled to the full maternity

leave of eight weeks or pay in lieu of any portion

of such leave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the present Act provides that a female

workman   will  forfeit  in  toto  her   maternity

benefits  if  she fails to give proper  notice  of

confinement to her employer. This is unduly  harsh

especially where failure to give notice is due  to

genuine ignorance of the legal requirement on  the

part  of the female workman concerned. Clause  19,

therefore,  seeks to provide that where  a  female

employee   fails   to  give   proper   notice   of

confinement  to her employer, she  will  still  he

entitled to one half of the maternity benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I read with considerable interest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>



the Employment (Amendment) Bill. I am particularly

interested in clause 2 of the Bill. To begin with,

this clause seeks to introduce a form of procedure

whereby  a  worker  or  an  employee  within   the

definition   of   the  original   Act   may   seek

reinstatement in his former employment if  he  can

satisfy  the  Minister that he has been  dismissed

from  service without just cause or excuse by  his

employer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as the Minister has pointed out, a similar

procedure  is  found  in section  35  (2)  of  the

Industrial Relations Act. The only difference,  of

course,  under  section 35 (2) of  the  Industrial

Relations  Act, is that a worker who is  aggrieved

by  his  dismissal  must  make  representation  in

writing to the Minister through his union, whereas

under the provisions of the proposed amendment  to

the  Employment Act he need not he a member  of  a

union.  We,  in the NTUC, have in the past  always

regarded  a  worker,  who  is  eligible  to   seek

membership  in  the  union but who  refrains  from

joining a union, as a parasite in our society.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, from our point of view, the proposed

procedure   in   clause   2   of   the   Bill   is

objectionable. You will agree with me,  Sir,  that

in  legislating  matters which  are  interrelated,

there   should  be  some  uniformity.   Both   the

Employment  Act and the Industrial  Relations  Act

are    pieces   of   legislation   governing   the

relationship   between  the   employer   and   the

employee.  I  do hope that clause 2 of  the  Bill,

which   introduces  a  new  section  14   in   the

Employment Act, could he amended at page 2,  lines

7   and  8  of  the  Bill,  to  ensure  that   any

representation  to the Minister for  reinstatement

arising from a wrongful dismissal can be made only

through a union and not otherwise. However,  I  do

realise  that it may be desirable to make suitable

provisions   in   exceptional   cases,   such   as

dismissals of a prospective union member  who  may

be  engaged in organising workers in his place  of

employment  or in cases where recognition  of  the

union  is  withheld by the employer  for  lack  of

majority.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture, Sir, it would be relevant for

me  to draw the attention of the House to the need

to  consider introducing a clear and definite form

of  procedure  in dealing with the merits  of  the

representation  for  reinstatement.  However,   to

understand  and  appreciate what  I  am  about  to

propose,  one has to go back to the year 1965.  At

the   end   of  that  year,  Sir,  the  Industrial

Relations  (Amendment) Act, 1965, was passed.  One

of  the most important amendments was the granting

of  specific  powers to the Industrial Arbitration

Court  to  order the reinstatement of a  dismissed

employee.  This power was removed  in  1968  by  a

further amendment to the Industrial Relations Act.

And  now, Sir, only in cases of victimisation does

the Court have the power to reinstate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the restrictions placed on the

Court's  power to deal with dismissal  cases,  the

only  remedy  available in the  case  of  wrongful

dismissal is that provided under section 35 (2) of

the  Industrial Relations Act. In the early stages

following  the amendment in 1968, a few  inquiries

were  held  at  the  Labour Court  in  the  Labour

Ministry,  presided over by an  officer  appointed

for  that  purpose. Witnesses were allowed  to  be

called  by both parties and could testify  at  the

inquiry. To some extent the proceedings at such an

inquiry, though informal, were well regulated  and

were quite satisfactory. For the past three years,

however,  no inquiries of such a nature have  been

held.  Instead, when representation  is  made  for

reinstatement, Labour Ministry officials call  for

the    parties   separately   and    make    their

recommendations   thereafter.   In   trade   union

circles,   dismissal  as  a  form  of  punishment,

especially  to a worker who has put in many  years

of service, is analogous to a death sentence as it

is  the  supreme form of punishment. Nor shall  we

confine our attention only to the dismissed worker

who may well be either the sole breadwinner or the

main  provider in his family. So, Mr Speaker, Sir,

by  one  injudicious act an employer  can  inflict

punishment on a group of innocent persons. It  is,

therefore, necessary for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>



us when dealing with dismissal cases to extend our

consideration to the family unit as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to deal with the

relevant  provisions in clause 2. In the  proposed

section  14  (1) (b), the employer  is  given  the

right  to  suspend  a  worker without  payment  of

salary  for a period not exceeding one week.  This

is  a re-enactment of the existing provision. From

experience,  Sir, very few employers  observe  the

provision  to suspend a worker for one week.  What

they  normally do is to hold an inquiry  of  their

own.  They  make  their own investigation  without

giving  an opportunity to the suspended worker  to

explain   or   to   counter  the  allegations   of

misconduct.   In  some  cases,  Sir,   where   the

investigation cannot be completed within  a  week,

the   employers  invariably  proceed  to  dismiss,

believing, rightly or wrongly, that if they do not

dismiss  after one week they might lose the  right

to  dismiss.  Even more disturbing,  Sir,  is  the

possibility  that the employer, being  engaged  in

more  urgent  business, may not be  able  to  take

prompt steps to investigate into the alleged  acts

of  misconduct, and when he finds that the week is

coming to an end through his neglect to take steps

promptly,  he will proceed to dismiss. In  matters

of this nature, Sir, it is desirable to extend the

time  where the case requires it. I would  suggest

that  the suspension period for the purpose of  an

inquiry  be one week initially, during  which  the

employee  is  paid  half  his  salary,  with   the

possible  extension  of  a  further  week  on  one

quarter of his salary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have criticised the procedure adopted by

employers  by  holding inquiries in  the  form  of

private  investigation without  the  worker  being

given  a  chance  to explain. We have  found  that

there are always two versions to a story. In  such

an  important matter as dismissal, there can be no

justice   unless   the   worker,   against    whom

allegations  of misconduct are made,  is  given  a

fair  opportunity to state his case. In  addition,

he  must  be allowed to be represented by a  union

representative of his own choice and be allowed to

contest the testimony of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>



persons  who have made statements against him.  In

other  words,  we consider that  it  is  not  only

desirable but necessary that an employee,  against

whom allegations of misconduct are made, should be

given  the chance to confront witnesses  from  the

management  side who have made statements  against

him. I suggest, Sir, that the worker must also  he

given  the  opportunity to call any  witnesses  he

considers  necessary  to testify  on  his  behalf.

Justice, Sir, must not only be done but also  seen

to be done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggested procedure, as mentioned by me

earlier,   is  particularly  necessary   following

representations to the Minister for  reinstatement

following a wrongful dismissal. I observe that the

Commissioner for Labour will he entrusted with the

duty to inquire into the dismissal and to make the

necessary  report to the Minister.  The  suggested

procedure  I mentioned earlier should he  followed

each   time  the  Commissioner  carries   out   an

investigation  into a dismissal case  referred  to

him  by the Minister. The present procedure  under

the  industrial  Relations Act - that  of  meeting

union      representatives     and      management

representatives  separately  has  proved   to   be

unsatisfactory. If this procedure  is  allowed  to

continue, the confidence of workers in the  Labour

Ministry  will  be  shaken. And if  confidence  is

shaken, it is not likely for the workers to  refer

their  grievances, especially in dismissal  cases,

to  the Labour Ministry. In the ultimate, it  will

lead to a situation which the House can imagine  -

how  much  industrial unrest  it  will  cause!  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  1  am sure that that  is  not  the

intention of this legislation, and I urge that the

most  serious consideration be given to the points

I have raised.

is  that  employers have the right to promote,  to

transfer,  to  reorganise,  to  dismiss,   or   to

retrench their employees. At that time the workers

accepted  these  restrictions so  as  to  help  to

create  a  good climate for investors to  come  to

Singapore, and thereby provide employment for  our

people.  Since  1968 Singapore has  been  enjoying

industrial peace and today we are experiencing  an

economic boom with full employment. I am proud  to

say  that,  with  the guidance  of  the  NTUC  and

various  trade  union  leaders,  the  workers   in

Singapore have conducted themselves very well  and

have maintained the continuity of industrial peace

which,  of  course, helps to preserve the  present

political and economic stability. The workers  and

the union leaders have acted in a very intelligent

and  reasonable  way  towards the  employers  when

dealing  with  the  various  industrial  disputes.

Unfortunately,   some   stupid   and    unreckoned

employers  mistook our reasonableness  to  be  our

weakness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a limit to everything. If employers

still  continue to take advantage  of  the  labour

laws  by  dismissing and retrenching  workers  and

union  leaders and to subtly victimise them so  as

to  weaken  the strength and unity  of  the  trade

union movement, then I suggest that the employers'

right  to dismiss and to retrench employees should

be  taken  away from the Employment  Act  and  the

Industrial  Relations Act. Why should the  workers

be  made to suffer and to sacrifice all the  time?

Sir,  I  would like to read part of the  editorial

from  the  Labour News of July 1973, published  by

SILO  and  PIEU, expressing concern over employers

retrenching employees in order to cow the  workers

from  becoming  union leaders and  to  weaken  the

union. I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Recent events showed that the hidden sharp point

of  the  instrument  of retrenchment  is  used  by

employers   to   get   rid  of  branch   committee

officials;  in  a few instances, the  retrenchment

exercises  have  knifed off as many  as  half  the

total number of branch committee officials. In the

first  place,  such  retrenchment  exercises  are,

basically, for the purpose of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>



breaking up the branch committees and to make them

impotent. In the second place, they are  meant  to

cow  other  workers  from offering  themselves  to

stand   for  election  or  appointment  to  branch

committees; and what is even more serious  is  the

real  intention of the employers, and that is,  to

break  the  faith and confidence of the  rank  and

file members in the trade union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would ask the Labour Ministry and the NTUC to

make  a  close scrutiny of management's rights  of

retrenchment  which, in practice,  can  camouflage

other  insidious intentions, and we  hope  to  see

positive results ensuing.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the fact that some employers are

taking  advantage of the labour laws  against  the

workers  and union leaders by retrenching them  so

as  to  weaken the union, I would suggest  to  the

Minister  for  Labour to deprive the employers  of

the  right to dismiss or retrench their employees.

The   employers  must  negotiate  with  the  union

leaders  before  any dismissal or retrenchment  of

any  employees.  In  fairness to  the  workers,  I

suggest that the Employment Act and the Industrial

Relations  Act should be amended so that employers

have  no right to dismiss or retrench any employee

unless they negotiate with the union.



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chin Harn Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chin Harn Tong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to comment on three provisions in the Bill to

amend the Employment Act. The provisions relate to

the  amendment  of sections 14 and  38  and  Parts

VIII, IX and X of the Employment Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to make it clear right from the

very  beginning that I am wholly in favour of  the

proposed   amendments.  Some   of   the   proposed

provisions,  however, do not seem  to  have  fully

dealt  with  every  aspect of  the  matters  under

amendment; and it is with regard to some of  these

aspects that I wish to seek clarification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of clause 2 of the Bill, touching

upon   section  14  of  the  Employment  Act,   is

apparently to bring the Employment Act  into  line

with the Industrial Relations Act, as the proposed

provisions  are  substantially  the  same  as  the

corresponding provisions in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>



section 35 of the Industrial Relations Act.  I  am

inclined  to  agree that there is a need  for  the

proposed  provisions.  Under  Part  XVI   of   the

Employment Act, a machinery has been provided  for

the   Commissioner  of  Labour  to  inquire   into

disputes  between  employers and their  employees.

But  if,  in  the  process of  so  inquiring,  the

Commissioner  is  convinced that an  employee  has

been  dismissed without just cause or excuse,  the

only remedy the Commissioner is empowered to apply

to  the  wrongfully dismissed employee is monetary

compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any sum of money, of course, is useful when a

person  is out of work but is no compensation  for

the loss of a steady career, for which he may have

already  spent  half  his  working  life.  It  is,

therefore,  only  fair  and  equitable   that   an

employee  who  has  been found  to  be  wrongfully

dismissed  should be allowed to have his  old  job

back,   wherever   possible.   Reinstatement    in

employment is, however, a statutory remedy and  up

to  now the Minister has the power to reinstate  a

person   in   his   former  employment   only   if

proceedings  for  such  reinstatement  have   been

initiated   through  a  trade  union   under   the

Industrial Relations Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In giving my support to the proposal to

incorporate into the Employment Act the  power  of

reinstatement  by the Minister, I am  particularly

struck by two aspects of the proposal. One is that

any   employee   who  considers  himself   to   be

wrongfully dismissed may apply to the Minister for

reinstatement regardless of whether or not he is a

member  of  a trade union which has been  accorded

recognition by the employer. The other is that the

Minister  may  have  recourse  to  the  well-tried

machinery  of the Labour Court for the purpose  of

ascertaining  the  facts of any  dismissal  before

making a decision thereon.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my humble opinion, however, that the

proposed  provisions  may be strengthened  in  the

interest of employees. I wish to suggest that  the

proposed  section  14 (2) of  the  Employment  Act

should  have  the words "whether with  or  without

notice" to qualify any dismissal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>



in  respect of which the Minister may be requested

to  intervene. It must not be forgotten that under

the  Employment Act, a notice of not more than two

weeks  is required for the termination of  service

of an employee with less than five years' service.

An employer would have to be exceedingly foolhardy

to  refuse  to  give such two weeks' notice  which

would free him from any anxiety in relation to the

proposed provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of clauses 4 to 18 of the Bill,

dealing  with Parts VIII and IX of the  Employment

Act, apparently seeks to strengthen the provisions

safeguarding    young    children    from    undue

exploitation by unscrupulous employers. Of late it

has become increasingly noticeable that employers,

with  bank  statements for their conscience,  have

been  engaging children of tender years at a small

wage  to  perform work which is unsuited to  their

capacity  and which taxes their physical  strength

beyond  endurance and reason. For such  employers,

of  course,  the attraction of employing  children

lies  in the fact that the children are too  young

to know better or to be able to fight for a better

deal.  The  savings  that  can  be  had  by   such

employers through evading their liabilities  under

the  Employment Act and the Central Provident Fund

Act arc tremendous, but they make a mockery of all

the  statutory provisions enacted or  approved  by

this House for the benefit of workers in general

and   the   protection  of  young   children,   in

particular.  The  proposed provisions,  therefore,

meet an urgent and grave need in that they will be

a  greater  and  more effective deterrent  against

improper employment of young children,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 of the Bill, amending the whole of Part

X  of  the Employment Act, seeks to remove a  long

outstanding  anomaly  in the statutory  provisions

governing  the terms and conditions of workers  in

Singapore. I should think that the removal of such

an  anomaly is long overdue. Up to now only female

workmen  are  statutorily entitled  to  have  paid

maternity leave during their confinement, that is,

one month before and one month after. On the other

hand,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>



other female employees, who are non-workmen,  such

as  clerks, shop assistants, teachers and typists,

are  not statutorily entitled to one single  day's

paid  maternity  leave during  their  confinement.

What  has  made  the situation more tolerable  for

female  employees as a whole is that trade  unions

have   secured  paid  maternity  leave  for  their

members and have incorporated such benefit into  a

collective   agreement,   and   that   enlightened

employers such as the Government and the Statutory

Board  have granted paid maternity leave to  their

female  employees despite the strange omission  in

the  Employment Act. Nonetheless, there is a  real

need  for  the  proposed amendment  as  individual

female employees, who arc non-workmen engaged by a

firm in the private sector without the benefit  of

representation  by a trade union, would  otherwise

have  no  cause  for complaint if their  employers

refuse to grant them paid maternity leave.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the restriction of paid maternity leave

only  to  female employees with not more than  two

living children, I agree that such restriction  is

rational   in  accordance  with  the  Government's

avowed  policy or restricting the size of families

in Singapore. Since the ideal size of a family has

been widely and recently mooted as that consisting

of  the  two  parents  themselves  and  their  two

children,  it makes sense not to offer  incentives

for employees to have more than two children.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Bill.



<br><br>3.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (in Mandarin):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the introduction of this amendment Bill  is,

in  my opinion, very timely in the present context

of  Singapore. These amendments will  ensure  that

our  workers will have better care and  protection

of  the  law.  This  is  a  progressive  piece  of

legislation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it cannot be denied that in the past few

years  industrial  relations  in  Singapore   have

improved  considerably. The number of strikes  has

been reduced



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>



visibly  and  most, if not all, of the  industrial

disputes have been referred to the Labour Ministry

or the Industrial Arbitration Court for reasonable

or  peaceful settlement. This is something that is

very encouraging.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this amendment Bill there are also provisions

which  are favourable to the workers, particularly

the   female  employees.  There  is  a   clear-cut

provision  in  the law to ensure that  all  female

employees in Singapore will enjoy equal rights. Of

course,  I  am  referring to the  maternity  leave

benefits  which will be extended from  the  female

workmen  to  all female employees.  This  is  only

right  and proper, because more and more women  in

entering  the  labour market are  engaged  in  the

factories. According to my estimate, about 30  per

cent of the workers in Singapore are female. So it

is  only  reasonable  that  all  female  employees

should enjoy the same rights and benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, several Members of the House

have spoken on this Bill. They have touched on the

question  of  wrongful dismissal  and  the  remedy

available to workers who are wrongfully dismissed.

They  have  suggested that there should be  proper

inquiries to ascertain whether a worker  has  been

wrongfully  dismissed, and, if so, to ensure  that

such a worker is reinstated. But it is not easy to

find  out  whether  a worker has  been  wrongfully

dismissed  or  not.  In my view  the  Ministry  of

Labour, which is now suffering from a shortage  of

staff,   will   find  it  difficult   to   conduct

comprehensive  inquiries  into  such  cases.   The

Ministry  of  Labour must have adequate  staff  to

ensure that proper inquiries are conducted, before

they  can submit their report to the Minister.  If

there  is  shortage of staff in  the  Ministry  of

Labour, delay is inevitable or the inquiry may  be

inadequate. This may result in the worker  who  is

wrongfully dismissed not being able to  enjoy  the

full protection of the law, and thereby could lose

his  employment  because of such  inadequacies.  I

would   therefore  like  to  remind  the  Minister

concerned that more officers should be engaged  to

conduct these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>



inquiries  to  ensure effective implementation  of

the provisions in the Act.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, all the

arguments  put  forward by the Members  for  Telok

Blangah  and  Bukit  Ho Swee had  been  gone  into

thoroughly in 1968 when the present Employment Act

was  passed  in this House. Therefore,  I  do  not

propose to repeat the arguments put forward by the

Government then, as I think the various points  of

view have been fully aired both inside and outside

this Parliament. Suffice it to say, as a result of

the  passing of the Employment Act in 1968,  there

has  been rapid economic development and  we  have

been  able to attract investments to this  country

and  to solve what was at one time regarded as the

insoluble  problem of unemployment  in  Singapore.

Today,  we  need to have a favourable climate  for

economic development. We also need investments  as

much as in 1968. For these reasons, the Employment

Act will have to remain with us for a long time to

come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there have been criticisms against the

shortcomings  of the Employment Act,  nevertheless

in   the   overall  interest  of  rapid   economic

development  and  in the overall interest  of  our

people, we cannot disband overnight the Employment

Act  which was introduced in 1968. What we can  do

is  to  ensure that the kind of situations brought

up  by the Members for Telok Blangah and Bukit  Ho

Swee  will be prevented or rectified whenever they

occur.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah has objected to the

provision whereby a non-unionised worker can  make

representation  to  the  Minister   for   wrongful

dismissal.  I am rather surprised that the  Member

for  Telok  Blangah should adopt  such  a  selfish

attitude. I think a non-unionised worker should be

entitled -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Govindasamy, will you let the Minister explain first?



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I wish to correct the misunderstanding that the Minister has conceived.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Sir, I have never said that

all  non-unionised workers should be left  out  of

that  provision.  Perhaps  the  Minister  was  not

listening. Let me repeat and quote the exact  text

of what I have said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We in the NTUC have in the past always regarded

a  worker,  who is eligible to seek membership  in

the union but who refrains from joining the union,

as a parasite to our society.'



<br><br>These  are the people I want to be kept  out;  not any employee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> In other words, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  he  has admitted that there are sections  of

workers  which cannot be unionised, and  therefore

they  need  the protection of this provision.  For

instance,  domestic servants and the large  number

of  construction workers, contract workers, and so

on.  Obviously  they need the protection  of  this

provision in the Amendment Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Telok Blangah has dealt at

length  with  the procedure under  the  Industrial

Relations   Act   regarding   representations   of

wrongful dismissal. Under the provision of section

35  (2)  of  the Industrial Relations Act,  if  an

employee  considers  that he  has  been  dismissed

without  just cause or excuse by his employer,  he

may  make representation through his union to  the

Minister for reinstatement. The representation  is

first  referred  to  the  Industrial  Relations

Section to be dealt with on a conciliation  basis,

and the employer concerned is asked to furnish  in

writing  the circumstances leading to, and grounds

for,   the   dismissal.  If,  in   this   informal

preliminary  inquiry, a prima  facie  case  is  not

established  by the union, then, of  course,  such

representation  will  be  rejected.  But  if   the

informal  inquiry reveals that the  management  is

partly in the wrong, then efforts will be made  to

get  the parties through ex parte consultation  to

settle the case either by reinstatement or by cash

compensation.  If  no  settlement  is  reached  by

conciliation,  the representation  will  be  dealt

with  either  under section 35  (3),  whereby  the

Minister  directs the Commissioner for  Labour  to

hold a formal inquiry and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>



to  make recommendations to the Minister; or under

section 35 (4) where the employer is asked to make

written submissions to the Minister to justify his

action to dismiss the employee concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as many of the representations are

straightforward,  the procedures  adopted  by  the

Ministry of Labour have proved to be effective and

satisfactory.  This is borne out by the  following

facts.    Since    15th    August,    1968,    109

representations  have  been  received.   Of   this

number, 24 representations were rejected, 52  were

settled by conciliation, 23 were withdrawn by  the

union,  three  are currently under  consideration,

and  a  total of seven cases were disposed  of  by

Ministerial   orders,  directing  four   dismissed

employees to be reinstated and three employers  to

pay  compensation to three dismissed employees.  A

total  of  three formal inquiries were  also  held

under  order  of the Minister. It is to  he  noted

that each formal inquiry took no less than two and

a  half  months for hearings to be completed.  The

current  procedure  of first  dealing  with  union

representation  by  means  of  conciliation   has,

therefore,  proved  to  be  both  expeditious  and

satisfactory. This same procedure will be  adopted

in  respect of representations made under the  new

amended section 14 of the Employment Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government does not

contemplate amending the relevant sections of  the

Industrial Relations Act at the moment,  nor  does

it  intend to accept the suggestions made  by  the

hon. Members in respect of representations by non-unionised  employees  for  wrongful  dismissal.  A

formal  hearing, which is not only  time-consuming

but also involves the full-time services of a good

number  of  Government officers,  should  only  be

resorted  to  when  a prima facie  case  has  been

established   and  when  all  other   conciliatory

efforts have failed to settle the issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole house.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Ong Pang Boon].

<div align="center"><b>CENTRAL PROVIDENT FUND (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Central Provident Fund Act

was  enacted  in  1955  to  provide  employees  in

Singapore with a compulsory savings scheme so that

they  will have some savings when they retire from

active work. Since then, the Fund has grown from a

membership of 180,000 with accumulated savings  of

$9  million  to  more than 911,000  members  whose

total balance amounts to $1,500 million at the end

of  June  1973.  The Fund is also  fulfilling  two

important  social  functions. Firstly,  under  its

approved   housing  scheme  introduced  in   1968,

members are permitted to use their CPF credits  to

purchase  Housing and Development Board fiats.  At

the   end  of  June  1973,  32,727  members   have

withdrawn $119 million for this purpose. Secondly,

it  is an institution for national savings and  is

one  of  the most important sources of  funds  for

Government development projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one unhealthy and unfortunate

development  that accompanies the  growth  of  the

Fund,  namely,  a  corresponding increase  in  the

number  of  infringements and offences  under  the

Act. This is especially true whenever the rate  of

contribution   is  raised.  In  1968,   when   the

employer/employee  combined rate  of  contribution

was   13   per   cent,  only  42  employers   were

successfully   prosecuted   for   non-payment   of

contributions and more than $114,000 collected  as

interest  on  late  payments. In  1972,  when  the

combined rate of contribution was raised to 24 per

cent, the number of employers prosecuted increased

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>



653  and interest on late payments also jumped  to $642,000.  For the first six months of this  year, 314  employers  have been successfully  prosecuted

and   $790,000  collected  as  interest  on   late

payments.  As the rates of contribution have  been

further increased from 1st July this year,  it  is

envisaged  that  the number of  infringements  and

offences  will  also increase,  unless  steps  are

taken  to check this tendency. This is one of  the

main objectives which the Bill hopes to achieve.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the aims of this Bill are given

in  the  Explanatory Statement. I will, therefore,

only concentrate on the more important provisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Provident Fund Board is facing some

difficulties  in enforcing the provisions  of  the

Central  Provident Fund Act because of its limited

powers.  At  present, officers of  the  Board  are

unable  to  deal effectively with the  problem  of

evasion of CPF contributions, as the Act does  not

provide   specific  statutory  powers  to  require

employers to produce contracts of service,  salary

account  books, registers and such other documents

relating  to  the  employment of their  employees.

Clause  4 of the Bill, therefore, seeks to provide

officers of the Board with the necessary statutory

powers to deal with this problem and to strengthen

the Board's enforcement machinery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is also concerned over the problem of

late  payments which is mainly due to the existing

low penalties. Currently, an employer who pays CPF

contributions  late can be charged interest  of  1

per  cent  per month on the amount of contribution

due  or  $1  whichever is greater.  This  rate  of

interest   of  1  per  cent  per  month   is   not

sufficiently   deterrent   to   encourage   prompt

payment,  while  the  minimum  penalty  of  $1  is

administratively  unenforceable  since  a   simple

registered  letter  of demand costs  75  cents  in

postage alone, and many employers simply refuse to

pay, knowing that the Central Provident Fund Board

is  unlikely to take criminal proceedings for such

a small sum. Clause 7 of the Bill will, therefore,

increase the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>



rate  of interest on late payment to 1 1/2 per cent

per  month  with  a minimum penalty  of  $5.  This

interest will be charged on a daily basis  instead

of  on  a  monthly  basis in  order  to  encourage

employers  to  pay  up  promptly  as,  under   the

existing  provision, an employer is penalised  the

same amount irrespective of whether he is late  by

one day or one month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more serious problem is where an employer has

deducted CPF contributions from the wages  of  his

employees  but  fails to pay  them  to  the  Fund.

Currently,  the  maximum  penalties  for  such  an

offence  are $500 for a first offence  and  $2,000

for   a  second  and  subsequent  offence.  Though

considered to be sufficiently deterrent  when  the

Act   was  first  introduced  in  1955,  when  the

combined rate of CPF contribution was only 10  per

cent  subject to a maximum of $50 per month, these

penalties are now manifestly inadequate especially

when  the combined rate of contributions has  just

been raised to 26 per cent from 1st July, 1973, in

respect  of employees earning more than  $200  per

month. The maximum monthly contribution payable by

both   employers  and  employees  has  also   been

increased to $225 and $165 respectively, and there

is no limit on CPF contributions on bonuses. Large

employers of labour will be very tempted to  delay

payment  of  CPF  contributions  which  have  been

deducted  from  employees' salaries,  and  utilise

this  money  for  other purposes. This,  in  fact,

happened in the case of four Chinese bus companies

prior  to and immediately after the reorganisation

of the public transport system in April 1971.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6, therefore, provides that where an

employer  has deducted CPF contributions from  the

wages  of  his  employees but fails  to  pay  such

contribution  to  the Fund within  the  stipulated

time,  the employer is liable on conviction  to  a

maximum fine of $10,000 or to imprisonment  up  to

seven   years,   or   to  both   such   fine   and

imprisonment.  The interest of the employees  will

be further protected by clause 16 which enables



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>



the  Board to lay claims on the proceeds from  the

sale of any property of an employer seized under a

writ of seizure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the amendments proposed in

clauses  5  and 10 are significant  as  they  will

empower  the  Board to make rules prescribing  the

manner  in  which interest should  be  calculated.

This  will  enable the Board to take into  account

late payments of contributions as though they were

not late so that the employees concerned would not

suffer  a  loss  of interest. The amendments  also

enable  the Board, if circumstances permit in  the

future, to credit interest to members of the  Fund

at  half-yearly or quarterly intervals instead  of

the present yearly intervals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment that deserves mention is

contained  in clause 11. At present, a member  who

has  withdrawn from the Fund at the age of 55  and

carries  on  working cannot withdraw  again  until

five  years  later. This may cause  some  hardship

especially  if the member is subsequently  out  of

job.  Clause  11 will now permit him  to  withdraw

again  if  he has been unemployed for a period  of

six months immediately preceding the date he makes

an application for a further withdrawal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to ensure that all employees enjoy the

benefits of CPF and employers are prompt in making

CPF  payments, it is necessary to arm officers  of

the  Central Provident Fund Board with  sufficient

statutory   powers  to  carry  out  their   duties

effectively  and to provide for stiffer  penalties

against recalcitrant employers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.14 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I see it,

this   Bill  which  seeks  to  amend  the  Central

Provident Fund Act is intended to give more  teeth

to  the principal Act. As such, the amendments can

benefit  workers in general. I have no  hesitation

in  giving  my support to it. However,  there  are

some provisions upon which I wish to comment on in

some detail.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the Bill, introducing a new section

4A  into  the principal Act, is, in my opinion,  a

timely  and  necessary provision, as  the  persons

charged  with  enforcing the  principal  Act  have

apparently encountered unnecessary difficulties in

the  absence  of  the proposed  provisions.  Human

nature  being  what  it is, it  is  probable  that

officers  of  the  CPF Board, or the  Ministry  of

Labour  for that matter, may have received  either

downright  evasive  replies  or  outright  hostile

silence from persons to whom their enquiries  have

been directed. Under the prevailing law, there  is

no  legal  obligation for such persons to  produce

documentary  records  or  to  be  frank  with  the

investigating  officers.  In  that  respect,   the

proposed provisions should, by helping to make  it

more   difficult  for  employers  to  evade  their

obligations under the principal Act, be  of  great

service to workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the proposed provisions, however, may

pose  a  threat  to  the peace of  mind  of  small

employers, particularly the employers of  domestic

help,  whether on a full-time or part-time  basis.

But  before some snide remarks are made about  the

affluence  of Singapore workers who  are  able  to

afford domestic help, let me hasten to add that  a

working  couple  with one or two children,  living

completely  on their own in a Housing Board  fiat,

without  the benefit of the service of in-laws  or

the  cheap  service of a creche,  have  to  employ

domestic  help out of sheer necessity -  that  is,

work   permits   from  the  Ministry   of   Labour

permitting.  In  such  a  case,  even  though  the

husband may be the official employer in the  sense

that he may be so described for the purpose of the

principal  Act  or any other statutory  enactment,

the actual or real employer may be the wife in the

sense  that she may be the one who deals with  the

remuneration and decides the terms and  conditions

of service for the domestic help. I trust that the

intention of the proposed provisions is  to  catch

out employers of large labour force rather than to

capitalise on any misunderstanding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>



between husband and wife in relation  to  the

employment of their domestic help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 6 of the Bill, a new subsection (3) has

been  added  to  section 6 of the  principal  Act,

which  provides that a heavy penalty is liable  to

be  imposed  on an employer who, after making  the

requisite  deductions from the pay packet  of  his

employees, forgets or refuses to remit the same to

the  CPF  Board. A vital distinction is made  from

the employer who fails to pay his own contribution

under  the  principal  Act within  the  prescribed

period,  as  dealt with in clause 7 of  the  Bill,

which  I  will comment upon later. The distinction

is necessary, as the Minister has pointed out just

now,  as the sums of money deducted from the wages

of the workers for payment to the CPF Board do not

belong to the employers but are only held in trust

by  them. As such, the sums so deducted should not

be  retained  by employers for any  period  longer

than  is necessary, and any provision discouraging

them  from doing so is undeniably in the  interest

of workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same clause 6 of the Bill, the proposed

subsections  (1)  and  (2) of  section  6  of  the

principal  Act are substantially a rehash  of  the

existing provisions and are apparently intended to

accommodate new circumstances which may arise from

any  implementation of such recommendations of the

National Wages Council as the Government may  have

accepted. One difficulty, however, is posed by the

time-lapse  between  the  effective  date  of  the

increase of CPF rates that is, in the case of this

year I per cent on 1st July, 1973 - and the actual

date  of  payment  of NWC's recommendations,  even

though  with retrospective effect. The  result  is

that  a  worker may suffer a cut in his  take-home

pay  because  of  the  increased  CPF's  rate   of

contribution  based  on  his  salary  without  the

benefit of any NWC's increment. An obvious  retort

from the Minister would be that, even without  any

NWC's   increment,  he  would  have  received   an

increase in pay by way of a higher sum credited to

his CPF account and that,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>



if  he  is  a member of a trade union,  he  should

press  his union not to procrastinate in the  hope

of  a  greater  increment than what  the  NWC  has

recommended.  Sometimes,  however,  the  delay  in

implementing  the  NWC's  recommendations  is  not

occasioned  by  either  the  trade  union  or  the

employer  but by complexities or peculiarities  of

terms and conditions of service not considered  by

the NWC.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the point I want to make is to relate clause

6  of  the  Bill to clause 10 of the Bill amending

section 10 of the principal Act which governs  the

payment of interest on contributions credited with

the  CPF.  I  believe  that the  purpose  of  this

amendment  is to enable the CPF Board  to  compute

interest  on  a more conscionable basis  than  the

present  yearly basis, which is manifestly unjust.

Charge  them interest every month. We welcome  it.

On the other hand, if the Post Office Savings Bank

is  able  to compute interest on voluntary savings

on  a  monthly basis. I should think the CPF Board

should  be  able to do so similarly on  compulsory

savings    of   workers.   With   the   additional

consideration  of clause 7 of the  Bill,  amending

section 7 of the principal Act, which provides for

the  payment of an enhanced penalty in respect  of

contributions which are belated by even  one  day,

any  decision by the CPF Board to compute interest

at  an  interval  longer than  one  month  clearly

smacks   of  profiteering  under  the   guise   of

bureaucratic  inefficiency.  The  CPF   wants   to

collect  1 1/2  per  cent  every  month  from   the

employer. Pay some to the employees as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, clause 11 of the Bill has introduced a

new paragraph (c) to subsection (2) of section  11

of  the  principal Act by providing for the  large

category of Malaysian workers who are employed  in

Singapore and who have CPF contributions  credited

to  their respective accounts while so employed in

Singapore.  The  proposed  provision  enables  the

Board  to  permit such workers to  withdraw  their

contributions  in certain circumstances  on  their

departure from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>



Singapore for good. Co-ordination perhaps with the

Work  Permit Office and other relevant departments

would serve to ascertain whether the departure  of

such  workers  from  Singapore  is  permanent   or

otherwise. Difficulty may he met by the CPF  Board

in trying to trace the whereabouts of such workers

twenty  or  thirty  years  after  they  have  left

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the above comments, I repeat that I am

wholly in favour of the proposed amendments to the

Central  Provident Fund Act but would request  the

Government   to  compute  interest   on   a   more

conscionable  basis, and that  is,  on  a  monthly

basis like the Post Office Savings Bank is doing.



<br><br>4.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  purpose of the Central  Provident  Fund

(Amendment) Bill is to make the implementation  of

the  principal  Act  more effective  in  order  to

benefit  all  the workers. This  is  a  very  good

amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister in his speech mentioned that

the  total  deposit  in the CPF  has  now  reached

$1,500 million with a membership of 911,000.  This

is  very  significant. I would  like  to  ask  the

Minister a few questions. Firstly, since  the  CPF

Board has this large sum of money totalling $1,500

million,  in  what way will the  CPF  invest  this

money and what benefit or interest will be derived

from the investment every year?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, is the CPF Board prepared to raise the

interest rate so that all the 911,000 members  can

enjoy better benefits?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as we all know, the CPF Board is now

constructing a new building. I would like  to  ask

where  does  the  money for this building  project

come  from.  Does it come from the  Government  or

from the Fund itself?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a suggestion to make to the Minister. For

a  long time, the rules of the CPF stipulate  that

only members of the Fund who read 55



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>



years  of  age  and  retiring  are  qualified   to

withdraw their contributions from the CPF. But  in

my  constituency there are certain people who  are

faced  with  financial difficulties  because  they

have  been  retrenched  and  have  retired  before

reaching  55  years of age. So they have  a  great

need for funds. Therefore, they applied to the CPF

for  a  withdrawal of funds or at  least  part  of

their  contributions to repair their houses  which

are dilapidated, and for other purposes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Yeoh Ghim Seng (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Teong, can you confine your debate

to  the  principle of this Bill and not go outside

its scope, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would

like to suggest to the Minister that those members

who retire before reaching the age of 55 should be

allowed  to  withdraw their CPF contributions  for

valid reasons.



<br><br>4.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  assure the Member for Telok Blangah that it is

not  the intention of this amendment Bill to catch

the  small  employers, the employer of a  domestic

servant, for instance. The intention is really  to

catch the big employers of a large labour force. I

am  quite sure the CPF inspectors will be able  to

exercise  a  certain  amount  of  discretion  when

dealing  with  employers of domestic servants  who

fail  to  pay  CPF  contributions  for  a  genuine

reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the CPF Board has, in fact,

considered  the possibility of computing  interest

monthly,   but   there   are   certain   technical

difficulties which it cannot overcome  as  yet  at

present.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> But the Post Office can do it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Yes, but the Post Office is

probably  somewhat  different from  the  CPF.  The

Member  may  be  aware that  the  CPF  has  a  new

computer with a larger capacity. It is hoped  that

when   the   computer  is  fully   installed   and

functioning, it may he possible in the near future

to compute



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>



the  interest at shorter intervals than yearly  as

at present.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the monies collected by the CPF are invested

in  Government bonds. The CPF is not permitted  to

invest   in   other  more  profitable   commercial

securities.  As the Government bond only  pays  an

interest  of  about 6 per cent, the CPF  therefore

cannot pay an interest of more than 53/4 per cent.

Much  as the CPF would like to pay more, I do  not

think  it is possible. The quarter per cent earned

by  CPF is used to pay for administrative expenses

and  staff salaries. I think this probably answers

the question of the Member for Sembawang regarding

the use of the CPF contributions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF building is built out of funds

accumulated by the CPF over the years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for withdrawal before reaching 55 years of

age,  I do not think the present law permits that,

unless the member is leaving Singapore for good or

is unable to work indefinitely. So I am afraid the

Member  for  Sembawang will have to  be  satisfied

with the answer at the moment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill.-[Mr Ong Pang Boon].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members may recall that on 11th April, 1971,

the  10 Chinese bus companies regrouped into three

companies, namely, Amalgamated Bus



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>



Company  (ABC), Associated Bus Service  (ABS)  and

the   United  Bus  Company  (UBC).  The  Singapore

Traction Company (STC) was the fourth bus  company

and  when  it ceased operation in December,  1971,

its   routes  were  taken  over  by  these   three

companies which in due course built up a fleet  of

over 2,000 buses deployed in 143 bus routes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the recent amalgamation of the three

companies  into  a  single company  known  as  the

Singapore   Bus  Service  Ltd  (SBS),   which   we

understand was registered on 11th July,  1973,  it

will  be  necessary for the Bus Services Licensing

Authority to monitor closely the progress  of  the

new   company,  its  affairs  and  its   financial

position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Bus Services Licensing Authority Act

has  provisions requiring bus companies to  submit

audited accounts. However, it is not mandatory for

the  bus  companies to do so within  a  stipulated

period  of  time after the close of the  financial

year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment Bill, therefore, proposes to make

it  mandatory  for  the bus  companies  to  submit

audited  accounts, including Statements of Revenue

and  Expenditure,  to the Bus  Services  Licensing

Authority within three months after the  close  of

each financial year. Every Director and Manager of

the  company will be held responsible for  failure

to  submit  the  accounts  within  the  stipulated

period.  On conviction, they will be liable  to  a

fine of up to $10,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also empowers the Minister for

Communications    to   appoint    Inspectors    to

investigate into the affairs of the company.  This

power  is necessary to ensure that the bus company

is  responsibly managed. In addition, I wish  also

to inform hon. Members of this House that separate

action  is being taken to increase the performance

bond  of $100,000 presently required from each  of

the three bus companies to $500,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these measures are taken in order to

safeguard  the  interest of the public  in  a  bus

transport system



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>



operated  by a single bus company which in  effect

has  a  de  facto monopoly of an essential  public

service.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (TAS

for  short) was established on 1st April last year

under the TAS Act, 1972, by transformation of  the

former   Telecommunications  Department   into   a

statutory body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has now been found from experience that it is

necessary  to amend the Act to enable disciplinary

control  over  officers of  the  Authority  to  be

delegated   to   committees   appointed   by   the

Authority,  or  to  the Chairman  or  the  General

Manager. This would allow disciplinary cases to be

more speedily disposed of.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instances have also arisen where disciplinary

proceedings need to be taken against staff of  the

Authority  for  acts  committed  while  they  were

employees   of   the   former   Telecommunications

Department. Since the Public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>



Service  Commission is not empowered to  institute

such  proceedings against these officers following

their  transfer  to the Authority,  the  Authority

itself  has to be vested with powers to do so.  It

is  inconceivable  that the  Authority  should  be

powerless to take action against its staff who may

have committed serious offences just because these

offences  were  committed  while  the  staff  were

employed    by   the   former   Telecommunications

Department. Particularly so as the Authority  has,

under  the provisions of the TAS Act, 1972,  taken

over  the  assets and liabilities  of  the  former

Telecommunications Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill also seeks to establish beyond doubt

that  the  Authority  is  vested  with  powers  to

terminate  the services of, dismiss  and  exercise

disciplinary control over its staff. It also seeks

to  enable  the Authority to make regulations  for

the disciplinary control of its staff.

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL LIABILITY (OIL POLLUTION) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ang Kok Peng (Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications (Dr Ang Kok Peng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent oil pollution incidents the

experience  of  the  Port of  Singapore  Authority

shows  that  the existing laws are  inadequate  to

ensure that the Port and the Government are  fully

reimbursed  for the expenditure arising  from  the

damage  caused  by oil pollution. The  purpose  of

this Bill, therefore, is to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>



enable  us  to  impose strict  liability  for  oil

pollution damage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Liability (Oil Pollution) Bill, 1973,

is  based  on the principles embodied in the  1969

International  Convention on Civil  Liability  for

Oil  Pollution  Damage.  This  Convention  imposes

strict liability but entitles a shipowner to limit

his  liability for oil pollution damage in any one

incident.  It  also provides three  exceptions  to

liability.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now summarise briefly the main provisions

of  the Bill. Clause 3 provides that where oil  is

discharged  or escapes from any ship or  off-shore

or  on-shore facility, the owner or operator shall

be  liable for any damage caused, for the cost  of

any  measures taken to prevent the damage, and for

any  damage  caused  by  the  measures  so  taken.

However, a shipowner's liability for oil pollution

damage  is  limited to S$375 for each ton  of  the

ship's  tonnage or S$50 million (when the  tonnage

results in a greater amount).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides for three exceptions to

liability.  The  owner  or operator  will  not  be

liable  if  he  proves that the oil escaped  as  a

result of: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) an act of war or an act of God;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) wilful act of a third party;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) negligence of the Government or the Port of

Singapore   Authority  (PSA)   in   maintaining

navigational aids.



<br><br>It  is  only  equitable that  exception  (iii)  is

included, for the PSA must be held responsible for

proper  maintenance of navigational  aids  in  the

Port.  In  cases where liability is not  based  on

clause  3  but on common law, the Bill  gives  the

right  to  recover  costs  of  measures  taken  to

prevent oil pollution damage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director of Marine and the Port Master are

empowered  to detain a ship suspected of polluting

the  sea and to require the owner to make  a  cash

deposit  or  other  security before  the  ship  is

released.  The Bill, however, does  not  apply  to

warships  and  government  vessels  not  used  for

commercial purposes.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule of the Bill will amend the

Prevention of Pollution of the Sea Act, 1971,  and

will  raise the maximum penalty for oil  pollution

offences  from S$20,000 to S$500,000. Mr  Speaker,

Sir, if this provision of the Bill would appear to

be  severe, it is because we regard the problem of

pollution  of the sea as a major problem requiring

strong measures for effective control. As our Port

is  a  fairly busy one, it is vital that  adequate

measures  are adopted to discourage the  pollution

of our harbour, territorial waters and shore-lines

by ships and shore establishments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State for the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for the Environment (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before the House is based on the

existing  Destruction  of Disease-Bearing  Insects

Act (Chapter 152, 1970 Edition). Consequent to the

difficulties  and  problems  encountered  in   the

application and administration of the  Act  during

the last two years, the need has arisen to amplify

the  Act  to  ensure  better control  of  disease-bearing insects through more effective enforcement action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One major problem encountered relates to

difficulties  in  obtaining the names,  addresses,

proof  of  identity and other relevant particulars

of  occupiers and owners of premises. This  defect

has  hindered  the issue of orders  and  summonses

considerably. Specific powers are now included  in

the  Bill  to  facilitate officers to obtain  such

information  of  any offender or  suspect  and  to

arrest  such person without warrant if he declines

to supply the required particulars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A device of "ticketing" is to be introduced in

respect  of  offences committed under the  Act  to

empower officers to serve on offenders notices  to

attend at the Court described, at a specified date

and time, so that the Court may take cognizance of

the offences. The purpose of this provision is  to

enable  more expeditious and effective enforcement

of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A presumption clause has now been introduced

which  will have the effect of fixing on the owner

or  occupier  the responsibility for any  premises

conducive  to  the propagation of  disease-bearing

insects, unless the contrary is proved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term "disease-bearing insect" is now re-defined to include every specie of mosquitoes and

house  flies.  This enables many potential  insect

vectors to come under control and prevention.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present provision, a medical officer is

required  to  appear in Court for the  purpose  of

giving   evidence  to  prove  that  a   particular

mosquito  or insect is, in fact, a disease-bearing

insect.  In order to eliminate this time-consuming

procedure, a provision is made in the Bill whereby

reports  signed by any Medical Officer of  Health,

Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>



Entomologist or Public Health Engineer  concerning

any  matter  or  thing submitted for  examination,

analysis  or  report are admissible  in  Court  as

constituting prima facie evidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other minor amendments to the Bill serve to

specify  and  define more explicitly the  existing

powers of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE SPORTS COUNCIL BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.26 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Social Affairs (Encik Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main purpose of the Bill, as found in

the  Explanatory  Statement, is to  establish  the

"Singapore  Sports Council" which will  take  over

the  functions  of  the National Sports  Promotion

Board and the National Stadium Corporation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Sports Promotion Board came into

being  with the coming into force of the  National

Sports  Promotion Board Act in February 1971,  and

the  National Stadium Corporation with the  coming

into force of the National Stadium Corporation Act

in  November 1971. At that time, it was considered

necessary   that  there  should  be   a   separate

organisation for the National Stadium which was at

the   initial  stages  of  its  construction.  The

Stadium  has now been completed and was officially

opened  by our Prime Minister on 21st July,  1973.

At  this stage, it would not be economical to have

two organisations concerned with the promotion  of

sports  and  the  provision  of  recreational  and

sports  facilities. The National Sports  Promotion

Board is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>



concerned  with  the promotion of sports  and  the

provision  of  facilities.  The  National  Stadium

Complex  will  be  the  main  sports  complex   in

Singapore and would also be concerned with sports.

The time has now come for the two organisations to

be  amalgamated,  so  as to  achieve  the  maximum

utilisation of staff, finance and facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With amalgamation, there would be a streamlined

administrative machinery, which would  result  not

only  in  a  considerable  amount  of  savings  in

finances on personal emoluments and office  space,

but  also in more efficient performance in  sports

promotion.  In this connection, I wish to  mention

that  this new administrative machinery  will  pay

particular   attention   to   intra   and   inter-Constituency  games which form an  important  mass

base for the new "sports for all" national policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enactment of the Singapore Sports Council Act

is in keeping with the new "sports for all" policy

which the Government has embarked upon. Under this

policy,  the  aim would be towards achieving  good

health, physical well-being, beneficial recreation

and   better  spending  of  leisure  time  by  our

population.  It also aims at raising the  standard

of  sports so that it becomes an essential part of

our  national life. In furtherance of this policy,

the objectives of this Council would be:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to improve the physical fitness standards of

the people of the Republic;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to encourage mass participation of the

population in sports in the Republic;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to provide the people of the Republic with

maximum  facilities so as  to  enable  them  to

carry   out   their  sports  and   recreational

activities; and lastly,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to raise the standard of sports at all levels

in the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various provisions of the Bill are geared

towards  achieving  these  objectives.  The   main

functions, as contained in clause 8 of  the  Bill,

are to plan and to promote, to co-ordinate and  to

cooperate, to encourage and arrange sports,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>



games  and  recreation and physical  education  in

conjunction with the Ministry of Education and the

Singapore  National Olympic Council  and  national

sports  organisations. Some of the other functions

are  to foster research and physical education and

establish   sports   stadia   and   other   sports

facilities as are deemed necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 9 of the Bill, the powers given to

the   Council  are  mainly  to  recommend  minimum

standards   for   participation  in  international

sports, competitions and games; to advise  on  the

planning,  promotion  and  standards  of  physical

education;  to  raise funds;  to  make  grants  or

contributions  to  sports  organisations,  and  to

conduct commercial and business ventures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 refers to transfer to the Council of

the   undertakings   of   the   National   Stadium

Corporation  and  the  National  Sports  Promotion

Board,  while clause 12 provides for the continued

secondment of Government employees of either Board

following  the  amalgamation and later  absorption

into  the service of the Council. It also provides

in  clause 13 for non-Government employees  to  be

transferred.  Part  VI of the  Bill  provides  for

financial matters. There is provision in the  Bill

for  the  Council to receive loans or grants  from

both   the  Government  and  the  private  sector,

including  the Singapore Pools (Private)  Limited.

One  new  innovation in this Bill is that most  of

the  financial provisions are set out in  schedule

form attached to it, and this has the advantage of

shortening the Bill considerably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill does not confer authoritative powers nor

powers  to  impose  sanctions  or  penalties  over

national sports associations or private clubs, nor

does  it interfere with or usurp the functions  of

relevant   Ministries,  like   the   Ministry   of

Education.  The Singapore Sports Council  will  be

there to advise, encourage, coordinate and lead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that with the setting up of the

Singapore  Sports Council by the  amalgamation  of

the   National  Sports  Promotion  Board  and  the

National Stadium



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>



Corporation,  we  will  have  a  streamlined

organisation made up of persons actively concerned

with  the promotion of sports, who would over  the

years he able to work together and build up a base

among  the  masses,  a base that  would  give  the

support necessary to bring about the popularity of

sports. Whereas the Singapore Sports Council  will

be  involved in the running of sports and physical

education programmes, as well as the provision  of

facilities, the Ministry of Social Affairs will be

actively concerned with policy direction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I wish to emphasise that with the

formation of the Singapore Sports Council, we  can

look forward to seeing that the main objective  of

promoting  mass  participation  of  the  people-in

sports  in  Singapore, as well as  bringing  about

physical  fitness of the population, so  essential

to  security and productivity in Singapore,  would

be achieved in the years ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Leong Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Leong Boon (Kim Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise  in  support of the Singapore Sports  Council

Bill.   As  in  1971,  when  the  National  Sports

Promotion Board Bill was introduced, there  is  an

air  of  hope for sports in Singapore.  It  is  my

personal hope and wish that the air now is not the

same  as  the  air then. However, looking  at  the

present  set-up, I am confident that  the  present

Singapore  Sports  Council  will  augur  well  for

sports in Singapore in future. However, I would be

failing at this stage if I do not bring up  a  few

points which I think are worth noting. Some of the

officials  in the last few surviving  days-of  the

National   Sports   Promotion  Board,   who   were

responsible for some of the acts of mischief,  are

still very much with this new body and unless  the

new  officials who are in charge will  bear  their

authority upon these junior officials, I am afraid

some of the acts of mischief committed in the past

might be repeated in the new Council.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I notice that there is a definite

shortage of staff in this big sports body. If that

is  the problem, then I think if we do not enlarge

the  staff  we might be faced with more  problems.

Thirdly, I would like to comment on the efficiency

and  leadership which was so markedly  lacking  in

the  last National Sports Promotion Board.  It  is

our   hope  that  with  the  introduction  of  new

officials,  this noticeable lack of  qualities  in

the past will no longer be with us now and we look

forward to able leadership in the Singapore Sports

Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I can assure the Minister for

Social  Affairs  that  my  colleagues  and  fellow

Members  of Parliament here who have in  the  past

brought  to light some of the unpleasant  problems

would join me in wishing this new Singapore Sports

Council  all  the very best, and we  give  it  our

fullest support.



<br><br><!-- Encik Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, just a few

words  to thank the Member and his colleagues  for

the support which they are giving to the Bill. One

of  the objectives of this Bill is also to rectify

all  the mistakes that have been made before,  and

to   improve   on  the  efficiency  of   the   new organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

<div align="center"><b>FISHERIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill that is before the House seeks to

amend  the  Fisheries  Act  (Chapter  294  of  the

Revised Edition) with a view to providing  a  more

exemplary penalty for trawl-net fishing within the

territorial    waters   of   Singapore.    Trawler

operations  of  late  have increased  to  such  an

extent  that  they  are not merely  a  destructive

nuisance   but  have  deprived  many   a   coastal

fisherman  of  his  livelihood.  Furthermore  this

method  of  fishing, whereby a vessel tows  a  net

shaped  like  an  open bag, is to be  particularly

condemned because of the manner in which  immature

and  unmarketable fish, prawns and other forms  of

marine  life  are  destroyed,  when  used  in  our

shallow coastal waters. In addition to taking away

almost everything in its path, the trawl-net drags

away  and destroys the fishing gear of our coastal

fishermen  and breaks their lines and nets.  These

operations  have  resulted in numerous  complaints

being  made  to  the authorities,  and  despite  a

series  of raids carried out to apprehend trawlers

fishing within our territorial waters, this method

of fishing has not abated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members who are aware of this problem  have

no doubt looked up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>



the   Fisheries   Act  only  to  find   that   the

legislation   has   provided   relatively    light

sentences  for  such  offences.  This  is  because

coastal water trawling commenced only a few  years

ago  with only a few trawlers operating. But their

numbers  have  since  increased  sufficiently   to

constitute a problem. One of the main reasons  for

the increase of such activity is the fact that the

penalties   imposed  by  the   courts   were   not

sufficient  to  constitute a  deterrent,  so  that

convicted  trawler  men continued  to  repeat  the

offence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to effectively prohibit this practice of

trawl-net  fishing within our coastal waters,  the

Government has decided to introduce the amendments

now  before  the House. Their main purpose  is  to

provide  for  the  imposition of a  more  salutary

punishment  upon  those found  guilty.  Under  the

existing  Act any person convicted of  an  offence

under  the  Act,  including  trawling  in  coastal

waters,  is liable to a fine not exceeding  $1,000

or  to  a  term of imprisonment not exceeding  one

year  or  to both such fine and imprisonment.  The

court  may  also  order the  confiscation  of  any

vessel or appliance used in the commission of  the

offence.  However,  in  practice,  none  of  those

convicted has so far been jailed and no vessel  or

appliance has been confiscated. The Bill seeks  to

amend  the Act so that it shall he compulsory  for

the  courts  to  impose  on anybody  convicted  of

inshore  trawling a mandatory term of imprisonment

of  not  less than three months and not more  than

three years, without the option of a fine. It also

provides that the courts may make an order for the

confiscation  of  any vessel, net,  instrument  or

appliance used in the commission of the offence on

the written application of the Public Prosecutor.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Bill confers on police officers the

same  powers as fishery officers to stop,  search,

detain  and arrest any person found committing  or

attempting  to  commit an offence under  the  Act.

This  will enable the Marine Police to assist  the

Primary Production



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>



Department  more  effectively in  its  efforts  to

stamp out coastal trawling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our hope that with these amendments to the

Fisheries  Act, a wasteful and destructive  method

of  fishing  within  our territorial  waters  will

completely  cease  or  at  least  be  reduced   to

negligible proportions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  wish to thank the Minister for introducing this

Bill.  The illegal trawlers regularly come to  our

coastal waters to catch fish, and this affects the

livelihood  of  our fishermen. I hope  the  Marine

Police  will  detail  more  boats  to  patrol  our

coastal  waters  so  as to prevent  these  illegal

trawlers from fishing in our coastal waters.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, I am not in charge of the Marine

Police.  But with the amendments proposed  in  the

Bill,  which give police officers the same  powers

as  fishery  officers, there will be  more  police

patrols.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to repeal the

Services' Lands Board Act and to transfer all  the

assets  and  liabilities of  the  Services'  Lands

Board to the Singapore Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Constitutional Conference held in the

United Kingdom in 1958, it was agreed, inter alia,

that the United



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>



Kingdom Services should retain the land which they

occupied  in  Singapore for defence  purposes  and

that  there  should be established  by  statute  a

Services'  Lands  Board. It was also  agreed  that

lands  paid  for by or on behalf of  the  Services

should  be transferred to and vested in the Board.

The   Services'   Lands   Board   Ordinance   was,

therefore, enacted in 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its incorporation, the Services' Lands

Board has been granted leases of State Lands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the recent Exchange of Notes on Defence

Arrangements between the Governments of  Singapore

and the United Kingdom, it was agreed, inter alia,

that  all  lands in Singapore held  by  the  Board

should,  with effect from 1st November,  1971,  be

transferred to and be vested in the Government  of

Singapore.
