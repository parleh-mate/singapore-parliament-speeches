Lean Suan) (for the Minister for Health)</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, please allow
me to first explain the difference between active tuberculosis (TB)
and latent TB infection. Active TB is a disease state where the
patient is symptomatic and the disease can spread to others. Latent
TB infection is an asymptomatic disease state during which the disease
cannot spread to others.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-cf610769-2755-42f4-9a1b-005e825c17e3">

with latent infection, about 90%, will not develop active TB disease.
Only about 10% of persons with latent TB infection develop active
TB disease. This may take place many years after the infection,
although there is a higher risk of active TB during the first two
years of infection. On average, about 1,380 Singapore residents
were diagnosed with active TB each year over the last five years,
or about 40 cases per 100,000. Most, or about 95% of these cases,
are adults. Among non-residents excluding short-term visitors, the
average number was also about 40 cases per 100,000 over the same
period, or about 450 per year. Short-term visitors were excluded
as many of them were workers who were diagnosed during pre-employment
medical screening for application of work passes, and will be rejected
if they were found to have TB. Others were here specifically for
TB treatment. There were about 100 students diagnosed with TB each
year during the last five years. More than 75% were students aged
17 years or older. About 1,000 people are currently being treated
for TB.</p>

that Singapore has one of the lowest incidence rates of TB in Asia,
besides Japan. Singapore has a comprehensive national TB control
programme which was enhanced in 1997 with the setting up of the
Singapore Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (STEP). Under STEP,
the key control strategy for TB is, firstly, early detection and
effective treatment. This is important to stop the spread of TB
in the community. Secondly, the TB Control Unit, which runs STEP,
closely monitors compliance with treatment until cure. Whilst most
patients would voluntarily be compliant with the treatment, the
Infectious Diseases Act gives us the power to mandate treatment
of TB patients who are non-compliant, if necessary. By actively
monitoring the treatment process of all TB cases, the risks of treatment
failure and development of multi-drug resistance are lowered</p>

through prolonged close contact, contact-screening is conducted
among household contacts and other close contacts in institutions
like schools to identify persons with latent TB infection. Persons
with latent TB infection are offered preventive treatment to reduce
the likelihood of developing active disease. My Ministry will continue
to monitor the effectiveness of the TB control programme closely,
and implement enhancements from time to time.</p>

Sir, I thank the Minister of State for answering my question. I
have a supplementary question. I believe when foreign workers apply
for work passes, they have to undergo X-rays to detect whether they
have got TB. Am I correct? If the X-rays show black spots, it would
be easy to presume it might be TB. Is there any other way to detect
infection other than black spots on the X-rays?</p>

foreign domestic workers, before they are granted the Work Permit, they
have to undergo medical screening, as the Member has rightly noted.
And we screen for active TB. As I have said earlier in my reply,
active TB cases are symptomatic cases. This is a disease state where the
disease can be spread to others in the community. We do not screen
for latent TB cases. If they are found to have active TB, they will
be rejected and sent home. When a foreign domestic worker re-applies for
a Work Permit, she would be screened again. The screening is done
every time they apply for a Work Permit. The reason being that we
feel that active TB can present itself in between screenings. The
best way to prevent the spread of such a disease would be to get
foreign domestic workers to go to the doctor, especially if they
have a chronic cough, because that is the main symptom of TB.</p>

I have also said in my reply that we do not screen latent TB because
the risk of these cases developing into active TB is actually very low.
Only about one in 10 of such cases will develop into an active TB
case, and it could develop over the course of many years. Of course,
the risk will be higher in the first two years – 50%. But the risk
is spread over a lifetime, so it is very low. We do not screen for
latent TB.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, to reduce business costs, owners and hirers of
goods vehicles are currently allowed to use their vehicles to transport
their workers to and from their places of work or business, subject
to various safety
regulations. LTA has put in place a set of rules under the Road
Traffic Act to enhance the safety of workers transported at the
rear of lorries and pickup trucks. </p>

workers to be safely seated at a height of not more than 1.1 metres
from the carriage deck and the vehicle must not travel faster than
60 km/h. Lorries must also be fitted with canopies and higher side
railings if they are to be used to transport workers on the carriage
deck. A Maximum Passenger Capacity (MPC) label must be displayed
on the goods vehicles to indicate the maximum number of workers
that can be transported, based on a minimum space requirement per person.
If goods are also transported, the number of persons should be reduced
accordingly. The label serves as a reminder to the vehicle owner/driver
on the maximum number of workers the vehicle can carry as well as
facilitates enforcement against errant employers/ drivers who overload
their vehicles. </p>

LTA and Traffic Police (TP) have imposed higher fines and demerit
points for non-compliance with safety regulations for the transportation
of workers on lorries for greater deterrence. A total of 1,329 offenders
have been caught for non-compliance with these safety regulations from
February to September 2011. Enforcement records showed there has
generally been a high level of compliance to these safety rules.
The number of violations of these rules during the eight-month period
before and after the enhanced penalties were introduced has fallen
by 49%. Similarly, the accident statistics over the same period
showed that the number of fatalities has dropped from five to no fatality
while the number of injuries has fallen from 199 to 83 cases.</p>

the Member that notwithstanding the reduction in the number of violations, LTA
and TP remain vigilant. The safety regulations that are in place,
in our assessment, have helped to ensure a higher level of safety
for workers who need to travel on lorries in the course of their
work. The efforts put in by all the relevant agencies underscore
the Government's concern about the safety of workers transported
on lorries. Employers and drivers must also play their part as safety
is also their joint responsibility. LTA will continue to monitor
the situation and, if necessary, review the current measures.</p>

I thank the Minister of State for the very comprehensive reply.
I am heartened to note that the safety standards for transporting
workers have improved since the introduction of the new penalties.
I have just one supplementary question. In terms of the summons issued,
I understand that it allows for business owners and hirers to transport
their workers from lodging to place of work, and in between places
of work. However, for some estates, there have been instances where
workers are transported from their lodgings to public transport
hubs for workers to commute further. Is this an area that is covered
under the Act and are there any penalties issued for contravening the
Act in this area?</p>

the Points Demerit System (PDS) was first implemented in 1987 for
hawker stalls. PDS was extended to food courts, coffee shops and
canteens in November 2010 to motivate operators to pay more attention
to the cleanliness of the common areas in their premises. Food courts,
coffee shops and canteens are routinely inspected at least twice
a year. NEA also carries out additional inspections based on the
feedback it receives from the public. Potential problem areas, such
as toilets in coffee shops, are inspected monthly.</p>

operators have been issued with demerit points, in addition to being
fined for cleanliness-related offences. The three most common offences
are the failure to keep the premises and the toilets clean, and
to maintain the sanitary fittings in the toilets in good working
condition. An operator who chalks up 24 demerit points within 12
months will have his licence suspended for up to three days. Thus
far, no operator has accumulated the maximum number of demerit points
for suspension. </p>

operators during the inspections, NEA also carries out outreach
and educational programmes, such as the "My Coffee Shop Shines"
programme in the South-West district and the "Clean Food Shops"

with the operators and stall owners to improve their cleaning regimes

Public Hygiene Council (PHC) and Restroom Association of Singapore
(RAS) to improve the state of toilet cleanliness in food establishments. </p>

NEA also initiated a voluntary accreditation scheme for the cleaning industry
in July 2010. The scheme recognises companies that have in place
operating systems that ensure the provision of quality cleaning

bring about improvements in cleaning standards in the longer run,

will be carried out together with the PHC, and we urge the public to also play
a greater part in demanding a cleaner dining environment by providing
feedback to NEA and not visiting establishments that are poorly
maintained. At the same time, the public can also help the situation
by being considerate when using the facilities in the food establishments
and keep them clean for the next user. This will help to raise the
level of public hygiene and improve our living environment.</p>

I thank the Senior Minister of State for the very comprehensive

rules and enforcement, how are they being applied to the hawker
centres which are run by NEA? The second is: I have noticed that
there are large numbers of foreign cleaners working in the various
eating establishments in Singapore and they have various acceptable
hygiene standards from their own countries. How is the Ministry
monitoring this and are they satisfied with the level of cleanliness
by these workers? The third question is whether there is any rating

stalls are being graded.</p>

Speaker, I would like to thank the Member for the supplementary questions.
For the enforcement, NEA hawker centres will be subjected to the
same regime. Second question about foreign cleaners: I would like
to stress that we do not make a distinction on the nationality or
the race of the cleaners. What we will focus on really is the outcome
and we would like to apply that same consistent principle, looking
at the outcome of overall level of cleanliness. We have a standard
that we apply on the various areas to watch. For example, as I mentioned
in my reply, how clean is the toilet, whether the toilets are properly
provided with the necessary supplies, and so on. So it is really
outcome-driven.</p>

to the question I think that most Singaporeans are concerned with.
It is really the overall hygiene standard and cleanliness at our
food establishments. My Ministry has worked very hard to improve
on that level but we are not satisfied, and we would like to see
a bigger improvement in the level of public hygiene. This is an
area that my Ministry will work very, very hard on for the coming years.
On the standards of cleanliness of eating establishments, this is
something that we will be prepared to consider, and if the Member
would like to give us specific suggestions, we will be very happy
to incorporate them.</p>

Mr Speaker, our education system and schools operate on the belief
that every child is valuable and important. We believe that each
child has intrinsic worth, and that he can learn and achieve. These beliefs
are articulated in the Philosophy of Education, the Desired Outcomes
of Education and the Teachers' Pledge. Teachers are also guided
by the Teachers' Creed which explicitly states that they should
treat all students fairly and provide opportunities and resources
to all students of different backgrounds.</p>

as respect, care and harmony, are emphasised to our students through
the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum. Schools
reinforce the values through many programmes and activities that
provide valuable learning experiences for their students. These
include community service and joint activities among schools with
different student profiles within a cluster or zone. </p>

such that each of the different educational pathways is valued and

actions of some individuals may not always live up to the beliefs
that we wish to uphold. And when this happens, the schools will
take steps to correct them.</p>

by a JC student to the media comparing the facilities of ITE and

Subsequently, the JC student who wrote the letter issued an online
letter expressing his sincere apologies. I think the public reaction
shows that many Singaporeans share the value of respect and care
for others. And in particular, this episode highlights the importance
for schools and community to continue to work together to mould
the character and values of our young people. Ultimately, shaping
the values and attitudes of our young people is a collaborative
effort and one that is always a work-in-progress. We will continue
to work hard at educating our young to respect and value others.</p>

I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Through Character and
Citizenship Education (CCE), we try to inculcate values that we
hope students will grow up with. But how can this be further emphasised
to students because, as it is, there is already segregation among
the different academic streams in schools, for instance? And will
the establishment of the two new specialised schools for Normal
(Technical) further segregate students who are of lower academic ability
from other students?</p>

is always very mindful of. I talked earlier about the mindset of
students and what we are doing in each and every school through
Character and Citizenship Education to cultivate sound values and

child is different and that learning needs and abilities are different.
And that is why we have customised progression pathways that are
different. Not just one single track, but multiple pathways to cater
to the different abilities and needs of students. No single pathway
is superior to another. That should not be the mindset. The diverse
pathways are meant to cater to different learning needs and each
one customised for people with different needs. Somebody may be
academically slower and they may need a longer time to study and
to progress in their pathway, but they may be a slow learner initially
and a faster learner later on. What we also want to do is to have
many bridges and ladders across the different pathways, so that
as you progress along one pathway and as you do well subsequently,
you can move on to a different pathway – adapted, again, and customised

lot of effort and investment to develop these different pathways,
to resource these pathways appropriately and to have customised

a real one that we have to continuously reach out and get people
to understand: that no pathway is superior to another, that these
are multiple pathways for learning, catered to children with different
abilities and needs, and we should embrace all of these different
learning pathways. As each person, embarking on a particular pathway,
achieves success, we should embrace that broader definition of success

Supplementary question, Sir. I am happy that the Minister of State
mentioned engagement with parents. In my engagement with parents
of children in the Gifted Programme, very often, my friends and
colleagues expressed their concerns about the students being different,
thinking differently and sometimes they even mention the word "elitist".
How do we partner with parents to help them bring up their children
with proper values because sometimes the parents themselves are
worried? Even though they want the kids to be in the Gifted Programme,
they also see the concern as something which they need to manage.</p>

goes back to what we can do through our schools and through our teachers.
Yes, there are different pathways and there are some which are catered
to students who are academically very strong. I think it is good
that they are able to cope with their studies and they will do very
well. Some of them go on to great achievements even in international
competitions. But that is where I think within the school system,
the teachers, the principals set the tone and they make sure that the
students are grounded in sound values, in character building --
that is a new emphasis that we have placed through Character and
Citizenship Education and through the curriculum that we are putting
in place through the schools, encouraging each school leader and
the teachers to think about how best to implement this curriculum,
not just within the school environment but also involving parents
and the community to make sure that the curriculum is something
that is effective, something that will truly shape the character
and nurture the right values in each and every child.</p>

I would like to ask the Minister of State and the Ministry if it
is healthy for students to be physically separated in different
schools from a young age: in SAP schools, Special schools, now specialised
Normal schools. Would it not be healthier if, even if they cannot
study in the same academic class, that they could – in the non-academic
periods or time – eat, have recess together, play and interact from
a younger age? I know it is easier said than done, and I would ask
if the Ministry is open to consider piloting models that will test
more effective inclusion and integration practices, so that children
from different backgrounds can be educated together from a young age
just like some of us – the older ones amongst us – were educated
that way when we were young. </p>

the Member for the question. I am not so old but I remember growing up,
going to school in Tanjong Katong Technical and that was the situation,
too – an integrated environment – and we had students from all sorts
of diverse backgrounds. Certainly, we want to do that, and the majority
of our schools are like that. I think we have a few specialised
schools catering to a select group of students where we think that,
from an educational point of view, they may be better served because
it is a more homogeneous group and their needs are very different,
and so more special attention, a customised curriculum can be developed
to reach out to this group. It is a balance. We cannot take that approach
and take it to an extreme. Then certainly every school will be specialised
and then you would really have very separate and distinct groups
of people rather than integration as we would like it to be. </p>

and deliberate environment, and we are monitoring the results of
what we are doing. For example, in the new specialised schools for
students who did not qualify for Normal (Technical), at least, the
initial evidence shows that they are doing quite well. Academically,
they are coping better in this new environment. As we monitor, we
will feel our way forward, in terms of evolving new models. But,
certainly, I agree with the Member that we will be very open to
looking at different models, new ways of promoting better integration.
We have a school system the way it is with the mainstream schools
across the board, but a few very specialised institutions catering

at an early age when our children are growing up, and for these
schools to come up with more programmes. And we would be quite happy
to work with the community, in terms of thinking of new programmes
that would help students in these specific institutions integrate
better with peers of different backgrounds. That is something we
would explore developing even more of. But I think our fundamental
approach is to look at the students' needs, to look at the students'
abilities and to try as far as possible to make sure that we have
a programme and a curriculum that addresses each child's needs and
maximises his or her potential. That is what we have done. It is
an education system that is student-centric. It is meant to be focused

Mr Speaker, Sir, I thank the Minister of State for his reply on

is to resource all our schools well, not just a few schools. And
this is what we have done and we will continue to do so. We provide
the same base funding to all schools which have significantly increased over

maintain a balance of the quality of MOE teachers allocated across

it is not possible to have a single ruler to measure success. The
principals know how to allocate or make sure that there are teachers

of different profiles. That is what the principals do. MOE has constant
dialogue with the principals, with the school leaders, to make sure
that this is done appropriately at the school level.</p>

                  </span>: Thank
you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me to join in this interesting discussion. I
would like to follow up on the specialised Normal (Technical) school.
I can understand the rationale is that we want to have more resources
to be channelled to this group of students, because at the current moment,
each school has maybe just one or two Normal (Technical) classes
and it is difficult to find the resources. Is there going to be
a trend that there is going to be more of these specialised Normal (Technical)
schools spread across Singapore? And whether MOE will instead consider
perhaps clustering resources together so that, perhaps, within the
cluster, they can help to set examination papers across the Normal
(Technical) classes in the schools? Or maybe MOE can do that, so
that we can still let these Normal (Technical) students stay in
a normal school rather than separate them?</p>

                  </span>: I thank
the Member for the supplementary question. In fact, the second part of
what he said is already happening. Within the clusters in the zone,
the teachers who are involved in teaching Normal (Technical) do
share notes, do come together and share experiences and resources.
But the specialised schools are really a step forward in terms of
thinking about perhaps a different way of doing things. So it is, to some extent,
an experiment in terms of trying out something different where we have
a specialised institution catered to this group of people, appropriately
resourced, with a different curriculum catered to them.</p>

cons, and we have to strike a balance. There is no plan for us now
to expand these specialised schools because this is something new.
As I mentioned earlier, we are developing these programmes and we
are looking very hard and monitoring the results of what is happening
through these schools. The initial findings are positive. We think
these children are coming out better and they are coping better
in their studies, and they are learning better, more effectively.
That does not mean that we should proliferate and expand them. I
do not think there are any plans now. But what we would want to do,
as I mentioned, is to focus on these institutions to see how they
can do better, in terms of developing their children in these schools.
At the same time, we will take up Ms Denise Phua's suggestion of programmes
that can better integrate students across different institutions.
We are working on multiple approaches. These are things that we
will continue to evolve and develop. If we think there are indications
that a particular programme offers success and is useful, then we
would look at ways to expand it in the most effective manner.</p>

Sir, I thank the Minister for the answer. There are residents who
have come and approached me, and they are singles without family
members, not very well to do, so they cannot quite afford the high
Cash-over-Valuation (COVs) of the resale flats or buying a flat
from the open market. There is not much option for them, really.
What can be done? Can there be Studio Apartments, small apartments
with shorter leases for them, instead of just for the elderly, those
who are above 55 years old?</p>

Studio Apartments are not quite the option because they were really not
designed for such young singles, and also because the Studio Apartments
are already on very short leases, of 30 years, which are quite appropriate
for retirees. For young singles, I am not quite sure whether that
is appropriate. Of course, as I have explained in this House two
sittings ago, there is a wide range of potential house buyers. Housing
is a very complex problem. I have to approach this problem systematically. I
have to set priorities. In due course, I would be able to address
all the various segments. But I decided to zero in for the first
12 months of my term on the first timers. I think we are delivering some
results, which now allow me, as I blogged about last night, to for
the next 12 to 24 months focus on the second timers. That itself
is another very big group, with a wide range of needs and differing needs.
It is a subject that is now occupying my mind. In due course, I
will tackle the other buyer groups, for example, the singles, too.</p>

their current flat, buy a Studio Apartment and have a decent amount

last Sunday, in one of my MPS cases, there was such an elderly gentleman.
A retiree, living in a 5-room flat and a widower. So, he is all
alone and he decided to just sell the 5-room flat, apply for a Studio
Apartment, and he will have some cash which he can then keep for his
retirement. So, that certainly is a good option. It is not the only
option for seniors but MND offered this option which I think can
be quite attractive for some of these seniors. We intend to expand
it. I have been looking at the application rates for the Studio
Apartments – quite good, quite healthy, not overly subscribed, but
well taken up, practically 100%. So far, we have launched 6,000
units. Last year alone, we launched 2,300 units. This year, I will
continue to press on.</p>

                  </span>: Let me begin by providing a recap on the purpose
of Electronic Road Pricing (ERP). The ERP is a tool to manage congestion.
It is not for revenue generation. The rates are set and reviewed
based on the latest traffic conditions. The key measure of the effectiveness
of ERP, of course, is whether it is able to keep traffic speeds
within the optimal range, rather than the amount that is collected
by each gantry. </p>

for each Financial Year from 2009 to 2011 was about $149 million
for FY 2009, $159 million for FY 2010 and $97 million up till the
end of October 2011. The ERP gantries that collected the highest
and lowest amount per day based on a typical month's weekday average
are at Nicoll Highway for the highest and Upper Boon Keng Road for
the lowest. For Nicoll Highway, it is $32,000 and for Upper Boon
Keng Road, it is $130. </p>

                  </span>: I should
explain the difference, why the Nicoll Highway gantry seems to have such
a high collection at $32,000 and Upper Boon Keng Road only $130
per weekday. For Upper Boon Keng Road, the gantry operates for about
half an hour in the morning from 8.30 am to 9.00 am. That is the
only time that it operates. The Nicoll Highway gantry operates from
7.30 am to 8.00 pm, rests two hours, and from 10.00 am to 12 noon.
The durations of operation are different, and the rates are different.</p>

some of these gantries, for example, like at Upper Boon Keng Road,
is that they are part of an outer cordon through which vehicles
have to pass in order to get to the city, and we also need to control
the movement of vehicles in this direction. We have to make sure
that we have a cordon that is sufficiently effective. We look at
the speeds every quarter. When the speeds are above the optimal
range, we have the option then to reduce the rates or to do away
with it altogether, as we have done for CTE in the morning for certain
hours. We have also done it for the CTE northbound, at night. The
last time we looked at the Upper Boon Keng gantry, the speeds were
not above the optimum range. They were within the optimum range
and, hence, we continued to operate the gantry. </p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, workers staying in foreign workers' dormitories
come from many different employers. They are currently transported
to and from their workplaces by their employers or by private transport
operators. The modes of transportation include chartered buses,
mini-buses and lorries. These are private arrangements made between
employers, private transport operators and the foreign workers.</p>

employers to have flexibility in deciding how best to safely and
efficiently transport workers between the dormitories and the workplaces,
instead of the Government mandating a single approach for all employers
to adopt. This is because employers' requirements could differ significantly,
depending on the number of workers they have, as well as the nature
of work, location and working hours of their workers.</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, for a country with a voting population of only
2.1 million citizens, Ministerial salaries in Singapore are by far
the highest in the world. It should therefore come as no surprise
to anyone in this Chamber that the debates surrounding Ministerial
salaries are also the most emotive anywhere in the world as well.
In the minds of many citizens, Ministers cannot make mistakes. The
connection is logical. If you pay top dollar, you would expect top
performance.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-08d450d4-eb3f-46ed-9c17-ee5b9df421cc"><!--a--></a>Over the Christmas period,
I took the opportunity to ask friends and relatives what they would consider
to be a fair wage to pay a Minister and an MP in Singapore. Although
this was not a scientific exercise by any stretch, on average, the
figure for an MP hovered around the $10,000 mark, while the total
wage for a Minister, excluding his or her MP's salary, ranges from
$30,000 to $50,000, bonuses included. As reinforced by the Committee,
with figures such as these, no Minister would need to worry about
his ability to meet the financial needs of his family or have to
face a drastic reduction in his standard of living. Many whom I
spoke to were shocked that Ministers have hitherto received their pension.
If anything, public servants who have for the longest time deserved
the pension are our Division 3 and Division 4 civil servants, some
of whom draw a salary of around the $1,500 mark. But paradoxically,
even years after the private sector removed this anachronism, the
PAP Government persisted in retaining for their high flyers until
this Committee's recommendations. </p>

reaction of Singaporeans is completely logical and understandable.
A few months ago, I asked via a Parliamentary Question the monetary
amount each Minister in the last Cabinet could expect to receive
in pension. The Prime Minister, however, gave an answer to another
question – one that was not asked – instead explaining how pensions
are calculated. The reluctance to reveal hard numbers provides yet
another glimpse into the reasons behind the emotive reaction of
Singaporeans to Ministerial salaries. I can confidently say that
this Government will never release how much each retiring Minister
received in pension, although I hope I will be proved wrong, especially
since one PAP MP
announced on Monday that Ministerial salaries are transparent and
published. Well, following that logic, we should expect the pensions
received by retiring Ministers to be published as well.</p>

landscape today is anchored by expectations of significantly higher levels
of transparency and accountability. To that end, the Committee must
be commended for its decision to remove the very concept of a pension
for Ministers. In my mind, this has been an apocal recommendation
made by Gerard Ee's Committee and I hope Singaporeans duly credit
them for it. They did not just remove pensions for Ministers. They
have set the benchmark for good governance, accountability and transparency
in public service. The Workers' Party welcomes this development
as the high water mark of the Committee's recommendations.</p>

transparency and accountability that the Workers' Party proposes
a simple, straightforward formula by which to determine political
salaries. Unlike what was reported by <em class="ph i">The Straits Times</em> today,
specifically one headline which read "WP proposals on pay not that
different", the principles behind the Workers' Party's proposals
differ significantly. The reasons for these differences were, perhaps,
best illustrated by Deputy Prime Minister Teo on the first day of
this Debate. Because it is the principles behind the numbers that
matter. Where the Committee could have done much better was to remove
this concept of pegging Ministerial salaries to the top 1,000 earners
in Singapore. It also persisted in pegging MPs' salaries to a percentage
of the Administrative Service superscale -- yet another visage of
elitism that should not be extended to the political realm.</p>

Mr Chen Show Mao, made the point about pegging political salaries
with the rank and file of the civil service in his speech on the
first day, at the MX9 level. But no PAP MP wanted to go there. It
is apparent that the PAP are fine with pegging salaries to an elite
corps of individuals, many of whom, discerning Singaporeans note,
are also cultivated for PAP political office. In the minds of these
discerning Singaporeans, the PAP Ministerial selection process is
clear. You have to be selected as a Minister first before becoming
an MP.</p>

this Administrative Service elephant in the committee's report.
One of them only managed to scratch the surface of the issue. Expectedly,
that MP was the veritable conscience of the PAP, Ms Denise Phua,
and the other was Mr Lim Biow Chuan. If I heard Ms Phua correctly,
she wanted Administrative Service salaries to be reduced in line
with the spirit of the recommendations of Mr Ee's Committee. Singaporeans
should know why she felt that way. What is so special about this
elite corps of 300-odd Administrative Service scholars out of the
127,000-strong civil service, a mere 0.02% of all civil servants?
And why is the MPs' salary pegged to a percentage of the Administrative
Service salary and why not to those of ordinary civil servants?</p>

off my speech by referring to how much emotion political salaries
generate in Singapore. The essence of the WP's proposals, specifically
the de-linkage of MP's salary to some percentage of the Administrative
Service salary and the top 1,000 earners' peg for Ministers, was precisely
formulated by the Workers' Party to remove this emotion from any
debate on Ministerial salaries, and to remove the overbearing odour
of elitism from political office. It is the Workers' Party's contention
that when you remove the connection to elitism, you take the emotive
element out of the debate. </p>

connection to the top 1,000 and to the Administrative Service, respectfully,
the Committee has missed an opportunity to fundamentally address
the emotive reaction of Singaporeans to political salaries. In <em class="ph i">The
Straits Times</em> today, Review Editor, Ms Chua Mui Hoong, wrote
and I quote: "The issue of Ministerial salaries will continue to
draw heated disagreement. The formula will be tweaked again, and
the future Prime Minister would have to stand up in Parliament and seek
the support of MPs and Singaporeans for yet another round of changes."
If this comes to pass, it would indeed be a most unfortunate eventuality.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-192b2a32-2cda-4dfa-a27d-047441a9d935"><!--a--></a>Like my party colleagues, I trawled the
Hansard for a record of previous debates on political salaries. Nothing
this Government has said over the last three days signalled a real
shift in the mindset of how to peg political salaries. Substantively,
it certainly looks like business as usual. The Workers' Party proposed
the MPs' be pegged to the MX9 level, the starting salary of entry-grade
civil servants into the superscale ranks, not the elite Administrative
Service scale when an officer at the age of 32 should expect to
receive around $400,000 a year, depending on bonuses. If the Government
pegs political salaries at the rank-and-file level of the civil
service, a level the average Singaporean can aspire to, you remind
all political aspirants what it means to be a servant-leader and
you unmistakably inject substantive empathy into Singapore's political
culture.</p>

next, and, like many developed countries around the world, you choose
a suitable multiple that is politically acceptable to Singaporeans.
We opine that Singaporeans can be persuaded by the reasoning behind
the Workers' Party proposals. While they may be close to the Committee's
proposal, the Workers' Party certainly expects a reality check on
the 13.5-month bonus a Minister can receive – a figure that flies
in the face of the Committee's commitment to clean salaries. For
the record, standing to secure a bonus of half your salary can hardly
be expressed as a clean salary. In monetary terms, it is akin to
the perks some MPs in other countries get, like a car or housing allowance.
With respect to the Committee, the Workers' Party proposal of a
five-month bonus is much clearer, much cleaner and publicly conscionable.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-0f63a6cd-42d6-401d-95fe-870079ae9682"><!--a--></a>As many Singaporeans would
understand by now, the Workers' Party proposals take their cue from the
rank-and-file of the civil service. Ordinary respectable civil servants
who represent the spine and the spirit of the public service. One
PAP MP was dissatisfied with the dental benefit of $70 the Committee proposed
for Ministers. But if the rank-and-file civil service is extended
a $70 dental benefit, why should it be different for Ministers?
Do they have golden teeth? If this Government wants its Ministers
to have more dental benefits, then extend the same privilege to
our civil servants, for they serve the public, too. This is much
preferred instead of treating Ministers differently. They are MPs
and public servants first.</p>

call for super heroes, as one PAP MP suggested. It calls for servant leadership.
Servant-leaders are those who back proposals that are akin to what
mainstream Singaporeans can aspire to. As the Workers' Party numbers
show, this is achievable and you can still attract high quality
individuals to politics, but only if you do not limit your MPs to
come from the top 10% to 20% richest Singaporeans, as PAP MP Mrs
Josephine Teo desires. Other PAP MPs have gone about the shortcomings
of Workers' Party approach: to apply a multiple to MP's salary and
thereby deduce the salary for Ministers.</p>

arbitrary and that you could decide to pay your Ministers by working backwards
from a pre-determined figure. I was a little surprised to hear this
from MPs like Mr Vikram Nair and Mr Zaqy Mohamad because the reasoning
behind the Committee's proposals is no less arbitrary. As recommended
by the Committee, MP's allowance is pegged to 17.5% of an entry-level Administrative
Service superscale scholar. Ministers get a 40% discount of the
salaries of the top 1,000 earners. Is that not arbitrary? Why not
10% or 12.5% of entry-level Admin Service super-scalers, or a 50%
discount for Ministers as opposed to 40%? Can you not get to the
figures you want, by manipulating these percentages? But it leaves
me to acknowledge the intellectual honesty of Mdm Halimah Yacob who
noted that whilst a specific multiple for Ministerial salaries proposed
by the Workers' Party can be interpreted to be arbitrary, so were
the numbers and percentages contained in the Committee's recommendations.</p>

the WP and PAP proposals are arbitrary, and I think the intellectually honest
in this Chamber will be the first to raise their hands and say there
is a lot of truth to this. But the difference lies in the principles behind
the WP's proposal. We seek to persuade Singaporeans that political
salaries ought to be underwritten by a key Workers' Party philosophy:
that public service is open to all Singaporeans. The privilege of
being of service to your fellow countrymen is the attraction of
being an MP. You are an MP first before becoming a Minister. Public
service in Singapore is for all Singaporeans, and opportunities
to be a Minister should not be restricted or institutionalised to
the few with silver spoons.</p>

if human resource is indeed our most precious commodity, as Mr Gan Thiam
Poh has reasoned, then it is indeed pragmatic that we send the right
signal to all Singaporeans and open the prospects of political service,
including becoming Ministers, to all Singaporeans, not just the
top 10% to 20%. The Prime Minister also alluded to the difficulty
that PAP may face recruiting individuals to become Ministers if
salaries are not competitive. With respect, I would urge the Prime Minister
to leave some room to consider the possibility that perhaps it is
not the salary, career or family circumstances that is the issue.
On the contrary, another reason could be that in light of the new
normal, talented people feel that the PAP is no longer capable of
hosting the aspirations for Singapore and no salary can move them.</p>

believe that choosing the appropriate benchmark is critical as it
sends an unmistakable signal when the principles behind your salary
peg is at a level the average Singaporean can empathise with and
aspire to. In doing so, we believe that the emotions that have justifiably
bedevilled the debate on political salaries over these decades will
finally be assuaged. I may not have convinced this House but I certainly
hope to have convinced Singaporeans that while the numbers behind
the PAP and WP recommendations may not be worlds apart, the principles
behind them most certainly are. Mr Speaker, Sir, I oppose the principles
behind the salary benchmarks chosen by the Committee and therefore
I oppose the motion.</p>

first question Mr Yee asked was whether I made my recommendations to
the Committee: the short answer is "yes, I did" but I did it in
writing because I did not think I was sufficiently special to ask
for an audience. The second, and this is the more fundamental question:
what is the difference I think between the Workers' Party's proposal
in terms of salary and ours because I think the Member asked me
to check with the Prime Minister why he said it was higher and I
said it was lower. The answer is actually quite simple. I think
I should perhaps correct the error which I realised Mr Chen mentioned
in his Facebook page yesterday as well. The Workers' Party's starting
salary for Ministers is $55,000. That is also the benchmark. On
the Committee's side, however, the benchmark is $55,000 but the
starting salary is lower. So, it is $47,250. That is one of the
key differences. Now, what is the result of that difference? The
result of that difference is that the Workers' Party's proposal
results in a higher base pay for the starting Minister but a lower
maximum bonus, whereas on the Committee's proposal, the starting
salary would be lower but the variable bonus is higher. So what
does this mean in principle? This means that earlier ---</p>

is that in a year when performance targets are not met, the Workers'

targets are met or exceeded, the Committee's proposal will provide
more pay. That is the key difference in terms of how they work.
The final question is how we should vote. I think one of the key
points I was making is obviously we should all vote according to
our conscience but there is not much difference in principle. We
all believe public service should be the most important thing. Now,
the Workers' Party has not said the salary should be reasonable,
but looking at your proposal, the salaries are in the same ballpark.
So, I think there is a lot of common ground. All I was hoping to
do is to highlight the common ground.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7cd7c33b-0fce-43d2-af0f-85f339f806ce">
                  <a name="motion__id-7cd7c33b-0fce-43d2-af0f-85f339f806ce"><!--a--></a>Now, in terms of Mr Singh's
point that I highlighted that the Workers' Party's proposal was arbitrary,
that was not really as a criticism but more actually to highlight
the fact that whatever formula you come up with, there is some element
of arbitrariness. But one point I should make is that the Workers'
Party arrived at $55,000, apparently independently by coincidence
at the same number as the Committee did. What is interesting is
that the probability of two four-digit numbers coinciding is miniscule,
as anyone who has bought 4D would tell you. The probability of two
five-digit numbers coinciding, I would say, is probably miraculous.
This means there is probably some special agreement between us.</p>

can his colleagues not try to punctuate every comment that they
make in Parliament with the Workers' Party brand. This is no more

to try to politicise and brand the party every time we discuss important

you, Mr Speaker. I would just like to reply to one point by Mr Vikram Nair
about this $55,000 versus $47,000. Mr Vikram Nair seems very determined
to prove that the Workers' Party's proposal is higher than that
of the Committee. Now, we have always been, in our recommendation,
focusing on the main principles behind our proposal which I feel
is important, the starting point from the MP pay. So, we have been
using benchmark pay versus the Committee's benchmark pay. Of course,
we understand that when we go into details, there will be some salary
range and, as the Committee proposed, it will be between 0.85 times
and 1.1 times of the benchmark. Workers' Party has not gone into
the details of this because we feel it is not necessary at this
point. It is better to debate on the broad principles. I do not
know for whatever reasons he wants to continue to harp on these reasons
that ours is higher than the Committee's, but I do not feel this
is necessary and actually diverts attention from the main point
that we are bringing up.</p>

                  </span>: Yes, Mr Giam
is not here, so I would just ask Mr Singh then whether they are
aware that it is a commonly accepted remuneration practice that
the more senior the position, the greater the weightage of remuneration
is placed on bonus. So, for instance, it is typical for a CEO to
have more than half his remuneration based on bonus. The idea here
is not that it is not a clean wage, it is made quite transparent
so the Committee has made it clear that with the good bonus, a Minister
would get $1.1 million. That is out in the open. The idea of having
a heavier weightage of bonus is to make it clear that the Minister
will not get that pay unless his performance is in keeping with
KPIs which include national outcomes which improve the lot of Singaporeans.
And my request for clarification is, does Mr Pritam Singh not accept
that that is consistent with the principle of having a Minister
being made accountable for
his performance, not just with his own KPIs but with that of nationally
set outcomes which better the lives of all Singaporeans?</p>

                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
thank you very much. I would like to thank the hon Member for his question
also. I think he has probably put in the best way possible why the
principles behind our proposals are so different. We are not looking
at the private sector, the CEOs in the private sector, how bonuses
are paid out to them. We are looking at the rank-and-file civil
service. I believe that political salaries ought to have some comparison
with the rank-and-file civil service. Now, if the rank-and-file civil
service are not paid double-digit bonuses, then we feel in the same
way that Ministers should not get double-digit bonuses.</p>

point that I tried to make in my speech was, if you pay these high
bonuses, sure, it may be common or expected for CEO of GE or some
other big MNC but what that works out in reality is an additional
part of your wage which when you compare with other countries, you
have these additional perks, motorcycle allowances, bicycle allowances
that Mr Inderjit Singh spoke about. We feel that it comes to the
same thing, in some different roundabout way. So, what we are saying
is, there is a cleaner way to reach that clean wage definition,
and that is by keeping bonuses a little bit modest and sober.</p>

that Ministers would be somehow less accountable? I do not believe
so and my party also does not believe so. We feel that bonuses can

Mr Speaker, Sir, I think Mr Pritam Singh probably misheard me when
I spoke yesterday. There was a point where the Workers' Party talked
about how the benchmarks result in monetising the value of political
office, and I said that even the benchmarks made by the Workers'
Party is an attempt to put some cash value, cash component to the
work contribution of the Ministers. So, in that sense, would you
then argue that this was an attempt to monetise the value of political
office?</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-25de83ec-d355-4bd2-8256-79f4d43e053d">
                  <a name="motion__id-25de83ec-d355-4bd2-8256-79f4d43e053d"><!--a--></a>The second point I said
was that whatever benchmark used will always be subject to question.
And in any event, how did the Workers' Party come to a multiple
of five times when it comes to the remuneration for Ministers? One
could also question whether that is a right benchmark. So that was
in the context of the point I made, whatever benchmarks, including
the benchmarks made by the Workers' Party, why must it be a multiple
of five, why not a multiple of two, why not a multiple of seven?
And in that context, every form of benchmark would be subject to
question.</p>

that is precisely what I am saying as well, that any benchmark will be
arbitrary. And I think the Member Mr Zaqy was suggesting that the
Workers' Party's multiple was arbitrary
but the difference between him and you -- not "you", I cannot say
"you" -- between him and Mdm Halimah Yacob, the important thing
that she did was she pointed out that both parties, both proposals,
had an element of arbitrariness to it, and I respected that.</p>

to seek a clarification. This is to Mr Pritam Singh, of course.
I was just puzzling over his comments about what I said and thinking
about the proposals that have been put forward by Members from the
Workers' Party. Well, as it turns out, the number that the Member
has proposed to pay a Minister, is actually not very different from
the number that the Committee chaired by Mr Gerard Ee is paying.
What that means, in effect, is that the Member is also proposing
to draw roughly from the same population that the Committee is proposing
to draw from, to fill our political leadership. So, how is it then
that the Committee's proposal is elitist but then the Workers' Party's
is not elitist? That is the part I fail to understand.</p>

we are coming from was best enunciated by the Deputy Prime Minister
on the first day. It is not the numbers that is the issue. It is
the principle behind those numbers. And we have moved away from
pegging Ministerial salaries to the salaries of the top 1,000 and
the Administrative Service. And that is the principle we are getting
at. And what we are suggesting is we do not need to peg it to people
right up there. Peg it to the average Singaporean, at a level where
Singaporeans can aspire to, not the numbers, the principle.</p>

I not hear Members agreeing that the principles that were enunciated

to, unless I heard you wrongly? The second thing is that I also remember
very distinctly the Deputy Prime Minister when he talked about pegging
the salaries at number 1,000, he also distinctly said it does not
mean we only draw people from around that salary range. Did he not
make that clear or did you not pick that up?</p>

one pegging the salaries to the top 1,000. Again, we do not agree

Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to ask for the hon Member, Mr
Pritam Singh's opinion whether he agrees that the Workers' Party
recommends that an independent body look at the salaries of the
political appointment holders, the Ministers and the MPs going forward;
whether he imagines that this body would seek a wide range of opinion
from Members of this House - from the PAP, the WP and any other
members of parties that may be present in the future. And I would
like to specifically ask whether he believes this has already happened.
It appears that Mr Ee's Committee, as an independent body, has sought
views of the PAP MPs, it has sought views of the WP MPs and has
come up with a non-partisan recommendation. And if he does not agree
that it has happened, could he explain why? If he does agree that
this has happened, could he explain why the WP does not support
the motion, Sir?</p>

I beg your pardon. I did not catch the initial parts of Dr Janil's questions
because I was checking on the comments made by Deputy Prime Minister
Teo. From what I understand from the report -- and if I have made
a mistake or error, I apologise to this House because I think it
is only honourable for me to do so – but where I am coming from
really related to the numbers and I felt that the numbers were high
and those numbers are specific, quite similar to Administrative Service
officer salary numbers. But it is very clear in the Report that
it is at the MR4 level and I acknowledge the error that I made.
Could I ask Dr Janil to repeat his questions, please?</p>

                  </span>:
Mr Speaker, Sir, when I entered politics in 2006, I had to leave my
public sector job of 10 years to join a local real estate company.
I was fortunate that my subsequent two-and-a-half years there coincided
with a period of property boom and, as with many other colleagues, I
enjoyed about nine months' of bonus, stock options and accommodation
perks as the company also owned a serviced apartment subsidiary.
Three years ago, I made another career switch and joined an international
public relations consultancy where I still am now. This company
practises a 12-month salary package and, comparing apple to apple,
the terms and conditions are much less attractive.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a4377bca-18dc-4c02-baa9-c04b229e89db">
                  <a name="motion__id-a4377bca-18dc-4c02-baa9-c04b229e89db"><!--a--></a>However, I know that I
should not make comparisons as it is a different industry now. I
made a switch because I wanted to try something different and, looking
back, I am happy that I made a jump, as I am now convinced that
communications is where my heart is. Joining this line has offered
me many good opportunities to develop as a professional and as a
person. It is also very relevant to my role as an MP.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2fd486f3-dc13-42a6-b29a-1bad1c419ba4">
                  <a name="motion__id-2fd486f3-dc13-42a6-b29a-1bad1c419ba4"><!--a--></a>If I have expected the
PR company to match or better the annual package and all the perks
I used to enjoy, I would not have taken up the offer and would have
missed entering a new, exciting phase of my career. As the Chinese
saying goes: 赛翁失马，焉知非福.What we may lose
now could give us better returns in future. So, we should not miss
the forest for the trees.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-9211290d-8adc-4570-a8da-b916f91ab38f"><!--a--></a>The job of a political
appointee is fundamentally different. It is not a position we can
apply to. First, there is no application form. You need to be first
elected by the people. And we have seen how voters' choice can change
a person's destiny overnight. Then, the Prime Minister appoints
his Cabinet. And it does not mean that once you are a Minister,
you are going to stay as a Minister forever. There are now several
veteran former Ministers serving as MPs. </p>

yesterday that he does not discuss the terms and conditions with
his prospective Ministers. As we can see this time round after GE,
our Ministers were already working hard in their jobs without knowing
what they will be getting. And the cycle starts again every five
years. I need to add that it is not easy to resign or quit for a
Minister, if he or she finds a better opportunity or he or she does
not like the work. It is like a five-year contract with no exit
clause. In 1985, during a debate on Ministerial pay, Mr Lee Kuan
Yew responded to Mr JB Jeyaretnam's proposal to cut Ministerial wages
by at least a third, "And then we all become honourable men who
have suddenly sacrificed ourselves for duty and public service."</p>

to a lower pay does not make one more honourable. Likewise, being
a Minister, whether past, present or future at a higher pay does
not mean the Minister is less honourable. At this point in time,
whether it is 53% for the Speaker, 37% for a junior Minister or
3% for MPs, this should not affect our commitment to serve the country,
community and people of Singapore. It is a commitment that we all
made when we went to the polls. Our constituents have voted us in
and it is our duty to do our best to serve them.</p>

will affect some people who are considering politics. Yes, we all

hope that there will be enough good and talented Singaporeans who
are not put off by material limitations. We need to have better
faith in our fellow countrymen. Hence, I support that while we need to
pay decent salaries, we need not be fixated on matching private
sector pay. I fully applaud the discount taken off the benchmark. </p>

in a company, only your boss and HR know your salary. Your superior
does your appraisal and HR policies guide your salary adjustments.
However, almost everyone will feel that he is underpaid and deserve

by Member Yee Jenn Jong's clarification yesterday that the Workers' Party
(WP) had met Gerard Ee for two hours, but had chosen not to share
with him and his Committee all the points that his party has made
in this debate in the last three days. Instead they kept some suggestions
to be raised only in Parliament. Even if all WP's suggestions to
the Committee were not incorporated in the final report, they could
still have raised them in Parliament. So either they have not thought
through this matter thoroughly, or they have changed their position,
or perhaps there are other political motivations, I wonder. In fact,
I am also a bit confused by the position taken now. I thought I understood
WP's points that they are taking a different approach and, hence,
the principles about how the salaries should be benchmarked or calculated,
although the quantums are the same. But I heard Mr Pritam Singh's
point just now that he made the reference towards Administrative
Service pay – not in principle but because the quantum was similar
to what is proposed by the Review Committee – so I am getting confused. </p>

will never be a right formula. We can have an issue over the approach
whether it is pegged to top 48th, 1,000th or 10,000th salaries,
or should it be benchmarked against the lower percentile, or the
civil service? I think we all agree that the public duty should
have a discount, but is it a 40% or 80% discount? I think we all
agree that it is arbitrary and very subjective.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-9183fe01-88fd-4f3b-bfc4-9eb808bf6cc5"><!--a--></a>Sir, I would like to make
two suggestions. One, given that the benchmarks are based on the
1,000th salaries, there will be a one to two-year lag before data
are available from IRAS. Hence, the situation may happen when top
Singaporean earners enjoy healthy income increments in a buoyant
economy, but when these salaries are used as the benchmark two years
later, Singapore has gone into a recession. It then becomes politically
not tenable to increase political salaries when people are being
retrenched. We have seen it happened several times when increments
based on the previous formula were deferred or forgone. I suggest
that we fix the salary and have no adjustment for the full term
of Parliament – that is, a fixed fee for a five-year contract. The
National Bonus and Performance Bonus can stay.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-17119fd6-c821-4878-9eda-4821cdcf9380">
                  <a name="motion__id-17119fd6-c821-4878-9eda-4821cdcf9380"><!--a--></a>I initially wanted to
suggest an annual salary adjustment based on our Consumer Price
Index. However, I know critics will jump to say that there is a
conflict of interest as Ministers would then have no incentive to
keep inflation down. So, therefore I know we cannot win on this,
so let us keep it simple and stay with a flat basic monthly salary
for five years.</p>

While I agree that we should have a "clean wage" without any hidden benefits
and perks, I cannot help but agree with Member Denise Phua and disagree
with Member Mr Pritam Singh that the medical benefits are really
quite basic. I believe people can accept that our political leaders
should have the best medical care either with increased coverage
or even free of charge. We all cannot choose when or whether to
fall ill or not, and it is in the interest of the country and Singaporeans that our Prime Minister,
our Ministers are given the necessary medical treatment and recover
well and fast to continue serving the nation. </p>

will consider my two suggestions when it does the review again in five
years' time. On the review frequency of five years, I am not sure
whether the Committee has the intention to coincide it with the
General Elections (GE). I think it may be good to let the Committee decide
political salaries after GE. Hence, no candidates would know what
salaries to expect when they are running for a seat. So perhaps
voters will then be able to assume that all the candidates are really altruistic. </p>

very demanding and critical of politicians, especially since GE
last year. While expectations and standards should not be compromised,
we need not get too emotive. We need to be patient and understanding
that it takes time for the right action to be taken, for issues
to be resolved and things to improve. Hopefully, the salary revisions
will appease people's feelings, whether it is 53% or 3%. Let us
unite as a country and as a people to overcome the many other challenges
facing Singapore. With that, Sir, I support the motion.</p>

you, Mr Speaker. I would like to clarify on the point that is made
by Mr Baey Yam Keng. He asked why we withheld information. I would
like to clarify a few things. Number one, I did not say that he
met Mr Gerard Ee. Mr Giam met the Committee of Gerard Ee. And I

that my colleague, Gerald Giam, met with the Mercer consultants
who were sent by Gerard Ee to seek input from MPs. </p>

to be made, number one, Workers' Party was never asked to be part
of the Committee but, nevertheless, we have very obligingly met
for more than two hours and we shared all the key points that are
in our proposal. There were no changes in our position. We shared
our benchmarking principles, we shared various KPIs and stuff like
that that is needed to be inside. What I meant when we say some
details were not given, of course, we also need time. We met the
Committee quite early in the stage and we ourselves have to convene
our own research to go and gather information from various countries
to benchmark. Of course, we would not have reached, at that point
in time when we met the Committee, all the details that we need
to share. But I would like to say it publicly that there is no shift
in the positions of the Workers' Party and we have not withheld
important information from the Committee.</p>

Sir, I thank the Member for clarifying that and I am surprised that
the Workers' Party expected to be invited to give inputs to the
Review Committee because it was a very public review and any member
of the public was invited to send in their recommendations and suggestions
to the Committee. But I can understand that perhaps the Workers'
Party expected to be invited to give their points. And I did hear
quite clearly yesterday Member Yee's point that not all information
were shared so I now understand that he has now said that not all
the details were not given, but all the principles and approaches
were shared with the Committee. So I take it as what the Member has
explained now.</p>

are not part of the Committee. We are not a member of the Committee.
If we are a member of the Committee, we would have behaved differently.
Of course, we would be part of the research, gathering the data,
analysing together with the Committee.
But having not being part of the Committee, we, nevertheless, gave
other inputs that we felt it is needed. It is the framework that
we have used in our final report. We needed time to gather some data
before we arrive at certain final figures. Was there any other part
that I have missed out?</p>

should this independent committee be formed by non-politicians –
by different segments of the entire society, eminent people to sit
together and decide on the politicians' salaries? So, should the
politicians' salaries be decided by the politicians or by non-politicians?</p>

of service. </p>

as many of my friends are on both sides of the House. And this debate

this service. </p>

in this House, believe that this place called Singapore is our home
and it is worth fighting for. We may have different views, and as
I have said it before, if we strip the politics, the rhetoric out

we care to admit. We should not try to speak as if we are the most
committed, the most passionate, the most principled, etc. We all
are in our ways.</p>

states so eloquently, we serve because it is a privilege, and I
agree. I would add that we serve because it is a calling. It is
not a career. It is an honour that none of us takes lightly. I think
all of us here believe in this. Importantly, we make sure that we
do the real work on the ground. And we serve because we want to
make a difference. For example, there is a prospect of economic
downturn coming, not everything is within our control but we have
been planning on how best to ride it, manage it and to look after
Singaporeans.</p>

Mr Yee Jenn Jong states, Singapore is not a company, nor a business.
It cannot be run as such. All of us agree. It is far more than that.

was made about us being MPs first. Indeed, we are. But I was curious when
hon Member Pritam Singh made these grand statements of a political
nature -- that for us, we are Ministers first, before MPs. There
is no such thing. He added that only the top tier can become Ministers. I
would suggest that it is rather untruthful. We are MPs first unlike
certain MPs who have stated that it is not their responsibility
to look after the low-income group, that it is the Government's
responsibility. </p>

that an MP's pay be based on MX9 because it is an extension of public service.
But then again, MX9 is also based on market considerations. This
is part of the entire pay structure of the civil service -- from
MX9 to beyond the Administrative Service pay. We look at the private
sector pay and adjust it accordingly. MX9 is the entry level to
the Superscale level. So, I suppose we add in some multiples to
make up a credible political number. </p>

one: the Workers' Party formula must come from some foundational perspectives
– either it chooses the market-peg that we have worked on, or it
puts forward another basis altogether. Pegging it to the public
sector sounds good at first glance, but it does not count because
the public sector too derives from that market-peg. So statements
like "Cabinet is not an extension of the Private Sector" again sounds
very good and we agree. But does it not then follow that under the Workers'
Party formulation, "the public sector is an extension of the private"?
Surely not, as well. </p>

a credit card sort of privilege, and membership in Parliament does
come with some privileges. I do not primarily think of it that way
nor many of my fellow Members. For me, it is a calling to serve. It is a hard-won honour,
but more importantly, it is a responsibility. Our responsibility as
leaders is to apply our hearts and also our minds to best serve
our people. There are practical issues we need to manage -- the
budget, sustainability, and trade-offs. They may not be emotive
or gut stirring, but that is what responsible leadership is about. </p>

was that a committee was set up in good faith to seriously review
the political salaries. Yet it now appears that the Opposition has
chosen not to share with the Committee the ideas that they are so
passionately championing. I understand that Mr Yee has explained.
But two days ago, Mr Gerald Giam would not give a clear answer.
But I thought Mr Yee's response yesterday was illuminating. In essence,
the thrust of what he said was -- there is no need to share that
much with the Committee because they would rather table it in Parliament.
But the fact of the matter is that the Review Committee was set
up to review the structure and the robust debate that we have today
can still continue.</p>

But it is more important to carry out our responsibilities as elected
Members of Parliament as best as we can. Ministerial pay is something
we need to decide on. Before the elections, I did make statements
that I think it is something that we should review. I believe the
recommendations are fair. It will provide us with a reasonable basis
to implement this sensibly. With that, Mr Speaker, I support the

Thank you, Mr Speaker. May I seek a clarification from the Member
on whether he sees a difference between the private-sector pay of
the top 1,000, to which the Committee is proposing to peg Ministerial
salaries, and the private-sector pay to which the salaries of our
rank-and-file civil servants outside of the Administrative Service
are compared to in the process of the review of their salaries?</p>

                  </span>: I
thank the hon Member for the question. There is a difference. What
the Committee proposes is using certain segment of the pay and then
bringing it downwards. What you are proposing is to take a segment
of the pay and bring it upwards. The point is that we all recognise
that the way we factor in salaries for the public sector has to
take into cognizance how the private sector pays, because we are
drawing from a pool of people who can move between private and public
sectors. At the MX9 level, obviously at the Director level, it would
be drawing from a pool of people of a certain age at that level,
and then you scale it up. In essence, what I am saying is that while
on the surface it sounds like it is different but, in reality, it
is very similar. The numbers that are thrown up show that, actually, we
are all in the same ballpark; rather, the Committee proposes a model
but then perhaps you choose to spin it in a different way.</p>

The second question I would like to ask the Minister of State and

                  </span>: Sir,
I thank the hon Member for his questions. Firstly, I do not doubt
his sincerity. Let me place that on record. What I cited was what
the Member said in Parliament yesterday. That, in essence, he had
shared and he acknowledged that, and he described it now that he
shared with the Committee some of the views and so on. The Member
provided a bit more details today, which I recognise. But he did
say something that was quite telling, which struck me, and which
I found, on the one hand surprising, but also disturbing that, "Well,
we need not necessarily tell them everything. They can wait for
Parliament because that is what Parliament is for."</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f76f44cb-f5f6-49be-ae84-0ee3cdfa2783">
                  <a name="motion__id-f76f44cb-f5f6-49be-ae84-0ee3cdfa2783"><!--a--></a>And I agree with him that
Parliament is where we can carry out robust debates. But robust
debates on the Ministerial pay structure, as proposed by the Committee,
can still be debated fully and robustly even with providing the
Committee that effort, to actively take in all the considerations
so that they can do as best a job as possible. That is what Parliament
is for. But when committees and various efforts are put in place
to help make things better, we do what we can to help them and to
put it forward. So it was on that point that I found disturbing.
But I do not doubt the Member's sincerity in approach, nor do I doubt
his credentials and his commitment. But I thought the whole approach
was telling from the way the Member put it across.</p>

Sir, thank you very much. I thank the hon Member for his remarks. I
would just like to clarify because I think the impression is being
created that just because not all the Workers' Party MPs participated
in the Committee report or gave recommendations or suggestions that somehow
we came into Parliament to try and undermine the Committee's findings,
recommendations and so forth. I feel that impression is being created.
If the Member feels that the Workers' Party politicised the issue
-- and I think the Member is doing the same -- what I do want to
say is that at no point do we feel that the Committee has been partisan,
has been unfair to us or that they are supporting the Government
or they had that conclusion already and they wanted to proceed to
provide a report that the Government would have rubber-stamped,
not at all. And I want to make that clear to the Member.</p>

am not sure why you feel so troubled. I apologise, no "you". I would like
to thank the hon Member for his clarification. But I am puzzled
why the hon Member feels disturbed because I did not make this allegation.
It was part of the earlier conversation. In my speech, I did not address
this point. But I think it is worthwhile to reflect on the whole
approach. The issue at hand, now that I am here, is that if we are
sincere about trying to change the Ministerial salary structure
for the better, something that would be acceptable for our people,
then it behooves all of us who have perspectives, passionate views,
to help the Committee get to as best a solution as possible. This Committee
is non-partisan. It is made up of people who are respectable, and
it has drawn on many perspectives from the public. As we all know,
there are many different views. It is not easy, but they have done
the best job they can. The question is, and the honest point is,
it does not stop the Opposition from not sharing everything and
choosing to do it and raise it in Parliament. That is your right.
All we are raising is, it is an interesting observation.</p>

like to thank the hon Member for clarifying that he does not doubt
my sincerity. I may be repeating myself again. But I would just
like to put on record that all important points in our proposals
were shared. As you can see, the Committee itself took a much, much
longer time to come up with its own findings. They had a lot of
research to do. Similarly, the Workers' Party itself had to convene
our own research and we had to spend a lot of time to do it. So
when we were called to share, we shared whatever we could at that
point in time. We did not feel that we had withheld any important information.
Nevertheless, we feel that it is enough for them to work with.</p>

                  </span>:
Thank you, Mr Speaker. When this House discussed the issue of Ministerial
salaries in 2007, I focused on the technicalities of the old formula,
and what I thought was wrong with it. But I had failed to appreciate
the bigger issue. Money changes how people look at things. Paying
high salaries can be intellectually reasoned, but it affects the
relationship between the Government and the people.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-0f61a1d6-d9b3-49c0-9253-c5eb6a2c4119">

It has never been, and will never be. We have all, at one time or
another, been critical of something the Government did or failed
to do. But, as former American President Bill Clinton once observed,
a successful country needs both an effective government and a good
economy. No exceptions. In Singapore, we have both. Other government
leaders, international commentators and experts agree that Singapore,
and what we have achieved, is exceptional. This did not happen by
chance. The people of Singapore deserve credit. And so does the
Government.</p>

and are appreciative of what the Government has done. But the issue
of political salaries, more than any other, has shaped the change
in tone of our national dialogue. When we pay top dollar, we expect
top results, and are less forgiving of errors. And so it has become
with the way people treat Government. Any mis-step is met with the
response that mistakes are unacceptable from highly paid leaders.
Things have become more "transactional". The emotional connection,
that redoubtable bond, which Singaporeans have always had with the
Government, and which has been the bedrock of Singapore's success,
is at risk of disappearing. </p>

a difference? Many Singaporeans have shared their thoughts on the subject,
and there are as many opinions as there are people sharing them.
But what I find interesting is that very few are willing to state
precise figures or precise formulas which they would be comfortable with,
let alone what everyone will agree on. I met a group of 30 bright,
young undergraduates and I asked them, "What do you think a Minister
or Prime Minister should be paid?" None of them was willing to offer
a specific figure. They all agreed it was a very difficult issue.
I met with a group of working adults and asked them the same question.
Their answers ranged from $500,000 to $3 million. Again, they accepted
that was a very difficult issue and none of them could say that
they were more right or others were more wrong. No consensus at
all. Even opposition parties cannot agree on the formula or quantum. Some
have declined to go into specifics obviously to avoid scrutiny.</p>

an alternative but, unfortunately, has also decided to play a game
of cat and mouse. I am very puzzled by the exchanges I have been
hearing in the last few days. Let us go back to the beginning. When
the hon Mr Gerald Giam was asked about what he shared with the Committee,
he declined to say, stating and citing that it was private. There
are only two inferences, that is, either the Workers' Party's public
position differs from its private position or that the Workers'
Party has changed its position since the report came out. Otherwise,
why is there anything to hide? Why keep it private? Then NCMP, the
hon Mr Yee, let the cat out of the bag. He made the extraordinary
statement that the Workers' Party did not share everything with
the Committee so that they could raise them in this debate. Today,
he stands up in the House and says that "Oh, it is not that we did
not want to share everything that we had. It's that we were in the
middle of doing research and we were not ready with all our facts and
figures but we shared what we had." But that is not what he told
the House yesterday. I have before me what he told the House and
I quote. He said, "We do not feel that we had to give everything
to the Committee and this is precisely what Parliament is here for."
Later on, he said, "I believe Parliament is where we come up with
another proposal to be decided upon." So, it is quite clear what
the intention was.</p>

up an independent Committee which took many months to ponder over
the proposals, invited feedback from Singaporeans at large, received
over 500 submissions. The whole purpose was to obtain as broad a
feel as possible for the issue and try to come up with the best
possible proposal and formula in the interests of Singapore. The
Workers' Party decided to hold back some of their proposals which
they say were meaningful because they wanted to come to the House
and announce to everyone they have better ideas. In short, they
put their Party's interests before Singapore's interests. I am not
doubting Mr Yee's sincerity but I doubt his consistency. But it
does not matter. Workers' Party can play whatever political games
they want. It is their prerogative. Playing games and fence-sitting
are the privileges of the Opposition. Politics is about making decisions,
and the Government has one to make. </p>

look at all the arguments. And there are many different arguments.
But despite all this, I believe there is much common ground between
Singaporeans on this issue, which is often ignored. I would like
to talk about matters I think we can all agree on. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4121fbb2-0e10-4d0b-b27a-b1b1424fd85a">
                  <a name="motion__id-4121fbb2-0e10-4d0b-b27a-b1b1424fd85a"><!--a--></a>First, we can all agree
that the Prime Minister and the Ministers have very important and
difficult jobs. They affect almost every aspect of our lives. In
fact, is there any other job which has a greater impact on the success
of Singapore and the well-being of Singaporeans? </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-84d32c1f-ee7e-49c3-84af-74a1c831c18e">
                  <a name="motion__id-84d32c1f-ee7e-49c3-84af-74a1c831c18e"><!--a--></a>Second, we can all agree
that we want first-class public services. When the former Chairman
of the US Federal Reserve, Dr Paul Volcker, was in Singapore last
year, he was asked what he thought of our policy on salaries. Dr
Volcker is a world-renowned experienced economist. He has been a
public servant all his life. When introducing him to the audience,
Dr Kishore Mahbubani, I recall, made a point that Dr Volcker was
content to earn a very modest civil servant salary despite the fact
that he could have earned much more in the private sector, and I
believe that was why he was asked that question by the audience. So
I expected him to talk about the privilege of service. He did not.
Dr Volcker's response to the question was simple and astute. He
said it was a good idea to pay public servants well as it is important
to ensure good public services. He cited the US Government's response
to Hurricane Katrina and the BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico as
evidence that the US public services were seriously lacking. In
short, in his view, you need good, capable people to provide good
services, and you should pay good people well. The logic is irrefutable.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-bc9e1e45-5675-4855-973c-aff281a5948a">
                  <a name="motion__id-bc9e1e45-5675-4855-973c-aff281a5948a"><!--a--></a>The third thing we can
agree on is that not every capable person wants a life in politics.
I dare say most do not. There are very good reasons for this, not
least of which is the effect on their families. While we do not
have an intrusive media, there is still a considerable loss of privacy
and a significant impact on personal lives. That includes having
your spouses and children being openly discussed and their conduct
scrutinised. Who wants that? Many will feel, quite understandably,
that that is too high a price, whatever the pay.</p>

we do not want to set salaries so high as to make money the sole
or main reason for seeking office. At the same time, we do not want
it to be so low as to become a disincentive. NCMP Mr Yee says we
are fishing for talent in too small a pond. But if we create financial obstacles
for good, capable people who are willing to step forward to serve,
we are only making that pond smaller. No one wants us to do that.
Everyone wants to make public service open to all Singaporeans.
Paying less does not make the pond bigger. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e779b0d3-eec9-44a0-a877-f82636d0d2cc">
                  <a name="motion__id-e779b0d3-eec9-44a0-a877-f82636d0d2cc"><!--a--></a>Now we come to the nub:
what should we pay capable people who perform critical jobs? This
brings us to the other "s" word, which tends to dominate this debate:
sacrifice. It has been said that public service is a privilege and
not a sacrifice. Again, no one disputes that. But that is not the
argument. The argument is that leaders should make sacrifices because
it demonstrates that they care about what they are doing. That is
another thing we can all agree on: we want our leaders to care about
Singapore. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-33ad815f-bdd8-47a5-a8ec-2074c742fef3">
                  <a name="motion__id-33ad815f-bdd8-47a5-a8ec-2074c742fef3"><!--a--></a>But why do we look at
sacrifice only in money terms? I think we are asking ourselves the
wrong question. It is not how much our leaders should sacrifice,
but what we want from them. I do not want someone who tells me his
best quality is that he loves his country or that money is not important
to him. Because these are the easiest things to say, and there will
be no shortage of people who will tell that just to win approval. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d8226c7b-b65a-44c6-808e-b902b1c73506">
                  <a name="motion__id-d8226c7b-b65a-44c6-808e-b902b1c73506"><!--a--></a>What do I want from our
leaders? I do not want them just to be smart and capable. I want
them to be the smartest, most capable people in the room. I want
them to be fair minded, hard working, compassionate and of unimpeachable
character. I want leaders who will not be satisfied until every Singaporean
has a home and the means to a better life. I want to know that if
there is an outbreak of a deadly disease like SARS, a terrorist
bomb goes off, or Singapore faces an economic crisis, we have leaders
who have the courage, intelligence, experience and determination
to do what is necessary for the good of Singapore and Singaporeans.
I want leaders who understand that their job involves a sacred trust,
a vow to devote every fibre, every moment, every thought, every
everything, in service to their country. That is the true sacrifice
I think every Singaporean should demand. And if we get the quality of
people right, the question of quantity of pay answers itself. I
believe more Singaporeans would agree with that.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5852a4d7-bbfc-40e0-b351-0da8de25758a">
                  <a name="motion__id-5852a4d7-bbfc-40e0-b351-0da8de25758a"><!--a--></a>That leads me to one more
thing we can all agree on. It is impossible to answer the question
of salaries in a manner which will satisfy everyone. And many have
said so in this House. Even the Workers' Party agrees that there
is no right or wrong figure. I would, however, make two suggestions.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b9022a9d-6ddb-40f9-bfc9-aa4527329ad7">
                  <a name="motion__id-b9022a9d-6ddb-40f9-bfc9-aa4527329ad7"><!--a--></a>Like others before me,
Mr Baey included, I suggest that the proposed formula be tweaked
to cap the salaries for the Government's term of office, with an
annual increment for inflation. In other words, salaries will not
rise if the benchmark median salary rises. That would create more
certainty and, more importantly, put paid to arguments that this
Government will pursue policies to favour the top earners to increase
its own pay. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-e34b8255-2352-4cca-bf3c-1305dd977d68">
                  <a name="motion__id-e34b8255-2352-4cca-bf3c-1305dd977d68"><!--a--></a>I would also like the
Government to do more to keep Singaporeans informed and engaged
on this issue. There is still much misunderstanding over salaries,
and we cannot have a proper dialogue if people are working off different
facts. For example, there are many Singaporeans who still believe
that MPs will receive pensions although that was discontinued many
years ago. Some even believe that MPs' and Ministers' salaries are
tax-free. Not true. Within days of the release of the report, Mr
Gerard Ee had to come out publicly and say that some had misunderstood
his report and what it said. And despite the enormous publicity
on this subject, some are still unclear about the details of the
new package. Although I know some would prefer not to keep talking
about this issue, I support the proposal for the formula to be revised
every five years. I believe we should welcome every opportunity
to debate it so that there will be
a wider and better understanding of the facts and the arguments.
It will also help if we publish annually and in clear terms the
average pay package of Ministers, so that we can demolish mischievous allegations
that Ministers would secretly earn more through discretionary and
undeclared payments. This is fertile ground for those who seek to
breed discontent and cynicism. Let us not give them the opportunity
to mislead and divide Singaporeans. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-7bcd0fca-ab0f-49cc-8d36-1b398f3796ca"><!--a--></a>I end with a final proposition
we can agree on. We want Singapore to remain an exceptional nation because
that is really the only thing that keeps us relevant. This exceptionalism
should not only be in the performance of our economy or the efficiency
of our public services. It should also be in the trust and relationship
between the Government and the people it serves. All around the
world, politics and politicians are viewed with great cynicism.
Cynicism weakens the Government, democracy and our country, and
we cannot let that happen to us.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-fafba151-7c6f-4975-8a19-d24acf154d28"><!--a--></a>I, therefore, support
the revision of salaries. The new formula is more relevant and intuitive.
It deals with some of the criticisms of the old formula and does
away with inequities like pensions. A thirty-plus percent cut is
on any view significant. The National Bonus better reflects performance.
Even the Workers' Party agrees that a monthly wage of $55,000 a
month is fair. And as Mr Vikram Nair pointed out yesterday, even
the difference in bonus computations may not amount to very much
a different sum. So we now have a sound basis for the Government
to move forward, strengthen connections with Singaporeans, focus
on the difficult problems we know to be around the corner, and deliver
on its promise for a better life for all Singaporeans. Because in
the final analysis, that is all that really counts, and I think
we can all agree on that. Sir, I support the motion. </p>

from the Public Service Division to meet with the consultants from
the Committee, and were asked to give our views on the issue. We
had come up with a broad approach to Ministerial salaries even before
the election and that is reflected in our election manifesto. Of
course, our interest was to want the Committee to come up with as
good a recommendation as possible that would be in the best interest
of the nation. So if we had not wanted that interest of the nation,
we would not have even answered the Committee's call for inputs.
We would have just withheld everything. So what we did was we went
for the meeting with the Committee and I am holding in front of
me the document which I took with me to meet with the Committee. </p>

we gave all the feedback that we had at that point of time in terms
of the technicalities of the proposals that we felt would be important
for the Committee to take into consideration. I can share some of
those things which you might find familiar because we had mentioned that
over the past few days. We talked about doing away with the current
benchmark of tying it to the 2/3M48 formula. We talked about KPIs
for the Ministers and measuring the Ministers' bonus against the achievement
of those KPIs. We talked about doing away with pensions. So this
is something I mentioned in my speech that I was glad to see that
we have done away with the pensions for Ministers. We also talked
about tying bonuses to the achievement of those KPIs. So those are
just some of the proposals that we put forward. </p>

that we did not withhold anything that we knew at that point of
time. But, of course, when the Committee's proposals came out, there
were many more details that we could not have foreseen that appeared in the Committee's
proposals. So I think it is fair for us to be able to analyse the
report, as a responsible party, and come to debate on the basis
on that report, rather than on what we had held our positions earlier
on.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr Hri Kumar Nair</strong>
                  </span>: Mr Speaker,
Sir, I do not understand why the Workers' Party could insist on dancing
at the end of that needle. Let us go back. When the hon Mr Giam
was first asked about this issue, he said he did not want to disclose
what he shared because it was private. He considered it private.
Why? Is it because what they shared privately is different from
what they disclosed publicly? Is it because what they disclosed
is different from the position they are now taking? Why does it
have to be private? He is a politician. He serves the public. He
should be more transparent. Well, at least he believes in transparency
– a statement which many of his colleagues make. Then, when Mr Yee
comes up, and he tries to defend Mr Giam, he says and I again quote,
"We do not feel we have to give everything to the Committee and
this is precisely what Parliament is here for." And then he says,
"I believe Parliament is where we come up with another proposal
to be decided on." </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-029eaa51-4f81-4969-8272-d31bf126d5e8">

their position was. They were not willing to share what they disclosed
to the Committee or what they shared with the Committee, and they
wanted to reserve some arguments for Parliament. And the only reason
why they want to do that is because they want to come up and say
and tell the whole world that "I am cleverer because I have a better
idea, and let me tell everyone about it." Never mind that months,
hours, a lot of resources were spent by Mr Gerard Ee's Committee
to put together the best possible package for Singapore. They were
playing political games. Today, they come and say, well, it is not
that they did not want to share but they were not ready with the
research, they had to re-formulate their thoughts, and so on and
so forth. They are plainly being inconsistent and they have been
called up on that.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak in this debate
on a motion which I agreed is one of the few critical issues we
have to tackle in ensuring that we continue to have a strong foundation
for a good government for the future of Singapore. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4b5feedd-4ec2-48f3-9a7a-4edadf7f9a81">

issue to tackle. From the time the question of raising political
salaries was first discussed in 1981 to the time it was last debated
in this House in 2007 when the Government was justifying a further
increase, I can well understand the tension when raising political
salaries. But this time, we are looking at a serious reduction and
there still seems to be a lot of disagreement. Or is there?</p>

last General Election, this was an issue which was canvassed. The
social and moral compact between the Government and Singaporeans
were strained, and there was a deep disquiet amongst many Singaporeans
over the level of salaries. But the Prime Minister and his Cabinet
acted swiftly. Within days of the General Election, an independent
committee was set up to relook and review the salary formula. Like
many Singaporeans, I was somewhat surprised not only at the speed
of the Government's pro-activity in dealing with the issue and their
concerns, but that it was prepared to put this sacred cow issue
up for scrutiny again. Whatever one may think of the Committee's recommendation, I
am heartened that the Government has responded to ground sentiments
and moved swiftly to address the issue. </p>

salaries is bound to be emotive. From salary or bonus discussions
in a small business to a large corporate enterprise, and, of course,
to a large national debate like this, there are many emotional arguments
over how much is enough or not. What is the value of the public
service ethos and what is the appropriate level of sacrifice? Invariably,
such arguments are also shaped and contextualised by the subjective
personal experiences and diverse backgrounds of the person making
the argument. Different perspectives will give you different answers.
But I would argue, however, that in this debate, we should consider
the issue dispassionately and without the emotion. We should start
by settling on what we want to achieve and then work out how we
can get there. Cast aside the emotion and look at it logically.
And if this Committee's report brings us closer to what we want
to achieve, then we should all endorse this White Paper. </p>

want to achieve, let me first start with some basic home truths
which I believe are already quite indisputable. Singapore has come
a long way in just over 45 years. We have been transformed from
a tiny island to a bustling developed nation. We managed to do this
because of the sheer determination, belief and strength of the founding
generation of our political leaders and the competence of their
succeeding generations. We now almost take for granted the economic
and socio-political stability of our country that is only the envy
of others. But the truth is, had it not been for a strong and visionary
government, it could also easily have been very different for us.
Just a short hop and skip from here will show you how we could have
turned out so very differently. And we cannot do worse if we assume
that this state will remain constant. In fact, it can be very transient.
If we falter, we can be sure that our neighbours will seize upon
it and take advantage. So we have to maintain our position well
ahead of the competition. To do so, our Government and each Member
of the Cabinet and each political office holder has to be capable,
has to be committed and has to have creative talent married to astute
leadership to get us home. We need the best and the brightest talents
to be brought into public service as our Ministers and political
appointment holders. That much, surely, must be a given. We want to
be able to choose from men and women of the highest quality and
who are capable of making it to the very top of their chosen profession. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-712a894a-7f70-4467-98bf-53587a52011c">
                  <a name="motion__id-712a894a-7f70-4467-98bf-53587a52011c"><!--a--></a>So we know what we want.
The next question is, in designing a remuneration system, how do
we achieve that? How do we bring the best and brightest into the
public service? That, really, is the debate on this motion. Because
the best and the brightest are the people who are either at or have
the potential to be at the very top of the private sector or their
own chosen profession, can we get away by not paying these people
competitive salaries? Can we just say, "You come in, we pay you
X number of times some civil service salary – five times, nine times"
– even if it is a fraction of what he might earn as a top private-sector
professional – and expect them to step forward? I think if we look
at that alone, the answer is obvious. If we did that, we would lose
out. Singaporeans will lose out. We have to be realistic. In today's
global world and economy, the options available to a talented and
highly motivated individual are dizzying. They have an array of
paths and options, both in Singapore and abroad, and we have to recognise
that those options are the true opportunity costs of stepping up
to public service. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a49ebcbe-4352-451e-a83f-9a502eb0dfbb">
                  <a name="motion__id-a49ebcbe-4352-451e-a83f-9a502eb0dfbb"><!--a--></a>But let me be very clear,
public service is a noble calling. We have heard many of the Members
in this House say that. And there is no place for anyone coming
forward to serve because of the financial rewards alone. It is a
cherished office, and a great honour to be chosen by the people
of Singapore to lead and to represent them. But all of us in this
House know that. We all know that. We all know it is a privilege
and we all understand the intrinsic value of political service or
we would not be here. If we would just consider the amount of time
we, as Members of Parliament, spent in the work that we do against
the additional allowances that we receive as MPs, I think it would
be fair to say that most of us would not be financially better off
in stepping up to serve. But let us not milk it with rhetoric and
make emotional points and let it cloud our assessment of what the
right approach ought to be. It is not, as the hon Member Mr Chen Show Mao says, "A question
of placing competitive salaries as the first principle." They are
all important principles and they work together. It is about finding
the right balance. </p>

recruiting a political office holder must still be that candidate's
sense of public spiritedness, of service, of desire and of a need
to want to put Singapore first, and his ability to deliver. Those
are the primary considerations. And if we have that, then we will
be considered. And in considering, the salary must be a neutral
factor. That is where the salary formula comes into play. We must
find a way to neutralise salaries as being a decisive factor for
or against entry to public service, and a balance has to be struck.
In my view, whilst tangible sacrifices are called for to give our
political leaders moral authority to govern and to lead, the level
of salaries must not itself be a disincentive for talented people
considering a public sector career. It would be naive for us to
assume that we can always rely on other people's charity in coming
forward to public service at huge cost to themselves and their families.</p>

has noted in his speech, Members of the front bench are here because
of that same sense of public spiritedness and not for financial
considerations. But we are designing a system for the future, and
we cannot design a system that relies on the good hearts of people
alone. </p>

a career path, financial considerations matter. Let us not pretend
that it does not. We all worry about mortgage payments, looking
after our elderly parents, providing for the family, saving for
retirement or just for a rainy day. Why should a bright young talent
and potential political office holder be any different? </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-b3bf7bc0-b408-4c73-b52c-46dd10cec944"><!--a--></a>Sir, the only way to achieve
this, in my view, is to start by benchmarking political office salaries
to the private sector. We might discount it, as the Committee has
recommended 40%, but as a matter of policy, it has to move in tandem
with private-sector pay scales. And it is not a question of being
elitist. Rather, it is just recognising the appropriate opportunity
costs and setting up a salary scale that gives us the best chance
of attracting that top talent. Let us ask ourselves, if we want
as our political leaders people who are capable of making it to
the top of their professional career, then, on balance, where are we
more likely to find that top talent? In the higher income scale
or the lower? And, as has been repeated several times too, I am
not suggesting for a moment that a person outside the top 1,000
Singaporean earners will not necessarily be considered for political
office. But that is not the question. The point is, in designing
the formula, we have to look at where that talent pool is likely
to be, and what the true commensurate opportunity costs would be.
And as the Minister of State, Mrs Josephine Teo, says, "That is
a basic HR tactic."</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-7ff7014c-ba6e-4493-a1e0-30b3e7330de1">
                  <a name="motion__id-7ff7014c-ba6e-4493-a1e0-30b3e7330de1"><!--a--></a>It is, therefore, unrealistic
to de-couple political remuneration from market influences, and
I would support the Committee's recommendation to retain the link
to the market, with a discount. I would add that I see a visible
tangible discount as being necessary to reflect that it is a deliberate
mark-down from the market to signify the sacrifice and add to the
moral authority of our leaders. In addition, I also think that a
significant improvement has been made to broaden the reference points
to the top 1,000 Singaporean earners and not just any earner in
the chosen six professions. The old formula was debated vigorously
in this House in 2007. I did not have that privilege of contributing
to that debate. But it was never apparent to me why that formula
was chosen and why only a select group of top earners was used.</p>

which focuses the pool squarely on Singaporeans alone, broadens
it regardless of profession. You could argue that the pool should
be more than 1,000 or less, or that the discount should be more
or less than 40% but that is a question of fine-tuning, a formula
which can be re-visited at the next review. I would just say that
as a starting point, given that the Prime Minister's new salary
would rank him at almost 400th, I do not see a pool of 1,000 Singaporeans
as being unreasonable.</p>

cries of disagreement by the Workers' Party, their own number actually
gets us to within the same ballpark. You have heard the hon Member
Mr <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Vikram Nair</span> yesterday. You
have heard several other comments today. The fact is they start
with the same or higher base pay and, in fact, they pay more and
continue to do so even after five years. I have taken the liberty
of preparing a table which I felt best summarises the respective
positions. If I could invite hon Members to please have a look at
it. I have taken some numbers from the Committee's report and I
have also extracted propositions from the speeches made by several
Members of the Workers' Party the last few days. If you look at
the base scenario of a 13-month package and -- there is a typographical
error here -- it should be $46,750. That is based on paragraph 89,
page 33 of the Committee's report. That is a 15% discount of $55,000.
That gets you to a base salary of $607,750. You contrast that base
salary with the recommended proposal of $55,000 on a 13-month package
that gets you to more than $700,000 as a base salary. If you add
the bonus -- the Committee's proposal for the benchmark bonus at
mid tier would be $1.1 million. That is based on thirteen months
plus the seven months which includes the bonus at $55,000, and that
gets you to $1.1 million. It would be lower if it was used at 15%
discount to the $55,000. </p>

proposal, we have heard from the hon Members <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Mr Chen Show Mao, Mr Gerald
Giam, Mr Yee Jenn Jong and Mr Pritam Singh. Collectively, they say
it is three to five-and-a-half months, and I have given the reference
at the bottom of the page. You will see that we get to an upper
tier salary with bonus $990,000 or something just shy of $1.1 million.
It is true that the Committee's proposal does recommend an additional
bonus should Singapore exceed target expectations, but that is the
benchmark. And if you do compare the benchmark, you will see that
we are not far off. The hon Member Mr Pritam Singh</span> says,
"Well, the numbers are about the same but our principles are different."
But earlier in this debate, the Member for Aljunied <span class="ph hcInline hcMember">Mr Chen Show Mao</span> says, "Actually
we agree with the principles." So, which is what? Do they agree
or not? </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-580f0323-dfbd-4b04-ae33-7352dfcf2786"><!--a--></a>Sir, in the past, absolute
numbers were used to stir emotions and sentiments against the salary
scale. Now that the Workers' Party's proposal gives us the same
ballpark, a different slogan is being trotted out – the people-up
approach based on five times, nine times – but what does that mean?
The hon Member Mr Chen says that the Workers' Party agrees that
salaries have to be competitive. Competitive means attractive relative
to what the comparable alternative is. In other words, what is your
market value? If you accept that the competitive wage needs to be
paid, then why peg it from the bottom up? I know of no corporate
in the market which pays its CEO "X" number of times the salary
of the tea lady, or "X" number of times the salary of some division
manager. For all the criticisms of arbitrariness, on what basis
do we arrive at five or nine times, if it were not just reverse
engineering after already having arrived at a desired number? So,
on this point on the benchmark alone, I would invite all those who
do not support this motion to re-consider. Accept the recommendations
of this Committee. </p>

turn to another feature of the report which I feel is important,
and, that is, of accountability. There are two aspects to it. The
first is the recommendation to keep to the "clean wage" principle.
It has been addressed by several Members of this House, but it is
a vital core principle and I will summarise why I say so. Political
remuneration packages should be fully transparent and accounted for
with absolutely no hidden perks and privileges. That has been the
hallmark of Singapore's political-remuneration principle and I am
happy to see it continue; and happier that on that score, there
is at least consensus with the Workers' Party. </p>

after the Committee's report was published, one argument against
political salaries which kept surfacing was that our salaries were
not comparable to international standards. Again, we have heard
that several times, and that on the salary of our own Prime Minister,
we could get both Barack Obama and Tony Blair combined. But, is
that what we really think or want? It must have been tempting for
this Government to have said that you know what, let us get paid
like Obama with the 132-room White House accommodation thrown in,
an expense account, a private jet, paid vacations, and a private chef. It
might have been easier. According to BBC reports, senators in Italy
almost double their official remuneration with expense allowances
as well as free rail, free flight tickets, and so on. In France,
politicians get very low interest rates on housing and what is not
commonly known is that if a Member of Parliament loses their seat
in an election, he or she remains on full pay for half a year, and then
a gradually declining proportion of the salary for a further two-and-a-half
years. </p>

touched on what some of the members of the parliament in the UK
have claimed for. And in the UK today, some three years later, it
still remains an issue which continues to bedevil the proper functioning
of parliament because they cannot work out how to really pay the
MPs, and worst of all, this casts a great shadow, not just on the
integrity of the parliamentarians but on the office of the parliamentarian
itself. A number of parliamentarians, both of the front and back
benches, from both sides of the House, including the Speaker of
the House of Commons, all resigned in the wake of those disclosures,
and some peers were also charged for false accounting. So, is this
what we really want? Why are the critics of our formula seemingly
content to accept and indeed advocate what is practised by other
countries: a low official pay but supplemented by a variety of perks
and benefits? It is a complete paradox and totally regressive. What
do these perks cover? How much, for what period? For the spouse
as well? Today, the claim is for home improvement, travel; tomorrow,
it could be a whole lot more. You just make one exception, and we
will go down the slippery slope. </p>

a model which the Workers' Party has said we should consider, has
for some time now been criticised for being less than transparent
and the addition perks and benefits which make up the Prime Minister's
salary are unknown. This is not even taking into account a pension which
ex-Prime Minister John Howard continues to enjoy, and the fact that
some of these benefits or the benefits available to him in his tenure
as a Prime Minister would continue to be available to him and his spouse
even after he has stepped down from office. Can any serious comparison
be made between the remuneration system of Australia and what the
Committee has recommended? Sir, surely not. We should not even be
comparing ourselves with governments who lack the political will
and courage to be completely transparent with what each and every
political office holder is paid. Sir, the value of a clean, transparent
wage system cannot be under-estimated. What you see, is what you
get. And we cannot move away from that bedrock which is the clean,
transport system, to the slippery slope of hidden perks and benefits. </p>

on accountability is that of performance. The Prime Minister has
addressed this in some detail but I would just like to make the
point that if we accept the principle that we benchmark our political
office holders against the market, then it would follow that similar
comparisons ought to be made when it comes to the assessment of
performance. The corollary of the market benchmarking is that our
political office holders must therefore be held accountable like
the private sector, and subject to the same rigours and risks. In
order for Singaporeans to support remuneration formula, Sir, they
must have the confidence and conviction that our Ministers and office
holders will be held accountable to those very high standards, and
I am glad to have heard the Prime Minister re-affirm that belief. </p>

Yes, Sir. Let me just sum up then. I will make a few brief points.
I think we have agreement in this House over the key principles
on which salaries will now be determined. In terms of numbers, we
are also in the same broad ballpark; there is clearly a significant
narrowing of the gaps which previously existed. And by all accounts,
this Committee's report and recommendations are, at the very least,
a step in the right direction and based on right and sound principles.
I think it is well reasoned and I think it makes the right judgment
calls. It is, however, not perfect, it must be tested in application.
It will evolve and I am sure it will continue to be fine-tuned at
each review which the Government
has said it will do every five years. There may be still some Singaporeans
who will remain unconvinced; it will take some time to convince
them, but we should and I hope the arguments can be considered with

there are so many different views of the proverbial elephant, perhaps
this is just an issue on which there may never be consensus. But,
Sir, we have a duty to put out all the views so that even the blind
will be able to call an elephant, an elephant. I personally feel
it is time to move on. This is a formula which has evolved over
30 years, too much political capital from all sides have been spent
on this. It is time we let our Government get on with the business
of governing and improving the lives of Singaporeans and demonstrate
that, indeed, it is worth the salary that we are arguing about.
And then we might conclude that we are not really arguing over very
much. I support the motion [<em class="ph i">Applause</em>].</span>

Sir, in my speech, I did say that $1.1 million represents what is
the bonus fixed by the Committee at seven months, based on what
they feel are achievements of the targets. And if they do exceed
those targets, then you get a few months more, and that gets us
to $1.4 million or thereabouts. If you were to compare that, like
for like, I would still say we are in the same ballpark. If you
look at the comparison, at the baseline level, it is $607,000 against
$715,000. At the upper end level, on the Committee's recommendation,
you get to a figure of about $1.4 million; at the Workers' Party's proposal,
it is over $1.01 million. At the baseline level, the differential
is also about $300,000 because if you look at the Committee's proposal
at baseline, it gets you to a figure of about $900,000-odd versus the
Workers' Party's proposal.</p>

Mr Speaker, Sir, the debate over the past few days is encouraging
because what it shows is that there is, in fact, more common ground
than differences in the Review Committee's recommendations which
the Government intends to adopt, and the Opposition's position.
This shows that we have in Parliament a broad consensus on the fundamental
principles which should govern Ministerial salaries, although there
may be differences in details for final quantum. And we therefore
have common ground on which to move forward. </p>

recommendations on three key principles and there is no dispute
on both sides that these principles are good ones and should be
adopted. And I have some comments on them.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f8bfd4bb-986e-4baa-85e3-df6c4238a583">
                  <a name="motion__id-f8bfd4bb-986e-4baa-85e3-df6c4238a583"><!--a--></a>The first principle: the
Committee benchmarked the salaries against the top 1,000 earners
and applied the 40% discount. Now, it has been suggested that this
is elitist, and that immediately makes it an emotive issue, because
the underlying thrust of that assertion is that if you use this
benchmark, then potential Ministerial candidates would not be in
touch with the man-in-the-street.</p>

a different way of looking at it. In his speech on Monday, Deputy
Prime Minister Teo said that the most important criterion for anyone
seeking political office is the motivation to serve the people and
the nation. Mr Chen Show Mao stated that "political service is a
calling and that it is a privilege accorded by the electorate to
serve Singaporeans" and that it is primarily "a privilege, not a
burden or a sacrifice". These are similar sentiments, albeit expressed
in different ways. But then, we must ask ourselves: to whom will
Singaporeans accord this privilege? Singaporeans are discerning. They
will not accord the privilege of leadership to just any and everybody.
They know what good government entails. They also know what kind
of Ministers they want. The type of person to whom Singaporeans
will accord the privilege to serve them, must be a person with certain
qualities. These include integrity, honesty, compassion, a desire
to act for the better good of all as well as ability, leadership
skills, communication skills, organisational skills and technical
skills.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-d6e774cf-c82b-4fb8-bf53-aae175b8cb52">
                  <a name="motion__id-d6e774cf-c82b-4fb8-bf53-aae175b8cb52"><!--a--></a>But where do you find
these people? Chances are people with these qualities would by their
very nature tend to be successful and would normally have risen
to the forefront of any organisation in which they work, whether
it be public sector or private sector. And this means that people
in those positions would command a certain remuneration and have
more options and choices. And this brings us right back to the first
principle on which the Committee based its recommendations which
is that salaries must be competitive so that people of the right
calibre are not deterred from stepping forward to serve. So the first
principle is not inconsistent with the concept that political service
is a calling and a privilege. In fact, the first principle is intended
to help us to get the right kind of persons to whom Singaporeans
will accord the privilege to serve them.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-dcb3f179-b7ba-4bbb-84f4-97aa85f3bc63"><!--a--></a>Let me deal with the third
principle now. There is no dispute on the third principle either.
Everyone agrees that we should have a "clean wage" system. However,
I find that whenever there is a discussion on a "clean wage" system,
there is always a distorted comparison with other countries. The
Workers' Party mentioned that their proposals were derived after
reviewing the remuneration systems in 12 developed economies, including
the UK and US. Now, the UK and US are the two most often cited examples
of where their politicians earn far less than ours. And I thought
that because they are cited so often, it is worthwhile to examine
the politicians' remuneration packages in these two countries in
a bit more detail.
And you will see that in these countries, political office is not
only a privilege, it is also about privileges. In fact, our more
is less, and their less is more, more or less!</p>

remuneration of UK Ministers, one must take into account the Green
Book. The Green Book is the Guide to the UK MPs' allowances. The
UK Ministers' salaries may be lower but they get a whole host of
allowances contained in the Green Book. Now, I encourage our MPs
and members of the public to look up the Green Book 2009 Edition
which is available online. It is seemingly transparent, yet totally
opaque. It seems to be transparent because the type of allowances
allowed are listed out, but it is totally opaque because you have

for parliamentary business. They have a travel card for train, air,

into account the food privileges. I read an interesting article
in the <em class="ph i">International Express</em>, Tuesday, 10 January 2012 which
reported that in the financial year of 2010/2011, the UK taxpayers
had to fork out £5.8 million for their MPs' food. Under a UK taxpayer
funded subsidy, UK MPs enjoy cheap meals, wines and spirits in the
House of Commons. The <em class="ph i">International Express</em> reported that
in the last year this amount soared to £5.8 million, an increase
of £87,000, notwithstanding that in June 2010, the Commons Commission
said £500,000 should be loped off catering costs, and bar prices
should match those of the High Street pubs.</p>

that this means that a total of £1.33 million was spent in the Commons

Britain as an example of a country where information on political
salaries and allowances is available and they have stringent disclosure

was only forced upon them after an investigative journalist pursued
the matter and even then it was only after years of trying to force
disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The House of Commons
resisted it on the basis that it was "unlawfully intrusive". It took
a court action to get the information and it was discovered that
the perks came up to millions of pounds. You can find this on Wikipedia

that our Prime Minister gets more salary than the US President. Our
Prime Minister may get more salary but he gets far less in terms
of the value of the total benefits package of the US President.
There is an article on the Internet titled "<em class="ph i">10 Most Expensive
Presidential Perks</em>". You should read it. It makes for interesting
reading. This is what the US President gets and this list is not
exhaustive. In addition to the US$400,000 salary, he gets US$100,000
for travel expenses, US$19,000 for official entertaining. The salary
is taxable, the allowances are not. And I also saw in Tuesday's <em class="ph i">New
Paper</em> that he gets an allowance of up to US$1 million a year
for "unanticipated needs". One has no idea what "unanticipated needs"
are.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-f9406a23-abee-4749-a4bf-7f11f676e54d"><!--a--></a>The White House is not
just an office. It is a residential home. It has 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms,
a movie screening room and a bowling alley, swimming pool, tennis
and basketball courts, jogging track, putting green, cleaning, laundry
and errand services and a whole house staff. The upkeep is US$4 million
a year.</p>

                  <a name="motion__id-290447f5-bdf2-43d6-9582-564dcfe2a543"><!--a--></a>The US President gets
a Chief Usher, an Executive Chef, an Executive Pastry Chef, a whole
medical unit, a Social Secretary, a Chief Calligrapher. Oh! I forgot
to mention he has a beehive. There is a beehive in the South Lawn
which is installed to provide honey for use in the White House kitchen.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4a9c8980-3f37-490a-ae4d-aa085e36210f">
                  <a name="motion__id-4a9c8980-3f37-490a-ae4d-aa085e36210f"><!--a--></a>He also has for his transport
Cadillac One - armoured limousine, valued at US$300,000. He gets Ground
Force One, that is, two Black armoured buses for himself and dignitaries
costing US$1 million each; Air Force One, that is actually two Boeing
747 jets under the name of "One" and it has a personal suite, a
26-member crew, a telecoms centre. Do not forget the C141 Starlifter
Cargo Plane -- that is to carry Cadillac One to go wherever the
President goes. Then there is Marine One which is the helicopter that
takes him for short-distance travel and there is also a helicopter
fleet which includes Sikorsky and Black Hawk helicopters. Then there
is the holiday home and the retirement perks, personal security, state
funeral. As I said, the list is not exhaustive. These things we
do not give our Prime Minister and I am not suggesting that we should.
These excessive trappings of pomp and grandeur are not what we want
in our system. But the point is that if you wish to compare what
the US President gets against what our Prime Minister gets, then
you must take these things into account.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c26858a0-e107-4dd9-8057-28d0e73abf06">
                  <a name="motion__id-c26858a0-e107-4dd9-8057-28d0e73abf06"><!--a--></a>I come back to the second
principle which is the discounted salary. And the benchmark figure
that the Review Committee arrived at was S$55,000 a month. The Workers'
Party disagreed with this approach in principle and they said, "if
this benchmark is accepted by the Government, it would continue to
send the message to potential office holders and Singaporeans that
top pay is the benchmark by which the importance of the office is
to be judged, and the value of political office in the final analysis
can be monetised. It cannot be. Not even at the highest income levels."</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-3d13fab7-9d7d-4a8c-ae3e-ef07f09f765f">
                  <a name="motion__id-3d13fab7-9d7d-4a8c-ae3e-ef07f09f765f"><!--a--></a>Fair enough. Workers'
Party says that we should instead apply the principle of political
service first and then MPs as elected representatives of the people
should be the starting point for the determination of Ministerial
salary. The Workers Party then applied the principle of political
service first and the figure they have come up with is $55,000 per
month. So it is exactly the same figure as the benchmark figure. And
the target or the group from which you would draw people who earn
this is really within the same cohort. So we started from the top,
worked our way down; they started from the bottom, worked their way
up, we arrive at the same place. There is no disagreement there.
The main disagreement is on bonuses. But even then you will find
that there is no disagreement on the fact that there should be bonuses.
And when you look at it, the amount, difference is not hugely significant.
It is significant to wage earners who earn less. That is correct.
But the difference between the two positions is not that much.</p>
               <p class="column">Page: 1048</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b8198019-ce65-4a3b-8d32-1fdff54f56de">
                  <a name="motion__id-b8198019-ce65-4a3b-8d32-1fdff54f56de"><!--a--></a>Another point where we are not very different:
yesterday Mr Yaw Shin Leong said that the Workers' Party had two
other proposals to enhance the "twin towers of accountability and
transparency". He suggested an independent commission for the Prime
Minister whenever he seeks to change how political pay is determined,
and he suggested that the findings of such a commission be subjected
to debate in Parliament and to Parliamentary approval. Here we have
the Review Committee. It is an independent committee. It is not
called a commission, but it is the same thing. Now, we did not make
it as a matter of law subject to parliamentary approval but the
Deputy Prime Minister has brought the Committee's recommendations
to Parliament to seek Parliament's endorsement. Same difference.
The principles of accountability and transparency are met. So there
really is very little difference between the two positions.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-6c0d092b-0085-4d36-ad58-e8216ea92d01">
                  <a name="motion__id-6c0d092b-0085-4d36-ad58-e8216ea92d01"><!--a--></a>But at the end of the
day, while I support the Committee's recommendations and I would
endorse the motion -- because it significantly brings down the remuneration
which was a cause of concern -- but at the end of the day, from
the public's perspective, the issue of Ministerial salaries is not
about logic, economics or formulas. It is about the connection between
Singaporeans and their elected leaders. In any age, in any country
and in any culture, what do people want of their leaders? They want
good, capable people of integrity who can provide leadership and
have the right technical competencies. They want leaders who they
can identify with and, more importantly, leaders who can identify
with them. They want leaders who empathise with them, who feel their
pain, their worries, will listen, address their concerns, and provide
solutions to the problems that people face. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-5ebd727b-6254-4d53-90d1-3f9df291c041">
                  <a name="motion__id-5ebd727b-6254-4d53-90d1-3f9df291c041"><!--a--></a>And the thing is this:
most people do not earn this kind of salaries. The instinctive feeling
is: how can you connect with me? How can you feel what I feel when
you do not have the same financial constraints that I have? How
do you know what it is to feel like to live day after day in fear
that you cannot pay your rent, your mortgage, or something as basic
as food? How can you know what it is like to be afraid that you
might lose your job because someone else, a foreigner who is a younger
and cheaper option for your employer? How can you know this when
your pay is so high? That, I think, is the real issue with Ministerial
salaries.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-a59e0839-f1a3-4ba2-bc45-55eaa906dc53">
                  <a name="motion__id-a59e0839-f1a3-4ba2-bc45-55eaa906dc53"><!--a--></a>And the answer does not
lie in pegging Ministers' salaries so low that everyone has to struggle
alike. No, the answer lies in this. That the Ministers, with the
abilities that you have, with the skills that you have acquired,
that you place these skills and abilities at the service of Singaporeans
and help solve their issues for them. People do not object to good
pay when it is well-earned. And if they feel that a Minister is
really working hard for the people, then they are fine with that.
Where they get upset is if they feel someone gets a good pay just
because he or she happens to land the job of a Minister, and they
do not see a real or visible effort on the part of that person.</p>

for each and every Minister, he or she must show that he or she
is truly indeed deserving of the pay, and the policies that he or
she initiates and implements must address Singaporeans' needs. Equally
important is the Minister's connection with people. People respond
well to Ministers who are in tune with issues of concern to Singaporeans,
who identify the solutions and take action on behalf of the people.
These are the ones that Singaporeans are happy to work with to achieve
a better result for all. </p>

it if a Minister talks down to them or in a way which they feel
is patronising or condescending, or who brushes aside their concerns

ministerial salaries: sincerity, compassion and high performance
by Ministers, coupled with a real connection and close bond to the
people they serve. Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. </p>

state the numbers: on a minimum basis, the Committee's proposal
is $607,750. The Workers' Party's position would be $715,000. At
the norm or baseline level, on the Committee's recommendation, it
would be $935,000 versus the Workers' Party's proposal of $880,000.

is the spirit of service that brings us to this House. Members like
Mr Sam Tan emphasised that political service is, first and foremost,
about having "a heart of service". Or in the words of Mrs Josephine
Teo, Mr Chen Show Mao, Dr Lam Pin Min and Mr Tan Chuan-Jin, it is
a noble office, a "calling", a "privilege", a "hard-won honour".
Sir, I look around at the faces of my fellow Members of this House,
and I see that it is this spirit or ethos of service that has brought
each one of us here; and this spirit, this ethos of service, is
what brings us together, and does not separate or divide us, Members of
this House. We are all clearly in agreement on that. </p>

that this will also put an end to misleading comparisons, both in

other countries that provide many benefits which are often not quantifiable.

Khor, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Edwin Tong, Ms Indranee Rajah and others, there
was also general agreement that a Minister's responsibilities are
at least as complex and heavy as the jobs held by those in the more
broad-based benchmark of 1,000 persons proposed, and Ministers have
a much wider impact on the lives of Singaporeans, as Mr Alvin Yeo
pointed out. I did not hear any disagreement on that score either. </p>

the view that the resultant 37% reduction in MR4 salaries was deep and
significant, and appreciated that the starting salary for a Minister
at $46,750 a month or for a basic 13-month salary of $607,750 provided
the Prime Minister with more flexibility for emplacing new Ministers. </p>

that there should be an independent review process for political
salaries, the Prime Minister appointed a committee to independently
review salaries for political appointment holders. The Review Committee,
chaired by Mr Gerard Ee, comprising eight well-respected members from
a range of sectors, had a free hand, contrary to what Mrs Lina Chiam
said, and Mr Yaw Shin Leong alluded to. They were allowed "to take
into account salaries of comparable jobs in the private sector and also
other reference points such as the general wage levels in Singapore".
I am glad to hear that Mr Pritam Singh has full confidence in the
Committee and its independence. The Committee has arrived at fair
and balanced recommendations. Members of this House have accepted
the key principles that it has put forward for determining the salary
framework, and also many of its key recommendations. The Government
has also accepted the Committee's recommendation for the Prime Minister
to appoint an independent Committee to review the salary framework
every five years. </p>

National Bonus has replaced the GDP Bonus. Many Members, including Mr
Zaqy Mohamed, Mr Yaw Shin Leong and Mr Zainal Sapari, welcomed the
introduction of the National Bonus which reflects a stronger link
with Singaporeans' interests and concerns, though some did express
views on the size and ratio between the different factors. Mr Zainal,
in particular, made a strong pitch to increase the weight in the
national bonus given to wage growth for the lowest 20th percentile
income earners, and Mr Alex Yam reminded us of the important goal
of raising median incomes of Singaporeans. </p>

reservations about the previous salary framework have also been prepared
to accept the proposed framework. For example, Ms Denise Phua spoke
out strongly and passionately in 2007 about there being good people
who would come in regardless of pay. In her speech on Monday, she
acknowledged that she "could not find enough of them" – such good
people, even to run her charity, let alone this country. Mr Inderjit
Singh, who had spoken against the previous 2/3M48 benchmark, has
analysed the Committee's proposal for a broader-based, 1,000 person
benchmark carefully, and the rationale behind it, and expressed
agreement. </p>

to hear Mr Chen Show Mao say clearly and in very definitive terms,

ethos, and that wages should be transparent." </p>

change and a significant step forward. For the first time, the Workers'
Party has stated that it accepted benchmarks, benchmarking salaries
competitively, similar to the approach taken by the Committee, and
it is a fundamental departure from their past proposals. For example,
as reported in a <em class="ph i">Straits
Times</em> article on 5 May 2006, in the run-up to the 2006 General
Elections, the Workers' Party said that they wanted the benchmark
to be based on what the poorest 20% of Singaporeans earned, and that
Ministers' pay could be multiplied by a factor of 100, making their
salary, at that time, $80,000 a month. </p>

2007 Debate in this House, Ms Sylvia Lim said that we should benchmark the
remuneration of political office holders to that of leaders in foreign
countries. The Workers' Party made Ministerial salaries a hot campaign
issue last year during the General Elections and proposed, as an
alternative, that "€¦these countries pay political office-holders
just a fraction" of what our leaders are paid, and "we should benchmark
against those countries." Sir, this is very different from what
I just heard Mr Giam said, that the position that the Workers' Party
is proposing in Parliament is the same as what they had said prior
to the GE and in their manifesto.</p>

"elitist", or too small. There are a number of organisations in
the public service which are comparable or larger than 1,700 people,

the MX9 (Superscale) salary is not pegged to the "general wage level
of Singaporeans". The MX9 (Superscale) officer is not representative
of an average "whole-of-government" officer. He is a senior officer
with significant responsibilities, in the ranks of the senior leadership
of the Civil Service. It is, in fact, pegged to the salaries of
quite senior people in the private sector, who hold jobs which have
equivalent significant responsibility and scope. So, in fact, Sir,
the Workers' Party is proposing that we benchmark MPs, not Ministers,
at the top 1.2% of the Civil Service. About half the Civil Service
are teachers, and we select our teachers from the top one-third
of the cohort. So 1.2% of the Civil Service is quite a select group.
But I leave it to Members and the public to decide whether this
is an appropriate way to compare. But, Sir, I wish to make the point
that this is quite far from the "general wage level" of Singaporeans,
and what the Workers' Party has described as a "people-up" approach. </p>

more significant in this analysis is that the principles as well
as the way that the Workers' Party have worked out their salary
proposals are actually quite similar to what the Committee has done
– the principle of benchmarking by selecting a set of jobs, skills
and qualities which they feel are comparable, in one case to that
of MPs, and in the other to that of Ministers. So the basis for
setting salaries is basically similar to that which the Committee
has used. </p>

Party has previously expressed disagreement over not just the basis
for determining salaries but also their overall levels, I am heartened
now that the Workers' Party's own proposals are at the same general
levels as those proposed by the Committee. </p>

allowance proposed by the Workers' Party, is benchmarked to MX9 (Superscale)
of $11,000/month, as compared to the Committee's proposal of $13,750/month.
The Workers' Party makes much of this difference, but actually when
you look at it, $11,000 is at the lower end of the MX9 (Superscale)
salary grade, and $13,750 happens to be about the mid-point of the
MX9 (Superscale) grade. So you can pick whichever one you want but,
say, you pick $13,750, which is the mid-point of the MX9 benchmark
grade that the Workers' Party has chosen. If you churn out the numbers
and multiply them up, you come up with an answer which is a bit
bigger, but still generally in the same ballpark as well. </p>

Nair yesterday, the monthly salary for Ministers proposed by Workers' Party
is actually higher than the starting salary of $46,750 per month
proposed by the Committee. And the Workers' Party has proposed a
ratio for the Prime Minister's salary: 1.8 times that of a Minister, while
the Committee has proposed 2 times. There is a certain amount of
judgement in this. I would use the word "judgement" rather than
the word "arbitrariness", which has been used quite widely by some Members
of this House. The ratio of MP's allowance to Ministers' salary
is also about the same – 17.5% versus 20%. </p>

                  <a name="motion__id-ae8b4283-ab58-4df0-ba4a-7515344eac39"><!--a--></a>We should also note that
if the Workers' Party came into power tomorrow, it would pay its
Ministers a salary which is not much different from what the Committee
has recommended. And this would still mean that leaders elsewhere
would likewise be paid a fraction, in cash terms, of what a Workers'
Party Minister would be paid. This is quite different from the view
that it strongly advocated just a few months ago. </p>

out, the main difference that remains now is really over variable bonuses,
whether there should be a norm of three months of a higher monthly
salary, or seven months of a lower monthly salary, including the
Annual Variable Component. Mr Edwin Tong tried to work out the numbers,
but you can see that they are all roughly at the same general salary
levels. The matter of salary structure and design and how one apportions
the salary between fixed and variable components is a matter which
HR and compensation specialists have a view on. The Committee had
the benefit of a compensation specialist, Mercer, to advise on this,
who recommended that for jobs at this level, about one-third of
the total annual compensation should be variable, so that a good
part of the salary is not fixed or guaranteed, but instead linked
to actual performance. I do not know if the Workers' Party also sought
competent HR or compensation specialist advice. But even compensation
specialists might offer different views on what is the appropriate
way to apportion between fixed and variable components. A higher
number of months of bonus in years when targets are met also means
a lower guaranteed monthly wage, and a larger reduction in bonus
when targets are not met, as shown in Mr Edwin Tong's numbers. </p>

is that the overall levels of the salaries being put forward are
both around the same general levels. The Workers' Party has quietly
abandoned proposing salaries that are "a fraction" of what they
are now proposing. They have indeed recognised that a pragmatic
approach is needed when setting salaries, and they have recognised
in their proposal that pragmatism and idealism need to be balanced.</p>

proposals in some detail not to point out the differences, but in
fact, to demonstrate the clear similarities with the Committee's
proposals. When we strip away the rhetorical wrapping, and take
a closer look, the Workers' Party's proposals are in fact based
on the same set of principles, have taken into account pragmatic
considerations, have resulted in salaries that are at about the
same general level, and have the same structural features of fixed
and variable bonuses, though in different proportions, as what the
Committee has proposed. </p>

these similarities to demonstrate that there is, indeed, much common
ground. We should not be accentuating the differences when there
are, in fact, so many similarities. Mr Yee Jenn Jong came out strongly
to say yesterday, "In conclusion, the annual levels we have proposed
are not the same as the Review Committee's. More fundamentally,
we object to the principles used to set the benchmark for Ministerial
salaries. Therefore, I oppose the motion." After hearing Mr Chen
state clearly on Monday that "We (ie, the Workers' Party) agree
with the three principles," I thought that we were quite close together.
Sir, I am still optimistic, in spite of what Mr Yee said yesterday,
because the actual proposals are really quite close.</p>

from the Singapore People's Party (SPP) updated the estimated pay
that a Minister would need, in her estimation, to live comfortably,
which former MP Mr Chiam See Tong had calculated in this House in
1994. In 1994, Mr Chiam's estimate was $50,000 a month, actually $51,000.
In this House in 2007, Mr Chiam updated the number to $70,000 per
month. Mrs Chiam has now, in her estimation, adjusted this figure
to $60,000. I was trying to understand the reason for this adjustment. </p>

the SPP has a different method of computation still tied to local
conditions and standards of living, it has similarly come up with
a monthly pay of $60,000, which is a little higher than the benchmark
MR4 monthly salary that the Committee has proposed – and an overall
outcome that is within the same general level and similar to what
the Committee had proposed. </p>

a little about one subject which this debate was totally silent

also provided information on the salary grades of the current Ministers.
The National Bonus is also fully transparent as the mode of calculation
and the numbers that go into it each year from the Department of
Statistics, are known to all. And the Prime Minister has periodically
provided this House with information on the performance bonuses
for Ministers in bands. This provides the public assurance that
the salary framework is being applied in a fair and reasonable way,
while maintaining a certain amount of privacy for the office holders.
I think that is fair. Mr Pritam Singh also asked for a list of pensions
for individual Ministers. He wanted to know why the Government has
provided the method of calculation of an office-holder's pension,
but not given the individual numbers for each person. The Government
has provided the method of calculation of an office-holder's pension
in detail and stated that the maximum amount is about 11% of the
annual salary in the previous framework. Why have we provided the
calculation method and not the amount for each individual? Again,
this balances the requirement for transparency for the purpose of
knowing how the salary framework is applied and to be sure that
it is applied properly, while respecting the privacy of individuals.</p>

we should learn from other countries that have websites that also
provide listings of Ministers' allowances and other benefits. Well,
they have websites listing out the benefits, not just how the Ministers
have used their benefits. I am amazed at the research which Ms Indranee
Rajah and Mr Edwin Tong have done. But we have indeed learnt from
other countries, and the most important lesson that we have learnt,
is that providing allowances and benefits is a veritable minefield,
and hence the most important lesson that we have learnt is to go
for clean wages, so that we can avoid such thick books, such big
websites, and such huge problems of abuse. Sir, if we put up a website
to account for usage of benefits, the only variable item that will
be there is how much a Minister claims for dental treatment – so
that is a maximum of $70, and I suppose we will all know how many
times he goes to the dentist, and whether he has used up his maximum
claim of $70. Mr Pritam Singh knows that this is the position of
the Government. So when he made a passionate discourse just now
on dental benefits, I think he was making a political speech that
was not grounded in any reality that this Government believes in. </p>

the many, sometimes heated, emotional discussions over the past
30 years, we have now taken a major step forward to bridge the once-wide
gap – the Government, by accepting the wide-ranging proposals that

this House by departing from their old positions and accepting the
principles and many key features that the Committee has put forward,
as I enumerated earlier. </p>

to very similar conclusions about how to benchmark political salaries
in Singapore by adopting the three key principles: market-competitive
salaries; ethos of political service; and clean wage. And after
applying these similar principles and methods, arrived at salary
levels which are about the same. We have made real progress.</p>

expressed concern about whether the proposed benchmark and framework will
result in huge salary increases in the future. Mr Baey Yam Keng
and Mr Hri Kumar have suggested keeping
salaries fixed for five years. Even under the previous framework,
the Government had been judicious in making changes if the benchmark
changes very rapidly in any one year. In any case, every change
in salary level will have to be done openly and transparently, as
was always done in the past, and this House will know about it.
And Members have every opportunity to raise questions and take issue with
it if Members for any reason have concerns. And of course, I, and
the Prime Minister, will do our best to address the concerns that
Members have.</p>

framework will be reviewed in five years. After we have worked with
this framework for five years, we will have more experience and
perhaps we can take on board the many interesting and potentially
useful suggestions that have been put forward by Members, such as
Ms Denise Phua. If structural changes need to be made to the framework,
we will then have the opportunity to do so. </p>

Sir, I think it goes to the nub of what I said just now. We are
about at the same levels of salary. There is not a great deal of
difference between what the Workers' Party has proposed, what the
Committee has proposed and what the Government accepts. Mr Chen
is bargaining over small differences here and there. I would have
hoped that Mr Chen would have taken a more elevated view of the
subject. He has agreed to accept the three principles. The Committee
has, in its wisdom, after consulting many people, including some
inputs from the Workers' Party, come up with what it thinks is a
good formula for Singapore for the future. We are prepared to accept
that. </p>

come up with a different formula, but as I have pointed out in my
speech, very similar in principle, very similar in method, very
similar in benchmarking against specific population groups where
they feel comparisons are relevant, and have come up with roughly
the same number. I think that this House should come together, accept
the Committee's recommendation and move forward; take a more elevated
view of the subject rather than accentuating the differences.</p>

Mr Giam whether he accepts that MX9 does not represent the general

that I do not have a crystal ball. I cannot tell what salaries will

the principle here. We have now all agreed that we do competitive benchmarking
against the market. The Committee's recommendation proposes that.
The Workers' Party's recommendation, in essence, proposes that,
too. Because MX9, and in fact, all Civil Service salaries are benchmarked
against the closest comparables that we can find in the market.
But does Mr Giam accept that the MX9 (Superscale) grade does not
represent the Civil Service at large and the general wage levels
of Singaporeans?</p>

because we are not privy to what the MX9 formula is but we are under
the understanding that it was more in line with general wage levels than
it is to the top 1,000 Singaporean earners. So does the Deputy Prime

is in the top 1,000 earners in Singapore?</p>

whether he believes that the MX9 (Superscale) salary grade is representative

We came out with the reason why we used the MX9 formula, it had nothing
to do with whether or not we felt that the people who are earning
the MX9 salary, are a larger group of people than the top 1,000
earners in Singapore. The principle why we took MX9 was because we
felt that that would be more representative of the majority of Singaporeans
rather than the top 1,000. And that is the reason why we have chosen
that, it is not because we felt that it is a larger pool of people that
we can deal with. </p>

I do not think any salary formula can be representative of everybody in

I think the Deputy Prime Minister has tried to press me on the fact
of whether I agree with him on whether it is pegged to the general
wage levels. I have already said in my first reply that I have to
accept that it is what the Deputy Prime Minister said. If it is
not pegged to the general wage levels, I have to accept that. The
point I was trying to make is that the reason why we came up with
the MX9 level was because we felt that, that was the general amount
that would be more representative of the majority of Singaporeans.
And obviously it is not the median wage level, but it is more representative
of the majority of Singaporeans.</p>

Sir, I think we have moved away from the whole concept of benchmarking
against the lowest income earners in Singapore. MX9 is what we felt
would be a reasonable level to peg MPs' salaries against. And the
reason why we chose the regular Civil Service rather than the Administrative
Service was because we were aware that the lowest entry Superscale
for the Administrative Service, SR9, is pegged to the 15th highest
earners aged 32. And so it is a much higher benchmark than what
the MX9 is. So we felt that MX9 is more reflective of what the majority
of Singaporeans earn rather than the top earners in Singapore.</p>

tax relief period for Pioneer Service Incentive. The Pioneer Service
Incentive was introduced in 1984 to encourage companies to engage
in high value-added activities, such as consultancy and research
and development in Singapore. The legislation currently stipulates
a minimum tax relief period of five years for companies awarded
the Pioneer Incentive Service scheme. The minimum tax relief period
will be removed to grant more flexibility to our economic agencies
in the award of an incentive package to better meet the needs of
companies. Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 18 of the Act to
give legislative effect to this. </p>

of the Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI). The Development
and Expansion Incentive (DEI) was introduced in 1996 to encourage
companies to expand by investing in technology and major upgrading
of equipment and operations. To ensure that only expansionary activities
are incentivised, a base income is imposed on existing activities
and the concessionary tax rate is applied, only to profits above
the base income. The base income is re-calculated on every extension
of the DEI after year 10. Re-calculating the base income, however,
transits companies to a much higher effective tax rate and makes
the DEI less competitive in encouraging companies to continue to
expand and stay rooted in Singapore.</p>

greater tax certainty, we will remove the need for the base income
to be re-calculated after year 10. Instead, the concessionary tax
rate will be increased by at least 0.5 percentage points at the
beginning of the 11th year and the 16th year to ensure that tax
revenues will not be eroded. Clause 4 of the Bill amends section
19J of the Act to give legislative effect to this enhancement.</p>

for international legal services. The DEI for international legal
services was introduced in 2010 Budget Statement to encourage law
practices to do more international legal services work from Singapore
and to attract international law practices to set up offices in
Singapore. This scheme will be reviewed after five years and can
only be awarded for up to five years of tax relief at a concessionary
tax rate of 10%. Clause 6 of the Bill inserts a new section 19KA
of the Act to effect these specific features of the scheme.</p>

the remaining legislative changes arising from our periodic review
of the income tax system are either technical in nature or relate

commitment to monitor the effectiveness of our tax incentive regime

Thank you, Sir. I would like to ask the Minister, with clause 3
in this Amendment Bill, there seems to be now more flexibility in
the tax relief period that pioneer services companies can enjoy.
I am not sure why the minimum requirement of five years of tax relief
is being removed. Nevertheless, my interest in this lies in whether
our local enterprises are benefiting
from this Pioneer Status Scheme. Could I therefore ask the Minister,
how many certificates have been given to local SMEs versus those
given to foreign companies and MNCs?</p>

we remove the minimum period of five years is to give our economic agencies
the flexibility to award less than five years if the kind of activities
brought in do not justify for five years. Whereas the current registration
requires us to give a minimum of five years so we are committed
to at least five years. So this gives us the flexibility. Pioneer
incentives are available to all companies who qualify. And the third
point is, I do not have the specific statistics, if the Member would file
a Question for Oral Answer, we will provide the numbers.</p>

                     </span>:
Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, while the Bill amends many Acts, I will
focus on two sets of amendments - those affecting the Criminal Procedure
Code, and those affecting the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order
and Nuisance) Act.</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-652b3097-cea0-4917-a0db-dfb34e039662">

Code or CPC. Clause 21(a) to (c) of the Bill amends the CPC with respect
to bail.</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-9e4f1f30-e94e-403f-8bce-05e33e3b9adb">
                     <a name="id-c85b0750-9ca2-4584-8962-6e7f2faa7fa4__id-9e4f1f30-e94e-403f-8bce-05e33e3b9adb"><!--a--></a>Clause 21(b) of the Bill
amends section 95(1)(a) to allow a court to consider whether to
release an arrested person on bail in all cases except where the
accused is charged with an offence punishable with death or imprisonment
for life. </p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-41169d74-5789-4020-8a6a-95d12bd8d63d">

will allow a court to grant bail where an accused is charged with
an offence which attracts imprisonment of 20 years or more, which
the current provision does not allow. I support this amendment,
as it will give a court the discretion to decide whether to grant
bail in such cases. The court can then apply the usual principles
in deciding whether to grant or deny bail to an accused, looking
at factors, such as the seriousness of the offence and punishment,
the risk of the accused absconding and the risk of further offences
being committed while he is on bail. </p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-f5eb7ce6-eeb8-42aa-9f5c-6e916fce38f5">

21(b) also rectifies an issue which recently arose in the case of <em class="ph i">Mohamed Hisham
bin Sapandi v PP [</em>2011] 4 SLR 868. There, the prosecution and
the defence had argued that the wording of the existing section
95(1)(a) was capable of two different interpretations, as the term
"20 years or more" was ambiguous. In any event, the problematic
clause will now be deleted.</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-b0c81ae6-cf74-4bb2-bd5d-223af66d21c2">

section 95, there has been an issue surrounding this section which
would be good to clarify in this debate.</p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-ff610176-b7c6-42bb-9252-b23f364fc7a7">

the court in granting bail in three situations: firstly, where the
accused is charged with an offence punishable with death or life
imprisonment; secondly, where he is a proven flight risk and the
court believes he will continue to be so; and, thirdly, where he
is arrested or taken into custody under warrants issued under the
Extradition Act. </p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-c7e15ec2-3f2b-4b63-b4c0-535771a4212d">

restrictions under section 95(1) apply to only the Subordinate Courts
or to the High Court as well arose in <em class="ph i">Mohamed Hisham's</em> case.
This is because there is an unqualified provision in section 97(1)
of the CPC which allows the High Court to grant bail to any accused
before it, or release him on personal bond, or to vary the amount
or conditions of bail or bond required by a police officer or a
Subordinate Court, as it thinks fit. </p>

the Deputy Public Prosecutors appeared to accept that the High Court's
power to grant or vary bail under section 97 was not fettered by
section 95. This view was accepted by the High Court in <em class="ph i">Mohamed
Hisham's</em> case. However, it was noted that there had been an earlier,
conflicting High Court decision in <em class="ph i">S </em>
                     <em class="ph i">Selvamsylvester v
PP</em> [2005] 4 SLR 409 which held that the High Court's power to
grant bail was subject to the restrictions in the equivalent sections
of the former CPC. </p>

to be grappling with what Parliament's intention is in enacting
the bail provisions under the old and new CPC, could this Bill have
included an amendment to clarify the position once and for all?
Or would Minister assist at least to clarify what Parliament's intention
is on this issue?</p>

concerning the Miscellaneous Offences Act (MOA). Under clause 28
of the Bill, the Commissioner of Police may authorise any person
or class of persons to possess truncheons which are batons, handcuffs
or specified weapons or equipment in a public place if the Commissioner
deems it necessary and appropriate. </p>
                  <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-89b65a08-50f7-4b17-96e3-8a9fb483a5f6">

widens the worrying section 22A of the Act which allows the Commissioner
to authorise persons in the private security industry to carry such
items in public. The existing section 22A was inserted in August
2007 and, at that Parliamentary debate, I raised my concern about
giving private security personnel such items, when they did not
have police powers nor received the same training. Some of these
items are meant for use in physical confrontations with members
of the public. As security officers generally have only citizen's
powers which are limited, the risk of use of excessive force will
arise. Should security officers become overzealous, or even in good
faith act or cause injury to the public, will the citizen be left
simply to sue the individual security officer and his employer?
In other countries, the accountability of private security officers
for wrongful acts has been a big issue, and it is a matter of time
I feel before this surfaces here.</p>

                  </span>: Mr Deputy
Speaker, Sir, may I draw the attention of this House to the Bankruptcy Act
which clause 13 of this Bill seeks to amend. This clause makes changes
to the adjournment of bankruptcy cases in Court and to bankruptcy
applications. I have two questions for the Minister. </p>

provide us with the number of bankrupt individuals sent for debt restructuring
schemes against the number of those who are discharged in the past
year? What I would like to know is whether the numbers of bankrupt
individuals are increasing or dropping, or if the majority of them
are simply sent for debt restructuring schemes. </p>

of a recent case that was reported in December 2011, in which the bankruptcy
orders for three former directors of the National Kidney Foundation
(NKF) – Richard Yong, Matilda Chua and the late Loo Say San – were
annulled. This has not been sufficiently examined by the media. Would the Minister
give details of this case and an account of the annulment of the
bankruptcy orders for these ex-directors of the NKF? I am sure Singaporeans
would like to know more about bankruptcy laws in Singapore and how
they have been applied to major cases like the NKF saga of 2006.</p>

                     <strong class="ph b">Mr K Shanmugam</strong>
                  </span>: Sir, if
I may deal with Mrs Chiam's questions first. As to the precise numbers which
are sent for debt restructuring versus bankruptcy, I am afraid you
should file a Parliamentary Question and then I can get the data
out. Likewise, the reasons why bankrupts get discharged from bankruptcy,
the Act sets out the requirements before one can get a discharge
or annulment, and those conditions have to be satisfied objectively
before you can get the orders. So if the Member wishes to know precisely
what happened in those cases – because I do not track every single
case of bankruptcy or reasons for annulment, insofar as the law
would allow, and I would need to check that – if the Member would
file a question we will check that and we will provide the answer.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-1fffef6f-e279-418f-838a-90ce217195ba">
                  <a name="id-c85b0750-9ca2-4584-8962-6e7f2faa7fa4__id-1fffef6f-e279-418f-838a-90ce217195ba"><!--a--></a>As regards the two points
made by the hon Member, Ms Sylvia Lim, I think the question on bail
and sections 95, 97, is a valid one. It was considered recently
last year in Hisham's case. The High Court held that its power to
grant or vary bail under section 97(1) would be redundant if it
were qualified by other provisions, specifically section 95(1).
And I think the statement is very clear, it was directly on point
in contrast to the earlier case which I think was decided in 2005.
And our view is that the statutory language is clear, the judgement
is clear, and the latest decision sets out the law. Nevertheless,
I thank the Member for raising it, allowing me to clarify that the
discretion is unfettered, and if the issue arises again, we will
certainly amend, to put that beyond doubt. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-4c2522ac-8cf3-46c5-955c-f6f01d8557d6">
                  <a name="id-c85b0750-9ca2-4584-8962-6e7f2faa7fa4__id-4c2522ac-8cf3-46c5-955c-f6f01d8557d6"><!--a--></a>On the second concern
on the power of the Commissioner of Police (CP) to authorise the
carrying, possession, and so on, of truncheons, handcuffs. Ms Lim's
point, and again it is a valid point, is about really the abuse
of such powers. A number of our laws provide for law enforcement
officers to carry such equipment needed for their work. For example,
of course, the Police Force Act, Immigration Act, Misuse of Drugs
Act, including the Miscellaneous Offences Act (MOA). The present
amendment supplements those provisions by giving the CP the general
power to authorise the carrying and possession and control of these
equipment. But before he gives any authorisation, the Commissioner must
be satisfied that it is necessary in the circumstances and appropriate
for the function to be given. And authorisations would be granted
to law enforcement officers who need to carry or possess the relevant
equipment in the course of their work. And that authorisation will
have to be stringently assessed; conditions will be imposed on authorised
persons, including proper training for the use of the equipment;
limits on where, when and the purposes for which the equipment can
be used; proper safekeeping and issuance of the equipment; and the
type and specifications of the equipment. And the person who breaches
the condition will be acting outside his authority to carry, possess,
control or use the equipment. If he does so in a public place, meaning
if he acts contrary to the authorisation in public place, that would
be a criminal offence. And if there is an unauthorised use of force,
that may disclose further offences. And those acts will be seriously
investigated, any abuse of powers will be disciplined or prosecuted,
and their authorisations will also, of course, be revoked. So I
thank the Member for raising the question and allowing me to set
out the framework within which these powers can be exercised. </p>

                  </span>: Thank you,
Sir. Two clarifications for the Minister. The Minister mentioned
in response that, for the MOA amendments, it is envisaged that the
Commissioner of Police (CP) would be authorising law enforcement
officers to carry such items. But the existing provision actually
foresees people from the private sector doing that. The existing
section 22(a) talks about private security. I would like the Minister
to clarify whether there are going be, besides private security,
other people from the private sector within CP's radar, for such
authorisation. Secondly, – it is a suggestion – I wonder if the Ministry
has considered that for these private sector people, whether there
should be additional insurance
against public liability taken out to protect possible members of
the public who may need to lodge civil claims for compensation,
at least to ensure that their claims would be met.</p>

I think I will have to answer both questions on behalf of the Minister
for Home Affairs. My understanding is that it is not envisaged that
persons other than private security industry professionals are intended
to be the beneficiaries of the exercise of these powers. If there
is a further clarification on that, I would certainly come back.
That is my understanding of the current position. And on the point
about insurance: I think it is a fair point that if they have these
powers and there could be potential victims, albeit they will be
acting <em class="ph i">ultra vires</em> and illegally, nevertheless, I think insurance
is a factor that the Commissioner should take into account before
giving such authorisation. I accept that.</p>

                  </span>:
Last year, the Government announced that it would introduce a data
protection law in Singapore to curb the excessive and unauthorised
collection and use of consumers' personal data, and that the proposed
law was expected to be in place by 2012.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-252ba388-8bad-4986-b341-d7f4458e96da">
                  <a name="hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-252ba388-8bad-4986-b341-d7f4458e96da"><!--a--></a>As data protection is
a complex issue with wide-ranging impact, it was necessary to undertake careful
study and conduct in-depth consultations with stakeholders in order
to formulate a framework that best meets stakeholders' needs while
providing adequate safeguards to consumers. As part of the process,
MICA launched a public consultation on 13 September 2011 to seek
public views on the proposed framework, as well as initial views
on whether a national Do-Not-Call (DNC) registry should be set up
in Singapore. </p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-78ec9aa9-cf1a-4eb3-a191-befdd82ab1b0">
                  <a name="hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-78ec9aa9-cf1a-4eb3-a191-befdd82ab1b0"><!--a--></a>In view of the strong
public interest and support for the proposed DNC registry, a second
public consultation was launched on 31 October 2011 to seek public
feedback on the implementation details of the proposed DNC registry.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-2482595b-4705-421a-9b91-d839512c65d0">
                  <a name="hansardContent43a675dd-5000-42da-9fd5-40978d79310f__id-2482595b-4705-421a-9b91-d839512c65d0"><!--a--></a>MICA and IDA have reviewed
the feedback received from the public consultations and are working with
the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) to draft the proposed Data
Protection Bill, which includes the proposed DNC registry. Another
round of public consultation will be conducted in the first quarter
of 2012 to seek further feedback on the proposed Bill. We expect
to introduce the Data Protection Bill in Parliament by the third
quarter of this year.</p>
               <p class="p hcParagraph" id="id-182c82ee-fdf1-4191-a7f1-a3cf44c72b9f">

law is expected to be enacted by this year, a sunrise period of
between one to two years, during which the data protection law is
enacted but will not come into force, will be provided to allow
organisations sufficient time to put in place the necessary measures
to comply with the law. Based on the feedback we received from the
public consultation, most were in favour of a one- to two-year sunrise
period.</p>

it is expected to be operational approximately one year after the
data protection law is passed. This period of time is necessary
for the registry operator to be appointed and to carry out system
development and testing before the DNC registry goes "live".</p>
