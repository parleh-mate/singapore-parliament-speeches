<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>TEACHING OF TAMIL IN</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4>NON-TAMIL MEDIUM</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>SECONDARY SCHOOLS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr S. V. Lingam</b> asked the Minister for Education

(a) what mini-mum number of pupils who wish to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>



study Tamil there must be in any particular non-Tamil

medium secondary school before a visiting teacher to

teach Tamil as a secondary language is sent to that

school; (b) whether at present, a visiting Tamil

teacher visits each such school where there is that

required minimum number; and (c) what provision is

made and the manner in which children who cannot

receive secondary language instruction in secondary

schools they attend due to inadequate numbers are

kept occupied in those periods when other children

in their respective classes are receiving instruction

in the other second languages.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a general

rule, a full-time teacher is posted to a secondary

school to teach Tamil as a secondary language if there

are at least four classes of 15 pupils each, or 60

pupils in all, who require instruction in that subject.

In such a situation, the school will have 15 periods

of Tamil a week, the minimum number to warrant the

posting of a full-time teacher. In practice, the

rule is not rigidly enforced and the Ministry will

post a full-time teacher to a school even where there

are fewer than four classes, or where some of the

classes have fewer than 15 pupils each, so long as

there are no less than 15 periods of Tamil on the

time-table.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a group of schools in the same vicinity jointly

satisfy the minimum requirements and if their

time-tables can be arranged to suit, a visiting

Tamil teacher is sent to serve the group. At present

, there are three secondary schools which satisfy

the minimum requirements and have full-time Tamil

teachers on their staff. They are Raffles Institution,

Naval Base Full School and Pasir Panjang Secondary

School.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In secondary schools which do not qualify for a

full-time or a visiting Tamil teachers, pupils who

wish to study Tamil as a second language can do so

at any one of the 18 Tamil language centres: nine

functioning in the morning and the other nine in the

afternoon. Each centre is located in a secondary

school to serve a group of other secondary schools in

the same neighbour-hood. Pupils are free to attend the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>



centre serving their own school or another centre

which may be nearer their home. Pupils who do not

receive instruction in the second language of their

choice in school during the second language periods

are encouraged to study as a non-examination

subject whatever second language is taught during

such periods. Those who prefer to spend such

periods preparing for other subjects may do so, and

supervision is provided wherever possible.

<div align="center"><b>INDUSTRIAL HEALTH SERVICE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng</b> asked the Minister for

Health  when  he  wil1l start an  Industrial  Health

Service   in   view  of  the  rapid  expansion   of

industries in our Nation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> In keeping with our rapidly

industrialising society, the Ministry of Health has

already   taken  initial  steps  to  establish   an

Industrial Health Service in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April last year, a Health Officer, already

holding  a Diploma in Public Health, returned  from

the  United  Kingdom after successfully  completing

one   year's  training  in  Industrial  Health  and

obtaining  the  postgraduate Diploma in  industrial

Health.   At  present,  two  officers  with   civil

engineering qualifications are being trained in the

United   Kingdom  in  postgraduate  Public   Health

Engineering course and, on their return later  this

year,   will  cover  the  engineering  aspects   of

industrial  health. Also the Chemistry Division  of

the  Ministry has been granted a Fellowship in  the

United Kingdom this year under the Colombo Plan for

a  chemist  to  study  air pollution,  trade  waste

analysis  and microbiological assays to  complement

the  new  industrial health service that is  to  be

established.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Liaison is also being maintained at present with

the  Factories  Inspectorate  of  the  Ministry  of

Labour  through the Environmental Health Branch  of

the Ministry in making available the Health Officer

with  the Diploma in Industrial Health on  a  part-time   basis  to  advise  on  medical  aspects   of

factories inspection.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, two consultants, one from the World

Health   Organisation  and  the  other   from   the

international  Labour  Organisation,  are  due   to

arrive  in Singapore this year to advise Government

on   the   proposed  pattern  of   development   of

industrial   health;   in   particular,   how   the

specialised aspects of industrial health should  be

organised and developed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only when more staff are being trained in the

different aspects of industrial health can a  full-fledged  industrial Health Service be brought  into

being, and every effort is being made to bring this

about as soon as possible.

<div align="center"><b>SUPERVISION OF DRAIN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CLEANING IN KAMPONG</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CHIA HENG</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mrs Devan Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mrs Devan Nair</b> asked the Minister for Health

if  he  is satisfied with the supervision exercised

over  the  contract  workmen who  clean  drains  at

Kampong  Chia Heng as the drains there  are  choked

with  rubbish and the environmental conditions  are

not  conducive  to the health of the  residents  in

that Kampong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> It is admitted that there was

no  supervision  of  contract  workmen  last  month

(February  1967)  who  were  responsible  for   the

cleansing  and desilting of the large anti-malarial

drain  which  runs through Kampong  Chia  Heng  off

Thomson Road, near the junction with Newton Road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two main reasons for this lack of

supervision.  Firstly,  there  was  an  unfortunate

delay  of  one month in the award of the tender  to

Poh  Construction Co., which should have been  made

with effect from the 1st of January, 1967, but  was

not  finalised till the 1st of February, 1967, thus

resulting in the accumulation of silt, etc. for one

month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, because of the three-day wild-cat

strike by the Public Daily-Rated Cleansing Workers'

Union on the 1st of February, 1967, the supervisory

staff  of the Public Cleansing Department had their

hands full in pursuing with re-organisation of  the

Public Cleansing Service, and were therefore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>



not  in  the  position  to supervise  the  contract

workmen  for this and other drains, but supervisory

work  commenced with effect from the 1st  of  March

this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The backlog of silt in the anti-malarial drain

passing  through Kampong Chia Heng has  since  been

removed,  and I can assure the Member for  Moulmein

that  there  are adequate provisions in the  tender

contracts     to    penalise    contractors     for

unsatisfactory work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 13 of the contract, the Ministry has

the power to request the contractor to increase his

work  force  within 24 hours and to deal  with  any

complaint without extra claim on the Ministry,  and

if  this  is not rectified within seven  days,  the

Ministry  can  deal with the matter  and  bill  the

contractor  for  the extra cost  involved.  And  in

clause  35,  if  work is still unsatisfactory,  the

Ministry  has the power to make deductions  against

monthly dues.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT PENSIONERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AND PENSIONS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Yeoh Ghim Seng</b> asked the Minister for

Finance how many Government pensioners there are in

Singapore  and whether their pensions are  assessed

to  be  sufficient to see them through their  daily

needs.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the total number of

Government  pensioners  at  present  is  8,710.  Of

these, 3,035 are living in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount which a pensioner will receive on

retirement depends on his length of service and his

last drawn salary. The maximum which an officer may

receive  as pension is equal to two-thirds  of  his

last  drawn  salary. To qualify for this,  he  will

have  to complete a length of service of 33 1/3 years.

Since  most  Government  officers  join  the  civil

service for a career, most



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>



officers  will,  on retirement,  have  completed  a

length  of  service  fairly  close  to  the  number

necessary to qualify for the maximum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of whether such pension is

sufficient  to  see a pensioner through  his  daily

needs  can best be assessed by comparing his income

and commitments before and after his retirement.  A

serving  officer will have to meet from his  salary

his  personal expenditure, the expenditure  of  his

family,   and   to  have  a  small  saving.   After

retirement,  his personal expenditure should  fall.

His family expenditure should also fall since some,

if  not all his children would by then be grown  up

and  be  no  longer dependent on  him.  He  is  not

expected  to  save  from  his  pension.  Thus,  his

expenditure  should fall by at least  one-third  or

more.   As   already  explained,  his   income   on

retirement  will  be  reduced by  about  one-third.

Since this fall is matched by a corresponding  fall

in  his expenditure, a pensioner is expected to  be

no worse off than before his retirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some officers who opt to commute a

quarter of their pension for a lump sum payment  as

gratuity  on retirement. In such cases, the  amount

of  pension  payable will be reduced by a  quarter.

The  reduced  amount payable monthly will  then  be

about half his last drawn salary. This may then  be

found  insufficient. Officers who require a  higher

monthly   income  from  their  pension,  therefore,

should  not  opt  for  a gratuity.  The  choice  is

theirs.

<div align="center"><b>ROAD AND STREET NAMES IN CHINESE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo</b> asked the Minister for

Finance  whether he will take steps to improve  the

rendering in Chinese of the names of certain  roads

and streets as shown on the street name-boards.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Ramaswamy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr S. Ramaswamy) (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a general rule, it

is  desirable  to avoid translations  into  various

languages as both literal and phonetic translations

are often misleading.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice since 1961 has been to give names in

Roman  characters to avoid complications in finding

houses  or  premises.  There are  instances  where,

through  usage, the name of a street in Chinese  is

quite  unrelated  to  the version  in  English.  It

would,   therefore,  be  desirable  to  allow   the

community  to  use  such names as  become  familiar

through practice rather than to provide for literal

and phonetic translations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. Member has any specific suggestions

as to the rendering in Chinese of particular roads,

these would be considered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (Choa Chu Kang):</b> May I ask

whether the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for  Finance  is aware that the literal translation

of  "Raffles  Place" is Raffles  being  abusive  or

impolite,  and also whether he is taking  steps  to

have that remedied?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ramaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ramaswamy:</b> I do not know the Chinese

Language, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> A further supplementary

question, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I have informed the Parliamentary

Secretary that the literal translation of  "Raffles

Place"  does mean Raffles being impolite  or  being

abusive   -  "Lai  fu  si  Buli",  "Buli"   meaning

"impolite" - will  he now consider taking  steps  to

remedy the situation?

<div align="center"><b>UNDESIRABLE PUBLICATIONS BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing Undesirable Publications

Ordinance (Chapter 124) there are two major aspects

in  the  control  of  undesirable  publications  of

various nature. The first is that of banning  these

undesirable publications under section 3,  and  the

second,  that of detaining these under sections  10

and 11.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the first aspect, that of banning, the

existing  Ordinance does not provide for  effective

control of these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>



undesirable  publications in that by the  time  the

action  of  banning  such  publications  is   being

effected  by Gazette Notification, numerous  copies

of  such  publications  could  have  been  sold  or

distributed. In addition, no provision is made  for

an   effective  means  of  curbing  the   sale   of

undesirable  publications  in  the  many   roadside

stalls  which channel these publications to members

of  the public, and there is no way of checking the

printing  machines which produce, quite easily  and

under cover, undesirable publications from time  to

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning the second aspect, that of detention

under  the  existing Ordinance, this  can  only  be

effected at the Customs, post offices, airport  and

other  check points where importers have to declare

their  consignments  of  publications  and  produce

samples  for examination before their sale  to  the

public. But in some cases such publications are not

declared  and are intercepted at the check  points,

as  a  result of our random examination. These  are

detained.  There is, however, no provision  in  the

Ordinance to detain undesirable publications  which

have evaded these check points or smuggled into the

Republic  through the Causeway or other clandestine

channels. We have no power to detain these if  they

are found on sale in the Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cope with this situation, clause 12 is

introduced.  This  is the new and only  significant

amendment  made  to  the existing  Ordinance.  This

reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) A Controller may authorise any police

officer  not below the rank of Inspector  to  enter

and  search  any  premises or place  where  he  has

reasonable   cause  to  believe   any   publication

prejudicial to public safety or public interest  in

Singapore is likely to be found, and to seize  such

publication so found.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A Controller may detain such publication for

so  long  as  he  deems necessary and  may  in  his

absolute   discretion  destroy  or  cause   to   be

destroyed such publication so detained.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Undesirable Publications Ordinance is

repealed  and is re-enacted with the amendments  to

make  it  more tidy, in view of the many amendments

effected in the past.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to assure the House that the Government

will  operate this new authority with the  greatest

responsibility and discretion. There  is  provision

for  any  aggrieved  person or  persons  to  appeal

against  such act to the Minister under section  15

of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Guan Hoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Guan Hoo (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I would like to ask  the  Minister,

when  he  introduced  the Undesirable  Publications

Bill,  whether  he  has noticed that  in  Singapore

there  is  another  kind of  publication  based  on

profit-making, and profit-making alone. Because  of

this, these publishers are doing business with very

undesirable  motives. They resort to all  sorts  of

names  to  canvass for advertisements from  various

commercial  houses.  After the advertisements  have

been canvassed, there are only enough copies of the

publications    for    distribution    among    the

advertisers.  Members of the public, including  the

Minister  himself, will not be able  to  read  such

publications.  This  kind of publication  is  often

used  to  deceive businessmen in Singapore  and  to

swindle  them  of their money. So if  there  is  no

provision in this Bill to restrict or control  such

illegal or unlawful activities, then those who  are

desirous  of advertising in good publications  will

meet with sonic trouble in future and will hesitate

to  advertise. I do not know whether  the  Minister

has paid any attention to this matter.



<br><br><!-- Dr Chew Chin Han -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chew Chin Han (Tampines):</b> In the past few

years,    there   have,   in   fact,   been    some

so  and so at certain addresses. The advertisements

are  in  small size - at $5 or $8 per square inch  or

so. I wonder if the Minister has taken any steps to

do anything about it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, legislation

in   the   field   of  censorship  is   notoriously

difficult, and so is the administration of the law.

This   is  partly  because  no  community  is  ever

reasonably unanimous as to what it requires



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>



in  the  way  of censorship, whether  political  or

moral.   The   degree  of  frankness   allowed   in

literature varies from place to place, from  decade

to decade, .and from person to person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am particularly concerned here with

publications  classified as  undesirable  on  moral

grounds.    However   well   laws   against    such

publications,  that  is,  obscene  or  pornographic

publications,  may be framed, they will  always  be

open  to  abuse  by  reactionary  authoritarianism,

fanatical   puritanism,  official  stupidity,   and

sensationalism of the Press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of films, there is a safeguard

against  such  abuses, as there is a  Film  Appeals

Committee which can review, on appeal, films banned

or  cut by the Film Censor. But for books there  is

no  Board of Appeal, although this Bill allows  for

an  appeal to be made against the decision  of  the

Controller of Publications to the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity should now be taken to review and

improve  the legislation so that the final decision

is  not left to one man, but can be made by a Board

of   Appeal   which   should  take   into   account

particularly  the  special needs  of  libraries  or

restricted  classes of persons  who  need  to  have

available  certain publications in the interest  of

scholarship or research.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, propose that a Board of Appeal be

set  up  to  review, on appeal, publications  which

have  been  declared  morally  undesirable  by  the

Controller   of  Publications.  It  may   also   be

advisable  to  give the Board power to  review  the

categories  of undesirable publications,  that  is,

whether  they  are undesirable on political  or  on

moral   grounds.  I  shall  say  more   about   the

constitution  of this Board when  we  come  to  the

Committee stage on clause 15 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as legal liability goes, publishers are

primarily responsible for the matter and the manner

of  publications. Printers, authors and booksellers

should,  therefore, be relieved  of  responsibility

for undesirable publications. Booksellers cannot be

expected  to  read  all they  sell,  nor  are  they

necessarily qualified to assess the legal propriety

of a book, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>



they should only be penalised if they conduct their

business  in  a way calculated to make a  salacious

appeal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any form of censorship must take into account the

fact   that   it  is  generally  unwise   to   make

publications attractive by labelling them forbidden

fruit. As standards of education and discrimination

rise,  society  itself would shun  pornography  and

obscenity  in publications which have no merit  but

sell in quantity.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang (Kampong Kapor)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, as I have already given my views

in  Parliament on an earlier Bill on the subject of

society.  I  am  also  of  the  opinion  that  this

Undesirable  Publications  Bill  is  belated.   The

reason  for my saying so is that undesirable events

had  already  occurred in 1964. We have  made  this

announcement so that our people can live  in  peace

and   can   make  progress.  We  know   there   are

publications which are trying to destroy the  unity

of  the  people.  I do not wish to  identify  these

publications as we already know them.  The  reports

in  these  publications are not  truthful  and  are

designed    to   mislead   their   readers.    This

misrepresentation may lead to the readers having no

faith  in  them.  If this Bill had  been  submitted

before  1964,  I believe the undesirable  incidents

which  occurred in 1964 would not have taken place.

Mr  Speaker, I gave my views on this subject  when

we  debated on the Budget. The reports or  articles

in  these publications are not true. We do not wish

them  to  be misrepresented or twisted so that  the

people  may  be  misled and thus a misunderstanding

can  arise. It is our duty to safeguard  the  well-being of our people. Therefore, every article  that

is  published  must be truthful in order  to  bring

about healthy and constructive criticisms from  the

people for the progress of our own country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I congratulate the Minister for Culture

and  Social  Affairs  on the introduction  of  this

Bill. With the stringent control exercised by  this

Bill,  our  people  will be able to  read  articles

which  can  bring  about healthy  and  constructive

criticisms in the interests of our country.

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  thank  the  Member for Choa Chu  Kang  for  his

suggestions  and observations on the Bill.  As  you

are   aware,   Sir,  in  the  original  Undesirable

Publications  Ordinance,  the  appeal  was  to  the

Minister  and it is not our intention to change  it

otherwise.  In  other  Ordinances,  such   as   the

Immigration  Ordinance, the  Women's  Charter,  the

Women's and Girls' Protection Ordinance, the appeal

is to the Minister and not to the court. There are,

of  course,  Boards  that make the  final  decision

without   further  reference  to  the  court,   for

example,  the decision of the Committee  of  Appeal

under  the Cinematograph Films Ordinance.  That  is

the  final  authority,  after  which  there  is  no

further appeal to the Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Undesirable Publications Ordinance is

different. As in the case of films, all the members

of  the  Appeal Committee can view the film at  the

same  time,  but in the case of publications.  Each

member of the Appeal Committee must go through  the

book  individually. This will result in long delays

which  are  not  desirable. We  are  setting  up  a

Committee to advise the Minister on whether certain

books  should be banned, and this should serve  the

purpose.  It is proposed that the committee  should

comprise  five  persons who are  experts.  When  it

operates, I can assure the hon. Member for Choa Chu

Kang  that  it  will  look into  and  consider  the

suggestions he has made.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to inform him that great

literary  classics are never banned, even  if  they

are  on  sex.  Current foreign books, if  they  are

published  by  reputable firms and are acknowledged

by  literary  critics, are also  not  banned.  Sir,

books  on  birth  control are not  banned,  as  the

Ministry  of Culture itself prints such  books  for

the  Public  Health  Division of  the  Ministry  of

Health  and  the  Singapore  Family  Planning   and

Population  Board  for  free  distribution  to  the

public.  Nude pictures, if they are in photographic

art books or in paintings, are never banned if they

are  real  works of art and are not  calculated  to

show nudity in its vulgar form with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>



intention to corrupt the minds of the young.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the National Library and the

University  Library,  banned  books  are  available

there  and  are released to academic personnel  for

research  and  other  purposes subject  to  certain

safeguards.  Such books are also available  in  the

Registry  of Publications of the Ministry  for  the

use of such people on application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the questions raised by the Member for Bukit

Merah  and the Member for Tampines, we have so  far

not received any complaints on the subject. If more

facts are available, we will, of course, look  into

them.  As  for the comments made by the Member  for

Kampong Kapor, my answer is, it is better late than

never.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the titles of "Customs Officer" and "Revenue

Officer"  in  the  Customs  Ordinance,  1960,  were

changed to "Assistant Superintendent of Customs and

Excise" and "Customs Officer" respectively. As  the

rank  of  "Customs Officer" is the lowest  in  the

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am glad to

note  that  the  Minister for  Culture  and  Social

Affairs  is appointing a board to advise  him  when

appeals  are made to him regarding the banning  and

detention  of books. Perhaps he would like  to  put

forward, for the consideration and guidance of this

board,  certain fundamental principles in  deciding

whether  or  not  a book which has been  banned  on

moral grounds should continue to be banned. While I

realise  the  force of the argument in leaving  the

final  decision to the Minister where  publications

are banned on political grounds, there is a lot  to

be  said,  where publications are banned  on  moral

grounds,  for the final decision to be  made  by  a

board   of  appeal.  Perhaps  the  Minister   would

reconsider his decision and, if possible,  at  this

late hour, amend the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the board - be it an appeals board or

just  a  board to advise the Minister  - should  take

into consideration:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The dominant effect of the book as a whole;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The literary or artistic merits, or the

medical,  legal,  political, social  or  scientific

character or importance of the book;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The persons, classes of persons or age groups

for,  or  amongst whom the book is intended  or  is

likely   to   be   published,  distributed,   sold,

exhibited, given, sent or delivered;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) The price at which the book sells or is

intended to be sold;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Whether any person is likely to be corrupted

by  reading the book and whether other persons  are

likely to benefit therefrom;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) Whether the book displays an honest purpose

and  a  seriousness of intention,  or  whether  its

contents are camouflaged, purely designed to render

acceptable any indecent part of the book.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the publication or distribution of any book

would  be  in  the  interest  of  art,  literature,

science  or  learning and would be for  the  public

good,   the  board  should  not  classify   it   as

undesirable.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon (Minister of State of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State of Defence (Mr Wee Toon Boon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to repeal and re-enact with

certain  amendments section 23 of the Criminal  Law

(Temporary Provisions) Ordinance, 1955.  As  stated

in  the  Explanatory Statement, the main object  of

the  Bill  is  to make it unlawful for any  workmen

engaged  in the very important essential  services,

namely, water, gas and electricity services, to  go

on strike at all, and similarly for the employer to

lock-out any workmen engaged in these services. The

prohibition by itself would appear to hon.  Members

to  be  a drastic step in curtailing the rights  of

trade unions to go on strike, but recent experience

has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>



made  it  necessary  for  the  Government  to  take

positive measures to ensure that the public are not

held to ransom by a few irresponsible elements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members will recall that in 1961,  when  the

workers  in  the  public utility services  went  on

strike, British and Singapore Army technicians  had

to  be brought in to man the essential services, as

any  failure  in  the  water, electricity  and  gas

supplies would not only mean a serious breakdown in

the   essentials  of  life,  but  also  result   in

dangerous  and  serious damage to public  property.

The  inexpert handling of electrical machinery  and

water  pumping  equipment  and  explosions  by  air

getting  into  the  gas main  can  cause  extensive

damage  and  havoc  to  the community.  Further,  a

strike in these essential services would mean  that

the overall economic situation of Singapore and its

economic future would be jeopardised. No government

can  allow any section of the population  to  cause

such serious and irreparable damage to the country.

As these services are part of the vital services of

the  country, no strikes will be permitted in these

areas  which  are already designated  as  protected

places under the security laws of Singapore. For  a

strike  must mean that the Government  has  to  use

troops  to  carry out the duties of these  workers,

which would, in fact, mean the assumption of powers

to  break  a  strike through the use  of  uniformed

personnel. Members will agree that this  is  highly

undesirable. Government is not unsympathetic to the

genuine  grievances of the workers and,  therefore,

any  future disputes in the public utility services

will  be  resolved by the established machinery  of

negotiation, conciliation and arbitration under our

industrial relations laws.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another special feature of the Bill is that no

strike  or lock-out shall take place in respect  of

the  other  essential services, unless a notice  is

given  at least 14 days before such strike or lock-out,  and such notice will expire at the end of  30

days  from  the  date of the notice.  The  existing

provisions  in the law are not clear in  regard  to

the notice period



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>



and the proposed amendments clarify the position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in the Explanatory Statement, the

proposed amendments provide that no strike or lock-out  shall take place before the date of the strike

or  lock-out specified in the notice or during  the

pendency   of   certain   proceedings   under   the

Industrial Relations Ordinance, 1960. Further,  the

penalties for offences under sections 26, 27 and 28

of  the  Ordinance  have been  increased  and  made

uniform in line with the other Ordinances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, by this Criminal Law

(Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Bill  which  has

been  submitted to Parliament today, I observe that

the  rights of the trade unionists have been eroded

by  the  pro-labour government. Before the  present

ruling  Party came to power, we, together with  the

trade  union movement, struggled to put up  a  pro-labour  government.  As  a  result  of  our  common

struggle,  we  were  successful.  During  the  1959

administration, with the support of the trade union

movement,  including that of the nationalist  trade

union  movement,  we managed to  isolate  the  pro-Communist trade union movement. The members of  the

nationalist pro-labour movement are those who  work

in   the  Public  Utilities  Board  and  who   have

struggled  hard  to  isolate the  front-line  trade

union  movement. But now, Mr Speaker, the  workers

of  the  P.U.B, are not permitted to go  on  strike

when this Bill becomes law. I know the difficulties

faced  by  the  Government in their  responsibility

towards  the  people when essential workers  go  on

strike, because they are responsible for the  well-being  and  livelihood of the people. On the  other

hand,  I do not think that the P.U.B, workers  will

go  on strike on a matter which is not serious.  If

it  is on a minor matter, I feel sure they will  be

prepared to come to a compromise rather than go  on

strike. But if it is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>



serious  matter, the Government has power to  refer

it  to the industrial Arbitration Court which  will

give  its findings, in this honourable way, strikes

can  be  avoided and this amendment to deter P.U.B.

workers from going on strike is not necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, some time ago the Singapore

Telephone Board was confronted with a strike by the

Union  because the employers refused  to  negotiate

with  the Union on its claims for better wages  and

conditions  of  service. But before  the  14  days'

notice  of strike expired, the Minister for  Labour

referred  the matter to the Industrial  Arbitration

Court  in  order  to prevent a strike  from  taking

place.  If he could avert a strike by the employees

of   the   Singapore  Telephone  Board,  which   is

discharging an essential service, I do not see  why

the  Minister of Defence requires these  amendments

to prevent the essential workers of the P.U.B. from

going on strike.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  Bill  proposes to amend, among other  things,

section   23   of   the  Criminal  Law   (Temporary

Provisions) Ordinance, 1955, by stipulating that no

workman   employed  in  the  water  services,   gas

services  and  electricity  services  shall  go  on

strike  or be locked out. The Government  also,  by

Gazette  Notification,  require  workers  who   are

employed  in  banking  services,  broadcasting  and

television services, public bus transport  and  air

services, to give 14 days' notice before  they  can

go  on  strike. Up to now, there has been  no  such

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I contend that such an

amendment  is uncalled for in view of the  adequacy

of  the  existing law which provides the Government

with   the   right  to  refer  trade  disputes   to

arbitration  if  strike action  in  these  services

harms   the  interest  of  the  community.  It   is

appreciated  that the employer of all  the  workers

engaged  in  the water services, gas  services  and

electricity services is the Public Utilities Board,

which is a statutory Board, and which is subject to

public control. It may be the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>



argument  of  the  Government,  in  advocating  the

abolition  of  strikes  in  these  three  essential

services, that the employer of the workmen  engaged

therein  is  not likely to exploit the workers  who

are  so rendered defenceless. While I do agree that

this House possesses the means of ensuring that the

employer  of  the workmen, from whom the  right  to

strike   is  taken  away,  does  not  take   unfair

advantage  of the situation, the fact remains  that

the  right  to strike has in the past served  as  a

psychological deterrent to the Board and its senior

employees  from  being  too  complacent  in   their

dealings with their employees. While the Government

may justify its proposal by claiming that the right

to   strike   has   been   abused   and   exercised

irresponsibly   by  workers  in  the   three   said

services,  this  by itself is no justification  for

the  total  ban  on strike by the workers  in  such

services,  if  the  Government is really  concerned

with the possibility that in the future, if it were

not  for such proposed ban on strike, the right  to

strike   would   be  abused  or  be   irresponsibly

exercised  by  the workers in the  three  services,

such  a  fear  on  the part of  the  Government  is

adequately  safeguarded by the relevant  provisions

of the Trade Disputes Ordinance of 1960; section  3

(1) thereof reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A strike shall be illegal if -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) it has any other object than the furtherance

of  a  trade  dispute  within  the  trade  or

industry  in which the strikers are  engaged;

or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) it is in furtherance of a trade dispute of

which  the  Industrial Arbitration Court  has

cognizance; or



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) it is designed or calculated to coerce the

Government  either directly or by  inflicting

hardship on the community.'



<br><br>Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I would have thought  that  the

provision of paragraph (c) of section 3 (1) of  the

Trade  Disputes Ordinance would have taken care  of

the  Government's  fear that the workers  in  these

three essential services would utilise the right to

strike  by coercing the Government either  directly

or  by inflicting hardship on the community. If the

Government  does really intend to ban strikes  from

these three services,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>



then  it  should, as a matter of necessity, provide

some more effective system of arbitration than  has

been   provided  under  the  Industrial   Relations

Ordinance to resolve disputes which would otherwise

have found expression in the form of a strike.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret to say that the present industrial

arbitration  machinery  is not  effective  for  the

purpose  of solving industrial disputes effectively

or  expeditiously. Even in the private sector, with

free  recourse to the right of strike, the workers'

experience  is that the machinery of the Industrial

Arbitration Courts does not confer on them adequate

protection  against  an unscrupulous  employer.  Of

course, I am not saying that the Government  is  an

unscrupulous  employer, but I must  emphasise  that

workers  and management personnel are human  beings

and that industrial disputes are bound to arise  at

any   time   in   the   course  of   their   mutual

relationship. It must also be remembered  that  the

strike weapon, while it serves to lend force to the

workers' demands on the employer, also serves as  a

means   of   focusing  attention  on  the  workers'

grievances,  whatever they may be. By  taking  away

such a means of bringing the workers' grievances to

the  notice of the relevant authorities, it becomes

more  imperative  that  the  Government,  which  is

proposing  this ban on strikes, should  provide  an

adequate and effective machinery to take the  place

of  strikes  as  a means of bringing  the  workers'

grievances to the attention of such authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I suggest that the Government

provide  a more effective system of arbitration  to

resolve  industrial disputes arising in a situation

where  the  workers have no recourse to the  strike

weapon.  It  is by no means to be assumed  by  this

House  that  I am in favour of the ban  on  strikes

even  though the ban is limited to the  workers  of

the  three  essential services. As  the  Secretary-General  of  the N.T.U.C., my stand is  clear,  and

that  is  I oppose in principle any ban on  strikes

except in a situation of national emergency when,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>



in the interest of the State and of the citizens as

a  whole,  it  is necessary to ban any strike.  But

such  a  situation  of national  emergency  is  not

present  here  today  and I cannot  see  any  other

justification for the Government's proposal to  ban

strikes in these three essential services.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I fully support  the  amendment

Bill  which  mainly seeks to prevent any  employees

from  going on strike in the essential services  or

any  employer from locking out the workers. If  the

workers  of  essential services have any  disputes,

they  must  give 14 days' notice of any  industrial

action to be taken. No lightning strike or lock-out

will be allowed. The essential departments, such as

the  Water Department, the Gas Department  and  the

Electricity  Department of  the  P.U.B.,  are  very

important to the people. So it is necessary to have

these provisions set out in the amendment Bill,  as

these   essential  services  must  be  manned   and

maintained continuously because they are  essential

to   the   lively-hood  of  the  people   and   the

maintenance of the activities of the industrial and

commercial sectors. They are important to  the  two

million people of Singapore. So both the management

and  employees  must not take any  reckless  action

against the interests of the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also in support of the punishment to be

meted  out  to  those  who  have  contravened   the

provisions  of this amendment Bill. It is  only  in

this way that we can ensure the enforcement of this

Bill  which is beneficial to the interests  of  the

nation  as  a  whole. I do not think there  is  any

provision in the Bill that is against the policy of

the  Government,  which  is industrial  peace  with

justice,  and  it does not cast any  doubt  on  the

sincerity  of  the Government as a  fair  and  just

employer and that it is a pro-labour government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a worker wants to go on strike, he should give

14  days' notice. This does not negative his  right

to go on strike. One must be very clear about this.

Therefore, whatever chaos that may arise out  of  a

lightning strike will affect



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>



the  whole nation. It is something like pulling one

hair and your whole body will quiver.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I feel that the introduction of this Bill is

not a measure aimed at suppressing the workers.  Of

course,  those anti-national unions  will,  by  all

means,  try to distort the intention of this  Bill.

This  is not surprising, of course. But in the case

of  the democratic labour movement, in the form  of

the  National Trades Union Congress, we  must  make

them  realise the true intention of the  Government

that is embodied in this Bill. They must understand

that it is introduced to safeguard the interests of

the  nation  without  any prejudice  to  the  basic

rights of the trade union movement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I hope that this Bill will not be abused

and  that the Minister will assure this House  that

the   Government   will   be   very   cautious   in

implementing its provisions.



<br><br>3.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mahmud Awang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mahmud Awang</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, the

object  of  this  Bill  is  certainly  to  give  an

assurance  that if employers want to  have  it  out

with  the workers, the workers will not suffer.  If

it  is  really the intention of the Bill to protect

public  safety, the Government has already provided

a building wherein the N.T.U.C. is housed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly. I regret to say that I am obliged to

mention  my  friends who are in  the  N.T.U.C. and

whose responsibility is to educate the workers,  to

make  them understand the Bill thoroughly,  and  to

advise the Government. If the N.T.U.C. cannot  give

its  co-operation to the management,  who  are  the

employers,   and  the  workers,  a   dispute   will

certainly  arise  between them.  The  role  of  the

N.T.U.C. is  to educate the workers  so  that  the

strike  weapon  is  used only against  unscrupulous

employers,  and  not to use it  to  cause  hardship

among  the  community or to make unfair demands  on

employers or the Government. This is the weapon  in

the  hands of the workers. An example is the police

officer.  He is given a weapon but not to shoot  at

wrong-doers if his own life is not in danger.  This

weapon is for self-defence, and, as the hon. Member

has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>



said, the strike weapon should be similarly used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the Government is pro-labour. We

have  always implemented this policy. When  we  say

"pro-labour", we must ponder awhile and  look  back

to  1959. Since then how many labour disputes  have

been   resolved  by  establishing  two   Industrial

Arbitration    Courts,   in   addition    to    the

discretionary powers exercised by the Minister  for

Labour and also the advice of the N.T.U.C.?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to labour this point, Mr Speaker,

but  what I wish to say is that the leaders of  the

Public Daily-Rated Employees' Union, who are my own

colleagues,  are sincere in their struggle.  But  I

feel  that  the leadership of the N.T.U.C. is  not

positive  enough to say whether this can or  cannot

be  done.  When the N.T.U.C. receive  a  complaint,

they must convene a general meeting or refer it  to

the  Industrial Arbitration Court. If we  allow  an

affiliated union to accuse us, then it follows that

the  other  affiliated  unions  will  take  similar

action.  I  think that is not the proper course  of

action to take. Before an issue is settled, we must

be  certain  that that issue will help the  workers

themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been allegations that the Government

is  anti-Indian and that the N.T.U.C. is also anti-Indian.  These  are very serious  allegations.  The

fact  could be that the N.T.U.C. could not  give  a

proper  picture  to  its  affiliates  of  what  its

struggle  is. If the responsibility of the N.T.U.C.

is  really to guide the workers in order to  uplift

their  living  standard, I am quite sure  that  its

struggle will be a success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that the problem of raising the living

standard  of  the members of the Public Daily-Rated

Employees'    Union   arose    two    years    ago.

Unfortunately, I am not a member of  the  Executive

Committee  of  the  N.T.U.C. The N.T.U.C. has  not

resolved  this problem. It has not used its  powers

effectively  so  that the living  standard  of  the

workers in the Public Daily-Rated Employees'  Union

can  be  improved. The leaders of the N.T.U.C. and

the   affiliated  union  leaders  have  failed   to

discharge their



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>



duties to see that this issue could become a bigger

issue so that whatever increase the Government  has

to  pay  would  be commensurate with the  work  the

workers  perform. If I am allowed to speak on  this

matter,  I can go on speaking for two days and  two

nights, Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, in the trade union movement there are

three  problems  as  explained  by  the  Secretary-General of the N.T.U.C.:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To use the strike weapon in good faith;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To use it as a threat;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To use it to topple the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be able to distinguish between these

three  factors.  If  we choose to  use  the  strike

weapon to raise the living standard of the workers,

we can use it by all means, no matter what happens.

There is nothing to fear because the action we take

is  in  line with our own principles. That is  all,

Mr Speaker.



<br><br>3.57 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  this Bill has been brought  up  for

consideration.  I  am  doubtful   whether   it   is

appropriate  to  bring it up  at  this  time.  This

Government  won the elections in 1959  mainly  with

the  support  of  the workers.  But  it  is  slowly

curtailing their interests. If we want to make this

country prosperous, we will have to look after  the

interests  of the workers. If we go on making  laws

and  ignoring the workers who are the  backbone  of

the country, we cannot bring them to the forefront.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not blaming the Government for making

laws,  but  we  have to take the responsibility  of

implementing  them. We have to bring  in  laws,  or

otherwise  undesirable things will happen.  But  we

have to think of ways of how to bring the laws into

play. This amendment Bill will make slaves and also

prisoners  of  the  workers, as the  Government  is

taking  away their rights. If we go on doing  this,

we will regret it in future.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>



The  workers are citizens and they are also serving

the   country,  and  we  have  to  give  them  some

privileges. If we do not give them privileges,  can

we  imagine  what they will think  of  us?  Why  do

strikes  take place? If the workers are not getting

the privileges they want, there will be strikes. If

they  get them, there is no need of any strike  and

there  is no need for such laws. They will be  more

angry if we bring in laws like this. They will  not

be  happy  at all. There, is a law which says  that

there  should be 14 days' notice of a strike.  What

will  happen  if  they strike after  the  14  days'

notice? What will happen if they go on strike after

serving  such notice? The Government has to prepare

for such an, eventuality. So I think this is not  a

suitable time and I am not supporting this Bill at

this time.



<br><br>4.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like to say a few words in support of the Bill. The

Public Daily-Rated Employees' Federation Union,  to

which  the  gas,  water  and  electricity  workers'

unions  are affiliated, has recently shown  by  its

action that it is a highly irresponsible union. The

leaders  of  the union recently called out  workers

employed in the Cleansing Department in an  illegal

strike in furtherance of certain disputes of  which

the  Industrial Arbitration Court had already taken

cognizance, and in spite of the advice given by the

N.T.U.C. We cannot allow such irresponsible  unions

to  call wild-cat strikes in the vital services  of

the  country.  Water, gas and electricity  services

are  vital  to the day-to-day life of  our  people.

These services must be provided, and continue to be

provided  to the public at all times; I repeat,  at

all   times.  Without  these  services,  the  whole

community  will  suffer and  the  survival  of  our

country will be seriously affected. We cannot allow

such  things to happen at this very vital stage  of

our development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members know that I was in the  Ministry  of

Health  for  about  three and  a  half  years  and,

therefore, am



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>



familiar  with the work of the Daily-Rated  Workers

Union,  especially  the Cleansing  Workers'  Union.

Rather  than  keep  the city  clean,  some  of  the

members  were more engrossed in collecting old  tin

cans  for sale. As a matter of fact, this  is  well

known  to all members of the public, including  the

union leaders. The workers were more interested  in

treble pay by working on Sundays and holidays,  and

for this purpose they absented themselves from work

on normal working days.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Tang See Chim in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br>4.05 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been instances of workers

belonging  to this union who went out to intimidate

those   members  of  the  public  who  had   lodged

complaints  against them for malingering.  Although

the  union  was fully aware of such happenings,  it

did   not  take  any  positive  action  to  rectify

matters.  If  the  union were, on the  other  hand,

responsible,  it would have co-operated  to  ensure

that  the workers did a fair day's work for a  fair

day's wage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Kampong Kembangan has said

that the Government, in introducing an amendment to

the  Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Bill,  has

become anti-union. This cannot be true in the  face

of  the  Government's contributions to the building

up  of  a solid and strong trade union movement  in

this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Member for Anson, I would say that

Government is definitely not unsympathetic  to  the

needs  of  the  workers. But it must be  recognised

that a strike is a weapon which should only be used

as a last resort, when all means of settlement of a

trade  dispute has failed. Strikes do  not  resolve

trade  disputes.  We  have a system  of  industrial

relations in Singapore which ensures a fair deal to

the  workers. Our system of voluntary negotiations,

conciliation and arbitration is provided for in the

laws  of  our  land  to ensure that  no  worker  is

exploited. There should be no reason for workers to

go  on  strike  and this is even  more  so  in  the

essential  and  vital services. The prohibition  of

strikes in the public utility services should not,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>



therefore, adversely affect the rights of  workers.

In  fact,  the  workers in these services  will  be

protected  so  that  they will  not  be  misled  or

exploited by irresponsible elements who control the

destiny  of their unions. It is the duty  of  every

loyal  citizen  to  see that our  survival  is  not

threatened  by irresponsible elements. We  have  to

see  that  not only is our economy kept going,  but

also ensure that it expands. Water, electricity and

gas  are  vital necessities of life, and Government

has  to ensure that these basic necessities are not

denied to the people. The prohibition of strikes in

these  services  is  to  ensure  that  these  vital

services  are available at all times and  that  the

people  are not held to ransom by the irresponsible

acts  of  a few union leaders who abuse freedom  of

action in a democratic society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member for Bras Basah has said that the

Minister  can  refer disputes to arbitration  under

the  present legislation. I would like to ask  him,

does  he not know, as I have mentioned earlier,  of

the  recent case of the wild-cat strike  called  by

one  union  even  though the Minister  had  already

referred the dispute to arbitration?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have included the banking services as an

essential  service  because  banking  is   a   very

important  financial institution in the economy  of

the  country. Of late the Singapore Bank  Employees

Union  has  shown  signs  of  irresponsibility   by

suddenly calling on its members to work to rule, to

refuse overtime work and even to go on strike  over

minor  issues.  These have caused  disruptions  not

only  in the bank services but also jammed  up  the

clearing of cheques, and this gives Singapore a bad

image.  This  union has on more than  one  occasion

taken  industrial  action to pressurise  the  banks

into  giving  in to their demands at  a  time  when

banking is doing its best business, such as  before

certain festivals like the Chinese New Year.  These

actions are highly deplorable because they not only

affect the banks themselves but also members of the

public   and  the  economy  of  the  country.   The

inclusion  of the banking services as an  essential

service  does  not  prevent the union  from  taking

strike action. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>



before  doing so, they have to give 14 days' strike

notice  so  that  the banks could make  alternative

arrangements  to serve the public and  ensure  that

the economic activities of the country do' not come

to a standstill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the broadcasting and television

services, these are vital media of transmission  of

news,   entertainment  and  information  of  public

interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should also be no qualms about the

inclusion of public bus transport and air  services

in  the  list of essential services. In  fact,  the

Singapore Traction Company Employees Union gave  14

days' strike notice although they were not required

to  do so when they threatened to go on strike last

year.   Public  bus  transport  is  very  essential

especially to the thousands of school children  and

office workers who depend on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards air services, Singapore is at the

cross-roads    of   international   air    traffic.

Malaysia/Singapore Airlines is providing ground and

catering  facilities for many airlines  and  it  is

essential that these services are not disrupted  by

sudden strike action by the workers.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wee Toon Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wee Toon Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the few

Members  who  have participated in the debate  have

raised  the  point, firstly, that by amending  this

Bill  we  have  gone  contrary  to  our  pro-labour

policy,  and,  secondly, that this  amendment  Bill

denies  the  workers the right to strike.  Firstly,

Mr Speaker, Sir, if the Government had not devised

a  pro-labour  policy, I am sure there  would  have

been   much   squabbling  between   employers   and

employees  during the period while we  are  in  the

Government.  Secondly, we know that in the  country

the workers constitute a majority of the population

and  that  they  have  played  their  part  in  the

national  interests  and they should  therefore  be

duly  rewarded. In order to do that, the Government

has,  together  with  the  trade  unions  and   the

employers,  discussed and agreed to  formulate  the

Industrial Arbitration Ordinance. Through this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance we hope to maintain industrial peace with

justice.  But, unfortunately, as far as the  Public

Daily-Rated   Employees   Federation    Union    is

concerned, they have not maintained the  spirit  of

maintaining  industrial peace  with  justice.  They

have  always  tried to hold the whole community  to

ransom  in  order to get something  for  their  own

selfish  interest.  We  agree  that  if  they  have

genuine  grievances there is machinery for them  to

seek redress. But, unfortunately, Mr Speaker, Sir,

as  you have heard what the Parliamentary Secretary

to  the  Minister  for Labour has  said,  when  the

Government try to improve certain services so  that

the whole community can benefit from them, they are

frustrated  by  the threat of a  strike.  A  recent

example of the irresponsibility of the Union is the

strike  carried out by the Cleansing Workers Union.

As  the  Member for Anson has said just  now,  even

with  the  amendment  to the  principal  Ordinance,

which  requires the unions to serve 14 days' notice

before  a  strike can take place,  the  matter  has

still  to  be  resolved. That is  exactly  why  the

conciliation  and arbitration machinery  is  there.

Therefore,  if  the  Union is responsible  and  has

genuine grievances, I do not see why it should take

the  trouble to call a strike as a result of  which

not  only the workers have to suffer but the  whole

country  has to suffer. So if it is responsible,  I

would say we do not have to make this amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker. Sir, the trade unions under the

present circumstances should not confine themselves

to their narrow sectional interests.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been mentioned that the Government and our

Party  have  associated with the workers  and  have

become  what  it  is today. But at that  time,  the

situation was different. We were not an independent

country. We were still striving for political power

so  that  we  could  run our own  country  for  the

benefit  of  our people. In the new situation  now,

the  workers have their role to play and they  must

above  all  see that they contribute to  the  whole

community.  Of  course, the Government  can  simply

meet the demands of the unions. But we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>



the  trustees of the public and, therefore, we have

to  look after the interests of the whole community

and  not a section of it. If we are to appease  the

unions,  we  can,  of  course, simply  resolve  the

matter by conceding to their demands. But there  is

a  limit  to  this. We are a Republic and  have  no

natural resources. All of us know that we depend on

our  human  resources  to  survive.  Therefore,  if

industries do not expand and the economic situation

does not improve, not only will the workers not get

any  improvement in their terms and  conditions  of

service, but they themselves will probably have  no

work,  or their dependants and friends will not  be

able  to find jobs too. Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe

we are not dictatorial in our labour policy, but  I

have  just  mentioned that in order to  refute  the

allegation  that ours is an anti-labour policy  and

that  we  are  denying the workers their  right  to

strike.  I  believe no one will swallow  the  false

allegations made by my few colleagues just now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 2 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

clause 2 is about essential services such as water,

gas  and  electricity services. But sub-clause  (2)

makes  no  mention of the other essential services.

In   Government's  view,  how  many  categories  of

essential services are there? Perhaps, first, there

are  the  three  which are mentioned in  sub-clause

(1), i.e., water, gas and electricity services;  in

sub-clause (2) are the second category of essential

services.  Is  there a third category of  essential

services?  Earlier, the Parliamentary Secretary  to

the Minister for Labour has stated that, because of

the wild-cat strike carried out by the Public Daily-Rated Cleansing Workers' Union, the Government  has

brought  in  amendments to the Bill  that  we  have

before  us  today. Why is it that  workers  in  the

Public Utilities Board are victimised on account of

the  strike  carried out by the Public  Daily-Rated

Cleansing Workers' Union? I am of the opinion  that

the  amendment to this clause 2 is contrary to  the

general interests of labour.

<br><br>4.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, for many years, the sole

currency  issuing authority in the territories  now

comprising Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore  was  the

Board  of  Commissioners of  Currency,  Malaya  and

British Borneo. This has resulted from an Agreement

made  between the Governments of these territories,

which Agreement also provides that the Board should

cease  to be the currency issuing authority  should

anyone of the Participating Governments give notice

to that effect. In December 1964, the Government of

the Federation of Malaysia lodged such a notice and

as  a result the Board will cease to issue currency

in  June  this  year.  After separation,  Singapore

embarked   on   negotiations  with  the   Malaysian

Government  regarding the use of a common  currency

in  these  two territories. The House  will  recall

that  at  a  sitting  on the 26th  August,  I  gave

details  of  the  negotiations and outlined  events

leading  to  the announcement made on  17th  August

that an agreement for a common currency and banking

system  could not be reached between the  Singapore

and  Malaysian  Governments. There  has  been  much

debate and discussion on this subject



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>



since  then, and I do not propose to dwell on  this

any  further.  Suffice  it to  say  that  with  the

breakdown in negotiations, it now becomes necessary

for  us to take legal steps to enable Singapore  to

issue  her  own  currency on 12th June,  1967.  The

objective of this Bill is, therefore, to set  up  a

currency issuing authority for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 26th August, 1966, I told the House that

Singapore  would  continue with  a  Currency  Board

system.  I  further  said that  the  new  Singapore

dollar will "at all times be backed 100 per cent by

gold  or  foreign exchange assets and  will  remain

fully  convertible". The provisions of the Currency

Bill   now  before  the  House  fulfil  both  these

requirements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to take the provisions of the

Bill clause by clause and to draw the attention  of

Members  of the House to the more salient  features

of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 provides for the establishment of a

Currency   Board  to  be  called  "the   Board   of

Commissioners of Currency, Singapore". The  purpose

of  the Board is to issue currency notes and coins.

In  clause  4, the Board is made a body  corporate,

with  its head office in Singapore, and with  power

to  appoint  agents  and correspondents.  Clause  5

enables  the  Board  to  employ  officers  for  its

business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The composition of the Board is given in clause

6,  which  provides  for a  Board  of  six  members

comprising the Chairman, who shall be the  Minister

responsible  for Finance, and five  other  members,

including a Deputy Chairman, to be appointed by the

President. The Deputy Chairman will be a  full-time

official   and  will  become  the  chief  executive

officer  of the Board. The other four members  will

include representatives of local and foreign  banks

in  Singapore, so that what we do in the Board will

be known not only in Singapore but abroad as well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is obliged by law to meet at least once

a  year, and on receipt of a request from at  least

two  members of the Board, the Chairman is  obliged

to call a meeting as soon as practicable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>



The  quorum for a meeting is three members. It will

be  noted that the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman

have  two votes each, whilst the other four members

each  has  one vote. In an equality of  votes,  the

Chairman  would have the casting vote. It  will  no

doubt  be  argued that this system of votes  places

the  balance  of par in the hands of  the  official

members.  It  is  our  belief,  however,  that  the

structure of the Board allowing for appointment  of

four  members from the private sector will  provide

for the maximum expression and balance of interests

before decisions could be taken. However, when  and

where  there is a genuine difference of opinion  or

of  judgment  among members of  the  Board,  it  is

necessary   for  the  Government,  in   the   wider

interests  of the nation, to be able  to  make  the

ultimate  decision with the use of  the  Chairman's

casting  vote.  Thus,  it  is  provided  that   the

Government  members, i.e., the Chairman and  Deputy

Chairman,  will together have four  votes  and  the

other  four  members will together  have  the  same

number  of votes with the Chairman having a casting

vote in case of an equality of votes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clause 8 are listed the conditions under which

members    of    the   Board   are    automatically

disqualified. In clause 9 are outlined  obligations

of  Board  members in deliberations  of  the  Board

where the member has an interest. Clause 10 ensures

that members and employees of the Board do not make

use  of  information they acquire in the course  of

their  functions for their own private use  or  for

purposes  other than for the performance  of  their

duties under this Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 establishes the unit of currency for

Singapore which will be called the Singapore dollar

and which will be divided into 100 cents. In clause

12  is stated the par value of the Singapore dollar

which  will be 0.290299 grammes of fine gold.  This

is  equivalent to 2s. 4d, in sterling. It  will  be

seen,   therefore,  that  the  par  value  of   the

Singapore dollar will be the same as the par  value

of our present dollar. In clause 13, it is provided

that   on  and  after  12th  June,  unless  validly

provided   for,   all   monetary   obligations   or

transactions in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  shall  be  deemed to  be  expressed  and

recorded and settled in the Singapore dollar.  This

is  to  avoid confusion. Clause 14 gives the  Board

the sole right to issue currency notes and coins in

Singapore.  The legal tender status of these  notes

and  coins is any amount for notes; and for  coins,

up  to  an amount not exceeding $10 in the case  of

coins  of denominations of 50 cents and above;  and

up  to  an amount not exceeding $2 in the  case  of

coins of a lower denomination. These provisions arc

similar  to  those  in the present  Currency  Board

system. Sub-clauses (3) and (4) of this clause  are

transitional provisions, providing that  the  notes

and  coins  of  the  present Currency  Board  shall

continue  to  be legal tender in Singapore  in  the

amounts as mentioned above until demonetised.  Such

demonetisation  will require the  approval  of  the

President and has to be published in the Gazette.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 of the Bill ensures that the new

Singapore  currency notes and coins are  fully  and

automatically  convertible into sterling.  This  is

identical  with the provisions to be found  in  the

present  Currency Board system. Clause 17  provides

that  the  Board may at its discretion  redeem  and

issue  currency  notes and coins against  gold  and

other  foreign currencies. In clause 18  are  spelt

out the details of how procedures of redemption and

issues  of  currency  notes and  coins  are  to  be

effected by the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clauses 23, 24 and 25 are detailed the backing

and  types of assets that will be held by the Board

as a backing for the currency it has issued. Clause

23  sets up a Fund to be called the Currency  Fund.

The  assets  of the Fund form the backing  for  the

currency  issued  by the Board. The  provisions  of

clause 25 (3) ensure that the value of the Fund  is

equivalent to the face value of the currency issued

by the Board, i.e., there is 100 per cent cover for

every  Singapore  dollar  issued.  Further,  it  is

provided  that  the  Fund  shall  consist  of   all

external  assets, the items of which are listed  in

clause 24. It will be seen that, apart



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>



from  sterling, the Board is also empowered to hold

other  foreign  assets and therefore  have  a  more

diversified portfolio of investments.  This  is  an

improvement  compared  with  the  present  position

where only sterling assets are held. It should also

be  noted  that there are no provisions  whatsoever

for  a  fiduciary issue. Put simply,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  a fiduciary issue means the issue of currency

with Singapore Government securities as backing and

represents Government's borrowing from the Currency

Fund.  This,  I may remind the House,  is  an  even

stricter  provision  than has  been  found  in  our

present  currency system which allows  the  present

Board to have a fiduciary issue of $300 million. In

addition,  the  provisions of  clause  25  (3)  and

clause  26 guarantee the 100 per cent cover as  any

deficiency  in the assets of the Currency  Fund  is

automatically  charged  to the  Consolidated  Fund.

Thus  it will be seen that the Singapore dollar  is

at all times backed 100 per cent by foreign assets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clauses 28 to 31 are miscellaneous provisions.

Clause  28 provides for the financial year  of  the

Board,  which will be the calendar year. Clause  29

provides  that the accounts of the Board  shall  be

audited  by  the  Director  of  Audit.  Clause   30

requires  the  annual accounts and  report  of  the

Board  to  be  transmitted  to  the  President  and

thereafter published in the Gazette and laid before

Parliament. The Board is also required to make  Out

quarterly  returns of its currency notes and  coins

in  circulation for publication in the Gazette  and

to   publish  half-yearly  statements  showing  the

liquid  portion of its Fund and the assets  of  the

Fund. Thus every member of the public will be in  a

position  to know and verify for himself the  value

and worth of the Singapore dollar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clauses 32 to 35 are transitional and repeal

provisions.  Clause 32 gives legal status  to  acts

performed by the Government on behalf of the  Board

prior  to  its establishment. In clause 34,  it  is

provided  that the notes and coins of  the  present

Currency  Board shall be exchanged at par  for  the

new Board's notes and coins.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, Mr Speaker, Sir, to add in

conclusion that the Bill now before the  House  has

been  drafted in consultation with the  Association

of   Banks   in   Singapore  and   Malaysia.   This

Association  was  formed  when  Singapore  was   in

Malaysia,  and still represents banks in Singapore.

Many  of  the Association's suggestions  have  been

accepted  and  incorporated in  the  Bill.  It  now

remains   for   me   to  record  the   Government's

appreciation of the careful and detailed manner  in

which the Association has contributed in finalising

the Bill, which continues with a system, albeit old-fashioned  to some, but which has given us  one  of

the  strongest and most stable currencies  you  can

find  anywhere. Mr Speaker, Sir, we are loath  now

to  relinquish a method of currency issue which has

stood us in good stead for so long. But if and when

we   find   it  imperative  to  make  changes   and

amendments  to  the law in order to cope  with  the

growing  complexities  and  sophistication  of  the

monetary  system, we will not hesitate  to  do  so.

However,  for  the  immediate  future  we   believe

confidence in the value of the Singapore dollar can

and  will  be  retained by a  continuation  of  the

Currency Board system with 100 per cent backing and

without any fiduciary issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the President's recommendation to proceed

with the reading of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the difficulties confronting me as

Minister   of   Defence  is  the  novelty   of   my

responsibility.  There are no  precedents  to  fall

back  upon. When one thinks of what elements should

be  taken  into  account in  framing  a  meaningful

defence policy for Singapore, one has to begin from

first principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A useful starting point is to ask oneself, why

bother  about defending Singapore at all? I am  not

being  facetious in asking this question, for there

are people, laymen as well as experts, who say that

we  should  not. They tell you that the  island  is

quite  indefensible, and if there  is  a  sustained

major  attack upon it, it is unlikely that, without

major  assistance from outside, Singapore can  hold

out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, excellent reasons why we

should  bother  about defence. I believe  that  the

people who hold the contrary view are mistaken. For

the  logical  conclusion drawn from  their  premise

must be that Singapore should revert to a colony or

a   satellite  of  whoever  wishes  to  afford   it

protection.  If you are in a completely  vulnerable

position, anyone disposed to do so can hold you  to

ransom  and  life  for you will  then  become  very

tiresome.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider it to be wrong to believe that there

is  nothing we can do or should do about  defending

ourselves,  even though we cannot achieve  complete

invulnerability by our unaided efforts. In a sense,

even the larger countries of the world today, other

than  the  nuclear super powers, are  indefensible.

For  instance, none of the European States can hope

to  survive  a  nuclear attack by the Soviet  Union

either  singly or in combination. Yet this has  not

prevented them from spending enormous sums of money

in defence. The two nuclear super powers have found

themselves paralysed in a balance of terror and yet

both  continue  to  devote  enormous  resources  to

defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One cannot but regret all this - that the keenest

scientific  minds today are devoted to  discovering

and  developing  more  effective  methods  of  mass

destruction rather than trying to bring about  more

human  happiness and progress -- but  that  is  the

world  as  we  find it today, and for small  States

like ours, we have to accept the position as it is,

not as we would like it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not the smallest of the independent

States,  nor  is  it  the  poorest.  One   of   the

unexpected developments of the post-war  world  has

been  the  proliferation of small States consequent

on the process if decolonisation. Especially in the

last  ten years, large numbers of new States, often

with  artificial boundaries, small populations  and

dubious  economies,  have come into  existence.  If

their  present position is uncertain, their  future

prospects are even more doubtful.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small States are likely to be a great source of

trouble  in  this world if they cannot  look  after

themselves.  If  the management of  their  domestic

affairs  is  so  bad  as to invite  civil  war  and

disorder,  there  is always the  risk  that  larger

States  may  be  tempted to intervene.  Where  this

happens  to  a small State situated in a  strategic

area,  as,  for instance, South Vietnam, the  great

super  powers may get mixed up and the risk  arises

of  escalation to something more dangerous  than  a

local  conflict. Therefore, unstable, badly managed

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>



poorly  defended small States pose a threat to  the

security and peace of the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the same token, if small States can manage

their  affairs efficiently and can raise sufficient

defence   forces   to  deter  others   from   risky

adventures  by making them costly, then they  would

add  to  the  stability and security of  the  whole

region.  The survival of small States within  their

original  territorial  boundaries  has  today  much

greater  prospects of success than one  would  have

thought  from a cursory view of the situation.  For

the  two  nuclear  super powers apparently  are  in

favour  of  freezing  existing  boundaries  as  one

method  of  reducing  the  danger  of  nuclear  war

between themselves by eliminating any temptation to

be  involved  in  quarrels  between  other  nation-states.   Where  a  small  State  is  strategically

situated, as Singapore is, it is important that  it

should  maintain adequate defence forces.  It  goes

without saying that the real security which we want

can be found, not by our unaided efforts alone, but

in  an  alliance  with others. In  the  long  term,

Singapore should work towards the establishment  of

some kind of regional defence arrangement, possibly

within  a larger international framework.  In  this

kind of regional defence alliance, we are likely to

be a more valuable partner and hence can exert more

influence, if we can make a defence contribution of

some  significance, rather than if we  were  to  be

utterly dependent on the arms of other States.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect to our defence effort.

This  is  a  contribution it can  make  to  nation-building.  Nothing  creates  loyalty  and  national

consciousness  more  speedily and  more  thoroughly

than participation in defence and membership of the

armed forces. This has been the experience of other

countries; there is no reason why it will not  hold

true  in  Singapore. The nation-building aspect  of

defence   will   be   more   significant   if   its

participation is spread over all strata of society.

This  is  possible only with some kind of  national

service.  If we were to depend only on  a  standing

army  of  professionals, then we would get so  many

soldiers and no more. The civilians remain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>



spectators outside the orbit of  the  defence

forces except for the small number who take part as

part-time soldiers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One important side to the nation-building process

is  that  there are not many members of our  monied

and   intellectual  elite  who  have  grasped   the

elementary point that their status and position and

wealth can be justified and maintained only if they

undertake  a responsibility in the defence  of  the

nation consistent with their position. In a society

like  Britain where class distinctions  are  strong

and  traditional, you will find  that  up  to  very

recently  it has been the ruling class, the  landed

aristocracy,  who  have supplied the  military  and

naval commanders, with whose exploits every school-boy  in  our English language schools is  doubtless

familiar.  The  British  ruling  class  has   never

abdicated its right to govern through unwillingness

to bear arms on behalf of the nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ours, of course, is a different kind of society

with     many    regrettable    weaknesses.     Our

intelligentsia and wealthy citizens would  do  well

to  read  that  part of Plato's "Republic"  dealing

with  the inevitable decline of oligarchies of rich

men  whose sons are spoilt by easy living and whose

flabbiness  becomes obvious to  the  citizens  whom

they govern, so that they, the citizens, eventually

decide  to  take over power from them  and  deprive

them  both of their wealth and their positions.  It

is  not  a  coincidence that sons  of  the  British

elite, as part of their classical education in  the

public schools, are taught not only Plato but also,

among  other  works,  "The  Peloponnesian  War"  of

Thucydides. Only in this way do you create a  breed

that can govern an empire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our own historical past, ours is a

society  which  is  deficient  in  many  qualities,

excelling  only in the ability to get  on  in  life

whatever  the regime - Japanese, British or  P.A.P.

Some  of  the valuable and indispensable  qualities

such  as  social discipline and moral  values  have

unfortunately  not been instilled in our  education

system  to  the extent that one would have  wished.

The  result is a generation of young people who are

largely amoral.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>



They  are  easy  victims of  all  kinds  of  ideas,

passions   and  fads  -  be  they  the   subversive

doctrines  of  the  Communist  underground  or  the

seductions  of Beatle music and Beatnik philosophy.

Such  aberrations in human conduct may be  accepted

with equanimity in large and wealthy societies. But

when we are trying to survive in a tight situation,

there  is  very  little place for harmful  or  even

meaningless   activities.  At   best,   these   are

irrelevant eccentricities; at worst, they lead  the

young  into a world of fantasy and make them  unfit

for the strenuous exertions that may lie ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against the background of such

considerations that our National Service scheme has

been  worked out. A minority of the young men  will

be  selected for a two-year full-time stint in  the

Army.  Those selected for promotion to the  officer

grade  will  do three years. At the  end  of  their

military service, they will be emplaced in civilian

occupations   appropriate  to  their  ability   and

qualifications. Sufficient numbers of such posts in

Government service, the Statutory Boards and  large

private  firms  will  be  reserved  for  discharged

National  Servicemen. Legislation on this  will  be

presented  to  Parliament  shortly.  We  intend  to

select the pick of our youth, within each education

grade,  for  the Army and there is  no  doubt  that

prospective employers will be very eager to  obtain

their  services as they represent the best  of  our

youth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those not selected for the Army will be allocated

to  the People's Defence Force, the Vigilante Corps

and  the  Special Constabulary. They will do  part-time  training during their off-work  or  off-study

hours. This means that those who are now engaged in

higher   studies  either  in  the   Higher   School

Certificate classes or in the Universities will not

have their studies upset. At the same time, it does

not  mean  that by being posted now to the  P.D.F.,

the Vigilante Corps or the Special Constabulary  to

do  part-time  training and  work,  they  will  not

subsequently  be  called up for full-time  military

service  on completion of their studies.  There  is

need  for  quality in the Army,  as  in  any  other

organisation,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>



and  the highly educated must do their  duty

along with the others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the four Branches of National Service -

the full-time Army, the People's Defence Force, the

Vigilante   Corps  and  the  Special   Constabulary

-National  Servicemen will receive, in addition  to

technical   training  specific  to  their   Branch,

instruction in moral values. This will  teach  them

what good citizenship means and explain to them the

nature of their social responsibilities. It  is  my

intention,  when  the  training  manuals  on   this

subject have been drafted, to seek guidance of  the

Inter-Religious  Council of the Republic,  both  on

the  content of moral instruction and on the method

of  implementation.  I  am sure  that  there  is  a

substantial common ground among the great religions

of  the  world,  whose values, if imparted  to  our

youth, will make them better men.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now a word about the mechanics of this exercise.

The names, addresses, ages and other particulars of

young men liable to national registration are known

to  the Government and, in fact, have been fed into

the electronic computer in the Ministry of Finance.

On the 17th of this month, i.e, in four days' time,

pink  cards  which  we call Registration  Reminders

will  be  sent  by  post to  young  men  liable  to

registration. These cards will be sent to the  last

known  address,  but  some of these  cards  may  go

astray in the rural areas there is no proper system

in  the  numbering of houses, many  of  which  were

illegally constructed; and in the slums anything up

to  twenty  families may share a house and  letters

often go astray. Therefore, if a young man does not

get  his  pink  reminder card in a week's  time  he

should  inquire at the nearest community centre.  I

may  say,  in passing, that not getting a  reminder

card is not a valid excuse for not registering. And

all  persons  who  do not register  when  they  are

liable to do so will, of course, be prosecuted.  In

the  present exercise we are registering only those

male  youths  horn between 1st January,  1949,  and

30th  June, 1949. There are approximately 9,000  of

them.  Those  born after 30th June, 1949,  will  be

registered in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>



a  later exercise this year. Sixteen days from 28th

March  to  18th  April - have  been  set  aside  for

registration and four registration centres will  be

in  operation. The Central Manpower Base in Kallang

will be open each day during this period from 9 a.m.

to  9  p.m. The Katong, Serangoon and Bukit Panjang

District Offices will be open each day from 2  p.m.

to 9 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of May, medical examinations will

take place and the final selection of who is to  go

into  what Branch of National Service will be  made

in  July. Enlistment notices informing young men in

which  Branch of National Service they  will  serve

will  be  despatched as from the 11th of July.  And

National Service itself is scheduled to commence as

from the 26th July this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many complications in this exercise, as

there  are bound to be. I do not wish, to  go  into

all  of  them. The Manpower Division of my Ministry

has  prepared a pamphlet which explains what  those

who are liable to National Service have to do. Five

hundred  members  of  the  staff  of  the  People's

Association who work in the community centres  have

been  briefed by the Ministry so as to enable  them

better to give guidance and answer questions  about

National  Service. The booklet on National  Service

will  be available at all community centres in  the

next  few  days.  These  pamphlets  will  also   be

distributed to schools. Any Association which wants

copies  of  these  pamphlets should  apply  to  the

Ministry  of  the  Interior and  Defence,  Manpower

Division,  stating  in what language  or  languages

they  wish  to  have them. At present,  copies  are

available in English and Chinese. Copies  in  Malay

and Tamil will be available shortly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with the passage of this

legislation  and its implementation,  the  Republic

moves  into  a  new era. Often in the past,  people

have listened to Ministers of the Government urging

upon  them  the paramount need to build  a  rugged,

closely-knit society. Some might have wondered what

this  meant and might have dismissed it as so  much

talk. Now they know that it is not merely



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>



talk.  Behind the exhortation lies a  concept  -  a

vision  if you like - of the new society that  must

emerge in this island if we want to retain all  the

good that we have built in the past and move on  to

greater achievements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, I rise in full support of this  Bill.

The  introduction  of  this  Bill  is  well  timed,

particularly at this juncture when there  are  four

significant points.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, this is a measure by which an

independent country shoulders the responsibility to

see  that all its people will perform their  duties

as citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, this Bill will strengthen the defence

structure of our Republic. It will also ensure that

all our citizens in future will be able to shoulder

the  responsibility of national defence and prepare

themselves for this task ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, this Bill will educate and train our

citizens   and  future  generations   in   military

consciousness   and   preparedness   and    defence

responsibility,  so that they will develop  healthy

and strong bodies and have a sense of discipline.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, this is a measure to ensure that a

multi-racial society will march into a new era of a

closely   knit  society  with  a  new  and   rugged

generation who can defend this country. I feel that

one  should be filled with pride to become a member

of  our Armed Forces. There is nobody against  this

with the exception of the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill provides various forms

of  military  training on a full-time or  part-time

basis. Most of the training will be done on a part-time  basis. Only about 10 per cent of the  persons

who  are  liable  to  be  called  up  will  undergo

military  training  on a full-time  basis  for  two

years. This is very appropriate and suitable to the

realities  of  this  country. As  we  are  a  small

Republic,  it  is  the main responsibility  of  the

Government  to  look  after  the  affairs  of   the

citizens. We have to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>



undertake the economic construction of our country,

which  has  limited resources, in order  to  ensure

that  our people can live happily. In view of  this

prerequisite,  we  have  to  look  after  our   own

survival. We have to make friends with all  nations

and,  therefore, we adopt a neutral foreign policy.

We  are unable to set aside large sums of money for

the  purpose  of  maintaining a  very  large  armed

force.  As  a  matter of fact,  this  would  be  an

unrealistic and inappropriate measure to adopt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since this National Service

(Amendment) Bill was introduced at the last sitting

and  publicised  in  the Press,  we  have  received

popular  support from various quarters and  leaders

of  the people. They are all of the view that it is

a  very realistic and far-sighted measure to adopt.

Only  the  Barisan  Sosialis are  expressing  their

opposition to this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, an organisation like the

Barisan Sosialis, which is anti-national, cannot be

expected  to  do anything useful and beneficial  to

the  country. If we expect this to happen, then  it

would  be  something  like  "fishing  on  a  tree".

Therefore, the people of Singapore should not  have

any  regard  for the Barisan Sosialis. But  if  the

Barisan  Sosialis  can  drastically  change   their

present outlook and show that they are loyal to our

country, then, of course, we shall treat them quite

differently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we believe that the broad

masses  of  the people fully support  the  National

Service  (Amendment) Bill. They will take practical

steps to respond to the call of the Government, and

will  accept either full-time or part-time military

training. In order that the implementation of  this

Bill  will  receive its proper effect, I hope  that

all  those  organisations which are  loyal  to  the

nation  -  be  they  civic organisations,  Citizens

Consultative  Committees or any other organisations

in Singapore --- will put aside some time to assist

the  Government by explaining the position  to  the

people  at large. Some publicity must be  given  by

all  these civic organisations, and steps must also

be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>



taken  to ensure that the Barisan Sosialis  do  not

distort the significance and intentions of the Bill

so that its success will be ensured.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there are clauses in the Bill

which  provide  punishment  for  contravention   of

certain provisions, that is to say, those who  fail

to  register themselves for national service  shall

be liable to terms of imprisonment or fine or both.

This  punishment is deterrent in nature and I  hope

that the Ministry concerned will properly carry out

the publicity through the Press, Radio, Rediffusion

and  Television, so that nobody will contravene any

of the regulations out of ignorance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support this amendment Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teo Hup Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teo Hup Teck (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, I feel that as a Member of Parliament

I  have  a  duty  to  support the National  Service

(Amendment) Bill and air my views on it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this Bill not only concerns the

interest  of the people of Jalan Kayu but also  the

interest of all the people in the Republic.  It  is

also  a  matter of life and death and involves  the

security  of  the nation. As a Member  representing

the people of Jalan Kayu, it is with great pleasure

and pride that I speak on this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will recall that in 1952,

when the National Service Ordinance was introduced,

it  did  not  receive the popular  support  of  the

people  in my constituency or the people at  large.

On  the  contrary, it was met with a certain degree

of  opposition  from the people of my constituency.

The  reasons were very obvious. At that  time,  the

people of Singapore were living in a colonial  era.

They  were under colonial rule and were not  imbued

with  national consciousness. For this reason,  the

people of my constituency and our country at  large

were  under no obligation nor were they duty  bound

at  that  time to support national service  in  the

interest of a foreign or colonial power. It  was  a

very understandable argument



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>



at  that  time. Although this happened in Singapore

only  ten  years ago, it cannot be denied that  the

people  were  right  then  in  advancing  such   an

argument.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will have noticed that the

political   situation  in  Singapore  has   changed

completely  during  the last  ten  years.  We  have

thrown  off the shackles of colonial rule and  have

obtained  independence. It is, therefore, necessary

that  our own people should defend our sovereignty.

So the significance of national service has changed

completely now because it is not in furtherance  of

the  interest of any foreign or colonial power.  On

the  contrary, national service is intended for the

defence and protection of the people of a sovereign

State.  So  this  change in  outlook  and  attitude

towards  national service is necessary. Our  people

must  take  pride  in joining the People's  Defence

Force,  the  Special  Constabulary,  the  Vigilante

Corps and other services. These organisations  have

been  set  up  in order to make sure  that  we  can

depend   on   our  own  strength  to   defend   our

independent country and the property and freedom of

our people so that our sovereignty and independence

will  not be jeopardised by any aggressive  foreign

power  or anti-national elements. So the good young

people  of  our country must take pride in  joining

the national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Service (Amendment) Bill is very

significant  in this respect. National  service  in

the  world  -  be  it in France or any  independent

country which is neutral or otherwise- is a  matter

of  necessity.  For instance, in America,  England,

Russia, China and other countries, national service

is implemented without any question, and even small

countries like the Philippines, Thailand, Laos  and

neutral   Switzerland  have  made   provision   for

national   service.  Generally  speaking,  national

service  is  a matter which concerns a citizen  who

has  a duty to his own country. As a member of  the

Armed Forces of an independent country, I say  that

it  is  the  duty  of all citizens to  protect  and

defend the country and the lives of the people.  It

is  very much a matter of pride for everybody to do

this. It is a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>



matter of glory, I would say. Today Singapore is  a

fully  independent, sovereign and  integral  State.

Our  people,  I am sure, will take great  pride  in

joining the various units for national service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, we relied mainly on the Commonwealth

and other friendly nations for our national defence

and  safety.  But  after independence  and  in  the

context of the present international situation,  we

must  take note of the particular fact that England

is  now taking steps to cut down its troops in  the

Far  East, including the withdrawal of its base  in

Singapore. This reduction will be planned stage  by

stage, and the time will come when there will be  a

complete   withdrawal   of  British   troops   from

Singapore.  So  we  must not  depend  too  much  on

Britain  for our defence. We cannot deny that,  for

our  own  security, we must take certain  steps  in

this  direction.  Of course, if necessary,  we  can

also come to some kind of arrangement with friendly

nations in the matter of defence. But between us, I

say that the main task of looking after the defence

and  security  of our country is a matter  for  the

people  of Singapore themselves to decide, so  that

we  can  protect our nation from invasion or  being

jeopardised   by  anti-national  activists.   Every

responsible  and  loyal citizen of  Singapore  must

protect  his own country and the lives and property

of the people from subversion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the old society there was a saying which

goes like this: "Good iron is never used for making

nails,  and good men are never made into soldiers."

This  is quite a popular Chinese saying, but it  is

an old concept. Perhaps in the old days this saying

had  some significance. But in the present context,

its  significance has been completely lost. If good

young  men  are not turned into soldiers,  then  it

follows that the nation will have to depend on good-for-nothing people for its defence. So how can  the

national security be safeguarded? If good  men  are

not turned into soldiers, then who will be there to

defend and protect the independence of our country,

the lives and property of our people?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, today to be in the army and fight

does  not  mean that we fight only with spears  and

swords.  It also entails the exercise of the  mind.

Some  brain  work  is  involved.  So  the  task  of

defending the nation cannot very well be placed  on

the  good-for-nothing people, but it must be placed

on  the  useful citizens of our country,  who  have

been  disciplined and well-trained. These  will  be

the  people who will defend our country. I  believe

that  the  old concept that good men do not  become

soldiers must be discarded in toto. At a time  when

our  nation  is  in need of people  to  defend  its

independence  and security, we must  all  come  out

bravely    and    accept   this    challenge    and

responsibility.  This is the time  when  good  iron

must  be made into nails, and good men turned  into

soldiers. This is the new concept that must prevail

in  the  present situation. To join the army  is  a

matter of glory for everybody. The old concept must

be  completely discarded and replaced  by  the  new

concept. This is the pre-requisite and spirit which

we   must   establish  to  ensure  the   successful

formation of our defence force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is an oasis in South-east Asia, and

there  is no place other than Singapore capable  of

giving  such  a  high standard  of  living  to  its

people.  Therefore, it is our good  fortune  to  be

able  to live in a country like Singapore.  As  the

Prime  Minister has already said, our young  people

must  always  bear  in  mind  that  if  we  do  not

understand the necessity of defending our  country,

then whatever we do will be in vain and in the  end

we  shall lose everything, and others will come and

step  into  our  shoes.  This  is  what  the  Prime

Minister  has said, and it reminds us of the  great

responsibility  of  the youths of  Singapore.  They

must  understand  and appreciate the  realities  of

life.  So at a time when our country is calling  us

to  take  up  national service, we  must  come  out

bravely  and take up the glorious task of defending

and  protecting our country. We must do  our  level

best to shoulder our responsibility as citizens. To

those who join the Army, Navy and Air Force, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>



Police  Force, the Vigilante Corps, and the Special

Constabulary, great glory goes to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, national service is needed not

only  to  defend  our  country  and  deter  foreign

intervention and suppress internal subversion,  but

it   also  has  a  more  significant  and  positive

meaning.  As  we  all know, our foreign  policy  is

basically  a non-aligned one. What we want  is  the

maximum number of friends and the minimum number of

enemies. Therefore, we have no intention whatsoever

to  invade other countries. But, on the other hand,

we  will  not allow any other country to  undermine

our   sovereignty  or  our  territorial  integrity.

Therefore,  the setting up of the Armed  Forces  is

with  a  view  to  defending our  country.  We  are

definite about this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a young country and we must establish well-trained armed forces. This will take perhaps 10 or

20  years  to  accomplish. This is what  our  Prime

Minister has said - that it will take about 5 to  7

years,  or even 10 years, to complete this training

programme. By that time we will be able to rely  on

ourselves to defend our country. At the same  time,

we  will  have  laid down a firm foundation  for  a

multi-racial society, because during the course  of

training the youths of various races will have  the

opportunity   to  live  together,  understand   one

another, and get to know their habits of living and

their  respective strong and weak points.  In  this

way,  a  strong body corporate will be established.

This  is  one  of  the main tasks  of  our  nation-building  and  also  one of  the  most  significant

features in the National Service (Amendment)  Bill.

In  the task of nation-building we will be able  to

train  and  bring  up  a  generation  infused  with

national consciousness and patriotism. These  young

people will be able to understand one another,  and

so  the  national solidarity of our nation will  be

strengthened.  After our younger generation,  under

the  correct guidance of the Government,  has  been

organised  to  meet the exigencies  of  a  national

emergency, they will certainly answer the  call  of

the nation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>



to  defend our country with pride and glory and  to

ensure our national survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt about the

need for this National Service (Amendment) Bill.  I

believe it will receive the enthusiastic support of

our  people.  In the past few years the  people  in

Jalan Kayu and other constituencies have taken part

in  all  activities, such as organising  themselves

into the Vigilante Corps, and have expressed a high

degree   of  patriotism  particularly  during   the

confrontation.  I  believe  this  Bill  will   also

receive the support of our young people. Therefore,

I  fully  support it. Its successful implementation

will certainly ensure the survival of our country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for Sembawang has

said  that when we implement this Bill, the Barisan

Members would oppose it and would try their best to

frustrate  its implementation. This  is  true.  But

what  we have done is correct. If we believe  this,

we  can  disregard their opposition. The people  of

our  country  are well aware of who  their  enemies

are.  In  the  recent by-election in  Thomson,  the

Barisan  Sosialis incited the people to cast  blank

votes. But the results showed that the people  were

not  misled  by  them. There were  only  about  300

misguided  people who were deceived by them.  There

were  about 11,000 voters, and about 9,000 of  them

cast  their  votes for the P.A.P. This  shows  that

what  the Barisan Sosialis did in the past was  not

approved  by  the people. Therefore, this  National

Service   (Amendment)  Bill  will  be  successfully

implemented, no matter how the Barisan Sosialis try

their best to sabotage it. I will try to fulfil  my

obligation  to mobilise all the people within  this

age group to answer the call of the nation.



<br><br>6.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

will confine my remarks to some general aspects and

leave   the  details  of  the  Bill  to  my   other

colleagues. In order to appreciate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>



the  essence  of  the National Service  (Amendment)

Bill,  I  think we ought to make a brief survey  of

this  part  of the world because what  goes  on  in

South-east Asia is more than academic to Singapore,

being the centre of this region. If you look around

us,  Mr Speaker, Sir, particularly on the military

aspect, you will find that Singapore is indeed in a

very peculiar situation.



<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Lim Cheng Lock in the Chair]</b></div>







<br><br>6.32 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Singapore Infantry Regiment, which was raised

in  1957,  is almost ten years old and saw  action.

Sir,  we  are  only  beginning to  crawl.  But  the

Indonesian  Army is more than two decades  old  and

has acquired a fair amount of combat experience. We

do  not know much about the Indonesian Navy and the

Air  Force  because  they  are  unknown  qualities.

Perhaps the only experience we think the Indonesian

Navy  can claim is piracy during the confrontation.

There  was  an  occasion when a  disgruntled  pilot

directed  his plane and his guns at the President's

palace; and then, of course, the recent coup.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you go further north towards Communist China,

the  Chinese  Liberation Army  was  developed  from

large  groups of organised guerrillas into a  well-established  fighting  force  of  more   than   2.5

million. And if you were to mobilise each and every

one  in  Singapore, young and old, you  would  only

succeed  in getting 1.89 million. The Chinese  Army

alone  is  more  than the population of  Singapore.

More  so,  Sir, the Chinese Communist Army  is  the

only  military force in this part of the world that

has  the  experience of fighting  in  international

wars, particularly fighting the Allied Powers.  And

if  you  come  down a little bit south,  North  and

South Vietnam, they are still building and fighting

at  the  same  time.  North and  South  Korea,  for

example, had similar experience and they were  only

slightly   better  off  when  compared   with   the

Vietnamese.  Even India, which is a neutral  nation

and  has a very sizable standing army, is tied down

to two border disputes with her neighbours.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closer to us, the Malaysian Army is still

expanding, and it is said that they will  build  an

initial target of at least 35 battalions, with full

Commonwealth   support.  The  experience   of   the

Malaysian  Army during the Emergency was  indeed  a

hard-earned one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we in Singapore going to join in this armed

rat race? What for? Who will benefit? Can we afford

to  raise and maintain a reasonably large army  for

our  security? Or are we expanding the Armed Forces

to  provide employment opportunities, as some other

country not very far from Singapore is doing?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for over a hundred years, under British

rule, we had been fed with a different language,  a

different way of life, and, most important of  all,

and perhaps the most upsetting thing of all, we had

been  made  to evolve a very peculiar  outlook  and

social   assessment  based  on  a  philosophy   and

education  system completely foreign to  us.  Those

who  were  fortunate were given an education  which

was sufficient to serve the colonial administration

but  not  good  enough to question  their  colonial

masters'  right; except for a few,  of  course,  to

whom  the British thought a higher education  could

be  given in the motherland, so that they could  be

equipped  with better knowledge, and then later  on

baited  with  high social position and security  to

serve the colonial interests. But there are many  -

perhaps  most of the Ministers on the  Front  Bench

- concerning  whom the British regrettably  admitted

that their plans had misfired.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, defence was then not our business. We were

free  to  make  a  living and go to any  commercial

enterprises provided the resultant benefits were to

the  British interest and in their favour. And none

at  that  time regarded this place as our permanent

home. Very few questioned the rights that were  due

to  them. The question of security then was not our

business  too,  because the security  of  Singapore

meant  the security of the colonial interest  here.

And  so when the Japanese were nearing Singapore  -

not  actually in Singapore - the British packed  up

and Singapore was handed over to the Japanese. They

could get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>



away because they had the Prince of Wales. What did

we  have?  Our sampans? We could not get away.  And

where  could we go? For the Chinese, back to China;

the  Indians back to India; and the Malays back  to

Indonesia?  Sir, the lesson taught to us  was  that

the  British could pack up and scoot off  and  then

return  at  a time when they felt it most opportune

to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we were the unfortunate that were left

behind  to face the music of three years and  eight

months.  Where  were the British?  The  Australians

fought  well, the Indian Regiment fought well,  and

so  did  the  Malay Regiment. Not the British.  Our

forefathers perhaps and our brothers were the  ones

that  fought the Japanese. Sir, the Japanese taught

us a lesson. [Interruption] I was five.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cheng Lock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> The lesson was that our stake

is  here,  and not anywhere else. If  you  want  to

survive, stay here and fight.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, going back to recent history, the

circumstances  leading to our independence  can  be

said   to  be  very  unique.  Overnight  we   found

ourselves  masters  of  our own  destiny,  standing

alone  at  the southern tip of the Asian continent.

The   first   step   was  to  establish   ourselves

internationally  and make as  many  friends  as  we

possibly  could. Then came the big  question  mark:

our  security. Can we handle the job? How? With  or

without  the  British? The position of the  British

base here in Singapore is more than one of military

consideration. But we cannot forever  be  dependent

upon a foreign country for cur livelihood, more  so

our  security. The British are beginning to have  a

re-appraisal of their defence arrangements east  of

Suez.  For us, the British base here can be a  very

delicate and explosive political issue. And  so  we

give ourselves a very thorough examination and post-mortem.  With  the almost immediate  withdrawal  of

Malaysian troops and the Federal Reserve Unit,  who

forbade  people  singing  Christmas  hymns   during

Christmas time,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>



we  would  have to more than fill up  our  security

vacuum.  This  we  did. But as a long-term  policy,

with  the  impending  and eventual  and  inevitable

withdrawal of foreign troops, we have to handle the

job  on our own. This will lead us to the question,

what  kind of army do we want to build up? How  big

should  the  Armed Forces be? And  most  important,

against  whom are we defending? Sir, let us  tackle

the  last  question  first.  Against  whom  are  we

defending? The established policy of the Government

on  foreign  policy is non-alignment.  India,  too,

professes  a neutral foreign policy. Yet that  does

not  prevent her from military conflicts  with  her

neighbours,  China and Pakistan. The disputes  with

Pakistan and China have created doubts in the minds

of  many  as  to the practicability of  neutrality.

Sweden  and  Switzerland, for instance, maintain  a

sizable  army  even  when their foreign  policy  is

neutral.  Sir, we cannot take it for  granted  that

nobody  will harm us, that everything is  well  and

good   if   we  adopt  a  neutral  foreign  policy.

Neutrality is meaningless without safeguards to our

national   integrity.  Who   will   guarantee   our

territorial integrity?



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>6.44 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past two decades the international

boundaries of countries have changed and are  still

changing. For example, the 38th parallel  in  Korea

and   the   17th  parallel  in  Vietnam  are   very

artificial demarcations. The Thai/Cambodian  border

was the subject of a World Court decision. The West

Irian,  India  and Pakistan, and  India  and  China

borders  and  many  African  countries  are   still

disputing over their boundaries. Some of these  are

of  military significance, but in our  case  it  is

more economic than political.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot afford to involve ourselves in

power bloc conflicts in this part of the world. But

we  cannot,  at  the same time, be so  ridiculously

presumptuous  that because we will not  and  cannot

play  the  part  of  the  aggressor,  we  need  not

therefore think about our defence. We cannot afford

to maintain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>



a  large  standing  army and, therefore,  our  very

small  Armed  Forces must be a very efficient  one.

That  means that the duty and obligation to  defend

the  country  is open to a very small  minority  of

those people who are serving in the regular forces.

Others  are indifferent. And the answer is national

service  so  as not only to provide  the  means  of

defence but also to make it obligatory on the  part

of  the  people  to defend their own  interest  and

their own property.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, history has proved that no standing army in

Asia  can  be demobilised. Once you raise an  army,

you have to maintain and feed it and even to expand

it,  for a general cannot be a general if you  have

not got an army division. Sir, this is particularly

so   when  a  country's  independence  is  achieved

through  violent  revolution, and  after  that  the

freedom  fighters  form  the  elite  group  of  the

nation's  army  and  claim the right  of  place  in

society.  After all, they fought for  independence.

Our  situation in Singapore is unique in the  sense

that  there  is  no  front  line  in  view  of  the

smallness  of  our Republic. You  cannot  run  from

Pasir  Panjang  to Katong. In a nuclear  war  there

will  be  no  one left behind to build a  memorial,

because  there will be no one left to pick  up  our

bones.  Even in a conventional war, you cannot  run

from east to west. It is a matter of 27 miles -  14

miles  by  27 miles. There is no front line.  Every

inch  of  our territory is, in fact, a front  line.

Who is going to defend that?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot afford to have a soft-kneed new

generation  if  we  are  to survive.  And  we  hope

through  military training that we can build  up  a

tough and rugged new generation that can make  this

country   tick.  The  situation  has   changed   in

Singapore over the last decade or so. In  the  mid-l950s,  national  service was the subject  of  very

violent  protests  from  such  categories  of   the

population   as  hawkers,  factory  workers,   shop

assistants  and  students. Today, 10  years  later,

these  are  the same categories of people  who  are

serving  now  in the Vigilante Corps,  the  Special

Constabulary  and, most important of  all,  in  the

People's  Defence  Force. The same  categories  who

protested 10 years ago



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>



are   the  same  people  who  now  understand   the

mechanics of survival and they serve diligently  in

their respective arms.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly before the Japanese occupied Singapore, a

great  number of somewhat questionably  able-bodied

men and youths were "mobilised", handed with rifles

and  ordered to go oil to the so-called front.  And

all  of us know what happened after that. With  due

respect  to  the people who fought so well  shortly

before  1942,  we cannot afford to face  a  similar

kind  of situation - the situation of being  caught

unprepared. Some of the stories related to  us  now

by   the  still  surviving  members  of  the   then

Volunteer  Forces were that they thought they  went

for  a picnic - and a "picnic" it was, Mr Speaker,

Sir. Can we afford another such "picnic"? Are we to

be caught again in a state of un-preparedness? As I

have  said, the fact that we cannot and will  never

attack others does not mean that we do not have  to

defend   ourselves.  National  service   has   more

important  aspects  than  military.  As  the  Prime

Minister  and earlier the Minister of Defence  have

said,  it is through military training that we  can

build  up a disciplined, well-organised, tough  and

rugged  new  generation. For if we are to  give  up

this  place,  we  had better know to  whom  we  are

giving our authority. If we give up ourselves,  and

the next generation with soft knees are prepared to

compromise under the slightest pressure, then I say

we had better pack up now. We have a right to guide

---- [Interruption].



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> We have a right and an

obligation to guide and to help build up  the  next

generation  and to evolve a spirit of  oneness.  In

the  most  advanced countries of the world,  as  my

colleagues, the Member for Sembawang and the Member

for  Jalan  Kayu  have  earlier  mentioned,  almost

everyone  of  them  has national service.  In  some

countries,  a  deserter or one who evades  national

service will never in his life reveal this fact  to

his friend or even to his wife, for he regards this

as  shameful.  Evasion  of  the  responsibility  to

defend the nation is something



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>



that we have yet to put into the minds of our

population.  After  all, military  service  is  not

purely military service. In the Army, one can learn

a  trade, the mechanics of repairing a car,  fixing

up   wires,   and  possibly  repairing  a   bridge.

Therefore,  in our new nation military service  can

be  very  important in one other aspect,  i.e.,  to

provide  sufficient  trained and,  most  important,

disciplined  men  to fill up the vacancies  in  our

industrial houses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, Sir, it is oui duty to

explain to the people that their obligation  is  to

these  224 square miles -- 225 square miles at  low

tide  -  of  territory and not somewhere else,  not

further  north where a certain country exploded  an

atom  bomb. Some of us in Singapore take particular

pride  in  that,  and not in any other  country  to

which  by sentiment or race we feel we are attached

- Indonesia or India.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to end our discussion today, ][ should like

to  quote a passage from the speech of the Minister

of  Defence made on the 29th of December last  year

at a passing-cut parade. Dr Goh then said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Throughout man's long history, defence of the

community has always been regarded as a novel duty.

In  the process of integrating the loose collection

of  peoples  into a nation with a strong  sense  of

identity, military service has played a significant

role  from the great city states of the 5th century

B.C, to the 12th century continental super powers.

We  have  seen  how  the  development  of  national

consciousness  has  been so  often  centred  around

service in the defence forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, we are not yet a closely-knit

community.  So  many of our people  are  of  recent

migrant  origin. All this goes towards  creating  a

sense of value which is personal, self-centred with

anti-social  tendencies  when  a  conflict   arises

between  personal interests and social obligations.

These  are  the values of the ruthless  parvenu  of

society.  We cannot hope to remove them over-night.

But  in the proces3 of creating a stronger national

consciousness among our people, we will  find  that

military   service   will  play   an   increasingly

important  role as it has played in  other  nations

and  in other ages. This aspect of military service

is  at  least  as  important as the purely  defence

consideration."

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is there anyone who would like to

catch  my  eye  on  this Bill at  this  stage?  Mr

Rodrigues.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, several Members of this  House  have

already  stated their views on the National Service

(Amendment) Bill, 1967. I wish to place  on  record

my   agreement  in  principle  with  the   proposed

amendments to the National Service Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am of the view that some form of national

service is essential to the well-being and security

of  Singapore.  Even if there would never  arise  a

situation where the persons who have been called up

for   military  training  are  required  to  defend

Singapore from any threat or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>



danger,  whether  externally  or  internally,  such

period  of  national  training  would  stand  those

persons  in good stead. By reason of such training,

they  would be fortunate enough to receive training

in  leadership  and  responsibility  towards  their

State.  Thus  Singapore  would  have  at  least   a

substantial   number  of  its  citizens   who   are

physically  fit  and  mentally  keen  to  give  the

effective  and  strong leadership required  in  the

future years of our Island Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, however, have two comments to make in respect

of the proposed Bill. I wish to refer ---



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Rodrigues, I think you are going

a  little too fast for the interpreters. Could  you

go a little slower, please?



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> I am afraid I cannot finish it

today.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It does not matter. You can continue

tomorrow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Bernard Rodrigues -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Bernard Rodrigues:</b> I, however, have two comments to

make  in  respect of the proposed Bill. I  wish  to

draw  the  attention of this House to the  proposed

new  section  21A  wherein it is provided  that  an

employer  of  any  person placed  in  the  national

service  reserve  shall  be  responsible  for   the

difference in the emoluments between such  person's

civilian  and  service emoluments. It  is  probably

envisaged  by  this section 2lA that  the  employer

pays  the difference while the Government pays  the

service  emoluments  direct to  such  person.  This

section provides for persons who are placed in  the

national  service reserve, but I am rather  puzzled

about  the position of a person who is in full-time

national  service for the duration of the specified

two-year  period. It is likely that such  a  person

might already be in the employment of a company  or

firm.  I  am  not  sure whether  in  the  principal

Ordinance any provision is made for the security of

such  person's  employment  and  earnings  for  the

period  when they are receiving full-time  military

training.  If  no provision has been made,  then  I

think it is essential that some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>



amendment  must be made to the principal  Ordinance

to safeguard the position of such person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point which I wish to bring to the

attention of this House is that while the Ordinance

provides for the security of jobs of persons placed

in  the  national service reserve, no provision  is

made  to  the effect that no person placed  in  the

national service reserve shall be prejudiced in his

employment by reason only of the fact that they are

placed  on  the  national service reserve  for  the

duration of such reserve services. I have  in  mind

the   possibility  that  a  person  placed  on  the

national  service  reserve  may  be  placed  at   a

disadvantage  in respect of promotion opportunities

as  a result of his military duties. Because of his

military training requirements, he may not be  able

to carry out overtime work in his company ---



<br><br>7.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.

Pursuant   to  Standing  Orders  and  the   earlier

resolution  of  this House, this is the  Moment  of

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>

<div align="center"><b>HUMILIATORY ARTICLES ON THE REPUBLIC</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>IN THE UTUSAN MELAYU</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahamat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to draw the

attention  of the House to humiliatory articles  on

the Republic published in the Utusan Melayu.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the very lenient manner in which

democracy   is  being  enforced  by  the  Singapore

Government, the Utusan Melayu, a paper published in

Malaya,  recently had the temerity to  outrage  the

sovereignty of our Republic by belittling



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>



the names and personalities of the Ministers of the

Government of Singapore and of the President of the

Republic  of  Singapore, by publishing  humiliatory

articles  purposely  exaggerated  and  given  undue

prominence  in  order  to cause  political  tension

between   Malaysia  and  Singapore.   This   is   a

mischievous and dangerous act on the part of Utusan

Melayu  against Singapore which has  emerged  as  a

free and sovereign nation. The Utusan Melayu always

publishes news as facts which have been twisted  by

Ahmad Haji Taff to excite communal feelings between

the  Malays and the non-Malays. Clarifications made

by  the  leaders  of the Singapore  Government  are

invariably  ignored and receive scant  coverage  in

the  columns  of  Utusan Melayu, and  if  they  are

published at all, they are twisted about.  This  is

done   purposely  by  Utusan  Melayu  for  specific

purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, like the Utusan Melayu, know that Ahmad Haji

Taff   too  acts  as  a  spokesman  of  a   foreign

government and owes no allegiance to the State, for

he  cherishes the same objectives as those achieved

by  Dato Hamid Jumat and Tun Lim Yew Hock who  have

become  Malaysian Ambassadors. Both  of  them  were

from Singapore and they were Singapore Ministers in

the  past,  but they became frustrated  with  their

political  struggle in Singapore. Ahmad Haji  Taff,

too,  is  frustrated  in  the  political  arena  in

Singapore  as  a result of defeats in  the  general

elections  in the past - he was defeated  twice  in

Tanglin  and  once in Geylang Serai  in  1963;  his

colleagues  too experienced severe defeat  in  that

last  election. The P.A.P. Government in  Singapore

took  pity  on him because of his defeats,  and  in

order  not  to  cause him further  frustration,  it

appointed him as a Senator whilst Singapore was  in

Malaysia.  It  was  only  then  that  he  had   the

privilege  of sampling the cosiness of a  chair  in

Dewan  Negara. But, unfortunately, because  of  his

own  doings, the appointment of Senator enjoyed  by

Ahmad  Haji Taff through the charity of the  P.A.P.

Government  lasted  for  only  two  years,  because

Singapore became separated



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>



from   Malaysia.  And  now  there   is   no   other

alternative for him but to act as a spokesman of  a

foreign government in league with the Utusan Melayu

and  to  twist  and  distort the  speeches  of  the

Ministers  of  the  Singapore Government  with  the

object and hope of obtaining a post like the  posts

obtained by Dato Hamid Jumat and Tun Lim Yew  Hock.

It  is  with  this  object  in  view  that  he,  in

collusion with Utusan Melayu, is going all  out  to

instill  in  the Malays in Singapore a  feeling  of

hatred   towards  the  leaders  of  the   Singapore

Government  through the columns  of  Utusan  Melayu

daily.  On  its  part, the Utusan Melayu  purposely

exaggerates the news, all the more so if such  news

items can fan the flames of communalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that we have not yet forgotten the

incidents  which took place in 1964 as a result  of

the publications in Utusan Melayu which then became

an   instigator   that   fanned   the   flames   of

communalism,   culminating   in   a    number    of

disturbances whereby many lives were sacrificed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Singapore was separated from. Malaysia and

became  a  free and sovereign nation, its  position

became more peaceful and prosperous. Be that as  it

may,  the Utusan Melayu, which is published outside

Singapore  and  allowed  to  circulate  freely   in

Singapore,  did not relent in its efforts  to  find

ways and means to print news which can give rise to

political  tension between Malaysia and  Singapore.

For  instance, in the issue of Utusan Melayu of the

13th of February, 1967, an article was published in

big  headlines  and it was twisted  by  Ahmad  Haji

Taff.  It  set out the meaning and purpose  of  the

speech of Inche Rahim Ishak, the Minister of  State

for  Education  in  Singapore, in  order  to  cause

confusion among the Malays to the effect that Inche

Rahim Ishak is a Malay leader of the P.A.P, who  is

anti-Malay  and  anti-Malay Rulers.  Actually,  the

speech  of  Inche Rahim Ishak did  not  state  that

people  of royal blood look on the Malays as  dogs.

etc.  He  mentioned  the word "patek"  which  means

"little  dog". The Utusan Melayu has itself  agreed

that the word "patek" means "dog". In its



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>



issue  of  31st  December, 1966, the Utusan  Melayu

printed  an  article in bold headlines saying  that

the  meaning of "patek" is "dog" and it was written

by  a  language specialist in Malaysia. The heading

of  the  article  published by  the  Utusan  Melayu

clearly  states that `patek" means  "dog".  If  the

Utusan  Melayu  itself agrees  that  "patek"  means

"dog", why then did it recently deny the meaning of

that  word, and why then did it and Ahmad Haji Taff

kick  up  a  fuss about the speech of  Inche  Rahim

Ishak?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Utusan Melayu of 15th February, 1967,

published  an  item  in  big headlines  criticising

Inche  Rahim Ishak and the President of  Singapore,

Inche  Yusof  Bin Ishak. Its object  was  that  the

President of the Republic of Singapore is  not  fit

to  be called "Paduka Yang Mulia" because he is not

of  royal  blood.  It is possible that  the  Utusan

Melayu  does not understand or purposely  does  not

wish  to  understand the terms "Paduka Yang  Mulia"

and  "Kebawah Duli Yang Mahamulia". With  the  term

"Paduka  Yang  Mulia"  for  the  President  of  the

Republic  of  Singapore, that  is  the  reason  why

Singapore does not use the word "patek". I  do  not

understand  why  the name of the President  of  the

Republic of Singapore was made the object of attack

by  Utusan Melayu. I have read an editorial  column

of   Utusan   Melayu   which  mentioned   President

Soekarno, using the term "Paduka Yang Mulia". Is it

that  of late this was purposely twisted by  Utusan

Melayu  in  a  campaign  so  that  the  Malays   of

Singapore  will  not centre their  loyalty  on  the

President   and  the  Ministers  of  the  Singapore

Government? This is a mischievous and dangerous act

by Utusan Melayu towards Singapore which has become

a  free  and  sovereign nation. The  Government  of

Singapore  should take a serious view of  this  and

take  action on the publication of such news items.

Similarly,  action  should be taken  against  Ahmad

Haji Taff for, like the Utusan Melayu, he acts as a

spokesman  of a foreign government for the  purpose

of  inciting political tension between Malaysia and

Singapore. In the interest of peace, happiness  and

prosperity of the people of Singapore, I urge  that

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>



Government  demand  an  apology  from  both  Utusan

Melayu and Ahmad Haji Taff for what they have done,

and  should  they  fail to do  so,  the  Government

should take necessary action against both of them.

<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would

like to reply to the speech made by the Member  for

Geylang Serai in Malay.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In Malay): At the outset, let me explain to this

House  that  it  is  true that  the  Utusan  Melayu

deliberately twisted and perverted the speech  made

by  Inche  Rahim Ishak, the Minister of  State  for

Education.  It was designed to stir up  hatred  and

enrage the Malays both outside and within Singapore

against  Inche  Rahim Ishak in particular  and  the

Singapore Government in general. The Utusan  Melayu

has  once again attempted to denounce the Singapore

Government   as  being  anti-Malay  and  anti-Malay

Sultans, as, in fact, it did when Singapore  was  a

part  of  Malaysia.  Under the  circumstances,  the

Utusan  Melayu deliberately reported Inche  Rahim's

speech Out of context and perverted it. However, we

all  know Inche Rahim's speech did not in the least

offend  the  position nor the status of  the  Malay

Rulers. What he said in full concerned the progress

achieved by the Malays in Singapore in the field of

education  with  the  various forms  of  assistance

given to them by the Singapore Government since the

P.A.P. assumed office in 1959. If it was true  that

Inche  Rahim's  speech offended and denigrated  the

status of the Malay Rulers, we would certainly have

received   a  strong  protest  from  the  Malaysian

Government.  However, to date we have not  received

any such protest officially. The Prime Minister  of

Malaysia,  Tunku Abdul Rahman, when  challenged  by

Mr D. R. Seenivasagam in the Malaysian Parliament,

stated that he did not wish to send a protest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all aware about Ahmad Haji Taff's tactics.

He   is   the   head  of  U.M.N.O.  Singapore,   an

appointment made in Kuala Lumpur. He was not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>



elected by members of U.M.N.O. Singapore, as is the

case   with   political   parties   that   practise

democracy,  but he was appointed by forces  outside

Singapore. It naturally follows that he feels  that

he  is under a certain obligation to his benefactor

and,  of  course, he comes Out in  support  of  and

exaggerates whatever his master says.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Possibly there is some truth in what the Member

for Geylang Serai has said - that Ahmad Haji Taff  is

aspiring to be an Ambassador, an ambition which his

colleagues have realised, i.e., Hamid Jumat and Lim

Yew Hock who have been given high appointments. Lim

Yew  Hock  has suddenly become a poet recently.  As

the  head  appointed by outside forces, Ahmad  Haji

Taff is apprehensive that, when the day of judgment

arrives, he will be ousted from UMNO. Singapore. So

one  way  out of his dilemma is for him  always  to

create  a  sense of uneasiness among the Malays  in

Singapore.  In  this  way, by fishing  in  troubled

waters,  he hopes to cling to his position  for  as

long as he can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Malays in Singapore, who have never been

under feudalistic rule since 150 years ago, are not

narrow-minded. Therefore, they turned a deaf ear to

Ahmad Haji Taff's speech and the articles in Utusan

Melayu  written under a nom de plume. I  understand

that  those articles were not, in fact, written  by

members  of the public but by the staff  of  Utusan

Melayu  itself.  I further understand  that  at  an

U.M.N.O, meeting held in Singapore recently,  Ahmad

Haji   Taff   condemned  Malay   organisations   in

Singapore   for  remaining  silent  and   for   not

supporting Utusan Melayu.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is a democratic

socialist  country.  We are  an  open  society.  If

Utusan Melayu and Ahmad Haji Taff were to live in a

neighbouring  country, they  would  certainly  have

been  languishing in prison by now, detained  under

the  internal security laws. But we will not resort

to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>



the  internal  security laws. We  only  invoke  the

internal  security laws against the Communists  who

cannot  be  convicted  in an open  court,  as  they

threaten  witnesses  with  bodily  harm.  We   have

certain  laws under which action may be  taken  for

such  offences.  I refer to the Sedition  Ordinance

contained  in  the Internal Security  Act.  We  are

constantly  giving serious attention  to  the  news

items  and articles carried in Utusan Melayu  which

affect  Singapore. When this daily paper runs  foul

of  the  law, then the Government will not hesitate

to take firm action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Utusan Melayu representative, in an interview

with  the  Prime  Minister, Mr Lee  Kuan  Yew,  in

September  1965, had already been provided  with  a

copy  of  the  Sedition Ordinance.  Certainly  this

representative  is not unaware that the  provisions

of  the  Sedition Ordinance are still in  force  in

Singapore  and  can  be enforced  at  any  time  if

necessary. I wish to remind Utusan Melayu  that  in

an  interview with me on 30th September,  1965,  in

the  Ministry  of Culture, Singapore, its  Managing

Director;  Dato  Hussain  Bin  Noordin,   gave   an

assurance to the Singapore Government to the effect

that  Utusan  Melayu  would  not  publish  articles

prejudicial to the peace and security of Singapore.

He  further  said that Utusan Melayu would  at  all

times   make  positive  contributions  by  way   of

maintaining good relationship between Singapore and

Malaysia.  Dato Noordin also stated that  he  would

accord  his  full co-Operation to bring  about  the

successful  creation of a just, prosperous,  multi-racial and multi-religious society in Singapore. It

is  well  and good for Utusan Melayu not to  forget

this undertaking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Parliament do now adjourn.
