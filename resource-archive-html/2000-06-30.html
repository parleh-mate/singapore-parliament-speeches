<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>DEREGULATION OF TAXI FARES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang</b> asked the Minister for

Communications   and   Information   Technology,   with   the

deregulation  of  taxi fares, (a) how the  consumer  will  be

protected;   (b)  how  the  taxi  fare  increases   will   be

distributed;  and (c) how much of each dollar  of  taxi  fare

goes  to the taxi company, the various taxes (Certificate  of

Entitlement,  import tax, registration fee,  Electronic  Road

Pricing charges, etc), diesel and the driver.

<br><br><!-- Mr J B Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr J B Jeyaretnam</b> asked the Minister for

Communications   and  Information  Technology   whether   the

proposed increase in taxi fares has been made solely  at  the

request  of  the companies that operate the taxi services  or

because  the  taxi  drivers themselves have been  complaining

that they are not earning enough from the present fares.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, may I have your

permission to take Question Nos. 1 and 2 together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, Members of this House will

recall  that  the Public Transport Council (PTC)  deregulated

taxi  fares in September 1998. This means that taxi companies

now  have autonomy to set taxi fares without needing to  seek

approval  from  the  PTC. They now have more  flexibility  to

introduce  differentiated and niche services and  to  respond

more   quickly   to   changes  in  the  environment   through

differential  pricing strategies. The aim was  to  allow  the

forces of demand and supply to determine the pricing of  taxi

services  that  would optimise the utilisation  of  the  taxi

fleet.  With  deregulation, taxi companies have  to  consider

carefully and individually decide on fare revisions based  on

their pricing strategy and supply-demand considerations.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxi companies have to price their services at a fair

level,  taking into consideration, among other  factors,  the

demand  for  their services, cost of providing the  services,

earnings  of  taxi  drivers,  competition  from  other   taxi

companies and other modes of transport, the need to  generate

adequate  returns  to  pay for vehicle  replacement,  and  to

invest in expansion and upgrading. Commuters are in the  best

position to decide whether taxi fares are set too high or too

low. If taxi fares are set too high, the demand will drop and

taxi  companies  will not be able to operate  their  business

profitably.   Conversely, if fares are set  too  low,  supply

will  not be able to match demand and service standards  will

drop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deregulation of taxi fares therefore serves to

optimise  the utilisation of resources in meeting the  demand

for  taxi  services.  Commuters stand to gain as  it  ensures

that the pricing of taxi services is competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fare deregulation, how each dollar of the taxi fare

is  distributed is determined by the taxi companies.  We  can

expect that, to retain drivers in this highly competitive and

tight labour market, taxi companies will have to enable their

drivers to earn a decent income.

<div align="center"><b>CERTIFICATE OF ENTITLEMENTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Review of categorisation)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Dr Jennifer Lee</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  and Information Technology, in  view  of  the

trend that has emerged from the converging of Certificate  of

Entitlement  prices,  if  his Ministry  will  reconsider  and

review  the categorisation of COEs, in order to preserve  and

support  a system in which car buyers will have more  choices

and the ability to opt for smaller capacity cars.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology (Dr John Chen Seow Phun) (for the Minister for Communications and Information Technology):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

can I ask the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>

Clerk  of  Parliament to distribute the handout?  [Copies  of

handout distributed to hon. Members].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Certificate of Entitlement (COE) categories for

small  and  medium-sized cars were merged into one  category,

Category A, in May 1999, following a review by the Government

Parliamentary  Committee.  The  Committee  had   noted   that

ideally,  there  should  only be one category  of  COEs,  and

recommended  the  merger of the two COE  categories  to  also

address  the  concern that the COE quota for small  cars  was

declining  while their COE prices were not greatly  different

from those for medium-sized cars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The merger of the two categories to form a larger quota

has  helped  to  stabilise COE prices. This does not  however

mean  that the COE for smaller cars will be cheaper than that

for  bigger  cars, because price is a function of demand  and

supply.  Latest prices for Category B COEs for cars more than

1,600  cc  against that for Category A COEs for  cars  up  to

1,600  cc bear this out. The COE price of Category A is close

to  and sometimes higher than that of Category B. This is  in

spite  of the fact that the monthly quota for Category A,  as

it stands now, is 2,617, which is more than twice the size of

the quota for Category B, which is 1,153.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, combining the former COE Categories 1 and 2 into

one category for all cars with engine capacity up to 1,600 cc

has  given car buyers greater flexibility to decide what cars

to  buy based on affordability. The fact that more choose  to

buy  at  the higher cc end of this category reflects consumer

preference  for such cars. This is notwithstanding  the  fact

that  there  are  other cheaper, smaller  cc  models  in  the

category which are more affordable. As a matter of fact,  the

prices of some small cars have not changed much, compared  to

the  first quarter of 1999 before the two COE categories were

merged.  I have distributed to Members some data to show  the

comparison  of car prices to illustrate what I mean.  If  you

look  at  Table 1, generally, the prices for small  cars  are

lower  than prices for medium-sized cars.  When you  look  at

Table 3, comparing the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>

car  prices, say, for small cars before and after the merger,

you can see that the changes are not much. Some have gone up,

some  have  come down.  The reality is that car  buyers  have

been  able  to benefit from the merger of the two  categories

and  they  are exercising their preferred decision.  More  of

them appear to be opting for the bigger, though slightly more

expensive models, rather than the cheapest models within  the

same COE category.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of motor dealers, they have responded to the

change  in demand pattern by adjusting the range and  numbers

of  car  models  they  import for the Singapore  market.  The

decision  to bring in fewer small car models is a  reflection

of  the  shrinking demand for smaller cars, even though  such

cars are still, as I have said earlier, generally cheaper and

hence more affordable than the bigger cars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owning a car is not a basic need. There is no reason why

Government  should intervene and arbitrarily  decide  on  the

market mix of the car population in Singapore. We should  not

influence the type of cars buyers should choose. It  is  best

left to car buyers how much they are willing to pay for a COE

and  what  type of cars they want to purchase. From the  land

transport point of view, all cars, regardless of the size  of

their  engine capacity, occupy the same amount of road  space

when moving.  Hence, traffic engineers have assigned all cars

the  same Passenger Car Unit (PCU) rating of 1. It is not the

intent of the COE scheme to address the social issue of price

progressivity. This issue is addressed through the Additional

Registration Fee (ARF) and customs duty which are  pegged  to

the  Open Market Value (OMV) of the vehicle, and the road tax

structure which is based on the engine capacity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the current COE trends, some have expressed

the  view that Government should move towards merging all car

categories  into one broad category. The COE categories  were

restructured  just  over a year ago. We will  be  introducing

open bidding for COEs later this year. It is best that we let

the system stabilise and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>

observe  the  price trends of COEs and consumer  preferences.

Hence, the Government has no plans at this stage to merge the

two car categories into a single category.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I would just

simply  like  to ask the Minister of State that, albeit  that

cars  are not a basic need, they do form a very real part  of

the aspirations of many Singaporeans and, therefore, the LTA,

as  it further studies refinements and hopefully enhancements

from  the public point of view, takes due consideration  that

it  tries not to contribute more to the very real and growing

feeling among ordinary Singaporeans that more and more things

are  getting  out  of reach of the little guy  and  of  young

people starting out in their careers.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, we understand that the

aspiration  to own cars is there and, of course,  subject  to

the  congestion objective, the Government will  try  to  help

Singaporeans  fulfill their aspiration.  As I  said,  at  the

moment,  there is progressivity also in the ARF and the  road

tax,   and  the  COE  is  not  intended  to  accentuate  that

progressivity. But what we can do is wherever we can, subject

to  congestion level, we will try to give more COEs and  that

will lower the COE prices.

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN DOMESTIC WORKERS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Complaints on ill-treatment and abuse)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Thomas Thomas</b> asked the Minister for Manpower if

he  will give figures of complaints received for the last two

years  on ill-treatment and abuse of foreign domestic workers

in  Singapore and state the actions taken by the  authorities

in addressing these complaints.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in 1997, the Singapore Police Force  recorded

157 substantiated cases of foreign domestic worker abuse.  In

1998,  the  number of substantiated abuse cases  reported  by

foreign domestic workers dropped to 89 cases and in 1999,  it

fell further to 82 cases.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 505</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that in May 1998, the Penal Code was

amended  to  enhance  penalties by  1.5  times  for  offences

committed against foreign domestic workers by the employer or

members  of the employer's household.  This appeared to  have

helped  to  reduce  the number of cases of  foreign  domestic

worker abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are more than 100,000 foreign domestic workers

working  in Singapore.  The number of cases of abuse  or  ill

treatment  is only a small proportion of the total number  of

foreign domestic workers working here.  The vast majority  of

foreign  domestic  workers in Singapore are  generally  well-treated  and enjoy a happy and rewarding working relationship

with  their  employers.  This is evident from the  fact  that

Singapore  continues  to  attract  an  increasing  number  of

foreign  domestic  workers and many  of  them  have  in  fact

decided  to extend their work permits beyond the normal  two-year term.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> I would just like

to  ask the Minister:  is there a problem with domestic maids

not  complying  with  the  terms of  their  work  permit  and

therefore we have to send them off?  What I am saying is that

since the problem with employers is so small, what about  the

problems  of  the domestic maids themselves?  Are  there  any

significant problems?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, I believe that the Member is

referring to the group of foreign domestic workers who either

take  off  from their employer's household and  moonlight  on

their  own  in  other  occupations or  are  deployed  by  the

employer  to work in some other occupations.  Let  me  assure

the Member that while this problem exists and that, from time

to  time, my Ministry's enforcement officers come across such

cases  and  take  action  against them,  both  employers  and

employees, the number of cases is small.  It is not a growing

problem.   We are continuing to educate employers of  foreign

domestic  workers on their responsibility, not  only  on  the

welfare part about treating the foreign domestic workers well

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 506</b></font><br><br>

and  caring for them, but also to remind employers that  they

should not deploy them to work outside the household, whether

it  is to help out the employer in the hawker stall or in the

provision  shop  in  the  neighbourhood.   Such  duties   are

obviously  not  part of the domestic duties  of  the  foreign

domestic  worker and  employers should refrain  from  sending

their  foreign domestic workers to work in such  occupations.

If  they  do and if they are caught, they face fairly  severe

penalties.

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Establishment)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

what  is the current status of the proposed establishment  of

the National Institute on Occupational Safety and Health.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a National Institute

of Occupational Safety and Health was one of the proposals of

the Manpower21 Report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, my Ministry's Occupational Safety and Health

(Training  and  Promotion) Centre  carries  out  training  in

occupational  safety and health (OSH) as well  as  implements

programmes  to  promote OSH awareness.  It  conducts  a  wide

range   of  training  courses  for  managers,  professionals,

supervisors and workers.  It also organises safety campaigns,

seminars  and  workshops  to promote  safety  and  health  in

factories.   We  also  have well-established  private  sector

safety  consultants  to help companies improve  their  safety

performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of research and development, we should tap

the  results  of work by institutions in developed  countries

which  are more advanced in OSH R&D.  If there is a  need  to

carry  out  researches  on  our own occupational  safety  and

health  issues,  we  can  do that in collaboration  with  our

institutions  of higher learning, perhaps with  funding  from

National  Science and Technology Board.  In other words,  the

major features of a National Institute of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>

Occupational Safety and Health are already being addressed by

the  existing industrial safety framework.  Hence we  do  not

see  an urgent need to establish an Institute on Occupational

Safety  and Health at this juncture.  However, we will review

the need for such an institute sometime in future.

Commodity Exchange (SICOM), namely, rubber and coffee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firms that trade in other commodities are not regulated.

As  Mr  Ong and other Members of the House have pointed  out,

some  of  these firms, commonly known as bucket  shops,  have

enticed the public to open trading accounts with them.   They

engage in trading practices that are against the interest  of

investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTI will be proposing amendments to the Commodities

Futures  Act  to extend the Act to cover all commodities  and

associated  derivatives, and to require any firm that  wishes

to  trade in commodities to be licensed.   However, to ensure

that,  obviously,  bona fide traders are not  inconvenienced,

several  categories of traders (other than those  trading  in

rubber  and  coffee)  will  be exempted  from  the  licensing

requirement.    These  categories will include  principal-to-principal  traders, over-the-counter traders and banks.   The

proposed  amendments  will help to stamp  out  bucket  shops,

without   overly  inconveniencing  bona  fide  traders.    In

drafting the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>

new  legislation, we welcome the views of all Members of  the

House and the public.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, as part

of  the  review  of the legislation, would the Minister  also

consider  legislating a cooling off period from the  date  of

signing  the  agreement, so that a prospective investor  will

have  more  time to consider his intentions before activating

the investment account?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Sir, we can consider such a

provision.  But we have got to look at it from all angles  to

see  whether it sets a precedent for other transactions which

may become a problem.  But we will consider it.

<div align="center"><b>(Enhanced incentives for first-time buyers)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Dr Lily Neo</b> asked the Minister for National

Development   whether  his  Ministry  will  further   enhance

incentives  for first-time buyers of Housing and  Development

Board  flats so as to assist young couples start their  homes

and families earlier.

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for National Development (Dr John Chen Seow Phun) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the HDB has several schemes to assist young

couples  to start their homes and families earlier.  Firstly,

HDB  flats are sold at subsidised prices to ensure that  they

are affordable to young couples.  Next, HDB provides mortgage

financing  at  concessionary interest rates to  first-timers.

HDB  flat buyers can make use of their CPF savings to pay the

20% downpayment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB also has a Fiance/Fiancee Scheme whereby young

couples intending to get married can apply for new HDB  flats

before  their  marriage.  For those on the  Registration  for

Flat   System,  HDB  allocates  more  flats  to  first-timers

compared to upgraders, to enable the former to start up their

homes  earlier.   Today, first-timers can  select  their  HDB

flats within one to one and a half years

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>

from  the  date  of  application.  If they  select  completed

flats,  they  can take possession of the flats within  a  few

months from selection.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, first-time purchasers can buy resale flats

or  Executive Condominiums with the CPF Housing Grant Scheme.

The  grant  of  $30,000 to $40,000 will help  to  defray  the

initial  cost of purchase of their resale flats or  Executive

Condominiums.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Sir, may I ask the

Minister of State whether he would consider raising the  loan

ceiling for first-time buyers from 80% to 90%, similar to the

existing  schemes  available for joint  selection  multi-tier

family and confirmed Government officers?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the requirement of 80% is a

prudent practice to ensure that buyers will buy flats  within

their affordability.  We also have schemes to help low-income

families to obtain a bigger mortgage financing.  For ordinary

first-timers, it is best that they stick to the 20%  deposit.

But if they have financial difficulty, they can always appeal

to their MPs and we will look at the case on its own merit.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Sir, on the question of affordability, may

I  inform  the  Minister of State that, in  fact,  there  are

already  affordability criteria, such as maximum quantum  and

maximum repayment period.  The criteria are already in place.

What is the worry on that?

<br><br><!-- Dr John Chen Seow Phun -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr John Chen Seow Phun:</b> Sir, the credit assessment that

we  have  is  to  ensure that people buy flats  within  their

affordability.   The 20% downpayment is also  prudent  market

practice  in the private sector, and this policy is  to  make

sure  that  people have enough savings before  they  actually

start  thinking of buying a flat.  So I think it is  quite  a

prudent approach.

<div align="center"><b>(Demand and supply)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  (a)  what is the status of  planned  and  actual

demand and supply of Housing and Development Board flats from

1998  to 2000; (b) how many HDB building project tenders were

called  in 1999 and the first quarter of 2000 and not awarded

till  to date; and (c) what is the waiting time for both  new

flat applicants and upgraders.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the HDB

received  8,800  and  9,700  Registration  for  Flats  System

applications in 1998 and 1999 respectively, and an average of

about  1,200  applications per month during  the  first  five

months  of this year.  As a result, the queue length for  HDB

flats  has  declined to about 37,000 as  at  31st  May  2000,

compared  to  a peak of about 146,000 in the year  1996/1997.

The  shorter queue has enabled HDB to reduce the waiting time

to  about 1 to 1.5 years for first-timer applicants,  and  to

about 3 to 4 years for upgrader applicants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the lower demand for new HDB flats, HDB has

reduced  its  building programme from about 28,000  units  in

1998  to  22,000 units in 1999.  It is planning for a further

reduction   of   the  building  programme  for   this   year.

Nonetheless, the decline in HDB building works will not  have

a  significant impact on the construction sector as  work  on

other public buildings is projected to increase this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the status of HDB tenders, HDB called tender for 32

building  contracts in 1999 and 9 building contracts  in  the

first  quarter  of  2000.  Of these, 14 contracts  are  still

under  evaluation, and the majority of which will be  awarded

between June and October this year.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Sir, may I ask the Senior

Parliamentary  Secretary how many construction firms  working

on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>

existing contracts have been asked by HDB to slow down  their

programmes,   and  whether  the  HDB  will   compensate   the

contractors if these construction works are slowed down?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Sir, I am not aware that HDB

has  asked any existing contractors to slow down the existing

building programme.  What HDB has done is to evaluate the  14

contracts  that will be awarded between now and October  this

year.   In view of the reduced demand for HDB flats,  HDB  is

now  looking at the tenders that are going to the market, and

those which we have called for tenders but not yet awarded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards compensation, for those tenders which are

under  the design and build category, HDB can consider it  if

contractors come to us and say, "You have called for tenders.

We have put in effort for the tender and now you have decided

either  to  defer or cancel it altogether."  But so  far,  no

contractor has come to us and asked for compensation.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin:</b> Sir, may I ask the Senior Parliamentary

Secretary  whether the HDB is prepared to relax the so-called

offer of rejected flats for walk-in selection?  There are new

applicants   for   certain  flats.    Sometimes   there   are

rejections.  These flats are normally pooled and  put  up  in

advertisements for the next allocation.  Can we  open  it  up

earlier so that applicants can walk in to select flats?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we can

consider that proposal.

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT BOARD FLATS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Purchase and rental)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  if  the Housing and Development Board  will  (i)

allow single persons to purchase new 4-room flats; (ii) allow

HDB   lessees  (within  the  5-year  occupation  period)   to

downgrade  to  3-  or  4-room flats; and (iii)  increase  the

income ceiling for rental flats to $1,000.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Koo Tsai Kee (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a general policy, our

public  housing programme requires flat applicants to form  a

family nucleus to qualify for the purchase of a new flat from

HDB.  This is in line with the philosophy that the family  is

the basic building block of a strong and stable society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to meet the housing needs of some Singaporeans

who  remain single and would like to live on their  own,  the

HDB  has  in place two schemes, namely, the Single  Singapore

Citizen  Scheme  and  the Joint Singles  Scheme.   Under  the

Single Singapore Citizen Scheme, singles who are 35 years and

above  can buy resale 3-room or smaller flats located outside

the   urban  areas.   The  3-room  flats  provide  more  than

sufficient space for singles who live on their own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Joint Singles Scheme, two eligible single

citizens  can  jointly  purchase resale  flats  of  any  size

anywhere in Singapore.  The CPF Housing Grant Scheme is  also

open  to  first-timer single applicants who are 35  years  or

more.  Today, the grant is $11,000 under the Single Singapore

Citizen  Scheme  and double that, $22,000,  under  the  Joint

Singles Scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as there are sufficient avenues to meet the housing

needs  of singles, I think for now  there is no need to allow

singles to purchase new 4-room flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked about downgrading during the first 5-year occupation period. In general, HDB requires lessees to

occupy  their flats for at least five years before  they  can

sell  them  in the open market.  This is to deter speculation

on HDB flats, which are heavily subsidized.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are two options available to HDB lessees

if  they need, for whatever reasons,  to downgrade to smaller

flats  within the 5-year occupation period.  First, they  can

surrender  their  existing flat to HDB and  then  purchase  a

resale  flat  from  the  open market; or  they  can  mutually

exchange  their  existing flat with another lessee,  provided

both parties have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>

completed  a  minimum 1-year occupation period and  meet  the

requirements of the scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Teo also asked about raising the income ceiling for

rental  flats.  Sir, HDB reviews the income ceiling regularly

to  take into account changes in household incomes.   In  the

case  of  rental flats, raising the ceiling from the  current

$800  per  month  to  $1,000 per month  may  be  against  the

Government's  objective  to  help  as  many  Singaporeans  as

possible  become home owners. Nevertheless, I would  like  to

assure the House that HDB does exercise flexibility to  allow

families  with incomes exceeding $800 per month to  rent  HDB

flats   at   subsidized  rental  if  there   are   mitigating

circumstances.  HDB also has several assistance schemes, such

as  Sale of Flats to Sitting Tenants, Sale of 3-Room Buy Back

Flats  and Rent and Purchase Scheme, to help the lower income

groups to own HDB flats.

<div align="center"><b>WORKERS FROM LOWER-INCOME GROUP</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Training grants)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower  if  his  Ministry has any plans to provide  further

incentives  to workers from the lower-income group  to  enrol

for training courses to upgrade their skills, for example, by

giving  an  appropriate level of training grants directly  to

these workers.

<br><br><!-- Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Encik Othman bin Haron Eusofe) (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Sir, worker

training  is  critical for our economic  competitiveness  and

successful  transformation  into a  knowledge-based  economy.

With economic restructuring, the types of jobs available  and

the  skills  needed to perform these jobs  will  continue  to

change.   These  new  jobs will require  higher  skills.  For

Singaporeans,  especially  lower  income  and  less  educated

workers,  continual skills upgrading is the key  to  ensuring

employability and enhancing incomes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the Government has recently committed additional

funds  to  motivate  and  facilitate  skills  upgrading.   In

February  this year, my Ministry established a  $200  million

Manpower  Development  Assistance Scheme  (MDAS)  to  support

manpower  development initiatives over the next  five  years.

Of  the $200 million, $90 million has been set aside for  the

Skills  Redevelopment Programme (SRP),  aimed  at  retraining

lower skilled workers. This is in addition to the $50 million

committed to the programme in 1998. Under the SRP, we aim  to

provide  training  for  100,000  workers  over  five   years.

Currently, we have about 26,000 workers who have completed or

are  undergoing SRP training. Companies sending their workers

for training receive generous grants, covering up to 100%  of

course  fees  and 85% of absentee payroll.  SRP  also  covers

those  who  are  unemployed or those who initiate  their  own

training. They can sign up for the training programme through

the CDCs and self-help groups. Already 6,700 Singaporeans had

done so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has also generously supported the

Education and Training Fund (ETF) set up by the NTUC  with  a

matching  grant  of $3 for every $1 raised  by  NTUC.   Since

1998,  the Government has committed $15 million to the  fund.

The ETF supports training for union members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, with effect from 1st July 2000, the salary

cap  for  the  Skills Development Levy will  be  raised  from

$1,000  to  $1,500.   The change will raise  the  total  levy

collection from the current level of $20 million  a  year  to

about  $48 million a year.  This will significantly  increase

the  training  grants  that can be made available  under  the

Skills  Development  Fund.  Apart from  supporting  employer-based  training,  the SDF also operates a Surrogate  Employer

Scheme.  Under the scheme, Singaporeans who sign for training

through  the  self-help groups or CDCs can also benefit  from

SDF's training grants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it stands, I believe that we have sufficient

resources to fund skills upgrading for lower income  workers,

whether  it  is employer-based or individual-initiated.   Our

biggest challenge now is not so much in finding funds for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>

upgrading but encouraging both employers and workers to  come

forward  and  utilise these incentives and embrace  continual

skills upgrading.

tell   the   House  how  the  Minister  would  exercise   the

are to be declared as political organisations?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is: how can the Minister assure this

House that such wide discretionary powers are not used solely

for  partisan  political agenda that is to  be  used  against

groups whose views differ from that of the Government?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, this matter has been

debated  widely  and  thoroughly during  the  Second  Reading

speech of the Minister in this House.  In fact, in his speech

organisation,  ie,   the  objects  and  activities   of   the

support it receives from foreign organisations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clearly this Bill is not a Bill designed to benefit

any  political party, whether PAP or otherwise.  It is a Bill

that benefits Singapore and Singaporeans.  I think all of  us

in this House and all Singaporeans will agree that foreigners

should  not  attempt  to  influence  the  domestic  political

process through this means of providing funding to any  group

in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Minister for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Community Development and Sports (Mr Abdullah Tarmugi):</b> Sir, swimming is an immensely popular

sport  in  Singapore. In 1998 and 1999, Singaporeans  made  a

total  of 13.2 million visits to our Singapore Sports Council

(SSC)  swimming  complexes. While we are encouraged  by  this

healthy trend, I am very sad indeed to inform the House  that

we  have had two drownings between 1998 and May this year  in

SSC swimming pools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry and the Singapore Sports Council take safety

in  sports very seriously. We need to ensure that the  public

can  engage  actively in sporting activities without  putting

themselves  at  risk  unnecessarily. With  regard  to  public

education on the importance of water safety, the SSC sponsors

the  Singapore  Life  Saving Society  to  organise  talks  on

drowning  prevention and water safety. These talks attract  a

lot  of interest from  pool operators, teachers, students and

also members of the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council has also been actively providing assistance

to  the  Singapore Life Saving Society such  as  letting  its

facilities  at  nominal  cost.  Under this  arrangement,  the

Society  has set up a Lifesaving Training Centre  at  Kallang

Basin Swimming Complex. The Centre actively conducts courses,

tests  and seminars aimed at producing professionally trained

lifesavers in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SSC and the Singapore Life Saving Society will

continue  to  work  together  to conduct  more  water  safety

courses and public education programmes. This will, we  hope,

help make swimming an even safer sport for everyone to enjoy.

various financial assistance offered to Indonesia in terms of

trade  financing  facilities and loans  to  assist  Singapore

Restructuring Agency (IBRA) assets.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (for the Prime Minister):</b> Sir,

in January this year, Prime Minister Goh led an international

business  delegation to Jakarta and announced  a  package  of

economic  measures  to  help  catalyse  Indonesia's  economic

recovery. The principal elements that Mr Zukifli referred  to

are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) A US$500 million Singapore Co-Investment Fund for

the major Singapore Government-linked companies (GLCs) to co-invest  with  other  foreign investors in assets  which  IBRA

wishes   to   dispose,   and   in  other   financially-viable

investments.    We hope that our co-investment  can  help  to

enhance  international confidence in  Indonesia.    To  avoid

creating  the wrong perception that the Singapore  Government

was  profiting  from such sales, the GLCs will  only  take  a

small stake in these assets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A S$400 million loan financing scheme to encourage

Singapore   companies   to  look  for   commercially   viable

opportunities in Indonesia. The scheme is administered by the

Economic  Development Board through participating  Singapore-based banks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March this year, IBRA successfully disposed its stake

in  Astra - an Indonesian car maker, through an open  tender.

The   winning  consortium,  led  by  Singapore's  Cycle   and

Carriage,  included  the Government of  Singapore  Investment

Cooperation (GIC) which invested US$76 million for about a 6%

stake  in the company. The GIC's role in the transaction  was

in  line  with  PM's pledge that Singapore  would  act  as  a

catalyst to enhance investor interest and encourage the  flow

of   investments  into  Indonesia.  The  sale  was   reported

favourably by the international media and both IBRA  and  the

Indonesian Government have noted the positive role played  by

the Singapore Government.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, Temasek Holdings teamed up with two

leading  palm  oil  companies  -  Golden  Agri-Resources  and

Cargill - to own, develop and operate oil palm plantations in

Indonesia. Cargill and Golden Agri-Resources will have  equal

share  in the joint venture while Temasek Holdings will  take

only a minority stake.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the loan financing scheme, a seminar was held in

February to elaborate on the details. It generated a  lot  of

investor  interest at the start. Participating banks received

many  queries. However, to date, the actual take-up rate  has

been  low.  About  S$14 million have been committed  in  four

projects.  Participating banks have  received  feedback  that

investors are adopting a "wait-and-see" attitude, citing  the

country risk involved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our private sector has taken the initiative to conduct

business missions to Indonesia to assess the situation. Early

this  month, the Singapore Confederation of Industries  (SCI)

organised  a mission to Indonesia.  I understand  that  there

was  a fruitful business-matching session with the Indonesian

Chambers  of  Commerce and Industry.  A Business Action  Plan

was  also  signed between the Confederation and the Chambers,

calling for closer cooperation between the two associations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the other elements of our assistance package to

Indonesia,  STB  will continue to implement the  S$2  million

tourism  and marketing package to help Indonesia restart  its

tourism promotion activities. Singapore sponsored Indonesia's

participation  in the PATA (Pacific Asia Travel  Association)

Travel  Mart 2000 in April earlier this year with 17  booths,

showcasing  the  best in Indonesian travel products.  STB  is

currently  working  on  an advertising  campaign  to  promote

Singapore  and Indonesia as complementary destinations.  This

campaign  is scheduled to start in the last quarter  of  this

year.  We  will  also  continue to work with  the  Indonesian

authorities  to enhance the investment possibilities  in  the

Riaus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will continue our efforts to play a catalytic

role to help Indonesia

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>

recover  economically.   We will continue  to  encourage  our

private  sector to look for suitable investment opportunities

that could also help in Indonesia's recovery.  However, their

investment  decisions  will depend  on  the  availability  of

commercially  viable deals, and the  perception of  political

risk.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Indonesia is a strategic

partner.  In view of the low take-up rate, would the Minister

think  it necessary now to consider reviewing this scheme  to

improve  the  take-up rate?  And secondly,  have  there  been

other  requests also because of the low take-up rate  by  the

Indonesian government to come out with new schemes to  review

or refine existing schemes available?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not

think we should rush because private monies are involved here

and  they  have  got  to make realistic  assessments  of  the

situation  in  Indonesia  in  all  its  aspects  -  economic,

political, social.  And while the Government can be  helpful,

the  Government should not be pushing such investments.   Our

role  is  a catalytic one, but in the end, it is for  private

investors to make their own decisions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> I would just like to ask the

Minister  whether  he  could  give  us  the  number  in   the

investment made, in the case of acquisition of Astra and  the

one  did  by  Temasek Holdings.  How much of these facilities

are  used by Temasek Holdings and the other company  that  is

making the investment?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I

mentioned  earlier,  GIC's  investment  in  Astra  was  US$76

million  for  about  a 6% stake in the company.   As  to  the

investment  by  Temasek  in  the  oil  palm  plantations   in

Indonesia, I do not have the number here.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> How much of the estate comes

from the package as offered to the companies investing?  That

means, how much of the money has GIC used in this package?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> I thought I have already given

the number.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> The entire US$76 million.

<div align="center"><b>CURRENCY SWAPS WITH REGIONAL NEIGHBOURS</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Simon S C Tay -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. To ask the Minister for Finance if he will explain

the  nature and extent of Singapore's commitment to  currency

swaps  with  our regional neighbours, following  the  "Chiang

Mai" initiative among ASEAN plus 3 countries, and the effect,

if any, on our reserves.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Question No. 15, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  Singapore has an existing commitment  to  the

ASEAN   Swap  Arrangement,  or  ASA  for  short,  which   was

established  on  5th August 1977, together with  the  central

banks  of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand.

It  is a co-operative financing facility aimed at alleviating

temporary  balance of payments needs among  the  five  member

countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total facility under the ASA amounts to US$200

million, which is to be contributed in equal amounts by  each

participating  member,  that  is  US$40  million  each.   The

participating member is permitted to draw on the facility for

up to a maximum amount of twice their contributions, which is

US$80 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me now to explain a little about the mechanics of

this  swap  arrangement.   A member  country  with  liquidity

problems or needs can exchange or swap its local currency for

US dollars provided by the other member countries of the swap

arrangement.   A  currency swap is effected  through  a  spot

purchase of US dollars against the domestic currency  of  the

borrower, accompanied by a forward sale of US dollars by that

borrower  against the same amount of domestic currency.   The

interest on the swap facility is the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>

difference  between  the  forward and  spot  exchange  rates,

determined  by  the interest rate of the Eurodollar  deposits

for  the relevant period of the Arrangement as quoted by  the

Bank  of International Settlements in Basle, two working days

prior to the value date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A swap transaction shall be for a period of one, two or

three  months,  and  may be renewed once  for  a  maximum  of

another three months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swap facility is made available only to the central

banks  and  monetary  authorities of the participating  ASEAN

countries.  A participant may choose not to participate in  a

swap transaction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Chiang Mai" Initiative was an outcome of the ASEAN

plus three Finance Ministers Meeting held in Thailand in  May

this year, and was in recognition of the need to establish  a

regional   financing   arrangement  to  supplement   existing

international  facilities.  The "Chiang Mai"  initiative  can

essentially be broken down into two parts:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) An expansion of the ASEAN Swap Arrangement to

include all ASEAN countries; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The establishment of a network of bilateral swap

and repurchase agreement facilities among the ASEAN countries

and the plus three countries of China, Japan and the Republic

of Korea.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the details of the Initiative and its

implementation  are not yet finalised, and  are  still  being

worked out by the central bank officials.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay also asked what impact this swap arrangement will

have  on Singapore's reserves.  In short, there will be none.

The  currency  swap  arrangement is a form of  collateralised

short-term loan.  It is no more than a conversion of one form

of  asset  to  another,  that is,  from  US  dollars  to  its

equivalent in another currency, with the commitment that  the

transaction  will  be  reversed  at  a  future  date   at   a

predetermined exchange rate.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>

Thus, there will be no impact on our reserve position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of our close links with our neighbours in the

East Asia region, Singapore is affected by the economic well-being  of their economies.  This was clearly demonstrated  by

the   recent  financial  crisis.   It  is  therefore  in  our

interests  to  do  what  we  can  to  maintain  economic  and

financial   stability  in  the  region.   The  "Chiang   Mai"

initiative is just one step towards this larger goal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Tay Beng Chuan -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. To ask the Minister for Trade and Industry if he

will provide an update on his recent visit to Mexico and  the

progress   of  the  Mexico-Singapore  Free  Trade   Agreement

negotiation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin:</b> Question No. 17, Sir.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in September

last year, President Zedillo and Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong

agreed  to  explore a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between  our

two  countries.   Subsequently, in February  this  year,  the

Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry  of  Singapore   and   the

Secretariat  of Commerce and Industrial Development  (SECOFI)

of Mexico agreed that negotiations would begin in July.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two main purposes to my recent trip to

Mexico.   First,  to open Singapore's first trade  office  in

Latin  America.  This is in recognition of the  closer  trade

links  between  Mexico and Singapore and  the  potential  for

greater  expansion in the future.  Over the last  ten  years,

trade  between Singapore and Mexico increased by  an  average

rate of over 30% a year, reaching $2.2 billion last year.  In

1998,  Mexico exported more electronics products to Singapore

than to the rest of East Asia, including China, Korea, Japan,

Hong Kong and Taiwan combined.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second purpose of my trip was to deliver a personal

letter  of  invitation from Prime Minister Goh  to  President

Zedillo  to visit Singapore in November before he steps  down

at the end of the year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also met with my counterpart Minister, Dr Herminio

Blanco.   Dr  Blanco  and  I agreed that  we  should  try  to

complete our negotiations for an FTA by November, in time for

Prime  Minister  Goh  and President Zedillo  to  witness  its

signing when the President is in South East Asia for the APEC

Leaders'  Meeting.  However, we may not be able  to  complete

negotiations  within this short time frame.  If  negotiations

cannot  be  completed by then, Dr Blanco and I  will  sign  a

document  listing the areas that our negotiators have  agreed

on   and   expressing  our  common  intention   to   complete

negotiations  by the middle of next year when a  new  Mexican

administration has been in office for a number of months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the candidate of the present ruling party wins, there

will of course be continuity.  I have taken the precaution of

sounding out the principal opposition

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>

candidate  from PAN.  He has expressed his full  support  for

the FTA.  Elections are due this weekend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key businessmen and representatives from the

business associations we met in Mexico also expressed general

support  for  the FTA.  While there were some concerns  about

the  impact  of  the FTA on specific domestic sectors,  these

concerns  arose  from  a lack of knowledge  about  Singapore.

Fundamentally,  Singapore  poses no  threat  to  politically-sensitive sectors in Mexico like steel and textiles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will negotiate an Investment Guarantee Agreement as

part of the FTA to facilitate Singapore investment in Mexico.

While  our  present  investment in  Mexico,  which  currently

amounts  to  US$133  million, is small  in  relation  to  our

investment  in  Asia,  it has grown significantly  in  recent

years.   The  Mexicans  are very keen to  have  more  of  our

businessmen invest in Mexico to take advantage of NAFTA.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strategically, we see Mexico as our gateway into Latin

America  and  we  hope that Singapore can be  a  gateway  for

Mexico into Asia.

at  Bukit Batok West Avenue 5 after the Hillview SERS lessees

and flat tenants have selected their new replacement flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the above, there are already several

schemes  which  enable parents and married children  to  live

near each other.  For example, SERS lessees may include their

parents or their married child in the application for  a  new

replacement flat so that they can stay together  in  the  new

flat as an extended family.  First-timer flat applicants  may

also  apply  to  the  HDB for the $40,000 CPF  Housing  Grant

Scheme  to  buy a resale flat to live near their  parents  or

opportunity  to  claim pension benefits under the  CPF-Annual

Allowance  Gratuity Option as they will no  longer  be  civil

servants  when they retire at the compulsory retirement  age.

This  policy  has  been  applied  consistently  in  all  past

conversion exercises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPF-AA Gratuity Option is not an entitlement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if the Government

will  consider a more moderate across-the-board  increase  in

the salary revision for civil servants, in order not to drive

there  are  further liberalization policies to  open  up  the

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, MAS' view on bank

consolidation  remains unchanged - that the Singapore  market

is  too small to support more than two major local banks, and

that  further  consolidation and mergers will help  banks  to

achieve economies of scale and compete internationally, or at

least regionally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the decision to merge has to be made by

the  local banks' managements and shareholders.  MAS can only

encourage,  not  dictate.  There have been no  moves  by  the

local  banks to merge so far.  As competition intensifies  in

the  banking industry, through the progress of technology and

our  liberalisation  measures,  the  pressure  on  banks   to

consolidate  and rationalise will grow. Alternatively,  banks

can choose to become niche players in specific segments.

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL SERVICE NWC AWARD, PUBLIC SECTOR SALARY REVISIONS,</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AND REVIEW OF SALARY BENCHMARKS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on the Deputy Prime Minister's

Statement [29th June 2000].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to support this pay rise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prevailing local conditions of CPF cuts, widening

wage  gap between the top income earners and the lower income

earners, higher transport and utilities costs make the upward

pay revision debate of all political appointees and top civil

servants  very  embarrassing.  Yet,  globalisation  and  fast

changing  technology require us to move quickly to  meet  the

new  challenges.   Thus, the urgent need to  retain  talented

people  in the civil service and the political arena to  take

our  country into the very competitive world markets.  We are

in Government to provide

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>

the ambience for the private sector to create wealth and jobs

for Singaporeans.  We must pay them well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, many in the House were revisiting many old

arguments  on  why politicians must put service before  self,

and  I  agree.  But the discussion should be centred,  in  my

opinion,  on  whether the changes made to the  two  benchmark

formulae  will be able to meet the changing wage  pattern  in

the years to come.  We will debate on these equally important

issues  at  a later date, or we may lose sight of  the  topic

under review.  I know it is difficult to de-link, but we must

try.   So with this as the background, we have to ask whether

we  are  comfortable  with the revision in  the  remuneration

package and can we avoid the situation we are facing now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think today's debate is not why top civil servants and

political  appointees should be paid well.   This  issue  was

argued  in this House during the last debate on the  subject.

We  agreed and we discussed how best we could pay them.   And

it  was in that debate that the current two benchmarks, 15P32

and  2/3  average  24, were thoroughly discussed  and  agreed

upon,  some  grudgingly.  I remember SM  said  that  once  we

agreed  on  the formula, we need not come back to this  House

again  to  discuss this politically emotive  issue.   But  we

could not achieve this because of two changes taking place in

the  world.   One  is  the new economy  companies,  including

dot.coms  and  life  sciences.  Their  remunerations  do  not

follow  the  norm.   Second,  stock  option  is  becoming  an

accepted  way of rewarding the top executives.  This  portion

of  reward  far exceeds their basic salary.  How  we  address

these two will be a challenge for us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15P32 apparently is working well. But I am not so sure

how  long  it  needs another review, seeing the  big  numbers

coming  from the United States corporate remunerations.   For

example,  let me give you some idea.  Last year, US CEOs,  on

average,  earned an incredible 475 times more than  what  the

workers  did.  If you compare this to 84 times  in  the  year

1990,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>

it  is  a  very  big jump.  We may not see  such  figures  in

Singapore  yet.  But we tend to follow the US trend.   Today,

the  average  Singapore  CEO earns 44  times  more  than  the

average worker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DPM has proposed three changes. The first one is to put

more  numbers in the basket of top earners, that is, increase

to  eight, instead of the present four top earners in the six

categories  -  banking, accountancy, law, engineering,  local

manufacturing and multinational companies.  The second change

is  to rank these 48 top earners in these categories and take

the  median.  And third, stock options, a portion of the 48th

top earners be divided by two, that is, accept only 50%.  The

two  points of increasing the pool of top earners to  48  and

taking the median as a reference base definitely improves the

formula.  But, again as before, it fails to address the point

that  these 48 top earners change every year.  This has  been

brought up a couple of times by other Members of Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question some are asking is, as long as the pay of

the  48  top  earners in the private sector  keeps  changing,

Ministers'  pay  will always receive an  upward  revision  of

their  pay, as experienced in the recession years.  To  many,

this  is  a  win-win situation.  Is there a  reason  for  not

changing?   Perhaps, DPM would want to consider keeping  half

of  the 48, that is, 24 top earners permanent and rotate  the

rest.   This could be a compromised move to reflect the truer

comparison  as the same cohort of 24 is used for every  year.

The  ideal  of course is to use the same cohort  of  48  each

year.  It is only a suggestion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new economy, the salaries of top CEOs will

continue  to  go  up  as  the  salaries  are  based  on   the

individual's worth and not on good or bad years.  If we  take

the  cue from the US again, in 1994, the US CEOs made  US$2.8

million.   Last  year, the average CEO of large  corporations

earned  US$12.4  million.  As Singapore is 12  to  18  months

behind  the US, we can expect next year's salary of our  CEOs

to  follow suit and a corresponding increase of our top civil

servants and political appointees.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large portion of pay package could come from stock

options.   Thus,  halving  the amount  of  the  stock  option

portion, as suggested in the new formula, may be very high in

the  coming  years.   I therefore suggest  that  we  consider

putting  a cap on this.  One suggestion is to use the present

stock  option portion of this revised formula as a  benchmark

to  work  out a figure on this.  In yesterday's DPM's speech,

he said, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Executives may exercise in a single year stock options

which they have accumulated over several years, especially in

a  bull  market.  To accept the full amount of  stock  option

gains  without  any  discount is unfair  and  will  skew  the

benchmark upwards."



Therefore, my suggestion for a cap is reasonable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Singaporeans are not aware that the Minister's

salary  is a total package.  Many Singaporeans do not realise

this.   There  are no perks, like car, driver,  house,  maid,

medical benefits, etc, and that the bonuses form part of  the

pay package.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have made a few suggestions which I

hope DPM will consider.  I support this revision in salaries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Mr Speaker, I rise to

support  this statement and wish to compliment  DPM  for  the

transparent   manner  in  which  this  issue  was   proposed.

Inevitably, the transparent manner of discussing this  matter

will generate discussion and debate.  Even in private sector,

discussions   on  salaries  and  remuneration   are   usually

sensitive  and  touchy.  In a small country, like  Singapore,

where  everybody knows everybody, you cannot avoid this issue

being personalised.  This, I think, will remain for some time

an unavoidable outcome to this issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, since this was announced yesterday, I asked a

number  of  people whether it is too much to  pay  the  Prime

Minister  about  $1.9  million or $34  million  annually  for

elected  Members of this House.  Most really do not know  how

much is enough.  But they agree that the Prime Minister,  for

example, should be paid a very high

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>

salary  for  the job he is doing.  In fact, some are  puzzled

that,  despite  the  increase, the Prime  Minister  is  still

ranked 63rd among top salary earners.  Many have no qualms to

have  our  Prime  Minister being the highest paid  among  top

professionals.   This shows that Singaporeans now  understand

that  we need to pay the best to attract the brightest to  do

what is seen as the most important job in this country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, there are problems, especially with

benchmarking  civil service salaries with the private  sector

and this can be problematic.  It is quite clear that most top

jobs in the private sector carry a high level and element  of

uncertainty   in  a  hire-and-fire  environment.    For   the

Minister,  some  said  that  at least  he  gets  a  five-year

contract  before his next election, a luxury  private  sector

executives do not enjoy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the salary review has been very comprehensive and,

in  my  view,  quite  revolutionary,  as  it  has  even  made

Permanent Secretaries non-permanent, it will be difficult  to

avoid  or  eradicate completely, like DPM said,  the  "hentak

kaki"  mentality,  in  a large organisation  like  the  civil

service.  We need to consider a number of things.   While  we

have  a  transparent system of paying top  wages  to  attract

talents into the civil service, we seem to have less  than  a

transparent  system in dealing with non-performers.   With  a

large  organisation like the civil service, we  can  possibly

have  a  free rider situation.  We therefore need to be  more

comprehensive in the scrutiny and management of those who are

not performing well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see this as a problem of political office

holders as they are more visible but the same cannot be  said

of  civil servants who are generally and sometimes seen to be

insulated from blame and problems.  Second, there is also the

time  lag problem which has made it necessary to have  salary

or  wage increase even at a time when private sector salaries

are  just coming out of a recession.  Perhaps, one suggestion

is to appoint a group of search

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>

firms  tasked to recommend salaries consistent with  formulas

that  have  been established. This is a practice  adopted  by

many  in  major MNCs and can similarly be done  to  determine

civil service salaries. Such firms can be more responsive and

therefore close the time lag problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another benefit to this, that is, you have a

third  party  telling you what is the going market  rate  for

these professionals which would make it easier to handle this

issue, because some feel that even if salaries are pegged  at

much higher levels today, the overwhelming majority that  the

PAP has in this House will make this a foregone conclusion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem you have is that when you provide a

range of salaries for certain categories of the same grade in

the  civil  service,  the number of people  you  can  compare

within  that  same  grade is far too  small  to  provide  any

meaningful competition as in the case of private sector where

there are a lot more competition and similar types of jobs in

other  companies.   Therefore, I  think  the  appointment  of

search firms may be relevant in this case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am, however, concerned about one possible unintended

consequence of this whole exercise and, that is,  whether  it

will  affect  the  moral  authority  of  civil  servants  and

political office bearers to govern because moral authority is

extremely  important.  I travel in the  region  almost  every

week  and have discovered the deep and wide respect that this

Government enjoys, not only in Singapore but also outside the

region and, partially, this has got to do with the fact  that

previous  office holders have demonstrated a level  of  self-sacrifice  when it comes to their own wages and remuneration.

I am also aware that we have existing procedures and policies

of  existing office holders who exercise restraint in  making

investments or getting themselves involved in other kinds  of

jobs.   I think this is something that we need to make  clear

and  something which we need to guard against  to  make  sure

that  while we pay top wages to our office holders, they  are

not seen to also compromise on the other investments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in this particular instance, I think political

office  bearers  are visible, they can be seen,  people  know

what  they do, where they go, where they live, what car  they

drive. But the same cannot be said for civil servants.   That

is  where  we need to be more careful and have provisions  to

avoid  such  conflicts instituted and not be the  subject  of

abuse.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, Sir, I would like to again reiterate my

support for the statement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tang Guan Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Tang Guan Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): It is

often  said that touching on the subject of money would  hurt

inter-personal relationship.  Even in a company, some  people

would  be unhappy if one of their colleagues gets a pay raise

of  only  $50  or  $100.  We are now talking  about  the  pay

increases of our Ministers.  Thus, we have to take more pains

in explaining this matter to the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many governments do not publicly discuss pay increases

for ministers, especially in countries where the ruling party

is  weak. The ruling party is worried that it might be  voted

out.  Other  governments  do not  discuss  this  because  the

country  cannot  afford higher pay for  its  ministers.   The

result is a less than clean government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is unique. Firstly, we discuss the issue of

ministers'  pay  openly.  The Government  takes  a  long-term

approach  to this issue because we want to maintain  a  first

class government with first class efficiency.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, our system is highly transparent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people ask why we are so transparent about the high

salaries of our Ministers.  There are many other easier  ways

to  compensate  them  and to supplement their  salaries,  for

example, giving them housing allowances, providing them  with

a  chauffeur  or  a maid.  The Government can  also  increase

their  salaries quietly through promotion.  If  we  do  that,

things  would have been much easier.  However, it is not  the

style of the Government to do that.  We want to lay

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>

everything  on  the  table and allow  even  the  formula  for

calculating Ministers' salaries to be brought up  for  public

scrutiny.   This  is a very honest way of  dealing  with  the

matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we discuss this issue, my view is that the emphasis

should   be  on  how  to  establish  a  system  to  determine

ministers'  salaries rather than focusing on  the  individual

minister's  salary.  I think this would make our  discussions

more objective and rational.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers and top civil servants are charged with the

very heavy responsibility of improving the standard of living

for  Singaporeans.  We have to establish a system so that the

Government  and  the  civil  service  can  attract  the  best

talents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The achievements of our Government are for all to

see.  There is no need for us to blow our own trumpet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I had a conversation with an Ambassador of a

foreign  country.  She told me that in the past three  years,

there  were  two things in Singapore that left  a  very  deep

impression  on her.  First, during the financial crisis,  the

Government  had time and again devised strategies  to  tackle

the  recession,  and  eventually led  Singapore  out  of  the

recession  -  the  first country in this  region  to  do  so.

Secondly, while we were dealing with the recession,  we  also

made  preparations to face the challenges of the new economy,

that is, to plan for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I spoke to a couple of Hong Kong entrepreneurs

and  they told me the property market in Hong Kong had fallen

drastically.  This had caused a lot of unhappiness among  the

people  and  many  of  them  had  taken  to  the  streets  to

demonstrate   against  the  government.   These   Hong   Kong

entrepreneurs asked me how Singapore managed to prevent  such

a  predicament.  I told them that in Singapore, the political

leadership  had anticipated the problem of `over-heating'  of

the  property market and introduced some timely  measures  to

cool down the situation in the property market.  This is  the

difference between Singapore and Hong Kong.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, PERC, an independent think tank

based in Hong Kong, in its report in May, rated the Singapore

Government as number one in terms of political leadership and

economic policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we should not look at the revision of Ministers'

salaries  in  an  isolated manner.   We  have  to  take  into

consideration  the  various factors in  the  public  and  the

private  sectors.   We are now in the midst  of  transforming

into  a new economy.  There are many attractions for talented

young  people to go into the private sector.  This bodes  ill

for  the public sector in the long term.  On the other  hand,

if the salaries in the public sector are much more attractive

than in the private sector, it is also not an ideal situation

because  the  private sector might be weakened as  a  result.

Between  these two sectors, we have to maintain a balance  so

that  there  will be a free flow of talents. They  should  be

able to move from the public sector to the private sector and

vice  versa.   We  want to have first-class  talents  in  the

public  sector so as to help formulate and implement policies

as  these policies will affect the private sector and all the

people of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the relationship between the political leaders

and the civil servants, let me share this story with members.

Recently, I attended an international conference where I  met

a  delegate  from an economy whose government was just  newly

elected.   I  asked him about his government's  new  economic

policies.   He told me that the new government had  only  two

priorities - one was environmental protection and  the  other

was  to  please the workers.  As for how to promote  economic

development, the new government had no ideas at all.  He said

that  civil  servants were facing big problems.   This  shows

that  if the political leaders are weak, the government  will

not  be able to function satisfactorily even if you have good

civil  servants.  The ideal situation is where the  political

leaders are more far-sighted and more capable than the  civil

servants.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to talk about the relationship

between  the  political leadership and  the  private  sector.

Yesterday,  some  MPs opined that the risks  in  the  private

sector are higher.  Of course, there are risks in the private

sector.   Ministers  also face high risks,  though  different

types of risks.  As for the responsibility that they hold,  I

think  no  one will have any doubt that theirs are very  much

heavier.  They have to care for 3 million Singaporeans, their

employment, their education and their future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In times of peace and prosperity, we will not appreciate

the  important  roles  played by the Ministers.   Only  in  a

crisis  will  we  realise the importance  of  having  a  good

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The political leadership, the civil service and the

private  sector  should maintain a balanced  relationship  so

that  there  can  be mobility among talents  in  these  three

sectors.  We have a very limited pool of talents.  If we  can

work  out a salary formula, which can facilitate the flow  of

talents  among  these  three  sectors,  it  will  be  to  the

advantage of our country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing formula will be replaced by a new formula.

The  new  formula is to take the 48 top earners  in  the  six

selected  professions  and to use the  median  point  of  the

income  as  a  benchmark.  The ministers'  salaries  will  be

pegged  at  two-thirds  of the benchmark.   Compared  to  the

existing  formula, this is an improvement.  This  shows  that

the  Government is prepared to review the agreed  formula  to

suit  new  circumstances.  There is one common characteristic

in  these two formulae - the discounting factor.  Now, we are

using  two-thirds.  Should it be lower or higher?  A decision

has  to be made.  Deputy Prime Minister has surfaced this new

formula for us to discuss.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that there should be flexibility in the formula,

so that even in changed circumstances, it can be adjusted and

be accepted by most people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is not the best time to raise the issue

of pay increases for Ministers and civil servants.  This is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>

because the cut in employers' CPF contributions has not  been

fully  restored yet and there have been increases in  utility

charges, taxi fares, etc of late.  So a lot of effort has  to

be made to convince the people to accept this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this connection, I hope that the Government will

pay  special attention to the following matters.  Firstly  is

wage cost.  Will the pay increases result in a chain reaction

that  triggers  off  an  escalation in the  private  sector's

salaries?    If   wage   cost   is   increased,   will    our

competitiveness be eroded?  Secondly, will this result  in  a

chain  of price increases and push up inflation?  Thirdly,  I

hope  that  the  Government  will  continue  with  the  asset

enhancement programmes so that all Singaporeans will be  able

to enjoy the fruits of our economic success.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  principle  of  pegging Ministers'  and  top  civil

servants' pay to that of the top earners  in the private sector was

debated in this  House  in 1994.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My stand on the matter remains unchanged. I do not

agree  with the principle in the White Paper.  In my opinion,

those who decide to take up politics and those who decide  to

earn  more  money for themselves are two distinctly different

categories  of  people.   If you  want  to  peg  the  pay  of

political  appointees  like Ministers,  Ministers  of  State,

etc., to the top earners in the private sector, and say  that

without  doing so,  you would not be able to attract suitable

talents into politics is virtually degrading the politicians'

noble spirit of serving the nation and serving the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that times have changed. We should be more

realistic  and look at this issue from the point of  view  of

market  economy.   But we all know that governing  a  country

with the national resources as its backing and doing business

with   one's   private  capital  are  two  different   things

altogether.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector faces market competition, even

competition  in  the  international market.   Among  the  top

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>

earners in the private sector, some are owners of enterprises

and some are salaried employees.  But do not forget that even

world-class  banks  can collapse and  close  down!   The  PAP

Government does not own Singapore, neither are the Ministers'

salaried employees.  They rule the country on a mandate given

to  them by the people after a general election.   Once  they

are  in  power, they can put to use the assets of the  State.

They  enjoy great power to decide everything.  They can  also

formulate and implement all sorts of policies to ensure  that

they can be returned safely at the next general election.  In

Singapore,  competition  in  the  election  market  is   very

limited.  As such, although both can be described as markets,

there is a vast difference between them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the electors in Singapore have elected the PAP to

form  the  Government to rule the country, the PAP Government

can  decide how much their Ministers are worth.  Is it asking

for the sky?  It is left to the people to judge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, the Government does not have to go through all

the  trouble, using  all kinds of computation methods  to peg

the  Ministers' salaries  to the top earners in  the  private

sector,  just  to  justify the amounts they are  asking  for.

There  is no need to use the income of the top 24 or  top  48

earners  in  the  country  as a benchmark  to  calculate  the

Ministers' salaries.   They might as well put it in a  simple

and  straightforward manner and say the Ministers need to  be

paid  how  many  hundreds of thousands of  dollars  a  month,

otherwise the Ministers would not have enough money to use!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the civil servants' salaries, I believe

there  is  just a very small number of senior civil  servants

who  are  going  to  receive substantial  pay  rise  in  this

exercise.  Thanks to the Ministers, they are given these  pay

increases  to  avoid having a big gap between their  salaries

and  those of the Ministers, lest it may be difficult for the

Cabinet to account for it.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government says that it is transparent and the

Ministers'  salary  system  is  also  transparent.   But  the

information   provided  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister   in

Parliament yesterday was not transparent enough.  May  I  ask

whether the Ministers' salaries as reflected in Handout 2 are

only  the basic salaries under the Ministers' salary  system?

I would like to request the Deputy Prime Minister to disclose

the  full  information on the gross salaries of the political

office-holders and the civil servants of the various  grades,

including the various variable components, bonuses and  other

allowances payable to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we must not forget that the people of

Singapore  are  paying a high price to engage this  batch  of

talents  to  become Ministers.  We sincerely  hope  that  the

return received by the people will not be mere peanuts.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I am much obliged

to you for allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, we debated on the disparity of incomes of

Singaporeans.  The lowest 10% of our workers were reported to

be  earning as low as $133 a month.   The Minister said  that

the Straits Times had made a mistake in its report.  Assuming

that there were mistakes in that report and we correct it  by

doubling  the  reported wage of $133 to $266  a  month,  then

rounding it off to $300 a month.  Even at $300 a month,  that

is  a  very low income.  A man can barely survive on  $300  a

month these days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am certain that Ministers must be aware that

there are Singaporeans who are barely scraping the bottom  of

the  barrel  to  make  a living.  Does  it  not  prick  their

conscience then when they themselves ask for high salaries at

over  a  million  dollars a year?    If we take  the  average

worker's wages at $2,000 a month or $24,000 a year,  and  the

Minister's  salary at $1.4 million a year, then the  Minister

is  earning  something  like 60 times more  than  an  average

worker  in Singapore.  It means that  for a Minister to  work

for one year, the average worker in Singapore has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>

to  slog for his lifetime for 60 years.  This, to me, somehow

does not look right.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers are supposed to be servants of the people.

They  are  to  take  care of the people and  to  give  public

service to lead the people, particularly by example.  How can

our  Ministers have the moral authority when they take  their

posts  purely  on  the  profit motive  by  asking  such  high

salaries?  At the moment, our Ministers are paid the  highest

salaries  in the world, more than Presidents, Prime Ministers

and  Ministers  of  other bigger and  richer  countries  than

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In America, President Clinton is paid about S$630,000 a

year, half of what our Ministers get and one-third of that of

our  Prime Minister.  I believe the work of the President  of

the  United  States  is definitely more  difficult  and  more

onerous  than that of any of the Ministers and Prime Minister

in Singapore.  Yet, they can live quite comfortably on a much

lower  salary than our Ministers and Prime Minister.   It  is

not that America is poorer than Singapore.  It is not that it

is  unable to pay its President well.  If they wanted to, the

Americans  can  afford to pay their President three  or  even

four  times more than the Prime Minister in Singapore.   They

certainly  can  afford  to do so, since  it  is  the  richest

country  in  the  world.   In fact, a  few  of  the  American

companies earn more money a year than the whole of Singapore.

Yet,  the Americans choose not to pay the President and their

Ministers high salaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is: why do Americans choose not to pay

their President and the Ministers high salaries, as Singapore

is  doing?  The reason is that the Americans feel that  those

who  aspire to take up public office must have an element  of

sacrifice.   It  must be seen that those who take  up  public

office  are  there to serve the public, and  not  to  make  a

profit  out of that office.  The President and his  Ministers

will  then  have  the  moral authority  to  lead.   They  are

basically there to serve the people and not to make money out

of their office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Americans are right on that point. We must

not scoff at American

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>

values.   That country has not only survived over 200  years,

over two world wars, but has become the most powerful and the

richest nation in the world.  There must be something that we

can learn from the Americans in regard to the way they reward

their  President and their Ministers.  I hope  Singapore  and

its Ministers shall take note of that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not envious of the high salaries paid to the

Ministers.   My concern is more for the future of  Singapore.

What sort of values should we set for young Singaporeans?  On

the one hand, leaders of Singapore urge the people to be more

communitarian  and not to be so self-centred, individualistic

and care only for oneself.  But, on the other hand, where the

Ministers' salaries are concerned, they do not believe in the

communitarian way.  The Ministers want their salaries  to  be

pegged  to  the private sector's high earners.   The  private

sector's  motivation is on profit.  Private  sector  earnings

and  level  of  salaries are entirely  based  on  profit  and

earnings.  Whereas on the part of Ministers, their motivation

is  not  profit  orientated  but  on  nation  building.   The

Ministers  then  should not be asking for salaries  based  on

high  earners in the private sector, but should be  based  on

other principles.  I think the fairest way is to ask how much

a Minister needs to have a comfortable life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debate on the White Paper on Ministers' salaries in

1994, I told the House that I estimated that about $50,000  a

month  should  give  a Minister a comfortable  living   -   a

bungalow house, servants, two motorcars and with a chauffeur,

annual  holidays and children's education.  I note  that  NMP

Walter Woon in the same debate also proposed a similar figure

of  about  $50,000 a month or $600,000 a year.  He said  that

could be a base on which the Ministers could work.  I tend to

agree with Dr Woon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that as long as the Ministers are given a

dignified  comfortable  standard of  living  that  should  be

enough.   That should be the criterion.  We cannot factor  in

the  profit element.  The profit element is a private  sector

practice and should not be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>

followed  because  the Ministers are not  running  a  private

company.  They are running a country, a nation, hopefully, in

our  case.   They are leaders of the people and  they  should

lead  by  example.  If our leaders show our people that  they

are  there in public positions and claim for themselves  huge

profits,  the wrong signals shall definitely be sent  to  all

Singaporeans,  including our young Singaporeans.  They  shall

become  cynical  and  the only thing that  concerns  them  is

money.  In fact, if money is the only motivation why one does

a certain job, that person shall not do that job well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the great achievers in the world. When asked

why  they  take on that job or do that thing which  they  are

good  at, the answers are inevitably not the great amount  of

money  they can earn, but the love of their job or the things

they  are  doing.  For example, when Michael Chang and  Boris

Becker,  world famous tennis players from America and Germany

respectively,  were  asked why they  devote  their  lives  to

playing tennis, they said that they love the game and not the

millions of dollars they can earn or have earned.  Similarly,

if  Ministers  really love their job and want  to  serve  the

people well, they should not be asking for high salaries.  By

asking  for  high salaries, they are giving wrong signals  to

Singaporeans that they do not love their job but for the huge

profits that they can earn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speakers in this debate and the debate on the White

Paper in 1994 had commented on the unfairness of pegging  the

Ministers' salaries to the six highest earners in a  selected

group  of  professions  in the private  sector.   The  reason

mainly  is  that  the private sector of  the  same  group  of

persons may not be drawing the same salaries in the following

year and also that they are taking bigger risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more equitable method is to peg our Ministers'

salaries  to  the world leaders of other countries.   A  good

example  is to take the President of the United States  as  a

base  for  which  we can work on.  I do not  think  that  our

Ministers  will  complain  on that.  We  should  compare  the

salaries paid to those in the public service in Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>

to  those  in the public service of other renowned  countries

and  not compare the public sector salary with those  in  the

private  sector.   The public sector and the  private  sector

cannot   be  compared  because  the  two  are  motivated   by

completely different reasons.  One is for public good and the

other  is  purely for profit.  The two cannot be  reconciled.

Therefore,  public  sector salaries cannot  use  the  private

sector salaries as a benchmark.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had read a report in the Hansard where Members of

Parliament  in  England  were debating  on  the  increase  of

Members'  allowances.  Almost each of the Members  there  who

rose  to  speak began by saying how embarrassed they were  on

speaking of the increase of their own remuneration.   It  can

be  seen from that debate in England that the values  of  the

English   parliamentarians  are  different  from   those   in

Singapore.  Over in England, the parliamentarians there  were

terribly  embarrassed when they were speaking on the increase

of  their own pay.  One notes that it is not so in Singapore.

The  Ministers  in  Singapore have affirmed confidently  that

they  have a right to be paid the proposed high salaries  and

are  not  a bit embarrassed by it.  This is an observation  I

note  in  the difference of attitudes and values between  the

Singapore Parliament and the English Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would just like to state what I heard

last  night  at  my meet-the-people session.  One  grassroots

member,  on hearing the revision of the Ministers'  salaries,

said,  "Wow, can buy a house every year."  Another  remarked,

"Just like striking a lottery each year."

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Goh Chok Tong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

Singapore  is not the United States.  The US has a population

of  280  million people. We only have a population  of  three

million.  The US is a huge country.  We are just a little red

dot.  So running Singapore, I believe, is much more hazardous

and  difficult than running the United States.  In Singapore,

people will require a good government much

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>

more  than the Americans will require a good government.   If

the Government does not run Singapore well, the whole country

can disappear.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1966, the Government sent me to study Development

Economics  in Williams College in the US.  It was  a  special

course for officials from developing countries.  I was then a

young officer working in the Economic Planning Unit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My class of 20 came from 16 different countries in Asia,

Africa,  Latin  America and southern Europe. We  were  taught

theories  of  economic development, quantitative  programming

and  other useful subjects.  But what we were not taught  was

the  importance  of  good government as a  pre-condition  for

sustained economic development.  This was assumed.  But alas,

it  was an assumption that did not hold true for most of  the

countries  represented in my class.   What  has  happened  to

these  countries  since  then is instructive.   For  example,

three  of  the countries have broken up - Pakistan,  Ethiopia

and  Yugoslavia.  Nine countries have experienced civil wars,

social  upheavals  or violent changes of government  at  some

stage  in  the  last  35 years - Philippines,  India,  Egypt,

Uganda,  Liberia,  Mexico, Colombia,  Bolivia  and  Honduras.

That leaves only four countries out of the 16 represented  in

my  class  without  severe political and social  upheavals  - Kenya,  Tanzania, Malaysia and Singapore.  Kenya and Tanzania

are not exactly models of economic growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were to do a Ph.D, I would study the relationship

between  economic development and the quality of  government.

Empirically, there is clearly a close correlation between the

economic  performance of a country and  the  quality  of  its

government.   The more competent the government,  the  higher

the  economic growth of the country when measured over a long

period of time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, of course, other reasons why some countries

do  better than others, why their economies grow faster,  why

their people enjoy a higher standard of living, and why  they

have peace and stability.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>

These  include  a country's natural resources, its  location,

and  its  people.  All these are important factors no  doubt,

but  I  believe  my Ph.D thesis will conclude that  the  most

important factor behind a country's economic performance  and

the  standard  of living it can provide its  people,  is  the

quality of the political leaders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much wisdom in an old saying that an army of

sheep led by a lion is stronger than an army of lions led  by

a sheep.  The former will function as an effective unit.  The

latter will end up with the lions fighting amongst themselves

and  the  sheep being eaten.  People are no different.   They

have  to  be led.  A people led by a superior government  can

produce  exceptional  results.  On the other  hand,  an  able

people  led  by  a  mediocre  government  will  underperform.

Worse, if they are led by a fanatical government which  fears

being challenged, clever people might even lose their heads.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cambodia is a tragic example. Pol Pot and his Khmer

Rouge killed off millions of their own people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uganda is another example. Under Idi Amin, it lost many

of  its  talents.  My friend from Williams College, a  native

Ugandan, had to flee the country.  Ugandans of Indian  origin

who  ran the economy were chased out.  Today, 21 years  after

the  end of Idi Amin's reign, Uganda is still suffering  from

his misrule.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;India has millions of talented people. Silicon Valley

is  full  of  Indians.  Indian Singaporeans have  contributed

significantly to our development.  Yet India remains  a  poor

country.   It  is  weighed down by a bureaucratic  leadership

that prevents India from performing to its full potential.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that India is capable of achieving much more.

When I was in India in January this year, I put this question

to several Indian leaders when we discussed the importance of

talents.  To what extent of its potential is India performing

today?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their estimate was 30 to 40 percent.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Good Government</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different people will have different definitions of a

good government.  My own criteria for a good government are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) It must be honest, fair and just.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) It must be capable of forging national consensus and

social  cohesion, and willing to take painful  decisions  for

the overall good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) It must be able to anticipate the future to head off

problems   and   be   nimble  enough  to  adapt   and   seize

opportunities when circumstances change.  In times of crises,

it must be resourceful enough to overcome them.  And,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) It must be able to improve the standard of living of

its  people,  maximize their potential and  involve  them  in

building a better society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have led this Government for 10 years now. How it has

performed is for you to judge, by my criteria or by  whatever

criteria   you   choose.   In  particular,   scrutinize   our

performance in the last five years from the time we argued in

this  House  that Ministers and civil servants must  be  paid

market-based  wages.  Has the performance  of  my  Government

justified its wage?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compare the salaries of Ministers and senior civil

servants  with  the benefits you receive from having  a  good

government.   Look at it from the viewpoint of results,  that

is, the value of output and not the cost of inputs alone.  It

is  the results which are important.  What you get out of it,

not  the  cost of inputs alone.  Has my Government given  you

"safe  homes,  stable  jobs and fuel  to  dream  of  all  the

tomorrows?", as a member of the public put it.  She wrote  to

express  her  appreciation for my "keeping the  country  well

oiled  and  well run". "Safe homes, stable jobs and  fuel  to

dream of all the tomorrows?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might not have systematically evaluated the

performance   of   the   Singapore   Government,   but   many

international consultancies have.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to refer to some of these professional

third-party  evaluations, not to blow our  trumpets,  but  to

underline the value of a good government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Singapore's economic competitiveness. This year,

for the seventh year running, the International Institute for

Management  Development in its annual  World  Competitiveness

Yearbook ranked Singapore the world's second most competitive

economy after the US.  Another think-tank, the World Economic

Forum,  thinks  we  have done better.   In  its  1999  Global

Competitiveness Report, it ranked Singapore  as  the  world's

most competitive economy for the fourth year in a row.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both analyses regard the effectiveness of government

policies  as  a  key  factor  contributing  to  the   overall

competitiveness  of a country.  In the World  Competitiveness

Yearbook,  Singapore came out first on the  extent  to  which

government policies are conducive to competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Global Competitiveness Yearbook, Singapore was

also  ranked  first  in  many areas of government,  including

economic policies and public sector competence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Straits Times and Zaobao recently carried a survey

by  the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) on the

quality  of  various Asian governments.  The report  by  PERC

showed  Singapore  to  have  the best  quality  of  political

leadership  among  the major economies of Asia.   Singapore's

economic  policies were also deemed to be the most effective.

The  PERC report said, "A nation's per capita GDP is  a  good

example  of  the  effectiveness of a particular  government's

economic policies."  It goes on to say that if it were to  go

back fifty years and pick those countries of Asia which would

be  dominant  economies  today,  Singapore  would  have  been

considered an economic backwater compared to places  such  as

Manila.   But  Marcos rode the Philippine  economy  into  the

ground,  whereas  Senior  Minister guided  Singapore  to  our

achievements today in an "amazingly short period of time."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another PERC-produced report in March, Asian

Intelligence,   also  reported  that  its   respondents   had

"consistently  rated  Singapore as having  one  of  the  best

bureaucracies  in the region" and that "Singapore  is  widely

regarded  as  a  place where things get done,  and  get  done

efficiently."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is not only in the area of economic policy that

international  analysts have rated the  Singapore  Government

highly.   In "The Economic Freedom of the World: 2000  Annual

Report", published by the CATO Institute in Washington DC and

Canada's  Fraser Institute, Singapore scored full  marks  for

its   legal   structure  and  property  rights.   In   PERC's

Comparative  Country  Risk Report 2000, Singapore's  judicial

system  maintained its top position in Asia.  PERC commented,

"Singapore's  legal system has an excellent reputation  among

businessmen for being fair and effective, if a bit  harsh  at

times."   More  recently, Lord Woolf, one of  Britain's  most

senior judges, was so impressed by the smooth functioning  of

the  Singapore  judiciary that he wished the  courts  in  his

country would follow some of the processes here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of health, the World Health Organisation

earlier  this  month assessed Singapore to have  the  world's

sixth  best  performing health care system among  191  member

states surveyed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our education system has also come in for praise from

foreign experts.  US Education Secretary Richard Riley,  when

he   was   in  Singapore  recently  for  the  APEC  Education

Ministerial Meeting, commented that there was a  lot  the  US

could  learn from Singapore's education system.  In the third

and  latest International Mathematics and Science Study  some

years  ago, Singapore's 13-year olds came in first  among  41

countries in their ability in science and mathematics.   This

is  clear  testimony of the effectiveness  of  our  education

system.   Some  US  schools are even  using  our  mathematics

textbooks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are but a sampling of the international

assessments of the performance of Singapore and the Singapore

Government.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans by now take all these assessments and high

rankings  for  granted.   But pause  for  a  moment  and  ask

yourself how we have managed to achieve first world standards

in  so  short a time and with so little resources.  Could  it

have  been  done  without leaders of integrity,  ability  and

dedication to the people they serve?

<br><br><i>Test of Government</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true strength of a government is revealed when it is

put through the most severe crisis.  This Government has been

put  through  one in the recent Asian financial crisis.   The

financial  storm  devastated the economies  of  South  Korea,

Thailand,   Indonesia  and  Malaysia,  but   left   Singapore

relatively unscathed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just consider the damage to these economies in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;South Korea's economy shrank by 6.7%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thailand's economy shrank by 10.2%, Malaysia's by 7.4%,

and Indonesia's by a massive 13%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, Singapore avoided a contraction in 1998.

Our economy still grew, if only by 0.4%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose we had not managed our economy well. It could

easily  have  shrunk by 5%.  This would have taken  off  $9.5

billion (at current prices) from our GDP.  Divide this  by  a

population of 3 million and you will get a loss of $3,166 per

person.   This is an indication of the price each Singaporean

pays if we had not managed our economy well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, what was the total annual salary for all

political office-holders in 1998?  About $28 million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the total salary increase we are proposing for

political office-holders?  About $6 million.  With the salary

revision,  the  annual  salaries  of  all  political  office-holders,  that is my Government, will rise from  $28  million

currently  to  $34  million.  Is this a  lot  of  money  when

compared  with  the $9.5 billion damage to the  economy  that

could have been inflicted by the Asian

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>

financial  crisis?  Is $34 million a lot of money  when  they

amount  to only 0.024% of our GDP of $144 billion (at current

prices)?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me put it simply: the damage we had prevented to

the  economy  from the Asian financial crisis  is  more  than

enough  to pay the Ministers and the other political  office-holders  for  the rest of their political lives and  in  fact

over many lifetimes!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Asian financial crisis has distinguished us from the

other regional economies.  Recently, an American asked the US

Ambassador  to  Singapore, Mr Steven Green, on the  Internet:

"Why  was Singapore affected less than the region during  the

economic crisis?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His reply: "In one word, it is management.

Singaporeans are very fortunate to have a government that  is

very  well-managed, very far-sighted and willing  to  embrace

change."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign governments and investors have noted our

strengths in the crisis.  Our ability to withstand the crisis

has  increased confidence in Singapore.  This is obvious from

my  many meetings with foreign investors and leaders both  in

Singapore  and  abroad.  We are going  to  see  more  foreign

investments come in.  This means more jobs and better jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us put the salaries of Ministers in their proper

perspective.  A million dollars for a Minister  seems  a  lot

when compared to the salary of a worker.  But $34 million for

all  the Ministers and political office-holders, that is  the

cost  of  government,  is a tiny drop when  compared  to  the

increase  in  GDP  that a good government can  produce.   For

every 1% growth, the GDP increases by $1.4 billion.

<br><br><i>Good People for Good Government</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how do we produce a good government? Get the best to

serve the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good government does not come naturally. It must be

systematically created through the active recruitment of good

and able people.  You cannot just

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>

leave  it  to  the  electoral process  to  throw  up  a  good

government.   If  the present ruling party  is  not  able  to

persuade some of the best people to enter politics, you  will

have  only  weak  men  and women to choose  from  to  form  a

government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After every election, we immediately look for new

candidates  for the next election (we do not wait  until  the

election  is  about to come) - from the civil  service,  SAF,

Police,  statutory  boards, GLCs,  the  professions  and  the

private  sector.  In other words, all over Singapore.   Since

the  last GE, we have already invited nearly 250 Singaporeans

in  their late 20s to mid-40s for tea sessions.  By the  time

of  the  next  GE,  we would have met 400  to  500  potential

candidates.  Out of them, we hope to find 15 to 20 with these

5  "Cs"  qualities.  These are the 5 "Cs" which  a  potential

candidate must have (not your usual 5 "Cs" but my 5 "Cs"):

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Capability: Does he have a record of good

performance?  Does he have the potential to become an office-holder?    Does  he  have  good  judgment?    Does  he   have

leadership qualities?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Character: Does he have character flaws? Is he

able to get on with people and motivate them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Compassion: Has he done things for others beyond

his own family?  Does he care for others?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Conviction: What does he believe in? What does he

want  to  achieve in life?  What motivates him?  Why does  he

want to be an MP or a Minister?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) Commitment: Is he loyal to his friends? Will he

stay the course?  Will he fight when the chips are down?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we assess that a person is interested only in

politics  as  a  career move, he will  not  be  chosen  as  a

candidate.  If he is attracted only by the pay, he  will  not

be  selected as a Minister.  But that does not mean we should

not  pay  a Minister what he is worth.  We are targeting  the

top

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>

people to be Ministers.  They are high-income earners or will

be  in their non-political careers.  We will have to pay them

a competitive, market-based salary so that pay will not be an

obstacle discouraging them from entering politics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Joseph Nye, Dean of the Kennedy School of

Government  at Harvard University, made the same point  in  a

talk in Singapore last year.  He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Singapore is very wise. You need to attract good

people into government, and paying high salaries reduces  the

incentive for corruption."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his point on corruption, Singapore's policy of paying

our  public officials market-based wages has helped us create

a  corruption-free environment.  Transparency  International,

an  NGO  dedicated  to  fighting  corruption  worldwide,  has

consistently  ranked  Singapore  within  the  top  ten  least

corrupt  countries in the world, since its  index  was  first

published  in 1995.  Among Asian countries, we are rated  the

least corrupt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Nye added that the high salaries also helped

"lateral  entries" from the private sector  into  government.

He  said that this was important in a modern economy  with  a

complex, fast-paced financial sector, as government decision-makers would need the inputs of private sector practitioners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Nye was right about lateral transfers. When

we  identify  a  suitable  young  man  (or  woman)  with  the

potential to be a Minister, we have to persuade him  to  give

up  his  bright  prospects  in  the  private  sector  for  an

uncertain   future  in  politics.   Benchmarking   Ministers'

salaries to what the best in the private sector earns,  makes

it  easier  for us to get some of the best people  to  become

Ministers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some may argue that you do not have to pay so much to

get people to join the public sector or become Ministers, and

that there will always be people who want to become Ministers

or  civil  servants.  Quite right, if you think in  terms  of

quantity, not quality.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economist in an article in its issue of 8th May 1999

on  "The  Politics  of  Envy"  asked:   "Why  do  governments

systematically underpay their top people?"  And answered that

it  is  the  tendency  to  think in terms  of  quantity,  not

quality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew Oswald, an economist at Warwick University, was

quoted in the same article:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Governments can set low pay and still get workers. It

is  the  quality  that will adjust.  I doubt whether  western

democracies have fully grasped this.  Governments still  tend

to count the warm bodies applying for occupations."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not this Government. It goes for quality, not

merely warm bodies, and certainly not seat-warmers.  That  is

why we have performance bonuses for political office-holders,

one  of  the few countries in the world to do so.   Ministers

are  paid in accordance with their performance.  I shall  now

ask  the Clerk of Parliament to hand out a table (Cols.  629-630)  showing the distribution of performance bonus  received

by political office-holders.  [Copies of table distributed to

hon.  Members.]   This is to answer the point  raised  by  Mr

Inderjit Singh that the performance of office-holders  should

be  properly evaluated (Table 1).  From the Table,  you  will

see  that only three Ministers received performance bonus  of

more  than four months, and the most number of Ministers  was

in  the 3-4 months category.  We have been stringent with our

evaluation.  The office-holders were given similar tables  at

the time they received their performance bonus.  So they knew

how they have been evaluated.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000630/20000630-HA-0720629.htm">Table - Performance Bonus Distribution for Political Office-holders (Cols. 629-630)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also insist on self-renewal. MPs and Ministers, even

though they are performing well, will at the right time, have

to make way for younger people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In future, Permanent Secretaries too, even if they are

good,  will  have to make way for younger people.  Otherwise,

younger people with high potential will not stay long  enough

to become Permanent Secretaries.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Timing of Salary Revision</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some MPs have told me that while they support the salary

revision for the public sector, they are concerned about  the

timing because the CPF cut has not yet been fully restored.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two reasons why we are proceeding with the

salary revision now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in November 1994, when we debated the White Paper

on  Competitive Salaries for Competent and Honest Government,

we  said that the salary benchmarks would be reviewed in five

years' time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the gap between private sector and public sector

pay  has become a gulf since the start of the Asian financial

crisis.  This is because the Government froze the salaries of

Ministers and top civil servants during the crisis.  This was

despite  the  fact  that the salaries  were  due  for  upward

revision.   For  example, the private  sector  benchmark  for

Ministers' salaries at Staff Grade 1 had increased by 13%  in

1998 and 29% in 1999.  Not to adjust the Ministers' and civil

servants'  pay now when we have emerged from the  crisis  and

resumed  strong  growth,  and especially  when  it  is  fully

justified by the private sector benchmarks, is to fall into a

state of paralysis experienced by governments elsewhere  when

they  faced the issue of public sector pay revision.  Because

they  were  unable to keep the salaries competitive vis-a-vis

the private sector, inevitably, their countries saw a decline

in the quality of people wanting to be MPs, Ministers, judges

and civil servants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not, however, insensitive to workers' feelings

and  public  sentiments.  Because the CPF cut  has  not  been

fully  restored, we are not restoring immediately the pay  of

Ministers  and  top  civil servants  to  the  private  sector

benchmark  for  Staff Grade I, but phasing it in  over  three

years.   These office-holders will receive only  80%  of  the

benchmark in the first year.  The basic monthly salary for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>

Ministers  will  therefore increase by only 0.3%  this  year.

With  bonuses, the annual increase for Ministers  will  be  a

modest 12%.

<br><br><i>Today's Realities</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In debating the salary revisions, let me remind you of

some realities we cannot run away from.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we are seeing a global convergence in the pay of

top executives.  Globalisation and technological advances  in

transportation  and  communication  have  led  to  increasing

mobility  of  this group of people.  They are  able  to  move

easily  around  the  world in search of the  best  employment

opportunities.    If   they   do  not   get   internationally

competitive  remuneration in their country, they  can  easily

uproot  for  other more favourable opportunities  in  another

country.   Companies are therefore increasingly pressured  to

pay  internationally competitive salaries for top executives,

regardless in which country they operate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, our job of retaining talents is made more

difficult  because  Singaporeans, with their  proficiency  in

English  and  high  competence,  are  mobile  and  in   great

international  demand.    American  universities   and   MNCs

regularly  cream  off  our scholars and bright  students  who

study in the US.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, we must make a rapid transition to a knowledge-based economy. We have done the easier parts like building

infrastructure,   putting   in  place   a   business-friendly

environment, and training our workers for skilled jobs.   The

next  phase  is much more difficult.  We have to  create  new

products  and services ourselves and not merely add value  to

other  people's  products.   With globalization  and  the  IT

revolution,  competition has heightened.  It is  a  new  ball

game altogether.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, what all this means is that the wages of top

private  sector  talents in Singapore will  face  significant

upward pressure in the years to come.  Companies in Singapore

will have to pay their top

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>

local  executives  internationally  competitive  salaries  to

retain  them.   Certainly, they have to  pay  internationally

competitive  salaries for foreign talents.  But  let  me  add

here  that  expatriates are excluded from the calculation  of

the salary benchmarks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has no choice but to match these upward

trends  in  private sector pay in order to attract  its  fair

share of talents.  But the Government does not intend to be a

price-setter.  It will not lead the pace of pay  revision  in

Singapore.   It  will only be a price-taker.   We  will  only

respond  to the trends in the private sector, with a  lag  of

one   year,   to  ensure  that  public  sector  pay   remains

competitive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reality we cannot escape from is the widening

income  gap  between the top and bottom  earners.   In  every

society,  there will be a bottom 10% and a top  10%  of  wage

earners.   The  Government  cannot  artificially  reduce  the

income  gap  between these two segments of the population  by

forcing  upwards the salaries of the bottom 10%,  or  forcing

downwards  the  salaries of the top 10%.  This  is  a  market

economy, not a command economy.  What the Government will do,

however,  is  to ensure that all Singaporeans have  an  equal

opportunity to make it to the top 10%.  At the same time,  we

will  help  the  relatively poor to  ensure  that  they  also

benefit  from  the  general  increase  in  prosperity.    The

Government has already put in place a system of subsidies for

education,  housing  and  health.  It  has  also  implemented

several  assets-enhancement programmes.  We will continue  to

help the lower-income Singaporeans increase their assets,  as

well  as improve their earning capacity through training  and

skills upgrading.  We will give them hope through investments

in their children's education and future.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Prime Minister, I have travelled widely and seen many

governments  at  work.  Our Ministers  can  stand  their  own

against  most  of their counterparts elsewhere.   We  have  a

Cabinet Singapore can be proud of.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My most urgent job now is to make sure that there will

be  a  successor  team  which can manage Singapore's  complex

economy  in  an increasingly competitive global  environment,

and  which  also understands the concerns of the  man-in-the-street.   I  can build up this team only if we  are  able  to

persuade good men and women into politics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty here is that a political career is not

the natural or first choice of most able Singaporeans.  Other

major  advanced  countries too, like the US,  face  the  same

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to overcome this problem. Singapore has left

behind the revolutionary stage where leaders emerged to  lead

a  historic movement with little thought of pay.  We are in a

steady state of development where fortunes can be made in the

buzz of the private sector.  There is much excitement in  the

new  world of dotcoms, financial services, life sciences  and

R&D.   Most  able Singaporeans prefer to seek  fulfilment  in

these challenges rather than in politics.  If we fail to  get

a group of these bright, able and honest Singaporeans to form

the political core of Singapore, then over time, the standard

of government will go down, and Singapore will crumble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is vulnerable. It does not have any natural

resources  except our people.  Our people have been fortunate

to  be led by a good and competent Government since 1959.  It

will  be very shortsighted and costly for Singaporeans if  we

grudge good Ministers their due, and settle for lesser men in

Government in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have gone through the proposed revisions to public

sector  salaries  and  salary benchmarks  thoroughly.   I  am

satisfied  that  they  are fair.  I do  not  think  they  are

generous,  given  the  Ministers' huge  responsibilities  and

impact on our people's lives.  I want the right people to  do

these jobs.  And so should you.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Ministers' pay is a source of envy for some people

is  not necessarily bad.  We are more likely to recruit  good

Ministers this way.  I would be extremely

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>

worried if it were the reverse.  If Ministers envy the pay of

their  counterparts in the private sector, that is the  first

step towards corruption.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several MPs have advised me that we must deal with the

emotional  reaction of Singaporeans over the salary revision.

They  themselves  support the market-based salaries  but  are

concerned that the man-in-the-street will not understand  why

Ministers have to be paid high salaries.  I understand  these

emotions.   But I have faith in the judgment and  rationality

of Singaporeans.  I have no doubt that some Singaporeans will

react  emotionally and will not accept our arguments.  But  I

believe most Singaporeans will listen to the logic and make a

rational decision.  They have always done so.  A rational and

practical  approach to problems has always  been  Singapore's

hallmark.   Otherwise, Singapore will  not  be  where  it  is

today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, let me go back to my Williams College days.

I have often wondered what has happened to my classmates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has happened to my Ethiopian friend, who already

had six children at Williams College?  He was a high official

in the government of the late deposed Emperor Haile Selassie.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for my Yugoslav friend from Croatia, I wonder whether

his   children  had  to  fight  fellow  Yugoslavs  to  become

Croatians?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the Pakistani official from East Pakistan who

became  a Bangladeshi?  His government house overlooking  the

port of Chittagong was shelled during the war.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, there were other classmates who have done

well,  retiring  in  high government  positions.   But  their

countries  have not lived up to their dreams when  they  were

young  men at Williams College, eager to learn and  eager  to

put into practice what they had learnt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real lesson for me from Williams College was:

without a good government,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>

all  the  good  theories  of economic development  count  for

nothing.   Countries  with weak or bad  governments  will  go

downhill, suffer internal strife and may even break up.  They

will  not  be able to deliver a high standard of  living  for

their  people.  And when a country goes down, it is  not  the

able  people  who  will suffer most.  It is  the  man-in-the-street.  They are the people who cannot migrate easily.  They

are the ones who need a good government most.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So ask yourself, "Where will Singapore be 30 years from

now?  What type of government will produce you a safe, stable

and prosperous Singapore?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me help you answer the questions by giving you some

simple arithmetic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the wage cost of all the political office-holders

will be $34 million after this pay revision.  There are three

million  Singaporeans.  What is the cost  of  Government  per

capita?   $11  per year or about five plates  of  "char  kway

teow" per Singaporean.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, in 1995, the Government made a contribution of

$200  into  the CPF account of all Singaporeans aged  21  and

above and an additional pro-rated contribution of up to  $300

to  those  who had contributed $750 themselves to  their  CPF

account.   The total amount paid out was about $800  million.

What was the pay-out per Singaporean?  $270, if we divide  it

by a population of three million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can do more such CPF top-ups in future, provided we

have  good  growth.  $11 per capita per year for a Government

that can produce good economic growth and give you $270, even

if it is once in five years, is surely good value for money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summing up, it is wrong to focus on the individual pay

of  Ministers in isolation.  He is only a member of  a  team.

You  should  focus  on  the cost of  my  Government  and  the

benefits and consequences of having that Government.  What is

the  cost of my Government to each Singaporean?  Five  plates

of "char kway teow"!  What was the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>

price each of us would have paid if our economy had shrunk by

5%  during the financial crisis?  $3,166!  And this price  is

only  an example of the huge price you have to pay for a weak

or bad government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have put in place a virtuous cycle of good

Government, economic growth and benefits for the people.  For

your own benefit, it is wise for you to strengthen, not break

this cycle.  [Applause]

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, may I seek a clarification

from the Prime Minister?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> All right.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Would the Prime Minister also

conclude in his proposed thesis that the higher the Ministers

are paid, the higher the return in benefit for the people?

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chok Tong:</b> Sir, when you do a doctoral thesis,

you  do not do such a simple correlation that the higher  the

pay,  the more the benefits for the people. You have to  look

at  what  the Government can deliver and if you need to  have

high  pay  to  attract good people into government,  then  of

course, there is a link between that and the per capita  GDP.

Where  you  have  high pay, and you pay  people  who  do  not

measure  up, then of course your performance cannot increase.

So  the link is not between the high pay. The link is between

good people whom you have to attract with the right pay.   In

our  context, it has to be related to the market, and you see

the  results  later  on.  What I am  saying  is,  judge  this

Government  in  totality for what it has performed.   Do  not

look  at  individual Ministers' pay alone.  Look at the  wage

cost  of Government as a whole, the benefits to you, and  the

price of a bad government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, I rise to support the

Deputy Prime Minister's statement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will not touch on the salary adjustments of the

civil servants as I think that is less controversial than the

issue  of  the Ministers' salary which is tied to the  public

sector salary adjustment.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had extensive debates before, inside and outside

this  House,  on  the  issue  of the  amount  that  political

appointment holders and, in particular, a Minister, should be

getting as his salary.  Mr Chiam had earlier alluded  to  the

fact that to the average Singaporeans who may not be paid  as

much, especially to the fair number of Singaporeans who  earn

less than $24,000 a year, the idea of a Minister getting more

than a million dollars is beyond comprehension.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first brush, there seems to be a sense of inequity to

this.  Somehow, many Singaporeans feel that it is  not  right

that  there should be such a divide between the masses and  a

small   number  of  political  elite  who,  as  the  people's

representatives, should reward themselves so handsomely  with

such salaries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, against this thinking, there is a sense that the

people have made deep sacrifices, as was acknowledged by  the

Prime  Minister earlier, when the Government decided  to  cut

their CPF contribution following the recent financial crisis.

Their  CPF contribution has not been fully restored  to  date

and  there  are constant calls for the Government to  restore

their  CPF  contribution to the level  before  the  financial

crisis.   Therefore, for some, it seems odd that  while  they

are  making the sacrifices by taking pay cuts, the  political

appointment  holders and civil servants should be  increasing

their salaries at this time.  Many Singaporeans may feel that

the  Government  should continue to set the  example,  as  Mr

Chiam  had  said earlier, by keeping the salary freeze  until

such  time  when CPF contribution has been fully restored  to

the people and the economy shows robust growth again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministerial Statement unfortunately also comes at a

time   and   hot  on  the  heels  of  the  recent  spate   of

announcements of cost increases. These include, for instance,

the  $2  charge on POSB accounts for those who  maintain  low

deposits,  and the recent announcement of revision  to  water

rates,  increase in transportation charges, and other private

sector led charges.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, we know that the recovery of the

Singapore  economy  is rather selective and  not  across  the

board. The construction industry is still in the doldrums and

many  Singaporeans are still unemployed.  At my MPS alone,  I

get  many  requests from my constituents for help in  looking

for jobs.  They are the ones who have been retrenched and are

not so employable on account of age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the backdrop of the present scenario, many

Singaporeans may be asking:  how can the Government  increase

the  salary  of  civil  servants  and  political  appointment

holders?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not deny, Sir, that the issue of Ministers' salary

has  always been a very emotive one. For reasons that I shall

elaborate  later,  I support the move by  the  Government  to

increase  the public sector salary.  Let me examine  some  of

the arguments raised against the salary revision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as was alluded to by Mr Chiam, the inequity

argument, ie, the growing gap in income distribution  between

the  top  and  bottom income earners and the  fact  that  CPF

contribution has not been fully restored.  Sir, the  argument

of  social inequity is based on the idea of equal misery  for

all.  The  argument simply put is this:  as long as there  is

inequality  of  income  distribution  and  as  long  as   CPF

contribution   has   not  been  fully   restored,   political

appointment holders, least of all, should be allowed to  have

salary revision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can this argument be tenable? Against this argument, we

have  to  ask ourselves the kind of society we want to  build

for  Singapore.  I do not think for a moment that  a  country

founded on a political philosophy of equal misery for all  is

going  to bring about more wealth for the people in the  long

term.   Let us recognise a basic principle here.   We  are  a

market  economy where talents and resources are allocated  on

the basis of pricing.  You want the best talent, you must  be

prepared  to pay for the best talent; and by talent,  I  mean

not  only people with the ability to run the country well but

also the honesty and integrity to run it.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the detractors, I have a question. Would you rather

pay  the  political  appointment holders a  fraction  of  the

salary  and  have either people without the ability  to  take

charge of our Government and make a mess of Singapore or have

people whose only interest in coming to public office  is  to

cream  off the system and line their pockets in the  process?

Let  us  be  honest about it.  Talent is in short  supply  in

Singapore.  We want to attract the best talents to serve this

country. For them, they will have to come out of the  comfort

zones  of  their  established  careers  and  family  for  the

country.   It  is  indeed  a  sacrifice  for  many  who  have

established themselves in their career.  They have to make  a

judgement  call  by  resigning their  jobs  and  serving  the

country  as political appointment holders.  We all know  that

there is no assurance that they will succeed in the long  run

as  political appointment holders, having made the sacrifice.

It  is  therefore quite clear that some sacrifices  would  be

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to ask them to make near complete sacrifice or

even  total sacrifice in the service of the country is a very

naive  thing  to  do,  Mr  Chiam.  These  people  have  their

mortgages to pay, their children to look after and a  certain

lifestyle  to keep. His calculation of $50,000 is a  relative

thing.  To the very poor in the poorest country in the world,

your  lifestyle would be obscenely rich.  I think it is quite

inappropriate to just pluck a figure out of thin air  and  to

say  that  it  is  appropriate  by  your  standard  and  your

judgement.   Let the person who is deemed by the  power  that

be, who is capable of running this country, decide whether or

not  it is a sacrifice that is worth making and paying at the

point in time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the call to political office to serve the

country is not a call to priesthood. They are not expected to

live  the  life  of  an ascetic.  Even in Israel,  where  the

country  has  for years had prime ministers who lived  rather

ascetic  lives,  has  had  to face down  two  major  scandals

recently, when their President and former Prime Minister came

under investigation

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>

on  allegations of corruption.  If a salary adjustment is  in

order, and having lived with a wage freeze for the last three

years, why should we begrudge this adjustment?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not a basket case where our people live from hand

to  mouth. We can afford the salary increase and we  want  to

continue to have people at the top who will be able  to  give

all  of us, and not just some Singaporeans, a better life  in

the new economy.  We had a discussion earlier about the issue

of  growing income disparity between the poor and the rich in

Singapore.   The  question that we have to ask  ourselves  is

whether  we  want  to  pay the right people  at  the  top  to

continue  to  create wealth for Singapore and  to  close  the

income  gap in the process.  If the answer is yes, should  we

not  be  willing  to pay the price?  The Prime  Minister  has

given  us  a very lucid illustration earlier and I think  the

example is very telling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, some Singaporeans, I suspect, may well support

the  pay  increase but would say that it is inappropriate  to

implement this at this stage with the recent spate  of  price

increases.   Sir, with all due respect, I do not  think  that

the two issues are necessarily related. What this argument is

tantamount  to  saying  is  that  because  there  are   price

increases,   political  appointees  must  not   have   salary

adjustments.  Why should the political appointment holders be

any different? Are the promoters of this argument saying that

wages  for  all  employees should be frozen?  Quite  clearly,

Sir, the argument is non-sequitur.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I have heard the argument making its rounds

that  the  political  appointment  holder  who  is  paid  the

equivalent of private sector salary may not be able  to  hold

his own in the private sector once he leaves the comfort zone

of  the public service. This applies to political appointment

holders  who have never worked in the private sector  before.

Again, I find this argument rather difficult to follow.  Sir,

I  believe  that  we have used the salaries  of  the  private

sector  as  a benchmark to allow us to (1) attract  and  keep

those  from the private sector with the necessary ability  to

serve the country;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>

and,  more  importantly,  (2) to recognise  the  ability  and

contribution  of political appointment holders who  have  led

the country well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the cynicism of some Singaporeans on the ability of our

political  leaders who never really went through the  baptism

of fire in the private sector that I want to touch on briefly

for  now. The argument is simply this.  We pay Ministers  top

private  sector  salaries.  Can they really  perform  to  the

level  of expectation required of the remuneration that  they

enjoy  if  they went to the private sector?  In other  words,

would  they  have  earned as much if they  actually  took  on

private sector jobs?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that to take this line of argument is to

confuse the issue.  Let me explain.  I am a solicitor  and  I

earn  an  income.  I should not be expected to earn the  same

salary  as  a doctor if I tried to do the work of  a  doctor.

This is because I am not qualified and, more importantly, may

not  be suited for the job.  The two are not the same.  I  am

paid  my salary which may be comparable to a doctor's  salary

because of what I do as a lawyer.  Nobody begrudges the  fact

that  I earn as much as a doctor.  By the same token, we  use

the private sector salary as a benchmark.  That does not mean

that  we should expect all political appointment  holders  to

have  the same talent to be a top doctor, lawyer or a banker.

What the benchmark does in addition is to provide a basis for

valuing  the  ability  of those in the public  service.   Why

should they be valued any less simply because they are in the

public  sector?   Clearly, this approach to  pay  our  public

office appointment holders well has been proven right, as was

mentioned earlier, because the last round of financial crisis

has  spared this country of the misery that we have  seen  in

the  region.  Is this not proof of the quality of the leaders

that we have?  In other words, the benchmark is arguably  our

way  of remunerating them for the quality of skills that they

have brought about in running this country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, Sir, we have to ask ourselves:

are  we prepared to pay the price for top leadership?  Is  it

worth it?  I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>

would say that at least for us, the system is transparent and

it is worth every cent of it.  We know how much we are paying

our  public servants; or do we want a system where  political

appointment  holders are paid little, and the  true  cost  of

leadership  is not known until perhaps the leaders  fall  and

corruption investigations begin?  Sir, to my mind, the answer

is obvious.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I support the pay revision for civil  servants

tabled  by  DPM  Lee.   This is done in  order  to  maintain,

strengthen and continue the system that has stood us in  good

stead.  In the past few decades, our system has brought about

an improvement in the quality of life of our people.  Ours is

an  open,  transparent  system which  practises  meritocracy.

Under this system, our leaders are not allowed to abuse their

powers  and to amass a great amount of wealth for themselves.

Unlike other countries where greed and corruption have become

rife  and  rampant, in Singapore, there is no room for  money

politics and Ministers do not have dubious extra benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is pragmatic to link Ministers' pay with those top

earners  in  the private sector as their salaries should  not

lag  far behind those top earners in the private sector.   We

should  attract the most capable and talented people to  come

forward  to  join  the  Government by  ensuring   that  their

salaries should not lag far too behind those of their friends

in the private sector.  We must attract the best and the most

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>

competent to enter politics.  Of course, they should  not  be

motivated  by  greed. They should come out  spontaneously  to

take  part  in  the  process  of  renewal  of  our  political

leadership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the pay revision, our Prime Minister's pay is

$1.94 million, which is equivalent to the pay of the 63rd top

earner  in  the private sector.  Prime Minister Goh  and  his

team  have  led the people  through the financial crisis  and

they have been able to turn a deficit of $5.1 billion into  a

surplus  of  S$3.2  billion.   The  Prime  Minister's  yearly

remuneration of $1.94 million is about 50 cents for  each  of

the  4  million people.  This is the negligible  amount  they

have to pay to hire a helmsman.  Is 50 cents too high a price

to pay?  Of course, we can each pay 10 cents a year to get  a

helmsman, but that helmsman is a helmsman of a tongkang or  a

sampan.   And a sampan or tongkang cannot carry four  million

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I re-read Senior Minister Lee's Memoirs, my belief

in  the  importance  of good Government  leaders  is  further

enhanced.  From the time we entered Malaysia and the time  we

were  separated  from it, if not for  the  Senior  Minister's

wisdom and sharp political judgment, we would be sitting here

today as a city council and not Parliament, and the issues we

would be discussing would be to get more financial allocation

from the central government or to get loans from the IMF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am saying all these just to tell the

people  of Singapore that what we should worry about  is  not

pay  increases for the Ministers, but  whether we can get the

best  people to become our leaders and to practise the system

of  meritocracy.  We must retain the best talent in our civil

service  and Cabinet.  If we lose them, it will be a loss  to

the nation.  Of course, of equal importance is that we should

not  forget  those low-income earners who work hard  for  the

nation.  In this respect, I am glad to hear Minister  BG  Yeo

once  again  assuring the House yesterday that the Government

would continue to provide affordable

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>

housing  and healthcare to the lower-income group, and  would

continue to invest heavily in education and training, thereby

ensuring the employability of the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good government will ensure that the children of all

Singaporeans, rich or poor, will have equal opportunities  to

be  educated  and  to  be promoted to a  better  standard  of

living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good leaders will make the lower-income people feel, at

all  times,  that whenever they encounter  difficulties,  the

Government would be around to lend them a helping hand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The politics of meritocracy not only enables the top talents

to  scale  the peak but also continues to provide the  lower-income  people with the hope and the twilight that  they  and

their  children  will be led to enjoy a  better  standard  of

living.

<div align="center"><b>CIVIL SERVICE NWC AWARD, PUBLIC SECTOR SALARY REVISIONS,</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AND REVIEW OF SALARY BENCHMARKS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  first  of all, on behalf of the trade unions,  I  would

like  to  thank  the Government for agreeing  to  credit  the

unused  portions of the annual $350 cap on outpatient subsidy

for  civil  servants who are on the Medisave  and  Subsidised

Outpatient  Treatment (MSO) scheme into the Medisave  account

of the officers. This is a shot in the arm for the unionists'

effort to make our medical benefit more portable, and it is a

great  encouragement  to our unionists and  gives  them  more

confidence  in  making representations to the  Government  on

behalf of the workers to review their welfare and benefits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the DPM's proposal for revision of salaries

for civil servants.  As we enter the 21st century, the nature

and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>

model of a global economy are undergoing great changes.  This

is  a  vast world with blurred boundaries.  Compared  to  the

time when we detached ourselves from the British rule some 40

years ago, the Singapore of today has seen a 70-fold increase

in  our GDP.   We have already attained great achievements in

social  and  economic  fields.   Recently,  the  Housing  and

Development Board handed out the 800,000th key to  the  owner

of  a brand new HDB flat.   90% of Singaporeans own their own

flats.  Even among the bottom 10% of our people, some 65% own

their 3-room or bigger HDB flats.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have read in various literature and newspapers

that  different people in different regions, irrespective  of

their  races and nationalities, have some common aspirations.

They  do  not want to be dependent on others.  They  wish  to

have  their  own  homes.  They also hope that their  children

have  education and everybody craves for the  country  to  be

prosperous  and  the people live in peace and  harmony.  They

hope  that their children will grow up healthily, live  in  a

safe  country and have jobs that provide them with  a  stable

income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take a look at all these hopes and aspirations.

We  all  feel that, as Singaporeans, we should be very  proud

and happy because many of  those things that remain as dreams

for  the  people  in many parts of the world  have  become  a

reality in Singapore.  Most, if not all, of the Singaporeans'

dreams have become realities.  We must continue to put in our

efforts  to  ensure that our people, especially  the  younger

generation,  will continue to enjoy this kind  of  very  good

social environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A friend of mine once told me that there are three types

of  government  in the world.  The first type  of  government

consists  of those who sit back and depend on their  national

resources to finance the government's spending and eventually

squander away all the national wealth.  The second type is  a

government consisting of people who work very hard to  create

wealth  -  for  themselves.  The third type is  a  government

comprising

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>

able  people  who work hard to create wealth for the  country

and  help  the people to enhance their assets and  share  the

fruits of success brought about by the government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot find anywhere on the map of the world any

other country like the little red dot of Singapore.  Yet, our

system  and  our hardworking people have made us  outstanding

and  different.  It is only here in Singapore  that  we  have

this  kind of transparency to discuss the question of how  to

implement meritocracy for good government to continue to help

the  country prosper and develop.  What we want in this  kind

of  system of transparency is reward based on merit.  Because

we  do  not want to be like many other countries in the world

which  have  fallen  into  the  pit  of  quicksand  of  money

politics.   Neither  do we want to be  a  country  using  the

"little  above  board and plenty under  the  table"  kind  of

reward system.  As a matter of fact, this kind of transparent

salary  system for our Ministers and civil servants who  have

sacrificed  a lot, is one which can be described as  a  "win-win" system for both the Ministers and the masses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is often quoted by the Opposition Member, "After

all, the wool still comes from the sheep's back." (meaning in

the  long  run,  whatever you are given,  you  pay  for  it).

However,  we must stress that if you want to have  the  wool,

you  must  also  ensure that the sheep  can  grow  with  good

health.   Then only will we have the wool to shear.   Let  me

give  you  another  illustration. If a farmer  can  rear  the

chickens  well,  then he will have eggs to harvest,  and  the

better  your  chicken, the better eggs you will  get.   If  a

farmer  has  developed a special skill to  make  his  chicken

produce  golden  eggs, then the golden  eggs  should  be  his

rewards.   On  the  contrary, if the farmer cannot  rear  his

chickens  well, then he gets only sick or even dead chickens.

He can forget about having eggs to eat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Chinese saying that people need food to

sustain  their  lives, while the nation  is  built  upon  its

people.   Our  leaders and civil servants have to  work  very

hard

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>

to  earn  their  rewards.  In Singapore, to become  political

leaders by itself is a sacrifice.  Like doctors and teachers,

the  political  leaders too make their  own  sacrifices.   We

should  remunerate  them  well so that  they  would  dedicate

themselves  to  serving the nation and  the  people,  without

having to worry about providing for their families and  their

children.   We  often say that for lovers in love,  they  can

survive  on water and fresh air only. But how long  can  they

survive?    If we want our horses to run well, we  must  feed

them  well.  How can you deny the horses of their feeds,  yet

expect  them to gallop well?  We should not inhibit the  able

and  talented  people to earn the rewards  which  they  truly

deserve.    If   they  are  good,  pay  them  handsomely   to

commensurate with what they are worth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an open society like Singapore, we should permit

"adding  flowers  to brocade".  As a unionist,  I  feel  that

while  practising "adding flowers to brocade", we should  not

forget  also to "send hot charcoal to the needy during  snowy

weather".    The  Government must try  and  do  its  best  to

upgrade  the low-income and low-skilled workers so that  they

too would have the opportunity to upgrade themselves and have

a  share in the fruits of  our economic success.  They should

be  given  the  necessary assistance in time of  need.   More

importantly,   we   must  ensure  that  children   of   every

Singaporean, irrespective of their family background,  should

be given the equal starting point, to receive good education,

so  that children from the lower-income group will also  have

the opportunity to  get out of the poverty trap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a widening income gap among the top earners and

bottom earners.  There is this V-shape going up all the time.

But  this  is  not  the  problem.  The  key  is  whether  the

Government-employer-employee  tripartitism  can  continuously

work  together to level up the "V", that is, to  continuously

push up the bottom line of our incomes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, we conducted a dialogue session with our

trade union leaders.  All

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>

the  leaders  raised their hands in support  of  this  salary

revision.  So  long  as  the  Government  can  implement  the

principles,  that is, to ensure that the less  fortunate  are

properly  looked after, in other words, we must have  a  good

government so that we can attract investments and create more

jobs  for  the people in Singapore, then we will have a  good

and  stable  working  environment.   The  trade  unions  will

support this salary revision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trade unionists also agree with building the bonus

system  into the scheme. The AUPE representative  hoped  that

the   PSD  will  further  enhance  its  transparency  in  the

evaluation of public sector employees, especially  those  who

have  become  trade  union leaders.  If possible,  they  will

ensure  that these trade unionists will not suffer under  the

scheme.   I hope the Government, in revising the salaries  of

the  public sector, will also expedite the work redesign  and

re-engineering in the public sector so as to further  enhance

the  efficiency  of  the public service.   I  hope  that  the

Government  will  benchmark the bonuses and  other  incentive

awards  with our GDP and other development indicators.   They

must  also  take  into  account  the  social  indicators  and

standard of living of the lower-income group.  What  we  want

is  a  public service that cares, one that does not sacrifice

the "human touch" for efficiency.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Senior Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there are no new arguments for the salary increases. They are

obvious.   They  have been debated thoroughly  but  it  is  a

popular issue which hits a popular imagination and it is  not

the  norm in other countries to pay the market rate  for  the

job.  We have decided to do this and we know - I know and the

prime  minister knows - that wherever we go, we  are  greatly

envied because they would like to do likewise.  They just  do

not have the political strength.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of the last five years, since the debate on

ministerial  salaries  working out this  formula,  have  only

shown that the formula is a practical method.  Otherwise in a

fast-changing  globalised economy - we  would  be  repeatedly

debating the need for salary revisions.  Instead, we are now

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>

fine-tuning  the  formula from the average of  the  top  four

earners to the top eight earners, in six professions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have grappled with this problem for over 30 years from

1959  to  1990.   I had argued this question  of  ministerial

salaries  when I was in the opposition in 1955/56,  45  years

ago.   I  then  urged the chief minister of  the  day,  David

Marshall,  to be realistic.  His monthly salary  then  was  a

princely sum of $3,500 when as a leading lawyer he was making

$10,000  to $20,000 a month.  I recommended a realistic  pay,

appropriate  to  his  earnings.  But  he  did  not  have  the

political strength to do it and he left it at $3,500.  So  it

remained  until I developed sufficient political standing  to

be able to tackle the question and raise ministerial salaries

in the 1970s when the economy had taken off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to recount briefly how we managed in the last

40  years since 1959 so that you will understand where did we

start, how have we arrived at where we are.  As I have  said,

the first Cabinet was unusual because it consisted of men who

had  been drawn together by the forces of history.   We  were

young  men  in  our  30s and 40s, who had  been  through  the

sufferings  of the war and the Japanese Occupation.   And  we

were  tempered  by that experience.  We wanted  independence,

and  were  strongly  driven to change  the  economy  and  our

society.   My colleagues were outstanding men, a  core  group

that  stayed together from the 1950s to the 1980s, when  they

retired.  They provided Singapore with 30 years of stability,

solid growth and finally a transformed society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But during that period, every few years I came to this

House  to  revise their salaries to catch up  with  the  fast

growth  economy and the ever higher salaries in  the  private

sector.   As  we  raced ahead and became part of  the  global

economy,  the salaries of our top people have been pulled  up

by  those of their counterparts in the advanced countries and

vice versa for those in the lower ranges.  This trend is  not

likely  to be reversed, unless we go into decline,  in  which

case,  the  highly-trained  and  highly-skilled  will  leave,

accelerating

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>

our  fall.   Of  course,  there is no  extrapolation  to  its

logical  conclusion,  as  sometimes it  would  stabilise  and

plateau,  because you cannot have a society  which  keeps  on

diverging.   You can see from the protests in  the  developed

countries  - in America, now in France - that they  also  are

protesting  against a globalised economy because their  lower

end  and  their middle end earners are hurt by the export  of

industries,  services and jobs; and they are  really  working

against the interest of the developing world that needs these

industries  and jobs.  So I advised the Prime  Minister,  and

finally  persuaded him to take this formula of  an  automatic

adjustment  to Parliament.  The earnings of our  top  earners

will continue to go up with the growth of our economy and  so

must ministerial salaries.  This is a very strong trend.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give the growth in the last 10 years: average of

the  top  24  in six professions in 1989 (which is  for  1990

income  tax) was $1 million.  Five years later,  in  1994  it

became  $1.4 million, an increase of over a third.  In  1999,

it  was $2.5 million, an increase of three-quarters, just  in

the last 10 years.  So had we not had this formula, the prime

minister would be faced with the awful dilemma of taking  the

1994 salary and saying, "Can we revise it by 76%?"  There are

lawyers  and  doctors  in this House  -  Shanmugam,  Davinder

Singh,  Dr  Michael Lim.  They are in the private sector  and

they can confirm by how much the earnings of top lawyers  and

top  doctors in the private sector have gone up in  the  last

five years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tandem with ministerial salaries, and the ministers

form  the benchmark, are the salaries of those in the  higher

echelons  in  the  public service, and  they  are  absolutely

crucial  officers of the State.  Without good  men  occupying

these  positions, we would be unable to maintain our  present

standards  -  the  Chief  Justice, judges,  attorney-general,

auditor-general,  accountant-general, permanent  secretaries,

CEOs of statutory boards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we took over in 1959, we inherited a civil service

recruited by the British with very few locals whom they

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>

picked from the best of a small pool of local talent.  And it

has been one unending process of improvisation and adjustment

ever  since.  For years, we could not get good lawyers to  be

judges,  because the disproportionate earnings in the private

sector  which they have to give up to become a judge make  it

unrealistic.   Only  after 1990, when  we  had  made  radical

salary revisions, and implemented them, has there been a full

panoply of High Court judges.  And it is an unending struggle

now between the private sector, which includes multi-national

legal  corporations  in Singapore, and the attorney-general's

office and the legal service to compete for top talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now explain how we have done it in this chamber.

To self-renew, MPs and ministers, besides the civil servants,

we had to recruit at every election able younger people.  For

ministers, I persuaded, and my colleagues too, able academics

with  PhDs  and  professionals to run as MPs, then  appointed

them as ministers.  Many did not make it.  The attrition rate

was  high.  These scholars had good minds and the ability  to

marshal facts and figures, and to present them.  But they did

not  have that quality necessary for a minister - "judgement"

-  making  a  decision, the right decision, on the  basis  of

complex and incomplete data.  You cannot wait until you  have

got  all  the  facts  in and then decide.   It  is  a  moving

situation.   You  have to decide where  the  trend  is,  what

should we do.  So I cast around with my colleagues and  tried

out  successful men, never mind whether they got PhDs or not,

but  whether  they had succeeded in the real world,  men  who

have been successful in their professions and business and in

their own fields.  The results were better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my ministers were very good at judging people.

Hon  Sui  Sen,  who  was  one  of our  best  civil  servants,

permanent secretary, head of Economic Development Board,  and

later  on  I  persuaded him to become an MP and then  finance

minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He recommended several, among them people whom he had

worked with - Goh

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>

Chok   Tong,  S  Dhanabalan,  Tony  Tan.   They  were   three

heavyweight ministers.  We did not know that when we started.

We  recruited them in the 1970s, but we knew them only in the

1980s.   Each  year,  we also selected 20  to  30  (later  we

increased  it  to  100  to  120) of  our  best  students  for

scholarships  to  study in the best universities  and  bonded

them  to serve the government for eight years.  Parents  were

poorer then, and scholarships were few.   So we had the  pick

of the crop.  And it is from that generation of the 1960s and

70s  that  we  have today the present leaders  of  the  civil

service  and  the  statutory boards, and quite  a  number  of

ministers, scholars and SAF scholars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But since the middle-80s, especially in the 90s, our

economic  conditions  changed and social  attitudes  altered.

Now  scholarships are numerous and commonplace.  I  read  the

Straits  Times supplement on scholarships.  Hundreds of  them

every year, because they had seen how we had succeeded -  the

private  sector,  the banks, even foreign multi-nationals  in

Singapore.   So the Straits Times devotes a whole  supplement

to  the  scholarships  on offer, describing,  tabulating  and

comparing  them in detail.  Statutory boards, GLCs,  all  the

big  banks,  major companies, like NatSteel, MNCs like  Exxon

Mobil,  KPMG  and  American Insurance (AIA),  they  all  give

scholarships.  They are all chasing a limited pool of  scarce

talent.  Moreover, many parents now earn enough to send their

children  abroad to the best universities and do the subjects

of  their choice and have their children sign no bond, except

to  the  father and mother, who would agree to whatever  they

want  to  do.   This has changed the whole  system  of  early

recruitment and nurturing and career development of the  best

for  higher  appointments.   For  the  last  few  years,  the

government  and statutory boards no longer have the  pick  of

the  crop.  That means 10, 15 years down the road, we may not

have the same quality at the top echelon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon Sui Sen recognised these changed circumstances and

the  altered values of our young.   So he persuaded me in the

1970s to abandon this handcuffing of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>

government  officers by their pensions.  We were  losing,  he

said, too many good top men who are quite prepared to give up

their  pensions  because  they were  attracted  to  lucrative

careers  in  the private sector.  So if we did not  pay  them

pension, we could up their salary and compete.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was uneasy because we were departing from an age-old

system.   The  British ran an empire for 200 years  based  on

lifetime employment in the government service.  But  Hon  Sui

Sen  himself  had spent his whole life in government  service

and, at the end, he told me, "Look at my pension!"  It was  a

pittance  because inflation plus growth meant a  pension  was

worth  little.   And he was convinced, and finally  convinced

me, that younger officers no longer considered their pensions

a  strong  pull factor when deciding whether to  stay  or  to

leave.  They wanted to be paid their worth immediately and so

wanted to go on CPF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After much hesitation and reflection, I accepted the

change and agreed to abandon pensions in favour of CPF.  This

led  to the next series of other changes  where salaries have

to  be regularly adjusted to match their counterparts in  the

private sector, or we would end up with the second and  third

best.   It is a continuous series of exercises.  In  the  old

system, the British recruited straight from the universities;

whether you are a law graduate, doctor, accountant, surveyor,

architect, they all have similar salary scales.  We inherited

that.   We carried that on.  But it was unrelated to reality.

Nobody  can predict which profession would be the high flying

profession  when it comes to maturity.  Today it's  the  law.

Tomorrow,  it  could be something else.   At  one  time,  the

architects in the building boom had the best returns.  So  we

now have decided, as a result of abolishing pensions, that we

have to go with the rate for the market in that profession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have new multi-faceted problems, because the global

environment has changed and the best, our best whom  we  send

abroad, are being recruited by top MNCs, also chasing  talent

and prepared to pay off their bonds.  What is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>

$200,000-$300,000  when  you can  get  a  good  mind  already

proven?   You can watch his school record, you can watch  his

college record, you can see his capabilities in argument,  in

presentation, and you have a ready-made winner.   Whether  he

is  a big winner or a small winner, it does not matter.   But

you know this is first league.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now take you to how we are now placed. The

present  team in the government was selected and  had  worked

with  the old guards long before 1990.  The selection started

in  the 1960s was not very successful because, as I said,  we

did not know how to spot who would make a good minister.   So

we  chose people who sympathised with our views, and had good

minds.   But  they  lacked the quality of  making  the  right

decisions.  We started to succeed only in the 1970s, after 10

years  of  error.  And in 1972, I persuaded Ong Teng  Cheong,

then  an architect, to give up his lucrative practice to join

us.  He took several years to wind up his practice first.  He

had  commitments.  Then 1976, Goh Chok Tong,  S.  Dhanabalan,

and  1979,  Tony  Tan, and so it went on.   There  were  many

others.   But,  as  I  said,  the attrition  rate  was  still

considerable.  And at one time, we were so short of ministers

to  hold  big  ministries, that I persuaded two senior  civil

servants, top men, proven administrative ability, to  contest

elections  and  become ministers - Howe Yoon Chong,  who  was

head  of  civil service, to become minister for defence,  and

Teh  Cheang Wan, head of HDB, to become minister for national

development.  So it was an unending quest for the  right  man

to put in the job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes many years for a person to be tried and tested

as  a  minister,  and  to develop that judgement  and  trust.

Every cabinet has its core members of the team, goal shooters

and  goalkeepers.  Not all 11 players can have the same  star

quality.  And it is the prerogative of the prime minister  to

pick  his  men  and,  having  picked  his  men,  it  is   his

responsibility to get them jell into a team and, as  a  team,

to  deliver.  I have grappled with this problem.  And were it

possible,  I  would have liked to pay the ministers  the  way

football clubs

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>

pay  their  players.   When you have a star  player  and  you

change  clubs,  hundreds of millions of pounds change  hands.

Could I do it?  I would cause so much public discomfiture for

the other ministers who are not goal scorers, that team would

soon  be  unable to function as a team.  So a certain balance

must  be kept, solidarity of the team and recognition by  the

captain  that  he  is  a  scorer  and  he  is  a  first-class

goalkeeper.  Somehow, you have got to get them to  share  not

only the glory but also the remuneration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My core members for 25 years, they are well known to the

public  - Goh Keng Swee, S. Rajaratnam, Hon Sui Sen, Lim  Kim

San.   Prime Minister Goh's core team must be obvious to  all

those who have watched how his government has performed,  who

have scored the goals, or have prevented them from being shot

into  our goal.  I leave you to judge.  But the point is that

all  the present cabinet members, including Lim Hng Kiang and

Teo  Chee  Hean, were selected before 1990, before I  stepped

down.  And since then, only three had made it to ministers of

state - Peter Chen, Lim Swee Say, David Lim.  The last intake

of  MPs was the highest average we ever had.  But there is  a

difference between a good player and a Pele.  That is what we

have  to  look for, a striker.  If the present team does  not

get  more good men to join them in the next election in 2002,

there will be a hiatus down the road.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good government did not happen by doing things naturally

in  Singapore.  It was a thorough and meticulous  process  of

selection and testing.  Finally, I learned how the  big  MNCs

did  it in America, using psychologists and psychiatrists  to

recruit  and to test before promotion.  And we became  better

also at assessing character.  The ability is simple to judge,

but  the  character element is very difficult.  But  we  have

assembled  together the best persons available  and  willing.

And  there is no alternative team, or group of people outside

the  government, who can replace this present  team.   I  say

this  without  wanting to discourage those who  are  outside.

There

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>

are  some probably star players outside, but you have got  to

form  a  team and work as a team.  If this government  should

fall, standards of government would go down, because from the

very  start in 1959, Singapore has had a government which  is

led  by  ministers,  not  by civil servants.   The  permanent

secretaries do not settle policy.  They do not innovate.   It

is  the  ministers who strike out.  It was Goh Keng Swee  who

started  the Economic Development Board;  Hon Sui Sen started

NOL; SIA, DBS, so many things.  They are creative men.  It is

the opposite of the Japanese system, where top civil servants

shape  policy.   Therefore, if Singapore does not  have  high

calibre  ministers,  our performance  will  degrade  and  our

economic  growth  will  stumble  and  social  problems   will

increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we have adequate salaries for ministers removes

only  one  of the factors that stand in the way of recruiting

talent.   Since the last revision to this formula, the  prime

minister  has  tried to get many from the private  sector  to

join  - top bankers, top CEOs.  He ended up only with  one  - Peter  Chen  from Shell.  Why did the others  decline?   Some

have  moved on and become venture capitalists.  Because  they

are  bright enough and shrewd enough to see, "Look, I am  40-plus.   If I join you, I will be asked to stay on and on  and

on,  if  I  am successful.  If I am not, I am out.   By  that

time,  I  have  lost my connections."  Some declined  because

they  sized up the ministers and decided they may  not  quite

measure up.  So it is a difficult task.  It removes only  one

obstacle, but not an insignificant factor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Politically, it is not possible for any minister, or any

MP, or any person to say at the outset that he would not have

taken on the task of being a minister if he knew he would not

be  adequately compensated.  But what he would do is,  do  it

for  a  short term and then excuse himself.  I can  say  this

because I have been at it for over 40 years and anyway  I  am

approaching  the  end of my career.  So I can  tell  you  the

blunt  truth.  That period of revolutionary change that threw

up  people with deep convictions and overpowering motivations

is over.  That is a fact.  We are in an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>

era   of  high  growth  with  fortunes  being  made  by   the

enterprising, whether in a dot.com company or in  finance  or

fund  management, or in the professions. And the whole social

climate has changed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was looking through the latest Forbes magazine which I

have  got  by courtesy of SIA because I am a frequent  flyer.

One  whole  copy lists out all the billionaires in the  world

with short descriptions of how they became what they are.   I

am quite sure they sell a few hundreds, if not a few thousand

copies  in  Singapore. So all our top minds are  reading  and

saying,  "Surely he can do it, why not I try?" So we  have  a

qualitative  change in aspirations.  And it affects  the  old

guards  too.  Some  of  them meet me and  say,  "Look  at  my

pension. This is what we are worth."  So I looked at them and

I  said,  "But that is the rules we made." They said,  "Yes."

So from time to time, I persuade the prime minister.  I said,

"Give  the pensioners a bonus because we are doing well.  But

for them, we would not be doing well."  But many of them,  if

I  were to go back and ask them all again, and they knew  the

progress that Singapore would make, they would tell me,  "You

carry  on.  I will stay out." This is the real world. We  are

not  talking  of  a hypothetical situation.  These  are  real

people  who  are going through a tremendous global revolution

in  values.   You open up Fortune magazine, what  is  it  all

about?  They also have their list of billionaires.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps, if I were a young man of 35 or even 45, I will

pause and ask myself, "Why not? Is it so difficult?  Somebody

else  can do this job."  But the plain fact is that very  few

people  can  do  this  job.  I was explaining  to  the  party

secretary  of  Shenzhen when it was getting  started  in  the

1980s, I said, "You have to be satisfied to run a system that

enables  many  millionaires to flourish, and you  are  not  a

millionaire.   And if you can do that, then you can  succeed.

But  if you see the millions being made and you want to  join

in  those  millions,  you will fail. The  whole  system  will

collapse."   That  is  the  problem.   Look  around  and  ask

yourself: why has it failed?  Because your authority to  sign

or not to sign a licence decides whether you

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>

will  make him a millionaire or a billionaire or not, so  why

not   make  yourself  one  incidentally?   It  is  not   very

difficult.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many countries, like America, people take on a job

for a short period and then they go out to the private sector

- where having served their country is a valuable addition to

their  bio-data,  apart from the important  connections  that

they  will  have.   You  look at one of the  most  successful

American  treasury  secretaries since World  War  II,  Robert

Rubin  - (Goldman Sachs, chairman) gave it up.  For six years

the  market knew that they had a professional and a very able

professional, and they had confidence in him.   The  boom  in

the Clinton years is partly due to him and to Alan Greenspan,

chairman of the Fed.  But he wanted to leave after the  first

term.   He  was persuaded to stay on.  He stayed  on  another

11/2 years and now he is co-chairman of the Citigroup.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me point out how long it takes to get an MP to learn

to  be  a minister and have the public recognise him as such,

especially  when  he  is  not a natural  crowd  puller  or  a

mobiliser.   There are two kinds of ministers in Singapore  - the  doer  and the mobiliser. The ideal is to be able  to  do

both.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Mah Bow Tan contested against Chiam See Tong in

Potong  Pasir,  you would not believe it, in 1980,  he  lost.

Because you stand in a crowd, watch two chaps performing, and

say,  "I  think  this chap looks reasonable.  He  is  bright,

energetic,"  and so they voted for him.  But  I  happened  to

know  Mah  Bow  Tan  and I knew his career.   He  had  worked

closely  with me when we tried to help the Singapore  Monitor

get  started to compete against the Straits Times and halfway

through he told me, "Look, we can't.  It will lose because of

the grip of the Straits Times on all sources of news. They've

bought  out  all the agencies, all the cartoons,  everything.

You   cannot  beat  them."   I  decided  that  this  man  has

judgement.  So we fielded him in 1984 and only after  another

10  years,  now  16  years,  that  people  have  a  different

impression  of  him.  They  know that  he  is  competent  and

effective.  Look at the ministries that he

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>

has  handled.   So the prime minister now gives him  National

Development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, you take Teo Chee Hean. He stood in the by-election in Marine Parade in 1992 - tall, lean, lanky, a bit

gawky - as against Dr Chee Soon Juan, voluble, exuberant.  If

it was not a GRC, one-to-one, he may well have lost.  Because

what  was the basis for judging?  A short note about  his  CV

and you see the physical person and you judge him on what  he

says  at  a  few  rallies.  But eight years later,  from  the

things he has done, from the difficult problems he is setting

out  to  solve, people recognise that this is a thinking  man

and  a  very serious man who gets things done and he is going

to  get the schools up to a different level, and the teachers

too.  They have seen the quality in the man, the depth of his

commitment and that he can deliver.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You take Lim Boon Heng, a Colombo Plan scholar, did

naval architecture in the University of Newcastle.  He worked

in NOL in 1971 but because Goh Chok Tong had worked with him,

he  knew  that  this man can do things. He persuaded  him  to

stand  for election as MP in 1980, then sent him to  NTUC  to

work with the secretary-general, Ong Teng Cheong. The NTUC is

not  a  glamour  sector.  No great addition to your  bio-data

that will get you into a higher job.  Maybe you can become  a

human resource or a trade union contact man.  But from a good

government point of view, NTUC is absolutely crucial  because

your  policies have got to be sensitive to the large mass  of

the  semi-skilled and the unskilled and somehow you  must  be

able  to craft your solutions so that they also have a  place

under  the  sun.  Quietly, he built  up  rapport  with  union

leaders  and  workers  and  won  their  confidence   by   his

sincerity.   Eleven years later, in 1991,  he  became  senior

minister  of  state  for  trade and  industry,  to  test  his

decision-making power as an administrator. Then in  1993,  he

went  back to NTUC as secretary-general and minister  without

portfolio in the PMO.  When a difficult measure like  cutting

the CPF by 10% was necessary two years ago, he

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 586</b></font><br><br>

played  a major part in persuading workers and union  leaders

to agree to this rational but emotionally very difficult cut.

The point I want to make simply is this.  It takes many years

of  quiet work to build up relationships and establish trust.

Those in the NTUC doing this job, they are a crucial part  of

good government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, one flaw of the democratic system is

that  voters  do  not have a proper assessment  of  the  real

person  behind  a first-time candidate - his  character,  his

steadfastness, his trustworthiness. They only know him  after

several years and it is true of ministers, of the Speaker and

of  every MP, including the opposition.  Both Chiam See  Tong

and  Low  Thia  Khiang  have  been re-elected  because  their

electorate  has  seen them as consistent and steady  and  are

prepared to continue to have them represent them.  Hence,  it

is  important that MPs are suitably remunerated.  People need

time  to  gauge and assess who has the qualities best  suited

for  what  jobs that can make Singapore grow and thrive.  The

danger  for  Singapore is one of sudden change, a new  school

term  with new pupils, new prefects, new head prefect, and  a

new school principal.  Many things can go awry.  And I cannot

over-emphasise the importance of continuity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The virtuous cycle that we have established, which the

prime minister spoke about earlier today, is a cycle of  good

government  making  for  high  growth  and  social  progress,

leading to the re-election of good government, leading to the

ability to renew that good government by recruiting more good

men to continue the work.  That cycle could be broken.  If it

does,  it  will probably never be re-established.   You  just

look  at the travail of the LDP in Japan.  After 40 years  in

office,   in  the  last  decade,  they  have  suffered   from

decreasing voter support.  One factor which will help prevent

that  happening  in  Singapore is to have  elections  without

money  politics - no money to win elections,  even  to  fight

elections,   and   to   pay  ministers,   judges,   permanent

secretaries,  CEOs  of  companies  and  all  those   in   the

Government  two-thirds of the market rate for the  job.   The

issue is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 587</b></font><br><br>

simple one, whether the public sector should adopt the market

rate.   Big  corporations give their top CEO  share  options,

worth  multi-millions, to attract the best.  When they  fail,

they are out.  Proctor & Gamble had two bad quarters, and the

CEO resigned, and they looked for another one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government has raised Singapore's per capita GDP

from  third  world to first world levels.  1959, per  capita,

$1,300, when I first took office.  1990, 30 years later  when

I stepped down, $22,000, from $1,300.  Ten years later, after

Prime  Minister Goh took over, it is now $37,000.  Sit  down,

ask  yourself,  was  that doing what comes  naturally?   What

needs  to  be  done to achieve that?  A working system,  good

policies, anticipating problems before they hit you.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question really is: can we afford not to increase

the $28 million paid to office holders last year by a further

$6  million, which the revisions cost?  See it in  proportion

to what is at stake.  Pay the judges what we used to pay them

and  ask  whether Chief Justice Yong could have done what  he

has  done in the last 10 years.  I knew the problems with the

Bar  and  with the courts.  Work was piling up.  The  problem

could  not be solved.  It could only be solved by a  complete

change of system.  I looked for a man who was a lawyer,  whom

I  have  known since we were in university together, who  had

gone  into private practice and become a top banker.  I asked

him  to take on this job.  He has a real grasp of the outside

world.  I gave him the support.  I said, "Change it," and  he

has.  And in 10 years, it is a totally different judiciary, a

totally  different  system,  because  he  has  been  able  to

persuade  good  men  to take up these jobs.   The  sum  total

increase which we are talking about is $400 million  a  year,

and they involve billions in the GDP every year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, do not believe that we have escaped the

problems  that have plagued our neighbours and the  region  - KKN for corruption, collusion and nepotism, which have caused

so much damage.  If we believe that we are immune from it, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 588</b></font><br><br>

are  really  risking our future.  It is a world-wide  disease

and  especially endemic in Asia, and we can be easily striken

by it.  Only constant vigilance has kept it down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our market-based pay and allowances will give no excuse

for any slippage, and it is the duty of all of us  -  MPs  of

all  parties and ministers  -  to be alert, to make sure that

no  KKN incidents take place without proper investigation and

punishment,  and  to  set  the example  by  maintaining  high

standards  in  protecting the integrity of our  institutions.

And  you need two things for Singapore's continued well-being

- strong institutions and good men to run them.  [Applause].

<br>4.50 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Thank you, Sir, for

allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure what I can contribute after all that has

been  said, especially after the last speaker.  Let me  start

by saying that Nominated Members of Parliament such as myself

do  not  enjoy  the same allowances as the  elected  MPs,  as

reflected in Annex 3 circulated by DPM Lee.  I say  this  not

to  begrudge them or to claim any moral high ground.  I  only

say  that so that all my friends would not try to claim lunch

from me next week!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DPM's statement covers three main issues - new

approaches  for civil service leadership, the  civil  service

salaries as a whole and, third, and most controversially, the

salary  increases  for senior civil servants  and  Government

appointments.  These are linked but quite different.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make just some short points on the first and

second   issues   before  moving  to  the  third   and   more

controversial.   I  would say that this is a  very  difficult

debate  to  join, in terms of how it is structured.   On  one

hand,  clearly in this House, we have emphasised  the  market

and  logic.   The  emphasis has been on  the  need  for  good

government, ie, this Government which is trusted and has done

well.  And it is this Government that is asking the public to

believe in the steps that it is taking.  What do we have,  on

the other hand?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 589</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As characterised in this House, we seem to have the

politics  of  envy  and emotion, and the danger  of  bad  and

corrupt  government.  My argument is that there is,  on  this

other hand, something more than this, and that we may need to

consider.    The  words  "equity",  "idealisim"  and   "moral

leadership"  have been far less prevalent in this  debate  in

this  House.  I think all of us would say that maybe this  is

accepted, understood, as part of the background, but I  think

they bear re-emphasis.  Of course, everyone will agree that a

good  living  wage,  and reward are necessary  for  political

leadership.  But very few people in this House have spoken of

the  reward  of other less tangible things.  When the  Senior

Minister was speaking on the founding generation, he made  it

very clear that they were special, and that events of history

had  brought them together.  He also made it very clear  that

they  were  human enough to have some tinge of  envy  at  the

present  salaries.  But I would say to them also that because

they  were participants in that great history, they have  and

deserve  our respect in a very deep way, and that is  what  I

mean by the reward of less tangible things, of being able  to

say  to  their  children that "I did this for  you  and  your

generation, and your children's generation."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am concerned about in bringing this issue

up,  particularly the  rewards for the politicians, is of the

unintended  consequences of debating  this  case  in  a  very

public,  rigorous way.  We are in danger of over arguing  the

case,  I  believe, that if we do not agree  to  these  salary

revisions, then everything we do will fail.  I think that  is

a  dangerous  argument.  And, therefore, I was glad  to  hear

earlier  today Prime Minister Goh's assurance  of  the  other

five  Cs,  not  the typical 5 Cs of society,  of  the  market

place,  but these other 5 Cs  -  qualities such as  character

and compassion  -  that he spoke so well about.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to acknowledge therefore the good that our

Government  has done and the need for future good government.

But I want to question what are the factors

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 590</b></font><br><br>

that  made it good  -  only money or is there something more?

In  fact, this recognition of a good government is one of  my

starting  points, because I think one of the  questions  that

has  not been asked so far is a very basic one.  What is  the

mischief that we are seeking to avoid?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me begin with the pay increase for the majority of

civil  servants, which has been less controversial.  But  the

pay  increase  is nevertheless substantial.   In  moving  it,

Deputy  Prime  Minister Lee has assured the  House  that  the

Government is trying to follow the market, but not  lead  it.

I understand that some people in the private sector have some

reservations.  They think that the wage hikes will  undermine

some   of  the  cost-cutting  measures  we  took  to  enhance

Singapore's  competitiveness last year  and,  secondly,  that

they may potentially spark a bidding war for talent.  In this

context,  I  would ask the Deputy Prime Minister  to  address

these concerns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to suggest a new mechanism. In

future,  when Government decides to go well beyond  what  the

NWC  recommends,  as in this case, these further  adjustments

should  also  be  the subject of some consultation  with  the

private  sector.  In that sense, it is  NWC  plus.   The  NWC

tripartite  system is a model that has served for  the  basic

wage  increases,  and  I do not see  why  it  should  not  be

reasonably  successful  in  negotiating  even  these  further

efforts to catch up with the market.  Because the Government,

put  together, is Singapore's largest employer, and  what  it

does, does matter to the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In saying this, I want to emphasise that I do believe

that  some turnover in the civil service is not a bad  thing.

There is no harm in having some percentage of people transfer

from  the  public sector to the private sector and,  in  this

way,  learn how these two different entities work and perhaps

link  them better.  There is a certain dynamism in this,   to

create  better links and understanding between  the  sectors.

In that sense, I am urging that the Government take a view of

acceptable levels of turnover and monitor trends

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 591</b></font><br><br>

against  this before acting.  This is necessary for the  bulk

of the civil service, but it is especially true for the elite

Administrative Service.  And with that, let  me  turn  to  my

second point of the measures concerning this elite.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am saying is that by looking at turnover, we will

avoid  the possibility of over reacting, because one  or  two

elite  civil  servants leave.  Allow me to cite some  figures

published in the Straits Times on Thursday, 29th June, in the

article "Fall in Number of People who Quit Jobs".  The report

cites  research  by  the  Manpower  Research  and  Statistics

Department.  It says that the rate of labour turnover has, in

fact,  declined in Singapore, following from 4.4% in 1990  to

2.1% in 1998, and then 2.2% last year.  Of course, these last

two were bad years, and people tend not to move in bad years.

In  that  sense, I want to ask the Deputy Prime Minister,  in

moving  these large financial measures to catch up,  what  is

the  turnover  for  the civil service as  a  whole,  and  key

sections  of the civil service.  Why are we needing  to  take

care of the turnover problem?  Is there a problem?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report I cite also mentions that professionals,

managers and others at the higher end of the workforce  tend,

in  fact,  to have the lowest resignation rate  -  1.6%.   In

putting  these questions to the Government, I  also  want  to

emphasise that there is the question of whether there is some

sort of pent-up departure, in the sense that people have  not

left  as normal in the last two years.  There has been  under

reporting   - 2.1%-2.2%  -   and therefore there  will  be  a

surge  quite naturally this year, and then we may again level

off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second set of questions I have for the Deputy Prime

Minister  relates to what are the reasons that civil servants

cite  for  leaving,  assuming they have  this  kind  of  exit

interview  that  asks such questions.   I  ask  this  because

Deputy Prime Minister Lee's statement itself recognises  that

pay  alone will not keep people in their jobs.  The prospects

of  the new economy are not just financial, but the sense  of

pioneering, adventure and ownership.  If

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 592</b></font><br><br>

so,  then raising pay by itself may not be the right  answer.

Indeed, if we over argue this and over emphasise this, we may

be  misleading ourselves.  There can be pay differences  that

do  not  lead  to  turnover or there can  be  high  rates  of

turnover  even  if there is good pay.  Other factors  clearly

come  into play  -  factors that money itself cannot address.

I believe there are some people who have good reasons to want

to  stay  in the civil service to contribute, even  if  their

pay,  whilst reasonably good, is not the best in the  market.

I hope there are such people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this sense, I actually welcome DPM's other point of

his  statement about the public sector leadership in allowing

more mobility, this flow of people, by requiring fixed tenure

of  appointments rather than making Permanent Secretaries too

permanent.  This change in permanence is a good one.   But  I

will put it to Members that in a sense it actually encourages

turnover,  perhaps  of a healthy type.  Nevertheless,  it  is

something  we need to consider.  I move to think about  these

issues   because  of  some  recent  publicity   regarding   a

particular civil servant, Dr Finian Tan.  From what I read in

the papers, Dr Finian Tan was one of the very few, if not the

only  private  sector top performer, to respond  to  the  pay

increases  and the call of Government to join  in  the  civil

service  leadership.  He did well serving as Deputy Secretary

at  the  Ministry  of Trade and Industry, going  through  the

civil  service training, but now has recently left.   He  has

got better pay.  But from what I read again, it is not merely

the pay that drives his departure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without over focusing on this one individual, this case

raises certain questions.  Why is it, despite increasing  our

pay,  the  Government  still faces difficulty  in  recruiting

people to the top of the civil service and of retaining  them

thereafter?   The same questions apply in that sense  to  the

political  leadership because we have not, despite these  pay

revisions,  recruited very widely from  the  private  sector.

The   new  members  of  Cabinet  have  come  much  more  from

traditional sources of the civil service and statutory bodies

and the ranks of the scholars.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 593</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me then turn to the last point and the most

controversial.   I  think it is understood that  Singaporeans

want  a Government of good quality.  But quality is not  all.

Cost  is  also a question of sensitivity and some  degree  of

subjectivity.   The  very fact that  we  are  in  this  House

debating how the formula should be re-worked recognises this.

The  very fact that for the two years of the crisis there was

a  freeze  recognises the sensitivity.  So, are  the  changes

that are being suggested enough?  In some ways, I am for  the

changes because they actually try to make it a fairer system,

48 people rather than 24, the median rather than the average.

But  is  that enough of a change?  Again, I have to  ask  the

question: what is the mischief?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we are arguing today in a new context. Five

years  ago  when  we  argued  the principle  of  benchmarking

salaries,  we had the assumption that the whole  economy  was

going  to  go  up,  that  everyone would  benefit  from  good

Government and what Singapore will deliver for them.  When we

talked  about  this again in the crisis years,  we  all  felt

affected.  Of course, looking back now, we know that those in

the  very top still prospered.  But the general sentiment was

that we were in it together as one nation, one society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context today, as emphasised by many speakers,

globalisation will  actually increase the differences between

the  top,  the  bottom, the top and the middle,  and  even  a

handful  of the very top, from the next few in the 1%.   This

new  context  brings  out not just the  market  forces  which

everyone  has emphasised, but the question the Prime Minister

and  the  Senior  Minister put to us: what  do  we  do  as  a

society?   Can  we keep diverging as a society?   The  Senior

Minister who spoke before me said no.  We can hope there must

be  some balancing point.  He pointed to global forces  which

then  speak out against this continuing divergence.  In  this

context,  we  have to ask ourselves whether this  new  policy

will  help or hurt us.  This is why the public and this House

have been engaged in debate about the true level of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 594</b></font><br><br>

the bottom 10% in Singapore, whether it is $133 per month  or

$530 per month, if we take out the jobless people.  Are those

still  too  low?  We have, in this context, to ask  ourselves

whether this new formula is really going to continue to  help

bind  the  society  together in a deeper  way.   I  emphasise

"deeper"  because the forces of globalisation are  likely  to

get stronger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that many people are concerned that linking the

private  sector  market  is  imperfect.   We  are  told  that

Ministers  are not priests. Fair enough.  Another analogy  is

like  doctors.   We  respect that doctors must  earn  a  good

living.  In Singapore, they do.  But if your doctor tells you

that  he is interested in your fees and not your health,  you

know you are in trouble.  You want to change your doctor.  In

fact,  the  profession I am from, lawyers, is the reverse  of

this  joke.   Everyone thinks that lawyers  are  in  for  the

money,  which is why there are all these jokes about  lawyers

and sharks, paying each other mutual professional respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the political dimension should be recognised and

handled,  not  just  with  appeals  to  logic  but  with  due

recognition for the values of society, of compassion, equity,

if  not,  the sterile hand of equality.  If other governments

pay  too low, or are corrupt, they provide us with very  easy

targets to say that what we are doing is exactly correct.  It

is  true that others do not have the right approach.   If  we

look at the US, I believe the salary of the President has not

been  adjusted  for about 17 or so years.   That  is  clearly

wrong.   But  we do not need to jump so fast to the  reverse.

They need not be adjusted automatically every year based on a

very  small  number  of  top performers  when  the  world  is

globalising and differences are accelerating.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to have good Government. We need to have

competent bureaucracy.  A part of that is to have very strong

links  to the median of people and even the bottom of people.

I  would  therefore urge the Government to consider at  least

one proposal.  This is that the benchmark should no longer be

with those at the very top, whether it is 24 or 48, but aimed

to  be  with the median.  In many statistics, one can analyse

companies based on how

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 595</b></font><br><br>

much  the  CEO  is  paid as compared to  the  bottom  worker.

Sometimes it is a multiple of 20, 30, 40 or more.   That,  in

some   ways,  will  be  more  comfortable  for  me  and  some

Singaporeans,  that Ministers should receive a  good  salary,

one  that  puts him above the temptations of corruption,  one

that  allows him to worry about the affairs of state  without

worrying  about their own pockets, but perhaps  one  that  is

pegged  as  a  high  multiple of the median.   This  is  more

comfortable  because this would actually create  the  linkage

between  their performance in bringing everyone  up  and  not

allowing  just  the few top people to fly ahead  of  everyone

else.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government will not consider this for the base

salary  of  the  top political leadership,  I  urge  them  to

consider  it  for the bonuses.  As proposed, the bonuses  are

pegged to GDP and GDP, as we know, is too raw, too global,  a

figure.  We need to target the bottom. We need to target  the

median.   We need political leaders who constantly  emphasise

their  links  in both pocket, in compassion, and  where  they

stand  with  these  people  at  the  bottom  and  middle   of

Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, Singaporeans take

pride  that we have a Government that is efficient,  corrupt-free   and,   more  importantly,  one  that  is  far-sighted.

However,  in  any  country where salaries of politicians  are

raised  for  discussion, it stirs emotion  and  public  talk.

Hence,  it  comes  as no surprise that the  topic  of  salary

revision  has become public topic today.  I am glad that  the

Government,  in  a  true,  open and transparent  manner,  has

chosen  to table these salary revisions despite it being  not

the best of times to do so, especially when we are recovering

from  a recession.  Sir, I commend the Government for tabling

these salary revisions timely for public scrutiny and debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me first comment on the salaries of the

Ministers.   Few  can deny that our Prime  Minister  and  the

Ministers  are a fine lot.  They sacrifice much  to  take  on

political appointments.  They sacrifice career certainty  for

political uncertainty.  They sacrifice privacy for  a  regime

of taxing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 596</b></font><br><br>

Government  and community work.  Many also sacrifice  private

and  family  life  for  the  country.   Sir,  they  manage  a

Government  whose  foreign reserves are in the  billions,  an

economy that is vulnerable and they are also responsible  for

the well-being of three million Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the critical issue is whether our Ministers focus

on running the country or constantly worry how they will meet

the  present and future needs of their families.   If we want

the  best, let us then pay the best and expect the best  from

them.  That the ruling party sets very high standards for the

recruitment  of Ministers is there for public scrutiny.   Our

Ministers are questioned in Parliament, by the media and even

in international forums.  Their impressive knowledge, thought

process and management skills are there for everyone  to  see

and  to  scrutinise.  Even critics are known to have conceded

due credit to our Ministers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original benchmark formula adopted in 1994 was not

the best as is recognised by the further refinement announced

recently.  But it has to be so as the compensation package in

the  employment  market is one that is never  static.   Stock

options  were something new here in 1994.  But now these  are

becoming  basic  in many new companies, particularly  in  the

emerging  new economy companies.  Change is the only constant

thing  in the new economy, and I am glad that this Government

is  tackling the issue of compensating public employees  head

on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking to some Singaporeans yesterday, I felt that many

do not really understand the details announced.  To many what

mattered  was that the increase was substantial.   The  usual

criticisms were raised.  I thought I would raise them here so

that they can be discussed openly in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these have already been highlighted by the Prime

Minister.  Some felt that political office is an ethical  and

moral  one  and not one that is purely pecuniary based.  They

felt  higher  salaries will translate to  cynicism  and  less

respect for the Ministers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 597</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some stated that the benchmark formula used is not

representative  of  the  pay of employees  but  are  that  of

entrepreneurs who make big bucks not due to hard work but due

to connections, guanxi, high risks and sheer luck.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some also felt that Ministers should set the right

example by withholding salary increases in an economy that is

still recovering.  Their point simply was that the timing was

inappropriate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another view was that the new pay packet was one drafted

by  civil  servants for civil servants and one that  was  not

subject to external evaluation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some even expressed the view that the new increases will

trigger a wage spiral in the economy as it becomes a case  of

many chasing fewer job candidates in the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what became clear to me after yesterday's feedback

was  that there are two groups of people.  One group is those

whom  I  would call the "I know" group and the other  the  "I

know not" group.  Those whom I refer to as "I know" group are

the  people who are very familiar as to what is happening  in

the  job  market,  particularly for the  top  talent  in  the

economy  and they know that it is very difficult to get  good

talent even when you pay high price.  The other group which I

call  the  "I know not" group is the group that has basically

no knowledge as to what is happening in the top talent market

and  they do not know how much it takes to pay them  and  how

difficult  it  is  to recruit top talent.   What  has  become

clear,  even  when listening to the debate  that  took  place

today, is that even some MPs are not clear as to how tough it

is  to get good talent in the market. Some MPs have expressed

the  view,  particularly the Members  for  Potong  Pasir  and

Hougang,   that  our  leaders'  salaries,  particularly   the

Ministers' salaries, be pegged to a reasonable level and they

compare to the salary of about $50,000 or the salary  of  the

US President.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chiam, in his address, stated that the US

President's salary was increased

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 598</b></font><br><br>

from  about US$200,000 to US$400,000 which works out to about

S$630,000.   But when the pay of the US President was  raised

in  1998,  one  of the reports indicated that  the  President

himself was embarrassed.  However, the reality was that  they

had  to increase his salary because the US President's salary

formed  the benchmark for the whole US administration.   Only

when they increased the salary of the US President could they

then increase the salary for the whole administration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, when we benchmark the pay of the Ministers,

we  are not only talking about the pay for the Ministers, but

we  are  also  talking  about the pay  for  the  whole  civil

service.   Although we are asking our Ministers to  sacrifice

and  forgo  salary increases, the reality is that below  them

there  is  a big group of civil servants who are all  waiting

for their pay increases and will constantly compare with what

the  private  sector is paying and what is the attraction  in

the private sector.  Although we are calling for Ministers to

restrain  pay  increases in the course  of  the  debate,  the

reality  is  that we can never keep the pay of the  Ministers

low  and yet try to keep our civil servants by keeping  their

pay  high.   We have to ensure that the whole public  sector,

which  includes the Ministers, is always paid  at  the  level

with  what  the  private sector is able to  afford  and  also

attract the same talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, nevertheless, it is essential that the Government

continually explains the transparency of our Ministers'  pay.

Let  me  highlight many other things that the public  is  not

aware.  Not many are aware that our Ministers' pay packet  is

a  whole package and there are no hidden benefits.  There  is

no  free  housing, no free cars for private use, no servants'

allowance, or paid holidays for them or their family,  as  it

is like in many other countries.  Even the US President's pay

is  not merely what he gets in terms of the US$400,000 but he

enjoys many other perks, including a special jet for himself.

So there are many other perks which if one packages it in,  I

am quite sure it well exceeds what our Prime Minister or many

of our Ministers earn, and that is something that was

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 599</b></font><br><br>

missing,  I  thought, in the debate that took place  in  this

House today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, not many are also aware that not all

Ministers are paid the same salary and bonuses but a range of

salaries   and   bonuses  according  to  appointments   held,

performance and other yardsticks, as also similarly indicated

by the handout by the Prime Minister in respect of bonuses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many also remember that Ministers, just like all big

income  earners, also pay a large income tax which  basically

creams off 26% of their income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many also remember that Ministers are not permanent

tenure holders but individuals whose tenure is decided by the

people once in five years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many also remember that they manage an economy that

has a GDP of $154 billion as of 1999 and a foreign reserve of

about $128 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many also remember that we hold our Ministers

responsible  when anything goes wrong in the country.   If  I

remember  what  happened in 1997, everyone, particularly  the

workers,  was  asking what were our leaders doing  about  the

recession and their loss of jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Sir, not many also remember that we hold our

Ministers responsible when anything else goes wrong  in  this

country.  Literally put, Singaporeans expect our Ministers to

be "Superman".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My call is: let us then pay them what they are worth and

what they deserve.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite these criticisms at home by Singaporeans, many

Singaporeans  I  met overseas usually take pride  in  stating

that  Singapore  has a corrupt free environment  because  our

Ministers and public sector employees are well paid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having added the above, there are two important

issues that I would like the DPM to address, and these are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) whether our well-paid Ministers will continue to

share   the   aspirations  and  concerns  of   the   ordinary

Singaporeans,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 600</b></font><br><br>

particularly  the low-income groups and the disadvantaged  in

Singapore; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) whether the new salary structure is adequate to

attract  and retain the best in Singapore to become Ministers

and political appointment holders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the civil servants' pay

revision.   While I recognise the need for the Administrative

Service to continue to recruit and retain the best talent,  I

think  it  is  the  best approach to ensure  that  the  civil

service  remains the backbone of a good and clean government.

I  am  convinced after my interaction with the Administrative

Service   officers  over  the  years  that  they   are   both

hardworking, have great minds and that they are also creative

and,  most  of all, have the interest of the State  in  their

minds.   Some  are  at  times  mistaken  that  Administrative

Officers  have  a cushy job.  I thought I will  highlight  an

instance   so  that  we  recognise  the  heavy   burden   and

responsibility  that  some  of  our  Administrative  Officers

carry.  While serving on the Inter-Ministerial Committee  for

the  Ageing last year, I gave a tough assignment with a tight

schedule  to  an  Administrative Officer supporting  my  sub-committee.  He produced the required work in 24 hours.   Sir,

I  saw his very red and tired eyes the next day and knew that

he had worked overnight.  I asked him whether this was common

to  him.   And he informed me that he provides administrative

support  to four to five committees usually and this  was  on

top  of his regular job at the Ministry.  I highlighted  this

to  show that we pay them well but we also expect and extract

a  lot  from them.  I am sure that such officers will  be  in

high  demand in the private sector and employers will  pay  a

premium  to recruit men of such quality.  The more  such  men

are  lost  in the civil service, I think the bigger the  loss

for Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Government to ensure that

the  career route to the Administrative Service continues  to

be  fair  for  entry  by  all  others  at  all  levels.   The

Government must ensure that the Administrative Service is not

a closed club of Mandarins who only get admitted

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 601</b></font><br><br>

through Government scholarships or academic excellence.   The

more it remains a closed club, it would invite resentment and

criticism.  It must continue to recruit the best talent based

on academic performance and proven performance.  It must also

continue  to remain open to proven talent at all levels  both

from  other  Government departments of the civil service  and

also from the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My bigger concern is whether our new class of Mandarins

will  lose touch with the average Singaporeans.  With  better

pay  and  bonuses, many will climb the ranks of the  well-off

too  quickly.   I  already sense that many  Singaporeans  are

feeling that our policy making top civil servants are  losing

touch  with the ordinary lives of Singaporeans.   How  do  we

ensure  that they remember that many Singaporeans are working

class  people  with real problems like balancing  their  bank

accounts  every month?  How do we ensure that  they  keep  in

touch  with  the ordinary Singaporeans and not just  the  top

income groups?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, let me move on to the civil service general

salary  revision.  Sir, I support the rise in the  salary  of

all civil servants as it will certainly go towards building a

first class public service.  What I would like to ask the DPM

is  whether exit interviews are conducted when civil servants

resign  from  the civil service.  I am sure many Singaporeans

will  be interested in knowing whether salary was the  reason

for  the  resignation  of the 284 senior  officers  from  the

Senior  Officer  Service so far this year.  The  details,  if

they  are  available,  will  enable  Singaporeans  to  better

understand  the  dollar pull of the private sector.   If  the

reason  disclosed  is  family commitments,  pursuing  further

studies  or  other  reasons,  then  improving  the  financial

package  will  not address the problem.  I do hope  that  the

Government will pay attention to the detailed reason for  the

resignations and take the necessary action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if the Government benchmarks the salary of the

public sector to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 602</b></font><br><br>

private  sector, the public also expects the tough  practices

of  the private sector, such as in the area of human resource

management to be introduced into the public sector.   In  the

private sector, non-performers are given adequate notice  and

shown  the  door.   Some have expressed concern  whether  the

public  sector will be able to fire non-performers.  It  will

be  no  use  if  "non-performers" are  transferred  to  other

departments as such non-performers will only continue to "non-perform"  in the other departments within the public  sector.

Is  the public sector really able to bite the bullet and fire

the non-performers at all levels of the public service?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, with better pay and bonuses, the public

will  expect  even higher standards of public  service.   The

public   will  become  less  tolerant  of  long   queues   at

polyclinics, delays in replies and average service.  I  would

ask  the  DPM  how  the civil service will respond  to  these

expectations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the public sector salary

revisions tabled by the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not by

chance  that the citizens of a small resource scarce  country

can  live peacefully, comfortably and ably, equipping  itself

to face the challenges of the new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not by chance that the Singapore economy made a V-shaped recovery from the recent stormy recession. It is not

by  chance  that we can boast of Ministers of  integrity  and

competence,   and   who   can  carry   themselves   well   in

international forums.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the preservation of a good, efficient and honest

Singapore Government in the new economy is too crucial to  be

left  to chance.  We should put in place a mechanism to  help

nurture  this.  It is on this basis that I rise to  speak  in

support of DPM's ministerial statement.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 603</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to make the following observations:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, Sir, the Government's recognition of the impact

of  the new economy on the Government and the aspirations  of

young  officers is most timely.  What is the new economy?   I

do  not think that anyone can readily claim full knowledge of

the  new  economy, as the very nature of the new  economy  is

that  it  is  ever changing.  But one thing is certain.   The

fast  pace changes will generate opportunities, such  as  the

sprouting  of  dot-com  companies and life  sciences.   These

opportunities  will  come  by swiftly.   Unless  we  position

ourselves well and ahead of time, we run the risk of  lagging

behind  in  the  competition.   Given  our  natural  resource

constraints,  Singapore  cannot  afford  any  slip   in   our

competitiveness.  What this means is that we need to  have  a

government  that keeps pace with new trends and developments,

has  the  capacity and audacity to act promptly,  has  senior

civil servants who are willing to read up on life sciences in

order  to  grow the Singapore economy.  In short, we  need  a

vibrant civil service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The typical image of a civil service is that of an

ageing,  inflexible bureaucracy, a fogy old man  holding  the

reins.   A typical image of the Singapore civil servant  must

be  one  with  the attitude of agent Ethan Hunt in  "Mission:

Impossible  2", highly skilled, IT-savvy, high IQ,  high  EQ,

excellent  network  of  contacts and  gutsy  enough  to  make

calculated risks.  I believe that with the proposal set up in

DPM's statement, we can take heart that we will have to place

a  continual leadership renewal process in the Government.  I

believe  that  the DPM's proposal will help to  maintain  the

average age of senior civil servants.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By instituting a 10-year term, the Government will send

the right signal that it is no longer an iron rice bowl.   It

will  allow Administrative Officers who have completed a  10-year term to bow out gracefully, should they choose to do so.

This  in  turn  will  generate more opportunities  for  other

competent Administrative Officers to rise to the top.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 604</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second observation concerns the review of the salary

benchmarks.  I believe it is a timely exercise and will  even

go  as  far  as to suggest that it should be conducted  every

three to five years.  So far, we have heard ample suggestions

on  how  to compute the Ministers' benchmark.  Which  is  the

most  acceptable  one?  In my opinion,  we  should  not  trip

ourselves  on  the technicalities of the benchmark  formulas.

We should not be overly concerned regarding whether we cut it

fine enough.  Rather we should use the ranking as a sanity or

reality  check  to ensure that the pegging is  at  the  right

level.  For example, the Prime Minister is ranked 63rd  after

the  salary  revision.  Given his duties and responsibilities

as  the Executive Chairman and CEO of Singapore Inc, he  must

be  grossly  underpaid in the marketplace.  Our  Minister  at

Staff  Grade 1 is only ranked 367th, which again  is  grossly

disproportionate as compared to a person of the same  calibre

in  the  marketplace.   And using the ranking  as  a  reality

check,  I  believe  that the proposed benchmark  revision  is

reasonable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that we should not view the remuneration of

our  Government and political leadership entirely  in  market

terms.   I  suggest that we should not deceive ourselves  and

say  that all Government leaders be only driven by their self

sacrificial public service spirit.  Let us be realistic about

it.   Let us try to marry the need to be driven by the market

and public spiritedness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test of the worth of the Government and political

leadership is in times of crisis.  Can they stand  the  test?

They  have  done  so  repeatedly, and  again  in  the  recent

economic  recession.   The  litmus  test  for  the  political

leadership is in the elections, just like the private sector.

If we feel that the management team has done a lousy job, the

shareholders  can  convene  to  dispose  them.   We  have  an

increasingly sophisticated electorate.  I believe  that  they

understand the need for good government.  I believe that they

understand  that  good things never come cheaply.   Likewise,

there is a cost to good leadership.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 605</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the DPM's ministerial statement.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Mr Speaker, the Senior Minister and

the  Prime  Minister  have just earlier shared  with  us  and

reminded  us  of  the  calibre  of  our  Ministers  and   the

achievements of the Government.  Actually, I think there  was

no  real need for that because there is no question that  our

Ministers are deserving and that the Government has done very

good  work.   The question that is troubling me  is  how  you

reconcile the pragmatic approach that we will always take  in

reducing  everything down to economic equations, on  the  one

hand, with our call, on the other hand, to Singaporeans,  and

to  younger Singaporeans especially, to be patriotic  and  to

have a love for their country and to have a commitment to it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two days we have been debating and discussing the

salary  revisions that are just about to be made for our  top

civil servants and Ministers.  Just about one month ago,  the

results  of  the 1999 Labour Force Survey were published  and

they were a reminder for us that things are not all well  for

all Singaporeans.  Much of the discussion that has ensued  in

the  weeks since have focused particularly on the bottom  12%

of households with income of less than $1,000.  Not that much

attention  was  paid  to  the next  category  which  was  the

households  with income of $1,000 to below $3,000.   This  is

another full additional 30% of our population.  While we  are

certainly  not destitute, they are not anywhere close  within

reach  of  what we all consider the good material  things  in

life.   And we all know and recognise that cost will continue

to  increase and that, with this increasing cost, this  group

will  also struggle more and more to be able to afford  these

good  things.  These two groups together comprise a full  42%

of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no argument with the philosophy of paying a

person  his  worth and of the importance of having  the  best

people in leadership.  But with this juxtaposition of earning

capacities right now so starkly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 606</b></font><br><br>

highlighted,  I  strongly and sincerely urge the  Government,

our  top civil servants and Ministers that, as the Government

continues in its work to formulate and implement policies and

programmes, it takes pains to be seen to be sensitive to  the

aspirations   of  and  gives  adequate  weightage   to,   not

alienating, this full 40% of Singaporeans.

<br>5.35 pm

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I thank all the MPs who have  contributed  to

this  debate.  It has been a very good airing and arguing  of

the  issues.  Rather than replying to the MPs one by  one,  I

will  group the issues together into seven separate  sections

and deal with them block by block.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first group of concerns raised has to do with the

quality of the civil service.  Pay them well, yes, but ensure

that they perform.  Prof. Chin Tet Yung argued that selection

for Public Service Leadership positions must be rigorous.  Dr

Vasoo  asked  whether  the  civil  service  quality  will  be

maintained.   He asked whether we have attracted good  people

since the last revision.  And Mr Inderjit Singh, Mr Ravindran

and   several   others  strenuously  argued   for   measuring

performance   and  penalising  non-performers  transparently.

They  did  not  ask  to cane them.  I fully  agree.   And  Mr

Zulkifli  raised the question of free riders,  which  is  the

same  thing.  I fully agree with Members that selection  must

be  rigorous and standards must be high and must be enforced.

And  we  have  not left this to chance since the last  salary

revision.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last five years, since 1995, for the

Administrative Service, we recruited 148 people, that  means,

nearly 30 a year.  We lost 115 for a net gain of 33.   So  we

now have 275 Administrative Officers.  The people who left  - left through resignations, left through retirement - part  of

this  outflow  happened  by itself, or  maybe  even  happened

despite  our  best efforts to discourage good  officers  from

leaving.   But  an  important part of this  outflow  was  the

result of active management, as we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 607</b></font><br><br>

redeployed our people who did not fit into the Administrative

Service  career  track.   So there has  been  a  considerable

amount  of  turnover every year in order to leaven the  group

and to raise the standard of the group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we measure the CEP, the potential of the officers who

are  in  the Administrative Service, five years ago and  now,

there  has  been  a  significant improvement.   Look  at  the

officers  aged  30  and above, when they  have  been  in  the

service  for  some  years and we are  able  to  form  a  good

assessment of their standard and where they can go, how  many

of  them can make it into a Deputy Secretary position, or now

what  we will call a PSL position.  Five years ago, less than

half,  about  46%.  Today, after the turnover and  after  the

recruitment,  63%  have the potential to  make  it  into  PSL

positions, nearly two thirds.  These are regular assessments.

We  have  committees, we have cross-checking, PSC  interviews

the  officers  and  confirms  them.   So  we  are  reasonably

confident that the quality of the service has gone up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we have been discriminating in rewarding the

performers  as opposed to the non-performers in the  service.

We  have the performance bonus.  It has been a valuable  tool

for   making  a  distinction.   Some  MPs  said  it  is   not

transparent.    Is   this  the  way  to   pay   people   more

automatically?   It  is not.  You work for  your  performance

bonus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, the Prime Minister had provided the

distribution  for the Ministers, how many received  how  many

months of performance bonus.  For the Administrative Officers

(AOs),  we  have  divided  them into  four  categories.   "A"

performers, very few; "B" performers, well above average; "C"

performers,  who  get  the base rate,  are  doing  well,  but

average; and sub-performers, who get nothing.  Last year, 234

people  were  eligible to receive performance  bonuses.   "A"

graders, 3; "B" graders, 68.  So to get an "A" or "B"  grade,

you  must  be  at least in the top third.  "C" graders,  155,

most of the rest; but no performance bonus, 8.  So there is a

possibility of your being graded below average.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 608</b></font><br><br>

And  if you continue to deserve zero performance bonus, after

a couple of years, something more drastic will happen to you.

It  is not the quota.  We do not automatically rank everybody

and  say  the  bottom person will forcibly be taken  out  and

shot.   But  we  make a hard-headed assessment  and  we  have

instituted  procedures  to  make  sure  that  hard-headedness

prevails and we do not after a while, out of the goodness  of

our  heart, lower our standards and slacken in what we expect

people to perform.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we will continue to manage the Administrative

Service,  to continue to recruit new talent, and to  continue

to  manage  officers  who do not fit into the  Administrative

Service career path, and retention criteria.  And now that we

have  defined the Public Service Leadership positions,  these

retention  criteria are going to be more stringent.   Because

the  test is: do you have the potential to make it into a PSL

post?  And if so, you stay;  if not, we have to move you.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, notwithstanding the calls for blood and thunder, we

have to handle this carefully and sensitively, because we are

dealing  with good officers and we do not want to  demoralise

the  service.   It is an unavoidable reality.  Not  everybody

who  joins  the  service  will  really  turn  out  to  be   a

satisfactory  and  ideal cut to be an  AO.   Some  work  out,

hopefully  most will; some do not.  And we must take  chances

and  try people out.  Because if everybody who comes in works

out,  my conclusion is that we were too cautious at the entry

point and we must have turned away many people who could have

worked  out, but whom we did not take a chance on.  So  there

must be some expectation of people who came in and have to be

moved  out.   But  not  everybody who  has  to  move  out  is

necessarily failing to make the effort.  We decided to  bring

him  in.  We decided to judge that he might do it.  It turned

out  that he could not.  It is as much our responsibility  as

his.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So therefore, when people leave because of exigencies of

service, or because we have changed our critieria, or because

we have decided to take a chance

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 609</b></font><br><br>

on  him  and it did not work, then we have to look after  him

and  move him in such a way that he maintains his honour  and

his  standing.  Publicly shaming him will be unnecessary  and

counter-productive.  That is not the way you  manage  people.

Of  course,  if  somebody is recalcitrant or  non-performing,

then, by all means, tar and feather him publicly and make  an

example  of him.  But fortunately, while there are  some  bad

performers  or non-performers in the service, the people  who

deserve this extreme treatment are few.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the question of risks and rewards of which

much  has  been made.  Starting with Mr Tay Beng  Chuan,  who

said you cannot compare Ministers and AOs with entrepreneurs,

like  Bill  Gates and Li Kashing, because they venture  their

own  money, they make it, they make it big.  If they do  not,

they  are  totally wiped out.  Fair enough.  But we  are  not

doing  that.  We are comparing Ministers with the executives,

professionals  and  managers,  the  people  working  for  the

entrepreneurs, like Bill Gates or Li Kashing,  and  they  are

paid well in the private sector.  If you are a CEO of IBM, or

Hewlett  Packard, you are paid well.  As Dr  Tan  Cheng  Bock

pointed out, very well in the US.  In Singapore, not quite so

well,  but  still, that is the group we are  comparing  with.

That is the right level which we want to compare with.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Dr Ong Chit Chung pointed out, there is a perception

that  the civil service is an iron rice bowl and the  private

sector  is  much riskier.  I would concede that  the  private

sector  environment is more volatile than the civil  service,

although I would not say that it is more risky than political

office.   Because  in political office, you have  totally  no

tenure  at  all.   You have no contract.   If  you  lose  the

elections,  you are out.  If you lose the confidence  of  the

people, you are finished.  And you cannot just go on to a new

job  easily because, having publicly not worked out, that  is

something  which you carry on your CV for the  rest  of  your

life.  So the comparison is not so extreme.  And if you  look

at the private sector, if you are working for an

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 610</b></font><br><br>

MNC, or a large law firm, or an accounting firm, the risk  is

not  so  large.  It is not one little boat in a great  ocean.

You  are  working on an ocean liner.  IBM may go up or  down.

If  you are Louis Gerstner, you have to turn it around.   But

if  you are a top executive in IBM, working with the company,

then  you  can expect a certain stability which may  well  be

greater than the stability of many governments in the  world.

So there is a point, but it should not be overstated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the test is: with the pay which we have set,

are people leaving the private sector to queue up to join the

public  service?   Or are people queueing  up  to  leave  the

public service and join the private sector?  That is the test

whether  you  have  overpaid  or  underpaid.   And  by   this

criterion,  there  is no evidence that the civil  service  is

overpaying people as a group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way forward out of this issue is to move away from

absolute  job security, and not to pay less because you  have

greater job security.  We have no more iron rice bowls in the

civil service.  I do not know where Mr Seng Han Thong used to

see golden rice bowls.  But I have never spotted any of them.

If  he  does, I would appreciate it if he will let  me  know.

But  what we have done now to move towards less absolute  job

security, less absolute rewards is, firstly, to increase  the

performance  bonus  component substantially.   And  secondly,

with  the Public Service Leadership framework where  we  talk

about  the 10-year period of appointment at the DS level  and

10 years at the PS level, that is a fixed term, rather than a

lifetime  commitment.   It  is  a  major  step  to  take  and

newspapers  have highlighted it and Members have  caught  on,

but  it is a step which we have to take carefully because  it

is a fundamental change and we better consider carefully that

we do not go too far.  We move and assess and, if need be, we

move  further  but it is not something which you  can  adjust

lightly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there is a turnover. Even in the natural course of

events, with the changes we are making, the turnover will  be

there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 611</b></font><br><br>

and  there is an acceptable rate.  It will vary from  service

to  service.   But  if the turnover is too low,  it  is  also

something to worry about.  If you ask me now today, is  there

a  problem,  I  will say, yes, because when you compare  this

year's  turnover  with last year's, it has gone  up  sharply,

whether  it  is  senior officers, whether  it  is  the  other

services, it has gone up, compared to last year, and  nothing

else  has changed except that the gap with the private sector

has  widened.  Therefore, we believe that that  is  the  main

problem.   Talking to the officers confirms  this.   We  also

have  to  make  sure  that other conditions  are  right,  the

challenge  of  the job, the working conditions,  the  way  we

treat  our officers and plan their careers, these are  things

we  have  to look at too, but salary is something  which  you

cannot ignore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when we did our comparison with the private sector,

we  are  not comparing with the top.  We are saying, "Let  us

look  at  the 75th percentile of the private sector  for  the

various  services in the civil service."  How do we  compare?

We  found that the gap was quite large.  In fact, the gap  is

about  20%  but  we  decided  that  we  will  not  close   it

completely.   We  will make this adjustment,  that  is,  13%,

which   I  announced  yesterday,  and  let  us  assess   more

carefully.   Where we need, we can make a greater adjustment;

where we do not, we can just hold it there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third group of questions which MPs have raised is

the possible deleterious side effects of this salary revision

package.   Mr  Ang  Mong Seng and Mr Chew  Heng  Ching  asked

whether the additional personnel cost is provided for in  the

budget.  The  answer is no. However, the budget  surplus  for

this year which has been projected is sufficient to cover the

additional  cost, which is $400 million. Some Ministries  may

need  to  come  back  to  Parliament and  pass  supplementary

budgets in order to pay for this, but it will be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the higher civil service salaries push up the cost

of  utilities, public transport and so on?  Dr Vasoo  and  Mr

Chew Heng Ching asked this.  Because we are paying it out  of

the budget, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 612</b></font><br><br>

increases should not affect the cost of PUB utilities, public

transport  and  so on.  They have to move for other  reasons.

Anyway,  public transport is not Government-run.   Those  are

private  companies.   But  in the cases  where  services  are

provided  on  a cost recovery basis, for example, healthcare,

and where wages are a major component of the cost, then it is

unavoidable that somehow or other patients have  to  bear  at

least part of the wage cost, whether it is 20%, whether it is

15% for the C class or whether it is 100% for the A class.  A

large  part  of  what you pay goes towards  the  doctors  and

nurses,  the hospital staff, not the x-ray machines  and  the

operating  theatres.   But we have no  choice.   If  we  want

better  services, we need to pay the doctors and  the  nurses

properly and this costs money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a letter in the Straits Times recently which

said  that the writer went to queue up at the polyclinic  and

he  was made to wait a long time, and the doctor was harassed

and  packing up her bag while talking to him and so on.   Why

can't he have better services?  But it costs money and one of

the reasons the doctor appeared harassed is because we do not

have enough doctors.  We are not paying enough to the doctors

in  the polyclinics who are doing a heavy and difficult  job,

and  we  will  have to raise the pay of the  doctors  in  the

polyclinic  to improve the service, because the  public  does

not  tolerate poor service either and somehow or other,  this

expense  has  to  be covered.  I saw that Mr  Lim  Hng  Kiang

answered  this question very carefully when he announced  the

doctor's salary revision a couple of days ago, but  it  is  a

reality.   Personal services are expensive and,  in  fact,  a

major  component of cost increases in the developed countries

and it is going to affect us too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Tay Beng Chuan, Dr Vasoo and Mr Chew Heng Ching asked

about  excessive civil service salary increases causing  wage

inflation.   I  would  make  three  points.  First,  we   are

following, not leading the private sector. I have  said  this

again  but it is an important point.  I think we have to  say

it repeatedly.  We are not leading, we are not pushing it up.

But we cannot be left

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 613</b></font><br><br>

behind  too many steps.  One step, yes, three steps, you  can

say that is the Asian style, walk three paces behind.  But if

you continue three paces behind for too long, your system  is

going to run into trouble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I accept that making the Government a more

competitive  employer will mean making it more difficult  for

the private sector to recruit, especially to recruit from the

public service. That cannot be helped. We cannot stand  there

and helplessly watch our lawyers leave, our nurses leave, our

clerks   leave,   our   senior   officers   leave   and   our

Administrative Officers leave and say that this is  good  for

the private sector.  It may be good for the private sector in

the  short  term, but if the Government falls down,  that  is

very  bad  for  the  private sector.   So  we  have  to  stay

competitive.  But we must also make sure that civil  servants

recruited  by  the  Government are employed productively  and

justify  their pay. When we take that person and put  him  in

the  Government, he is actually producing something  and  not

just a drone, not just a parasite. Then he justifies his  pay

because otherwise, we are just going to have a large class of

people sharpening pencils and pushing papers, and we will  be

wasting resources and causing wage inflation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that this year, we have put the

Government salary revision and the NWC award together.  It is

two in one. Traditionally, the NWC award has been a benchmark

for  private sector NWC adjustments.  But this year,  because

the  two  of  them have been put together into  one  package,

which  includes  the  AVC, the extra  performance  bonus  and

monthly  salaries, the total Government package, 13%,  cannot

be  taken as the norm for private sector settlements. We  are

catching up and this package is not only NWC. There is salary

adjustment  to  catch up. The private sector companies  which

have  justification in salary adjustment can argue their  own

case,  but  I do not think it will be fair to use  the  civil

service as a benchmark.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 614</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Simon Tay asked whether we could consult the

private sector when the Government makes pay revisions.  I am

afraid  the answer has to be no. The private sector does  not

consult  us  when they make pay revisions.  We have  no  wage

control or wage freeze and the Government cannot consult  the

private  sector  when we make our pay revision.   It  is  not

possible.  We  have to decide what is right and  we  have  to

judge.  We have the responsibility and we have to answer  for

it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fourth group of questions concerns the basic principle

of paying the market rate for the job.  Mr Tay Beng Chuan was

the first to raise this, talking about the spirit of personal

sacrifice  which  is required because of tripartism,  because

without  sacrifice, leaders will not deserve  respect,  trust

and confidence.  And others too, including Mr Zulkifli and Mr

Chiam,  talked about moral authority.  It is a  basic  point.

There  has  to  be,  and  there is  some  personal  sacrifice

involved in public service, otherwise, it would not be called

public  service. But the sacrifice cannot be so large  as  to

put off able men.  A business leader earns a full wage but he

is  respected for his business acumen, for his organisational

skills,  for his professionalism and the results he produces.

Why  should a political leader not be judged in the same  way

by  his acumen, organisational skill, professionalism and the

results  he produces?  If he is paid nothing and produces  no

results, he deserves no respect.  If he is paid properly  and

he delivers results, I think he is fully entitled to respect.

He  is doing an honourable job. There is nothing improper  or

dishonourable about it.  He should not enrich himself through

public service but why does he have to make a large financial

sacrifice just to prove his credentials?  As Dr Ker  Sin  Tze

has  asked:  can we find people who will do this in  peaceful

times?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Mr Tay Beng Chuan described and the other MPs also

talked  about is indeed the model in many countries.   I  say

"model" in the sense that that is how it works, not that that

is  the  ideal for us to follow.  Actually, in some of  these

countries, it is the other way round.  Politicians

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 615</b></font><br><br>

are  not  respected and the public refuses to support  paying

them  properly and, therefore, they are unable to raise their

wages.  That is why the British Members of Parliament had  to

stand up and say, "We are very embarrassed to talk about this

because  the public will not countenance raising politicians'

wages."  And so too in other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just in Australia recently and the MPs said to me,

"Your  politicians  are paid well."  I said,  "Yes,  we  have

decided  to make it a clean wage." They said, "If we  did  it

here,  we would be sacked.  We would be out."  They  did  not

say,  "Here,  we all volunteer to sacrifice."   But  it  just

could not be done in their environment.  I was talking to  an

American  central banker and he asked about our wages  -  how

big  the gap was.  He said that it was a real problem for him

because  the  politicians' wages are not  moved  up,  so  his

peoples'  wages cannot go up.  There is some sense of  public

service,  so  he still has some good officers.  What  is  the

problem?   Because  they  have  to  send  their  children  to

college.   So what he does is once a person comes in,  if  he

thinks the chap is good, he moves him right to the top of his

scale  immediately. And he says, "You please save this  money

up,  so  when  you reach the top of your career and  you  are

still at that salary point, at least you would have been able

to  accumulate  savings over the last five or ten  years  and

would  be  able to send your children to college.  You  would

not  have to come and tell me that you have to resign to send

your children to college."  So it is a real problem.  As  for

Bill  Clinton,  of whom much was made, the  US  Congress  has

decided  that they are going to double the salaries, starting

with the next President. They could not do it for themselves.

It  is  politically untenable.  But it is a problem and  they

are  going  to double it. When we say we follow the  American

example,  I  think  we should understand  what  the  American

example entails.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have chosen a different formula. It has worked for

us, and I think we better keep it.  I would not shy away from

this  transparency  by moderating the salary  increase  using

supplementary incentives

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 616</b></font><br><br>

and  rewards, as Mr Tay Beng Chuan pointed out. We go  for  a

clean wage.  What we declare is what the Ministers get. It is

more transparent.  It is more sensible.  It is better to  pay

$968,000 and be honest and open about it than to pay a  small

nominal wage and top it up with perks.  Perks cause money too

- to provide maids, cars, houses, free holidays and education

for   children  is  very  expensive.  Besides,  we  will   be

generating  a privileged class of people who then will  start

arguing  what car you are entitled to, which holiday are  you

allowed  to go, can you travel first-class or business  class

on  holiday and so on.  So as Dr Tan Cheng Bock pointed  out,

we show all components.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang said that we are not transparent

enough. What else is there which we have not declared,  which

is not in the Table I handed out yesterday? There is nothing,

that  is  it.   It  is broken down in many  different  pieces

because there are different purposes, bonuses, allowances and

so  on,  but  all  the pieces are declared and  however  many

pieces there are, it adds up to that total sum of money.  And

if  you  want to know what the pieces are, the Straits  Times

has  done  its homework.  Instead of asking your  Legislative

Assistants,  you can look up the Straits Times today  and  it

provides  a  neat little tabulation of what the Superscale  G

salary  consists  of, what the Staff Grade I salary  consists

of. There is nothing else.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going on from the principle, MPs also argued about the

detailed  basis of the benchmark. Mr Iswaran asked:  does  it

include   foreigners?   Does  it  include  bankers  who   are

entrepreneurs?  The answer is no. The benchmark only includes

Singaporeans and also Malaysians who are Permanent  Residents

in  Singapore,  because  that is really  one  labour  market.

Foreigners are out and bankers who are entrepreneurs are also

explicitly  excluded. This has always been the  case,  it  is

nothing new.  Members may have forgotten or may not have been

present at the last debate, I think it is worth clarifying.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another major point made is that the list of top earners

changes every year, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 617</b></font><br><br>

therefore  Ministers earn much more than any person  outside.

Mr  Shanmugam raised this.  Mr Ang Mong Seng said that it  is

like two aeroplanes, one of which is in the air all the time.

Mr  Chiam  See  Tong  raised this,  and  Dr  Tan  Cheng  Bock

suggested that maybe out of the 48, we have 24 people  fixed,

and  24  people change from year to year.  I am not sure  how

you  fix  them, because sometimes they grow old, they  retire

and  sometimes  they  change  jobs.   But  I  understand  the

sentiment of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several answers to this. The first answer is

that Ministers and civil servants also have no permanence. We

are  not  here forever.  We are here while we are  doing  the

job.   When we are no longer the Minister, we are  out.   Our

aeroplane  has  landed.  How much should they be  paid  while

they  are doing the job  -  an amount comparable to what  top

executives with similar responsibilities earn in the  private

sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible to have an alternative approach, as Mr

Zulkifli  has  suggested.   Get a pay  consultant,  make  pay

comparisons,  survey  the  industry,  identify  other   firms

against   which  you  are  comparing  yourself,  benchmarking

yourself  or  against  which  you  are  competing,  and  then

ascertain how much executives in these firms are paid.  It is

a  way  private sector companies do it, and it is a practical

approach.   We  studied it quite extensively in  this  review

before  finally deciding, no, we better go back  to  the  old

approach of highest paid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two reasons. First, because the process

cannot  be  totally  transparent  or  automatic.   There   is

judgment.   You  have  to decide whom  to  include,  whom  to

exclude,  and  you will have to review the list of  companies

from year to year. It is not a fixed list.  Then you have  to

look  at  the companies and say, "Is it a foreigner or  not?"

And  too  much  judgment goes in for it to  be  an  automatic

formula.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that if we do it that way by using

a  private survey, the data would be less reliable  than  the

IRAS' data.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 618</b></font><br><br>

IRAS sees your total pay, or at least they have a fairly good

sense  of what your total pay is.  And if they have any doubt

that  that is your total pay, they will look into the  matter

and  satisfy  themselves  as  to  what  the  truth  is.   Pay

consultants  -  Towers Perrin, A T Kearney or whoever  it  is

-  do not have quite the same binocular and telescopic vision

in  these matters.  They have an impression.  It is not quite

as accurate.  I think, overall, for purposes of automatically

computing  a  benchmark, it is better just  to  use  the  top

earners as a proxy for the leaders in each profession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some bias, because the top earners change from

year  to  year, and there is a certain amount of  randomness.

Maybe  by chance, that person's business was good and he  was

ranked  high  that  year.   But then  so  too  with  the  top

companies, because companies go up, go down, and I will  have

to  continue to compare against the top companies.   We  have

tried to minimise the bias.  First, by increasing the samples

from  24 to 48; secondly, by using the median instead of  the

mean.   And also the two-thirds factor which we apply to  the

benchmark tends to go on the opposite direction to bring down

your numbers.  So that also compensates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, our answer is $968,000, ranked 367th amongst

private sector earners, based on this year's revision  or  if

we  went for the full benchmark, $1.21 million, ranked 206th.

And I think that is an eminently reasonable outcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many other suggestions made by other MPs. Mr

Iswaran  said  why  not  just use the 200th  ranking  private

sector  earner.  Dr Tan Cheng Bock said why not cap the  size

of  the  stock option gains, maybe at $1 million.  We can  do

many  of these things.  Numerically, I think, one way or  the

other, it would come out at about the same place.  But we are

looking  for sound rationale to make the comparison,  because

the  benchmark is not only a numerical formula, it is also  a

statement  of  where  you  peg your Ministers,  in  terms  of

responsibility  and  job scope.  What is  the  group  against

which   we  should  rank  our  Ministers  and  compare  their

outcomes?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 619</b></font><br><br>

And  we say we should rank against the top professionals  and

executives  in  the  private sector with  general  management

responsibilities.  That was the definition in the White Paper

and I think that is the right definition.  In other words,  I

want  to  compare our people  -  the Ministers and the  Staff

Grade  I Permanent Secretaries  -  with people in the private

sector holding that level of jobs with that standing in their

professions.  So I am really talking about the top 24  people

-   four  professions times six.  But to give my number  more

stability,  to  make some adjustment, in  case  the  top  man

happens not to have top pay that year, so, all right, we have

decided  we will go to 48 people instead of 24.   And  it  is

still representative, but stabler.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is different from saying I will aim for number 200

or  367, because I am not aiming just for the number.   I  am

aiming  for  that category and, as I will show later,  number

367  includes  many people in front of it.  As Mr  Noris  Ong

says,  very sensibly, finally, you are looking for a  reality

check.  Do not get caught up on the technical details of  how

the  benchmark is calculated.  Just have a reality check;  is

the  outcome  reasonable, rank 200th for the full  benchmark,

rank  367th  for  the present adjustment?  I think,  on  that

basis, we pass the reality check.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not go for a link to the median per capita

income and multiply by X, as Mr Simon Tay suggested.  We have

a  component in the package which is linked to GDP.  I  think

it  is the most comprehensive single indicator of the overall

performance  of the economy, rather than any sub-group.   And

we  really  want growth, because growth is the first  target.

With  growth, you can have distribution.  If you  start  with

distribution and then hope to have growth, you are getting it

the  wrong way around.  So I would stick to GDP and  I  would

stick  to  the basic principle that we are comparing  against

the top people in the private sector, and that is what I want

to measure against.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the formula, the next question is: is the

quantum reasonable?  This

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 620</b></font><br><br>

question was asked in different ways, firstly, by Mr Seng Han

Thong  and  Mr  Chay  Wai  Chuen  who  wanted  to  know  what

professions are the 366 or 367 people who earn more than  the

benchmark.   The Clerk will now distribute the Tables  (Cols.

631-634) .  We have tabulated them and you can see who  these

people are or at least what professions they are in.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000630/20000630-HA-0720631.htm">Table 1 - Professions of Top 366 Earners (Cols. 631 - 634)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the 366 people who earned more than the

benchmark,  namely, $968,000 in 1998 and  assessed  in  1999.

You  can  see that they belong to a wide range of professions

-   accountants, bankers, manufacturers.  The legal  services

are right at the top, large numbers.  These are the ones that

we  are  comparing against.  The one group we  are  comparing

against,  not figured here, are the engineers who earn  less.

But  then  there  are  many other professions  who  also  are

represented  in  the top 366 people  -  real estate,  medical

services,   ie,   doctors,  computer  services,   hospitality

services,  market  research, luxury  goods,  advertising.   I

think if you ask whether the Minister ought to be better than

some of the people on this list, I would say yes.  And if  he

is  not better than somebody on this list, then he should not

be  a  Minister.  So I think that the figure is a  reasonable

figure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, look at the second page of Tables 2 and 3 (Cols.

635-636),  to  have  a  look  at  what  the  individual   six

professions  in the benchmark actually earn.  Table  2  shows

the  range  of  the  eight people in  each  profession.   The

bankers  earn  $2.2-$4.5  million.   Lawyers  earn  $1.5-$2.8

million.   That is completely typical.  Accountants earn  $2-$2.3  million, and so on.  Engineers earn less  -   $0.5-$0.8

million,  but that is really because a lot of engineers  have

become CEOs of companies and are not captured as professional

engineers on this chart.



<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2000/20000630/20000630-HA-0720635.htm">Tables 2 and 3 - Earning ranges of top 8 earners in 6 professions (Cols 635-636)</a><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you discount for stock option gains because you think

they  are  volatile and discount by 50%, the numbers actually

come  out  about the same.  The only people who are  affected

are  those working in multi-nationals who come down, both the

lowest  and  highest.  And the local manufacturers  who  come

down for the lowest earner.  The highest did not change.   So

it really does not make much

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 621</b></font><br><br>

difference.  I think you can see that a lot of people are  in

these income brackets.  These are not fictitious figures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We excluded doctors from the benchmark but, as you can

see  from  the  list on the first page, there are  a  lot  of

doctors who are in this earning category  -  11 people are in

medical  services.   And  if you  ask  about  the  top  eight

doctors, because Mr Simon Tay mentioned doctors and  I  think

Dr  Michael  Lim  too,  they earn between $1.12  million  and

$2.48  million.   It is a little bit less than  lawyers.   So

doctors  have to care for their patients, not just  care  for

their fees, but doctors do not earn negligible fees, which is

why  we  have had to make significant adjustments to doctors'

salaries in the public sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of stock options which Dr Tan Cheng Bock

focused  on,  I have shown from the Table that they  actually

did  not make much difference in the past.  In the future,  I

think they will make a difference to the multi-nationals,  to

the  local manufacturers.  They were not figured for lawyers,

accountants and engineers because there you are talking about

principal earned income from their partnerships.  So they  do

not get stock options from their partnerships, unless one day

we  allow our law firms to become lawfirm.com.  When that day

comes, we will have another debate in the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the way we are calculating the benchmark now,

namely,  depending  on  the median,  because  we  have  these

professions  -  lawyers, engineers and accountants, at least,

and  probably  also the bankers  for now   -   without  stock

options,  even  if  the people who have  stock  options  have

inflated  options, it is not going to make a disproportionate

move to your median, because they will be the few at the top,

unless all 24 people have huge stock options and therefore it

affects  your median.  If that happens, we will  look  at  it

again.   I  do not think that is imminent.  So the conclusion

from this is that the adjustment is well justified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was one group which I must confess which we

accidentally omitted to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 622</b></font><br><br>

mention  although we did not omit to consider them, and  this

was  pointed  out by Mr Simon Tay and by a few other  Members

privately,  and  this  has  to do  with  the  Nominated  MP's

allowance.   This  will be adjusted in  step  with  the  MP's

allowance,  and so too the NCMP's allowance, proportionately.

We are completely fair and equal in these matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I pay some attention to the speakers whom I

have  agreed with, as opposed to speakers where we have  some

difference of views.  Prof. Chin Tet Yung, Mr Iswaran and  Mr

Ong  Ah Heng urged us to restore the CPF as soon as possible.

I  fully agree.  We have accepted the NWC's recommendation to

bring forward the next step to January 2001, and we have said

that  we will announce in October how big this next step will

be.   We  have to keep faith with the workers.  When we  told

them  that  things were bad and to cut, they cut and  agreed.

Now that things are good and they want to restore it, we also

want  to  restore it, and it has to be restored  as  soon  as

possible.  2% has already come and I look forward to  another

adjustment on 1st January.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think underlying this question is a different

question,   which  was  what  Mr  Sin  Boon  Ann   explicitly

articulated, and that was why we move Ministers' salaries now

before  the  full CPF restoration.  Let me turn the  question

around  and ask:  now that the economy is recovering, is  the

private sector continuing to freeze its salaries?  No, before

CPF  full restoration, it is moving up.  In fact, it  is  one

reason why we are bringing forward the CPF restoration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the private sector is not freezing salaries, should

we  hold back all of the civil service salary revisions until

the  CPF is fully restored?  I think the answer has to be no,

because if we did hold back, we are being unfair to the civil

servants and we are going to lose more good officers, and the

best  ones are the ones who are going to go first.   Then  we

would  have  the  real problem which the MPs worry  about  of

people who are free-riding and under-performing.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 623</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So should we move for the whole public sector but leave

out the Ministers?  I think that would be wrong too.  Because

it would show that we lack faith in our own argument that the

Ministers' pay should follow the benchmark and the  benchmark

should follow the private sector up and down.  We have argued

and  debated this.  We have decided that the benchmark is the

way  to  go because we want to move with the private  sector,

not  automatically up alone, but both up  and  down.   In  an

exceptional  situation when we are faced with  a  crisis,  we

froze the benchmark in 1998 and 1999.  The crisis is past and

the economy is recovering.  It is on the way up.  I think the

right  thing to do is to move for the Ministers' salaries  to

catch up, but 80% of the full benchmark, and we phase out the

adjustment over three years.  I think that is eminently fair.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chay Wai Chuen and Mr Thomas Thomas asked the

Government  to re-commit itself to promoting social  mobility

and   flexibility.   I  fully  agree  with  them.    I   also

particularly  agree with Mr Thomas Thomas  that  in  the  US,

although  income  disparities are large, social  mobility  is

significant.   The US social attitude towards the  successful

ones  who  make it big are positive, because everybody  hopes

also  to  do the same and to rise, and thinks that he  has  a

chance  to get there.  It is the major reason why in  the  US

they  have  social  stability and the income  gap  is  not  a

political problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income distributions are stretching out but this does

not  mean that hope is extinguished.  So long as we keep  our

society  open and we help all citizens to start out  in  life

with  education, good health care, with a home, and  we  give

talent  from all backgrounds every opportunity to succeed,  I

think  that is to our benefit that we have these high  peaks.

They will bring others along and lift up the average for  the

whole society.  If we push the peaks down we are not going to

raise  the  rest  of  the society.   We  are  going  to  push

everybody down.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to continue to look after low income groups and

create  more  jobs for all.  As Mr Ravindran and Dr  Jennifer

Lee said, and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang put it in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 624</b></font><br><br>

Chinese, not only Jin shang tian hua but also Xue zhong  song

tan  not just add a rosette on to your brocade but also  send

coals  in  the snow to a needy person.  I fully  agree.   The

strategy should be what Mr Chay Wai Chuen explained, which is

to  uplift the lower income households and not focus  on  the

income  gap  per se.  What is important is the level  of  the

lower  income group. That Dr Jennifer Lee is able to say  the

$1,000 to $3,000 household income group is something to worry

about  is a great tribute to Singapore.  Because in any other

Asian  country,  if  one  is earning from  $1,000  to  $3,000

household  income,  owning a house  with  a  television  set,

washing  machine, telephone and probably handphone and  a  CD

player,  one  would be very comfortably off.  In China,  they

would  consider  that an enormous achievement,  and  in  many

other  countries in Asia too.  But in Singapore,  because  we

have  succeeded  in uplifting our people en masse,  even  the

lower   income   groups  are  $1,000  to  $3,000   and   have

considerable assets to their name.  I am not saying we should

rest  on our laurels.  We should continue to work and  uplift

this  group  further.  But that this group is  already  in  a

considerably  privileged  position compared  to  any  similar

stratum in any other Asian society, that is not in doubt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the crucial point, which Mr Lim Boon Heng made

eloquently yesterday, that we must attract talent to come  to

Singapore.  We must retain talent, get Singaporeans  back  to

Singapore and we must have good government.  Because  without

good  government, we can have very hardworking  and  talented

people,  but  we  are  going to have a lot  of  hardship  and

suffering.   This is crucial.  The future of all Singaporeans

depends on this and our revisions will help to achieve this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MPs have understood this. Therefore, they have supported

this  policy.   I would like to thank all the MPs  for  their

contributions.   I think what we need to do now  is  to  work

together  with them to raise the standards of public  service

and  Government, to get people who are idealistic, committed,

patriotic and capable to come forward and serve Singapore and

to bring

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 625</b></font><br><br>

about a better future that we all aspire to. [Applause.]

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, may I seek

clarification with the DPM?  I refer to Handout  2  that  DPM

distributed in Parliament yesterday.  Is the salary figure in

that  Table  inclusive of AVC, bonuses, etc?  Is it  a  gross

figure or a basic figure?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> It is a gross figure. It includes

everything.   It  includes  the  monthly  pay,  AVC,  Special

Allowance,  which the Ministers have been getting one  month,

Public   Service   Leadership   Allowance,   which   we   are

introducing, car allowance, which has always been  there  and

is tax free.  So we actually imputed on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 626</b></font><br><br>

top  of the car allowance the amount of tax which would  have

been  paid if it were taxable and added that into the  bundle

as  well the performance bonus and the GDP bonus.  It is  all

listed out in the Straits Times.  Go and check it up there.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before I take the vote, can I just remind

hon.  Members  that we still have a number of  items  on  the

Order  Paper to clear.  So please do not forget to come  back

on Monday.

<div align="center"><b>FINANCIAL SECTOR</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <b>Mr Zulkifli Bin Baharudin</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  (a) what is the status of the process to merge  the

local  banks;  (b) whether there has been any change  in  the

policy  to  encourage local banks to merge; and  (c)  whether

there  are  further liberalization policies to  open  up  the

banking and financial sector.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS' view on bank consolidation remains unchanged - that

the  Singapore market is too small to support more  than  two

major local banks, and that further consolidation and mergers

will  help  banks to achieve economies of scale  and  compete

internationally, or at least regionally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the decision to merge has to be made by

the  local banks' managements and shareholders. MAS can  only

encourage, not dictate. There have been no moves by the local

banks  to  merge  so far. As competition intensifies  in  the

banking industry, through the progress of technology and  our

liberalisation measures, the pressure on banks to consolidate

and rationalise will grow. Alternatively, banks can choose to

become niche players in specific segments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures to open up the domestic banking market that

MAS announced in May 1999 were the first instalment of a five

year  programme to liberalise the industry. MAS  will  review

the position next year before deciding on the next package of

measures.
