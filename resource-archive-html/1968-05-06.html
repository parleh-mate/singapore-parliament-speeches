<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>12.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Prime Minister, Members of the

Government and Back-benchers, I am deeply conscious

of the great honour that lion. Members have done me

in  re-electing  me as Speaker  of  the  House.  In

thanking all hon. Members, may I say how happy I am

that  I  have gained the confidence of  those  hon.

Members   who  were  also  Members  of   the   last

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I was elected Speaker in August 1966, I have

endeavoured to discharge my functions in accordance

with  the  traditions  of  this  high  office.   In

enforcing  Standing  Orders  my  rulings  may,   on

occasion,  have appeared to be harsh. In  accepting

them as they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>



have, hon. Members appreciate that Standing Orders

govern our business. To those Members taking their

seats for the first time, I would say the only way

not to be overawed by Standing Orders is to be

familiar with them. In this regard, I know hon.

Members will receive all help from the older

Members and from the staff of Parliament. They will

always be ready to help you, as indeed I am, for,

as Speaker, I am servant of the House. In that

spirit, I thank hon. Members again.



<br><br>12.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, hon. Members join me in extending you

our congratulations and our co-operation on your



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



re-election to the Chair. It is nearly  two  years

since  you  were first elected to the office.  Your

experience  as  Speaker  must  be  unique.  In  two

successive Parliaments you sat over a House without

an  Opposition. First, the Opposition boycotted the

House.  Next, they boycotted the general elections.

But in spite of the extraordinary circumstances,  a

legislative   chamber  without  the   stimulus   of

provocative criticism, those of us who were in  the

last  Parliament  are  confident  that  under  your

guidance,  this  House will keep the  parliamentary

machine  in  good  shape,  and  also  sustain   and

cultivate the attitudes of tolerance and calculated

deference to opposing views.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who are natural optimists, or not long

acquainted  with the social science of  psephology,

may  believe that the return of all 58 Members from

the  P.A.P, reflects the unanimity of views amongst

people outside. My colleagues and I, who have  gone

through more harrowing times, cannot afford  to  be

so naive, or so ingenuous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1963, the pro-Communist groups, under the

banner  of the Barisan Sosialis collected  over  30

per cent of the votes and 13 out of 51 seats. True,

their  fortunes have declined. This is  partly  the

result  of our social and economic policies, partly

the   result  of  higher  political  sophistication

amongst  the  voters. But it is mainly  because  of

their   own   irrational  rigid  orthodoxy,   their

obsequious subservience to directives from outside.

They  have mechanically chanted ridiculous  slogans

and  asserted  incredible untruths - that  Malaysia

does  not  exist, that "Malaya" includes Singapore,

and that the Republic is a sham.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even so, had the Communists decided to contest the

elections  through the Barisan Sosialis,  or  other

front  organisations, like the Communist-led  trade

unions,  or  the  old  boys' associations  and  the

cultural groups, I would not have been surprised if

they  had collected over 15 per cent of the  votes,

which would have ensured them some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



six  to  eight seats in this House. If they persist

in  orthodoxy, and their orders continue to  be  as

unrelated to the realities of the situation in  and

around Singapore as they have been in the last five

years,  and  more  important, if our  economic  and

social  policies make the progress they  have  made

over  the  last  five  years, then  by  1973  their

electoral support may further sink down perhaps  to

below  10  per cent. But I doubt if I can  give  as

cheerful  an estimate in the corresponding  decline

of  their  cadre  strength. One of  the  subsidiary

reasons why their electoral support has declined is

that   they   have  withdrawn  their  trained   and

experienced  cadres  from open  front  activity  to

conserve their strength for future deployment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of the 58 Members in this House, 26 Members

have  never  known what it is to be in a Parliament

with   an  Opposition.  Indeed,  16,  having   been

returned unopposed, have never known the rough  and

tumble  of a contested election. To them, I commend

Hansard,  the report of proceedings of  this  House

since  May 1955, particularly the years 1955, 1956,

1959,  1961 to 1963. In 1955, the Governors stopped

presiding over sessions of the Legislative Council.

A mainly elected Legislative Assembly of 32 Members

of  whom 25 were elected was allowed to meet  under

an independent Speaker. Three Members were from the

P.A.P.  I  am  the  sole  survivor  of  that  first

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the clerks of Parliament and I have

personal   knowledge   of   the   boisterous    and

rumbustious past of this House. There was no dearth

or  differences  of  opinions, or  independence  of

views,  sometimes sincerely, and often  vehemently,

held.  Hansard  records the  clash  of  minds,  the

exchange of retorts courteous and not so courteous,

the conflict of ideas and ideologies, and the face-to-face confrontation of the exponents of different

ideologies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They reveal all the bounce, the abrasiveness and

the  self-confidence that Singapore had  and  still

has.  They  made for lively meetings. Debates  were

often bitter and vicious. The fact that we now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



have  such  a homogeneous group in 58 Members  does

not   mean   that  it  will  remain  so  hereafter.

Opposition in this Chamber will and must inevitably

return.  But the Opposition will not be individuals

claiming to act as the conscience of the people, or

offering  themselves as the necessary accoutrements

of parliamentary democracy on the spurious argument

that,  because  there  is no Opposition,  therefore

there  is no parliamentary democracy. Singapore  is

not that gullible and credulous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition, when it returns, will comprise a

group  offering an alternative policy, and offering

themselves as a credible alternative government  to

implement  the  policies they expound.  This  could

come  about in one of two ways, one less  desirable

than the other. First, it could come as a result of

severe  economic setbacks, the failure to meet  and

overcome the problems coming upon us in the  l970s.

Then  the  Opposition that emerges will be extreme,

either  orthodox  Communist  or  revisionist,   or

Trotskyite. Then divisions will be sharp and angry,

and the country the worse for it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the more desirable alternative, economic

success  and enhanced social stability, and further

reduction  in  electoral support for  Communist  or

extremist  policies. With stability and prosperity,

the sense of national urgency and unity which binds

together  a  people faced with common danger,  will

slacken and a more relaxed mood will set in. A  new

restlessness will bestir the people, a  desire  for

improvement and change, or just change for change's

sake,  will  appeal  to a younger  generation.  The

emergence of a party or parties either to the  left

or  right of the P.A.P, must result. But they would

be constitutional alternatives, willing to work the

system, prepared to compete and attain power within

the  system, and to surrender it by the same  rules

through which they came into office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the crucial 1970s, it is as well that in

the P.A.P, we hold together in national consensus a

wide  cross-section  of  our  society,  from  semi-skilled and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



skilled   workers  like  the  Members  for  Kampong

Kembangan  and Geylang Serai, both former employees

of the Singapore Telephone Board and leaders of its

union,  clerical groups represented by the  Members

for  Kallang and Toa Payoh, teachers and principals

like  the  Members for Telok Blangah and  Moulmein,

university  lecturers  and  professors   like   the

Members  for  Katong, Joo Chiat and  Alexandra,  to

professional men and business executives  like  the

Members  for Bukit Panjang, River Valley and  Jalan

Kayu.  Our task, Mr Speaker, is to help you ensure

that  the  parliamentary machine is well-maintained

and  tuned to meet the new circumstances that  will

evolve in the 1970s.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that hon. Members will debate

matters  before them frankly and freely. More  than

half  of  hon. Members, however, have  never  taken

part  in  a debate with an Opposition like that  we

had  from  1961 to 1963. Then attack was  not  only

venomous  and sharp, but ruthless and unprincipled,

and criticism was intended not to point out defects

and secure improvements but designed electorally to

kill  and  destroy the other side by fair means  or

foul. Hon. Members will have to learn and practise,

as  much outside as inside Parliament, the cut  and

thrust  of  debate, the retort and  rejoinder,  the

rebuttal  and  riposte. I am  told  that  simulated

flying  in  a cockpit is nearly the same  thing  as

actually  flying an aircraft, except for the  eerie

feeling  a  pilot gets when he finds himself  aloft

and alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than four years from 1955 to 1959, I was

a Member of this Chamber occupying the seat, if not

the  title, of Leader of the Opposition.  At  every

crisis,  crowds thronged the Gallery to  watch  the

Government  being castigated and  whipped  for  its

many  misdemeanours. I changed  places  and  became

Leader of the Government from 1959 onwards. It  was

our turn to be pulverised. From 1961 to 1963 crowds

were  drawn  like  a magnet to this  Chamber,  some

waiting outside to hear, if they could not see, the

pack of Barisan wolves come in for the kill of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 11</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P. lamb.  I  do not believe that  these  large

numbers    of   pro-Communist   sympathisers    and

supporters have all vanished or been converted just

because  they  left disappointed,  as  the  Barisan

wolves were chastised in the encounter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst this will not be

a  Parliament  with the suspense and excitement  of

its  earlier  years, nevertheless,  there  will  be

momentous times ahead for all of us, and this House

will  have  enough  drama if  not  anxiety  in  the

crucial years ahead. Hon. Members will speak  their

minds freely and forcefully. Our future is at stake

and  we  must give the lead in thinking and feeling

in  the  country. If the new Members we now welcome

to our fraternity learn and drill themselves, there

is  no reason why, when actual blood is drawn in  a

subsequent Parliament, that it should not  be  from

the other side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, may you preside over us to a

more secure and triumphant Third Parliament.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Coomaraswamy (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I thank you, Mr Prime Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to report to the House that the President

will be in this House at 7 o'clock this evening  to

address Parliament. The business set down for  this

morning  being concluded, I now suspend  the  House

until 7 p.m.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President (accompanied by two A.D.C.s) entered

the  Second  Clerk-Assistant,  the  Clerk-Assistant and the Clerk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Clerk announcing "The President", the

President delivered his Opening Speech.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>7.04 p.m.



<div align="center"><b>PRESIDENT'S SPEECH</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The President (Inche Yusof bin Ishak)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Honourable  Members,  we  are  met  today  after  a

general  election  in which 51  Honourable  Members

were  returned unopposed and the rest,  seven  from

the  same  party,  returned with clear  majorities.

This  is  a Parliament which is faced with problems

of  more  than  usual magnitude.  It  is  not  only

because  Britain will be withdrawing her forces  by

the  end  of 1971. The whole security and political

situation  in South and Southeast Asia  is  in  the

process  of  change. The balance of  forces,  which

have more or less held the position since 1954 when

the  French  relinquished power over the  whole  of

Vietnam, and the Americans stepped into the  breach

in  the  south, is now poised for a possible  major

shift.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momentous changes in the political and security

pattern  of  the region have already  been  set  in

motion.  By  the end of the term of this Parliament

in  1973,  it  is  probable that new  security  and

political  patterns  would have  begun  to  emerge.

Peace  and  security will have to be ensured  under

different circumstances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These historic events will have a profound

influence  on  our  future.  Perhaps  it  was   the

awareness  of this that made Singapore vote  almost

unanimously for the P.A.P. In the next five to  ten

years,  issues of life and death will be determined

more   by   factors  around,  rather  than  within,

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(In English)</i>: My Government will seek to achieve

three objectives:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, optimum use of the time available to build

up   an  effective  defence  capability  which,  in

conjunction   with   Malaysia   and    our    other

Commonwealth   partners,  can   ensure   continuing

security.  This  must be done at minimum  cost,  so

that  most  of our resources will go into  economic

development. It means that, although we have  small

numbers  on  active service, we  shall  have  large

numbers in the reserve service. These



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



reserves will be well and regularly trained,  ready

for   combat,  but  otherwise  they  will   be   in

productive employment, contributing to the economic

growth and progress of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, greater economic growth, higher

productivity  with the elimination  of  restrictive

practices,  abuses  of fringe  benefits,  and  more

efficient management. With ever lower costs we must

reach  out for more export markets. The continuance

and  consolidation of stable political  and  social

conditions,  sensible  relations  between   labour,

management  and  government,  these  are  the  pre-conditions   for  increased  investments   in   the

industrial   and   servicing  sectors   to   create

meaningful jobs for ever-increasing numbers of  our

more educated citizens seeking better jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, enhancement of national consciousness of

the problems that will come upon us in the next few

years.   We  must  all  learn  to  place   national

interests  above  personal or sectional  interests.

Internally,    high   morale   -   internationally,

confidence   in   our  continuing   stability   and

efficiency  -  this combination will enable  us  to

achieve new records in high performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broad outlines of policy for each Ministry in

my  Government are set out in an addendum* to  this

Address. To sum them up, it is to get  full  value

for  every dollar spent. To do this, everyone

must put in a full day's work for a full



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Cols. 15-32.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>



day's  wage.  Sacrifice and greater  effort  in  an

emergency comes naturally to those who seek  group,

as against individual, salvation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resilience, resourcefulness and the

indomitable spirit we have demonstrated in the last

decade,  they  will  enable  us  to  overcome   the

problems  following in the wake of changes  in  the

security  and economic conditions of the region  we

live in. These problems appear daunting only to the

faint hearted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would wish Honourable Members to speak

in  forthright terms to reflect and more  important

to  lead  thinking and feeling in the  country,  to

ensure that everyone understands the challenge  and

gives of his best.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish Honourable Members a rewarding five years.

May  your  deliberations and  decisions  leave  the

Republic the more flourishing and secure at the end

of your term.



<br><br>7.14 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the conclusion of the President's speech, Mr

Speaker,  preceded  by the Serjeant  at  Arms,  the

Clerk,  the  Clerk-Assistant and the Second  Clerk-Assistant,

escorted the President (accompanied  by

two  A.D.C.s)  out of the Chamber,  and  the  House

adjourned  without question put,  pursuant  to  the

Standing Order.

<div align="center"><b>MEMORANDUM PRESENTED TO PARLIAMENT AS AN ADDENDUM</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>TO THE ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outlines of policy on matters of finance,

defence,  foreign affairs, industrial and technical

training and technological education, have  already

been set out in speeches by respective Ministers.

<br><br>

<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF LABOUR</b></div>

<br><br><i>Comprehensive Labour Legislation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comprehensive Employment Bill will be introduced

in   Parliament.  The  Bill  will  standardize  and

regulate the terms and conditions of employment for

all  employees  irrespective of  whether  they  are

workmen, clerks or shop assistants and the existing

Labour   Ordinance,  1955,  the   Shop   Assistants

Employment   Ordinance,  1957,   and   the   Clerks

Employment Ordinance, 1957, will be repealed. Among

other  things  the  Bill will  provide  a  standard

working   week  of  44  hours  for  all  employees,

regulate overtime work, to enable a wider spread of

employment, limit certain fringe benefits to lessen

abuses  and increase productivity and promote  more

industrial growth.



<br><br><i>Central Provident Fund</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to mobilise domestic savings to be

employed  in our counter recession strategy.  Under

consideration are selected increases in  the  rates

of  Central Provident Fund contributions and a  new

range   of   contributors  covering  all  employees

including those in Government and Statutory  Boards

in  addition  to their pensions or other  provident

fund benefits and self employed persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently a scheme is being worked out between

the  Ministry and the Housing and Development Board

to enable balances in the present Central Provident

Fund to be set off against the first instalment  of

Housing   Board   flats.  The  additional   Central

Provident Fund contributions can be used to pay off

monthly instalments of both Housing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



and Development Board and privately built homes. It

is estimated that about 60 per cent of the 2, 3 and

4-room tenants of the Housing and Development Board

flats  will  thus  be  enabled  to  purchase  their

present flats. The lowering of assessments is  also

being  considered to make the home ownership scheme

attractive.



<br><br><i>Training</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hotel and Catering Training Centre will be

extended  to train waiters, barmen, room  stewards,

receptionists and cashiers for the expanding  hotel

and  catering  industry. Technical  assistance  had

been  sought under the Colombo Plan and the  I.L.O.

for  the expansion of the Training Centre. Soon the

training  of cooks and courses for supervisory  and

management personnel will also be conducted at  the

Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A crash programme for the retraining of redundant

base workers was started in April this year at  the

Singapore   Vocational  Institute,   the   Economic

Development Board's Workshop, Polytechnic and at  5

secondary technical schools. These training courses

will equip retrenched workers with the basic skills

in  various trades. Further, steps have been  taken

to establish industrial training centres which will

be   equipped  with  modern  machinery  to   enable

trainees  to  gain  actual  production  experience.

These  centres  will offer training and  retraining

facilities  not only to our citizens retrenched  by

the British Services but also to school-leavers who

desire   to  acquire  industrial  skills   to   get

employment in blue collar jobs.



<br><br><i>Manpower Planning</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Manpower Planning Committee will be established

to  study  the supply and demand position in  depth

and  breadth. The studies will embrace  educational

and  training requirements and supply the necessary

information for comprehensive manpower planning.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In education, the available resources of the

Government  will  be  directed mainly  towards  the

following targets: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A reorganisation of the secondary school

system  to  divert  a much larger  number  of

students    to   technical   education    and

vocational  training.  A  Cabinet   Committee

with  the Minister for Education as Chairman,

Minister    for   Science   and   Technology,

Minister for Labour and Minister for  Finance

has  been  set  up to supervise the  planning

and    co-ordination   of    technical    and

vocational training on a national basis  with

the  object of avoiding duplication of effort

and  ensuring  that technical  education  and

vocational   training  will   be   keyed   to

manpower needs and employment opportunities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A concerted effort to produce effectively

bilingual  school -leavers  to  ensure  wider

opportunities   for  higher   education   and

employment   in  our  multi-racial   society.

Increasing  use will be made  of  the  second

language as a medium of instruction.  As  far

as    possible,   students   in   non-English

language   schools  will  study  mathematics,

science  and  technology  in  the  medium  of

English  and  the humanities through  one  of

the   other,  either  their  mother  language

Malay,  Chinese or Tamil. In English language

schools,  the  mother  tongue  will  be  more

extensively    used    to    make    students

effectively literate and fluent in  a  second

language.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Increasing emphasis on quality at all levels

of  education to make up for shortcomings  in

the past necessitated by the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



unprecedented  rate  of  expansion   in   the

school  system to provide a place  for  every

child. Now that this quantitative target  has

been  achieved, attention will be  turned  to

qualitative  improvement in  such  fields  as

curriculum  reform,  textbooks  and  teaching

aids,  teaching techniques, teacher  training

and    re-training,   examinations,    health

education,   physical  education,   art   and

music,  and all forms of extramural activity.



A   few  well-established  secondary  schools

will  be converted to single-session schools,

so  that  maximum use may be made by students

of  laboratories,  school libraries,  playing

fields and other amenities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Integration of the 4 language streams is to

be   extended   to  aided  schools   wherever

possible.  The  policy of integration,  which

has  helped to overcome the language barrier,

has   so  far  been  confined  to  Government

schools  only. Ways and means will  be  found

to introduce the system to aided schools.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF COMMUNICATIONS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The geographic and strategic importance of

Singapore  gives  us  an  edge  in  the  field   of

transportation and communications.



<br><br><i>Marine</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, a record number of 28,496 vessels or

117.3 million net registered tons of shipping  used

our  port  facilities. Singapore became the  No.  1

port in the Commonwealth and moved from 5th to  4th

port in the world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proper terminal facilities for ocean-going

container  vessels  at the East  Lagoon  have  been

under  construction at a total  cost  of  over  $77

million. They will be operational by 1970.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The efficiency and productivity of our port, both

workers  and  management, must be  demonstrated  in

quicker turn-round of ships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been considerable progress in

shipbuilding  and ship repairing  business  at  the

Port  of  Singapore Authority Dockyard, at  Jurong,

Kallang and Tanjong Rhu shipyards. This is a highly

labour  intensive  industry.  The  naval  base   at

Sembawang  will  be  converted  into  a  commercial

dockyard,  even whilst the Royal Navy is using  the

Base. This conversion work may commence this year.



<br><br><i>Telecommunications</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has long been a major regional and world

centre  for telecommunications. To keep abreast  of

satellite   communications,  we  have  decided   to

install an Earth Satellite Station in Singapore  to

be  operational  by  1970.  This  station  will  be

supplementary to the Seacom cable system.  It  will

enable  Singapore  to obtain direct  link  via  the

Indian   Ocean   Satellite  with  other   similarly

equipped  countries from Japan and America  in  the

East to Britain and Europe in the West.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to normal telecommunication

facilities, the Earth Satellite Station can provide

a  means  for  the  reception and  transmission  of

television  programmes,  thus  enabling   Singapore

viewers  to  link  up  with  the  main  centres  of

civilisation the world over.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Telephone Board has over 108,000

telephones and 76,000 direct lines are in  service.

98 per cent of subscribers are now connected to the

automatic Subscriber Trunk Dialling Service  (STD).

The Singapore Telephone Board will have not only to

expand   its  services  to  keep  pace   with   the

increasing  demand  for its services  but  also  to

improve   its   standards   of   maintenance    and

efficiency.



<br><br><i>Aviation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1967 was a record year with 964,244 passengers (25

per  cent  increase  over the  previous  year)  8.6

million  kilos of air cargo (11 per cent  increase)

and 1.8



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



million kilos of mail (26 per cent increase)  being

handled by our airport authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-one international airlines run scheduled

services  through Singapore and work is in progress

for the extension of the runway from 9,000 feet  to

11,000 feet to get Singapore Airport to receive the

jumbo jets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modern equipment such as Visual Approach Slope

Indicators,  Instrument  Landing  System   and   an

Airport  Location  Beacon have been  or  are  being

installed to maintain high standards of safety  and

efficient   operation.   An  aircraft   engineering

facilities building is nearing completion.



<br><br><i>Postal Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A record 192 million articles of mail were handled

by   our  Postal  Services  during  1967.  We  must

maintain  high standards of efficiency  under  even

heavy loads of mail traffic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following agency services were continued

during the year, namely: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) collection and payment of Central Provident

Fund contributions,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) payment of Social Welfare Public Assistance

allowances,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) payment of civil pensions and allowances for

Army and Air Force personnel.



<br><br>Legislation is being drawn up to permit renewal  of

driving licences at post offices, on behalf of  the

Registrar of Vehicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five new Post Offices (2 of which will be

replacement  offices) will be built by  1969,  thus

bringing the total number of Post Offices to 44.



<br><br><i>Road Transport</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offices of the Registrar of Vehicles at Middle

Road  will  be  reorganised in order to  streamline

work  procedures and to ease congestion  for  large

numbers of licence holders who regularly pay  their

dues at this office.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new driving licence testing centre is being

built  in  Queenstown expected to be  completed  by

November this year. This should relieve the present

congestion at Maxwell Road centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help reduce traffic congestion, the services of

2  officials from the London Transport  Board  have

been obtained under the Colombo Plan Technical  Co-operation Scheme to advise on possible solutions to

our growing passenger transport problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be an intensification of the campaign

to  stamp  out  the smoke nuisance (air  pollution)

from  motor  vehicles  and to  improve  Road-Safety

consciousness   amongst  road   users   to   reduce

unnecessary heavy casualties on the roads.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 21</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF CULTURE</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get our people better prepared and to

participate  more  in the immense  national  effort

required in the crucial years ahead, the mass media

of  Radio,  Television  and  publications  will  be

improved and expanded. The Library, the Museum, the

Printing  Office together with Radio and Television

will  not  only inform, entertain and  educate  but

will also stimulate patriotism, public-spiritedness

and  the  importance of increased productivity.  An

appreciation  for  dancing, music,  art  and  other

cultural   and   artistic   activities   will    be

assiduously   encouraged  especially  amongst   the

young.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Museum which will now come under the Ministry

of  Science  and Technology will be  modernised  to

serve  as an educational centre displaying in vivid

manner  the  rich  political, social  and  economic

history  not  only of Singapore but  of  the  whole

region of which we are the fulcrum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Library facilities will be expanded. Work on a

branch library will start later in the year. Mobile

library services will reach more people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magnitude of the tasks ahead, and the need to

carry  the  people with us in the new  policies  to

meet these



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



tasks   increases   the   need   for   good    mass

communication media. Television and Radio  will  be

elevated  into  a  separate  Division  within   the

Ministry  of  Culture  under a  separate  Permanent

Secretary.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 22</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF SOCIAL AFFAIRS</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increase in Defence expenditure in the coming

years  will necessarily limit expansion  of  Social

Welfare services. To make the best available use of

the  vote  on  Social  Welfare  services,  the   12

institutions   operated  by  the   Social   Welfare

Department will be encouraged to provide their  own

domestic  services  instead of  depending  on  paid

staff.  Residents of Homes will also be trained  to

undertake  work, the proceeds of which will  assist

in paying for the running of the Homes. Examination

will   be  undertaken  to  see  that  the  services

provided   in   the  Social  Welfare   Department's

Children Centres and Creches are not duplicated  by

similar  services  provided by other  organisations

and  voluntary  welfare bodies.  Voluntary  welfare

organisations will be encouraged in their  work  to

provide  services to the handicapped, the  disabled

and  the  aged in our community. Steps have already

been  taken  to  increase the number  of  voluntary

helpers in these voluntary institutions and in  the

Social  Welfare Department Homes. It is encouraging

to  note  that more of our women are coming forward

to  undertake voluntary welfare work in the way  as

our young men are undertaking National Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater emphasis will be given to sports. A Sports

Division has been created, to promote and encourage

sports in Singapore. The National Sports Stadium at

Kallang,  piling  work  for which  is  still  being

carried out at present, is expected to be completed

by the end of 1970. This will be the centre for the

training  of all our students from all schools  and

universities  who  show promise.  Coaches  will  be

employed for the various games and sports to  raise

the standards of performance in athletics, swimming

and games.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF LAW</b></div>



<br><br><i>Public Utilities</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The growth of the Public Utilities Board's

operations in recent years has been unprecedented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electrical sales have risen at an annual rate of

15  per  cent. Of this, the demands from industries

have increased at a phenomenal rate of 23 per cent.

To  meet  this, the Public Utilities  Board  having

completed the construction of the Pasir Panjang `B'

Power  Station in 1966, has now begun  construction

of  the  Jurong Power Station. The first two  units

will  be completed in 1969 at a total cost  of  $82

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Johore River Waterworks was commissioned in

July  1967.  Work  has  commenced  on  the  Seletar

Project,  which will be completed in 1970.  Several

other  projects  to increase yield and  storage  in

Singapore are under way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An indication of the rapid expansion is that $63

million was in 1967 for capital development, whilst

$140 million is budgeted for 1968.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 23</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT</b></div>



<br><br><i>Housing</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The target of the Second Five Year Housing

Programme  (1966-70) of the Housing and Development

Board has been the building of 12,000 flats a year.

This  target has been more than achieved.  However,

in  view  of  the continued demand for more  public

housing,  both for rental and for sale to citizens,

under  the "Home Ownership Scheme", the Board plans

to  build  up  to  16,500 units per  year  for  the

remaining period of the Second Five Year Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board at present manages some 100,000 housing

units   accommodating  a  quarter  of   our   total

population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The biggest project now under development is Toa

Payoh  New  Town.  Approximately 8,000  units  have

already  been completed. A further 7,000 units  are

under  construction.  Extensive  sites  have   been

cleared  and  the piling for more buildings  is  in

progress. When this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 24</b></font><br><br>



new town is completed in 1970 - 71, it will provide

modern homes for more than 200,000 people with  all

the modern amenities for comfortable living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more Housing Board flats will be offered

for  sale.  The  Government  and  the  Housing  and

Development  Board are working  out  new  ways  and

means to enable as many sitting tenants as possible

to buy their own homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Housing Board has so far built 3 blocks of

flatted  factories - 2 blocks in Kallang Basin  and

one  in  Tiong  Bahru.  In  consultation  with  the

Economic  Development Board, more flatted factories

will be built in the next four years to accommodate

labour  intensive  industries  in  or  adjacent  to

housing  estates.  The  demand  for  this  type  of

flatted factories has been steadily growing because

of  its  advantageous position next  to  large  and

convenient  sources  of  labour  from  the  housing

estates in the neighbourhood.



<br><br><i>Land Reclamation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Republic's major land reclamation scheme along

the  East Coast is progressing satisfactorily. When

completed in 1970 more than 1,000 acres of  coastal

land stretching from Bedok to Tanjong Rhu for about

6 miles will he added. Apart from the major coastal

highway  that has to be constructed, plans are  now

being examined to ensure the optimum usage of  this

land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other reclamation scheme at the Kallang Basin

which  entails the filling of the tidal swamp  with

earth  from  Toa Payoh will be completed  in  1969.

This  will  yield  some  380  acres  of  land   for

industrial and housing development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work on one other reclamation scheme at Pasir

Panjang   adjacent  to  the  Haw   Par   Villa   is

commencing.  Several  other schemes  at  Woodlands,

Nicoll  Highway,  Bedok to Tanah  Merah  Besar  are

under detailed investigations.



<br><br><i>Urban Renewal and Redevelopment</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire Central Area of the City of about 1,700

acres  has been divided into 17 precincts,  grouped

mainly in 2 localities in relation to the position



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



North and South of the Singapore River. The plan is

to  redevelop the older parts of this whole Central

Area  systematically in stages  over  a  period  of

years. Under the Second Five-Year Development Plan,

an estimated total of $125 million will be spent on

the   development  of  the  initial  2   precincts,

referred  to  as N.l (Crawford) and  S.1  (Outram).

Work  in  these 2 precincts began in  1966  and  is

progressing smoothly. In Precinct N.l, 3 blocks  of

multi-storey flats and shops at Palembang Road have

been completed and when occupied will transform the

skyline of this once dilapidated area into a modern

high  rise centre. In Precinct 5.1, on the site  of

the  old  Outram  Prison, 8 blocks of  multi-storey

flats  and  shops and another 4 blocks  of  lock-up

shops are nearing completion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the complete success of urban renewal

includes  substantial participation by the  private

sector in high quality buildings. To encourage  and

promote  this, administrative changes and incentive

measures   have  been  introduced.   For   example,

approved  projects such as hotels, office buildings

and  luxury  apartments in designated  areas,  will

have  property tax reduced to 12 per cent per annum

for 20 years. In addition, a legislation will be re-introduced to enable genuine developers to  recover

their   rent-controlled  properties  in  designated

areas  for redevelopment. Tenants of these affected

premises  will be compensated fairly, and  will  be

given   adequate   time  to  move  to   alternative

accommodation    which   includes    Housing    and

Development Board premises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sale of State lands by public tender of 14

strategic  sites  suitable  for  a  wide  range  of

projects   from   hotels,  entertainment   centres,

floating   restaurants  to  office  buildings   and

shopping  centres on attractive terms has  resulted

in  7  out  of the 14 sites offered being sold.  In

addition,  negotiations have now  reached  a  stage

where 3 more sites along the "Golden Mile" may soon

be  taken up for hotel development. Plans  are  now

being  made to release more State lands for private

development to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



meet a wide range of high quality development.



<br><br><i>Physical Planning and Building Control</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The State and City Planning Project assisted by

the  United Nations Development Programme  (Special

Fund)  has  been launched and will  operate  for  4

years to produce comprehensive long-range land  use

and  transportation plans which will provide proper

guidance,  and greater flexibility in  the  control

and  use  of our scarce land resources. Whilst  the

long-range  concept plans are being  formulated  by

the technically skilled experts associated with the

Project,  the  day-to-day control of land  use  and

development  is still subject to the  Master  Plan.

The Planning Department and the Development Control

Division   of   the   Chief   Building   Surveyor's

Department  will ensure that plans for  development

are approved more expeditiously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrative reforms to streamline control

procedures will enable planning applications to  be

processed with the minimum of delay. Planners  will

review  and relax wherever possible plot ratio  and

density controls so that our limited land area  can

be   more  intensively  utilised,  provided   other

planning criteria are satisfied, and developers are

prepared to pay the requisite development charge.



<br><br><i>Public Works</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The traditional role of the Public Works

Department   as   a  Government  agency   for   the

maintenance   of   public   buildings    and    the

construction  of bridges, roads, schools,  clinics,

etc, has to be widened to assume a more active role

in  providing  suitable  basic  infrastructure  for

increased economic development. During the  next  4

years  the Public Works Department will execute  an

expanded  programme  of  public  works  which  will

entail  an  additional expenditure of $250  million

for  1968 - 70 over and above the current provision

in the Second Five-Year Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's major flood alleviation scheme at

Bukit  Timah after years of preparation was finally

launched in 1967.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



When completed it will relieve the flooding in  the

Bukit  Timah  area by diverting waters into  Sungei

Ulu Pandan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasing needs of the new housing estates

and  industries demand that the sewerage system  be

extended  to  cover  an even more  extensive  area.

Recent sewerage projects include Toa Payoh, Jurong,

Kallang Basin and urban renewal areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic problems continue to tax the wits of our

transport and traffic planners and engineers. Short

term measures include improvements made to existing

road  junctions  and  one-way  traffic  systems  to

facilitate   smoother  flow  of  traffic.   As   an

intermediate   term  measure  the   Department   is

undertaking  the  construction  of  a   number   of

flyovers and grade separated interchanges at  major

road junctions to ensure the smoother flow of heavy

traffic. Main arterial roads have also been widened

to  provide  for dual carriageways wherever  it  is

possible  to  acquire  land  to  do  so.  Long-term

measures  will continue to be studied, investigated

and  worked out in conjunction with the  State  and

City  Planning  Project in  order  to  lay  down  a

comprehensive  but flexible traffic  plan  for  the

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two major road programmes to be implemented soon

are: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the plan to construct a coastal highway

along the East Coast reclaimed land linking

traffic from the eastern sector    of the Island to

the City;



and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) the plan for a Pan-Island Ex pressway

connecting the Jurong Industrial Estate, the

proposed Woodlands New Town, the Toa Payoh New Town

and the Kallang Basin.



<br><br>Parts   of  the  Pan-Island  Expressway  are  under

construction  and external loan will be  sought  to

finance these two major highway projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plans to make Singapore a Garden City, the

cleanest and greenest in South-east Asia are  being

implemented assiduously. A Parks and Trees Division

has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



been    established   within   the   Public   Works

Department. Improvement to the Botanic Gardens, the

Van  Kleef  Aquarium and many of the  Public  Parks

will  be  made. Some 15,000 trees of  50  varieties

have  been planted since June, 1967. Other projects

to   beautify   our  highways  and   other   public

thoroughfares, road circuses, open spaces,  schools

arid  other public institutions are being  pursued.

The  private sector will be encouraged  to  make  a

corresponding effort.



<br><br><i>Primary Production and Urban and Rural Services</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provision of services and advice to our

farmers enable them to increase their farm products

and    reduce    production    costs.    Increasing

productivity  and reducing costs of  production  in

the  agricultural  sector is a constant  objective.

Particular   emphasis  is  on  the   promotion   of

intensive  and diversified farming to make  maximum

use of our limited land resources.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Fisheries Industry, the emphasis is on

off-shore   and   deep-sea  fishing.   Considerable

efforts are being made towards improving the system

of fish landing, marketing and distribution as well

as in the training of a new generation of fishermen

for    off-shore   and   deep-sea   fishing.    The

construction  of  the Fisheries Wharf  and  Central

Fish  Auction  Market at Jurong is a step  in  this

direction  as  also  is  the establishment  of  the

Fishing  Training Institute with the assistance  of

the United Nations Development Programme at Changi.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jurong Abattoir, completed at a cost of about

$6 million will ensure that the slaughter of sheep,

cattle and pigs, meat handling and inspection  will

be  run  on modern assembly line system to  achieve

high  hygienic  standards. The  export  market  for

canned meat will be exploited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The breeding of tropical and fancy fish as an

industry  to  earn more foreign exchange  is  being

encouraged  and  assisted.  This  industry  can  be

carried  out  in  any home as a part-time  job  for

earning extra money. Horticulture, particularly the

growing of orchids, for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



which  our climatic conditions are ideal,  will  be

assisted by research and new free flowering hybrids

to take greater advantage of the export market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Urban and Rural Services Committee will

continue  to  facilitate the supply of  electricity

and  water in the rural areas and to provide better

communication and drainage. As part  of  a  special

campaign  water supplies are being laid  direct  to

home  in  order  that  public  standpipes  can   be

removed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 29</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>MINISTRY OF HEALTH</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that full establishment has been reached for

all grades of staff, the time has come to chart the

future progress by striking out on a new course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task in the coming years will be to sustain

the  high  standards already achieved. The key-note

will   be  greater  sophistication  in  the  Health

Services together with greater demands on the civic

responsibility   particularly  in   public   health

measures.  It is essential that in the  reappraisal

of  development, priorities are assigned; costs are

kept  down  as  far  as possible  without  stunting

growth.



<br><br><i>Environmental Health</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new sophistication will be apparent in the new

and aggressive approach to the challenge of keeping

Singapore  clean.  A  "people  orientated  problem"

being  more  complex  will require  that  the  main

effort  will  be  directed  in  wrestling   out   a

successful   solution  which  will   involve   mass

participation of the public.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progress has been made in recent years in the

control of hawkers by licensing and re-siting.  The

labour force of the Cleansing Services will have to

be  further  reorganised for better efficiency  and

discipline.  There  is much room  for  improvement.

Dirt, flies and mosquitoes are all too evident. The

recent   occurrence  of  two   cases   of   cholera

underscores the need for maintaining vigilance  and

the highest standards of sanitation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Public Health Division will be strengthened by

integrating  some  of  its  sections   which   have

hitherto been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



working  as  separate units; by  strengthening  the

supervisory  staff  to achieve better  control  and

discipline.   Reappraisal   or   the   methods   of

collection,  haulage  and disposal  of  rubbish  to

improve the efficiency of procedures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time the people will have to play

their part as citizens in making Singapore a garden

city. For those who are incorrigible, new laws will

be  enacted to penalise litter bugs, and those  who

unnecessarily add to the c1eansing problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Public Health legislation is being consolidated

into  a  comprehensive  environmental  health  code

capable  of  maintaining the highest  standards  of

public  health  required in a modern complex  urban

society.



<br><br><i>Hospitals</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim is to develop the medical care services as

a   premier  curative  service.  Further   hospital

accommodation  will  have to  be  manned  when  the

British   Services   vacate  their   hospitals   at

Alexandra,  the  British Military  Hospital  -  400

beds; at Changi - 125 beds; at Sembawang - 74 beds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of certain sophisticated

specialties   will  be  selected   for   stimulated

development to standards equal to the best  in  the

world. We must keep abreast with the latest in  the

world  and keep up facilities, knowledge and skills

as   the  best  and  highest  in  the  region.  The

construction   of   the   Institute   of    Medical

Specialties as a joint project with the  University

has already started. The first section to house the

Cobalt Units will be completed about August of this

year.  The other sections for the specialties  such

as  the artificial kidney unit; cardiac unit, open-heart surgery, neurology, neuro-surgery, gastrology

and  others will be built soon. Some of these units

have   already  been  established  within  existing

facilities  in  the  hospitals e.g, an  artificial

kidney unit in the Outram General Hospital; a neuro-surgical unit in the Thomson General Hospital and a

Cardiac-vascular Surgical Unit in the Tan Tock Seng

Hospital.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Dental Health</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dental health services require to be improved

and expanded. The standards of dental care amongst

the   population   are  low.  Only   the   younger

generation  of the population show the  beneficial

effects  of  fluoridation of  the  water  supplies

which  started in 1958. Although the  main  effort

for  dental  care  is directed at school  children

(there  are  50 school dental clinics) it  reaches

less    than   half   the   primary   school-going

population.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvement in dental health will be achieved if

there  is greater attention to dental hygiene  and

if   dental   services  become  more   universally

available. Great stress will therefore  be  placed

on   an  intensive  and  sustained  dental  health

education programme. This will be started  in  the

schools  and then directed to the general  public.

Dissemination  of  dental  health   knowledge   is

regarded as urgent at this stage as our population

is  not  conscious  enough of  the  importance  of

maintaining dental health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dental care services will be expanded as

rapidly as resources are available. The limitation

is  the shortage of dentists (there being only 156

Division I registered dentists in Singapore; 60 of

whom are in Government service). Priority will  be

given  to the establishment of dental clinics  for

school children.



<br><br><i>Medical Charges</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maintenance of the Health Service and its

plans  for development make an ever growing demand

on  the  public purse. Already 12 per cent of  the

Republic's  budget (or $78,000,000) is apportioned

to the Health Service. The rise in costs cannot be

sustained without limit without either contracting

the  services or a fall in the standards of health

practices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither alternative is acceptable. Hence some

other means of holding down costs is essential.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the services are almost entirely free a

token  proportion of the costs  will  have  to  be

borne  by patients if the services are not  to  be

limited.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A revision on medical fees is therefore being

undertaken on the principle that services must  be

partially  paid  for.  Examples  of  the  proposed

revision will be: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) extending charges for hospital care to

classes  of patients who have hitherto  been

treated and fed free;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) increasing the number of paying class beds

in  hospitals  (there  are  insufficient   B

class  beds  to meet the increasing  demands

chiefly  due  to  the increasing  number  of

collective  agreements where employees, are

entitled   to  admission  to  paying   class

wards);



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) charges for workmen injured at work and

persons  injured  in road traffic  accidents

who  are  covered by Workmen's  Compensation

or     third-party    insurance     schemes,

respectively;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) increasing outpatient charges per

attendance   and   for  attendances   during

Sundays and public holidays;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) enhanced accouchement charges for the third

and  further  child  to discourage  families

who  can  least  afford  to  increase  their

numbers.



<br><br><i>Family Planning</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the economic growth, social development and

the  quality of living is to be maintained and not

absorbed  by  over-population the family  planning

programme will have to be pursued to maintain  the

accelerated  drop in birthrates. Family  planning,

which  has  achieved  notable  results  in  recent

years,  will  be  prosecuted with  greater  vigour

augmented by the proposed legislation to  legalise

abortions  and  the  voluntary  sterilization   of

persons.
