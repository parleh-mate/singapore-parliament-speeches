<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>UNIVERSAL PROCESSING CENTRES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Setting up)</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mdm Ho

Geok Choo -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To ask the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for

Finance  (a)  has  the Government  any  plan  to  set  up

universal processing centres (UPCs), and if so, how  does

it  intend to expedite this set-up; and (b) how  can  the

Singapore UPCs be distinguished from the competition from

Australia, China and India.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan (Hong Kah):</b> Question No. 1,

Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance (Mr Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore

has made significant headway in positioning itself as the

regional  IT and financial hub.  Institutional  investors

and   analysts   have  rated  highly  our   national   IT

infrastructure,  quality  of manpower,  as  well  as  our

political and regulatory environment. More companies  and

financial   institutions   are   outsourcing   processing

activities, as they seek to save costs and focus on  core

competencies.  The industry has recommended  to  the  ERC

setting   up  Universal  Processing  Centres  (UPCs)   in

Singapore  to leverage our strengths and to  support  our

efforts   to  develop  front,  middle  and  back   office

activities here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government supports in principle the set-up of

UPCs.   The  hubbing  of  higher  value-added  processing

activities  in Singapore will create jobs,  and  generate

spin-offs  to  other economic sectors, such  as  business

advisory,  IT and telecommunications. Global corporations

and  financial institutions are among the early  adopters

who   have   consolidated   processing   along   business

functions,   and   also  centralised  processing   either

globally or regionally in the American, European or Asian

time-zones.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is well-placed to become a key processing

hub  in  Asia.  Cost is only one factor. For  example,  a

consultancy  study  showed that Singapore  was  a  viable

location for treasury processing activities despite  keen

regional competition.  Global financial institutions like

Citibank  and  Deutsche  Bank  already  have  established

processing  centres in Singapore serving  Asia,  and  for

specific  business  segments,  beyond  Asia.  We  have  a

critical  mass  of MNCs and financial institutions  here,

which  is  one of our key advantages. The MAS  and  other

agencies are currently in discussion with industry to see

how to encourage more UPCs to be set up here.

<div align="center"><b>UNDER-AGED DRINKING</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister and Minister for Finance (a) how many have  been

caught for under-aged drinking at pubs, discos and at the

premises of other licensed liquor sellers for each of the

last  three years; and (b) what action has been taken  by

the police to deter such incidents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, prior to 1st

October  2002,  which is today,  the  responsibility  for

liquor  licensing  came  under  the  Customs  and  Excise

Department,  or CED. As it is primarily a law  and  order

issue, this function has been transferred to the Ministry

of  Home  Affairs with effect from today.   Nevertheless,

this  question has not been transferred and I  will  take

this question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35 under-aged persons were caught in 1999, 19 in

2000, and 7 in 2001.  In 2002, 20 under-aged persons have

been  caught so far. Offenders were fined $100 and  their

parents were informed of the offence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The licensees who were caught allowing consumption

of  liquors by under-aged persons in their premises  were

fined  $300 for the first offence and $500 for subsequent

offences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CED had been conducting regular checks on licensed

premises.   Police, in its checks on public entertainment

premises,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>

had  also  referred  offenders of the  liquors  licensing

regulations to CED for follow-up actions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Liquors Licensing Board would

require  licensees who repeatedly infringe the  licensing

conditions  to appear for a hearing before the  Board  to

see whether their licences should be revoked.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to assure Dr Khor that under-aged

drinking is not prevalent. Measures are already in  place

to  ensure  that  liquors  are  not  sold  to  under-aged

persons.   With this function transferred to the Ministry

of  Home Affairs, I trust that the synergy that would  be

reaped  by  the  Home Team would keep this problem  under

control even better.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Sir, it was recently

reported  in  the newspaper that there were some  private

parties  held  by  predominantly junior college  students

where  under-aged drinking might exist.  I  am  not  sure

whether  it  is  appropriate to ask the Minister  if  the

Police has taken any action on such incidents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if there are

such  cases  reported, we will investigate them,  but  if

they  are  private  parties and not in  pubs,  discos  or

licensed liquor sellers, it is in somebody's home, it  is

really the parents' responsibility.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Clarification, Sir. When I

said  "private parties" it was reported to have been held

at discos.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Let us have the particulars and

we will investigate the matter.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman</b> asked the Minister

for Health (a) whether there is an increasing trend since

1997  of  Singaporean patients (excluding those  who  are

eligible  for Medifund) who have sought help in  settling

their  bills from public hospitals; (b) will  the  recent

increase  in  hospital charges contribute to this  trend;

and  (c) what measures are being taken to further  assist

this group of Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan (Minister of State for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Health (Dr Balaji Sadasivan) (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  Question  Nos. 3 to 9 are on the  same  topic,  ie,

healthcare increases in hospital charges.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So you would like to take them

together?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Yes, Sir. The main

responsibility  of  our  public  sector   hospitals   and

institutions  is to provide Singaporeans, especially  the

middle  and  lower  income groups,  good  and  affordable

healthcare that is appropriate to needs. In this respect,

our   public   sector  hospitals  have  done   well   and

Singaporeans  have over the years grown to expect  to  be

treated  by  competent staff using the latest procedures,

drugs and equipment in our public sector hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue to provide quality healthcare, public

sector  hospitals must be responsive to medical advances,

demographic changes and also able to retain good staff by

offering   competitive  remuneration.  These  initiatives

would,   however,  inevitably  increase  their  operating

costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MP for Holland-Bukit Panjang GRC had asked for a

comparison  of  the operating cost of our hospitals  with

those of other countries. Unfortunately, such data is not

readily  available or comparable as hospitals may  differ

in  their accounting treatment, size and casemix. If  we,

however, consider total healthcare expenditure, Singapore

as  a  whole spends only 3% of its GDP on healthcare when

other  developed  countries spend 7% or more.  Our  total

expenditure  on health per capita for 2000  was  S$1,500.

This  is  much  lower than the per capita expenditure  of

countries such as United Kingdom (S$3,092), United States

(S$8,243) and New Zealand (S$1,890)1.  In fact, the World

Health  Report  published in 2000  by  the  World  Health

Organisation  ranked our health system  sixth  among  191

countries in overall cost effectiveness. This is a strong

indication  that our healthcare delivery system  provides

good value for money to Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our two public sector healthcare clusters are not-for-profit entities. As not-for-profit entities, their

main  objective is not to maximise profits. However, like

any other operating entity, public sector

<hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>

<br><br>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on exchange rate of 1.78S$ per US$.  Our total expenditure on health per capita for 2000 was US$843. Based on OECD Health Data 2002 total health expenditure per capita for 2000 for comparative countries are as follows: United Kingdom (US$1737), United States (US$4631) and New Zealand (US$1062).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>

hospitals need to exercise financial prudence and recover

cost to ensure their continued viability. Otherwise, over

time, standards will decline.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Singaporeans will have to pay for the increase

in  healthcare cost, the Ministry of Health has  taken  a

four-pronged  approach  to minimise  the  impact  on  the

public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, by having small, regular fee increases.

Restructured  hospitals conduct annual reviews  of  their

costs,  and  review their fees and charges  regularly  to

better  reflect  their cost profile. In  the  recent  fee

revision, the quantum of hospital fee increase  has  been

kept  quite small, around $20 for class C wards  and  $40

for  class  B2 wards, which most Singaporeans  should  be

able  to meet through Medisave.  For the hospitals,  this

translates   into   an  increased  total   revenue   from

subsidised patients of around $12 million a year,  or  3%

of their revenue from subsidised patients.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, by subsidising healthcare for the middle and

lower  income  Singaporeans. MOH has put in place  target

subsidies  for  the different ward classes and  services.

For  example, inpatients are subsidised 80% for C and 65%

for  B2 class wards. The subsidy rate for day surgery  is

65%  while the subsidy rate for SOC is 50%.  Our  figures

show  that  MOH has more than met its target obligations.

For example, in FY 01, MOH's subvention was 80.5% and 69%

of the total C class and B2 class charges respectively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans pay only for the services that they

use. The Government provides additional subvention to the

hospitals for teaching, training and research activities.

Full Government funding is also provided for building  or

upgrading hospitals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of Singaporeans, they should choose

their  ward  class  wisely according to  their  financial

means.  To help Singaporeans make that choice, financial

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>

counselling services are mandatory at all hospitals.   My

Ministry  has  also  produced a  brochure  "Ten  Tips  to

Stretch   Your  Health  Dollar"  to  help  lower   income

Singaporeans  access  the heavily  subsidised  healthcare

services in the public healthcare system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, by helping Singaporeans to save for their

healthcare needs through Medisave. Several concerns  have

been  raised  about the timing of the fee  revisions  and

whether the implementation can be postponed. As the  last

fee  revision  was  in  February 2001,  the  current  fee

revision  has  already been postponed  by  at  least  six

months. Singaporeans must, however, also understand  that

the  approach  to paying their share of healthcare  costs

must  be  through  long  term  savings,  complemented  by

appropriate medical insurance plans. This is why we  have

put in place Medisave, which helps Singaporeans build  up

a  sufficient sum of money over many years to fund  their

healthcare expenses in the future.  Singaporeans can also

use  their  Medisave  to pay their  MediShield  premiums,

which  will  help  to  further  defray  their  healthcare

expenses  especially  if they suffer serious/catastrophic

illness.  For subsidised patients, 70% of C and B2  Class

bills  are  entirely met using a combination of  Medisave

and MediShield, with zero out-of-pocket payment needed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, by providing a safety net. Singaporeans who

still  cannot  afford to pay the highly subsidised  rates

even  after using their Medisave and MediShield can apply

for  Medifund.   Medical Social Workers in the  hospitals

are   also  given  the  flexibility  to  extend  Medifund

assistance  to those who need help. So far, the  approval

rate  of  Medifund applications has consistently remained

above  99%.  With Government subsidies, the 3M  financing

framework (Medisave, MediShield and Medifund), is able to

pay  for  97%  of the total charges for B2  and  C  class

patients. Therefore, my Ministry believes that the  small

fee   increases  are  manageable  for  the  majority   of

Singaporeans.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MP for Jalan Besar and MP for Hougang have asked if

our hospitals can be run more efficiently. The answer is:

Yes. There is always room for improvement.  Public sector

hospitals   must   be   managed  efficiently   and   cost

containment should become part of the hospital management

culture,  both  among administrators and  clinicians.  My

Ministry has restructured our public sector hospitals  to

give  them more autonomy so that they are more responsive

to  the  market and therefore achieve better cost control

and productivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hospitals have introduced numerous initiatives,

both  big  and  small, to improve their productivity  and

manage  their  cost.  These include  bulk  purchasing  of

drugs, improving process flows such as offering same  day

admission  for  surgery. The clusters have also  obtained

significant savings by  outsourcing of services  such  as

catering and promoting greater energy efficiency as  well

as  getting their staff to multitask. The hospitals  have

also   introduced  innovative  measures  to  lower  their

overheads.  For  example,  SNEC  has  sought  to  improve

utilisation and reduce fixed overheads through  marketing

excess   OT  facilities/consultation  rooms  to  non-SNEC

Ophthalmologists.   All these measures  have  saved  both

clusters several million dollars each year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must, however, also be realistic as to

the  extent  to which hospitals can keep cost down  while

continuing   to   maintain  healthcare   standards.    If

Singaporeans  expect the best treatment and  diagnostics,

short queues and good services, they must be prepared  to

pay for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we try our best to control cost, it is

inevitable  that cost will increase each year.   Even  in

the  prevailing economic situation, based  on  MOM  data,

basic  wages showed an average increase of 2.9%  for  all

employees  in 2001.  Taking into account the 4 percentage

points  restoration in employer's CPF  contribution,  the

change   in   overall   wage  costs   (comprising   staff

remuneration and employer's CPF contribution) amounted to

5.2% in 2001.  Drug costs will also continue to increase.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>

The average growth rate in prescription only medicine  in

Singapore   from  1997  to  2000  was  nearly   8%.    In

comparison, the projected drug price inflation of the  US

healthcare system is even higher at 10%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I would like to give my assurance that

the  Ministry of Health is and will continue to work with

public sector hospitals to minimise the cost increases to

Singaporeans.   I would also like to assure  Singaporeans

that no Singaporean will be denied essential medical care

because of his inability to pay.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I

object to being referred to as Jalan "Bazaar" GRC MP.   I

am Jalan Besar GRC MP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister of State whether the hospital

fee increase could have been avoided this time, since  it

has  been  announced that the hospital  fee  increase  is

small?   Therefore, can the Ministry of Health  not  give

more  subvention to the public hospitals instead, in view

of this economic downturn?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, running

hospitals  efficiently and ensuring that all Singaporeans

can  afford their healthcare are two related but separate

issues.   Hospitals  are  most efficiently  run  if  they

follow  cost  recovery principle,  that  all  aspects  of

health  services are costed correctly and  resources  are

allocated appropriately.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As demand shifts due to advances in medicine, due to

shifts   in   demography,  hospitals   reallocate   their

resources  to meet these demands.  If you have  a  system

that does not respond to these changes continuously, then

you will find demand will build up, queues will form, and

people  have to wait long periods before they  get  their

services.  This is what happened in UK with the NHS.  The

NHS  in  UK  does  not  follow  this  principle  of  cost

recovery.    And  as  a  result,  over  the  years,   the

development of services and facilities has suffered,  and

now  patients sometimes have to wait over a  year  before

they can get their surgery.  It has reached a crisis

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>

level  that in the UK, they are sending patients down  to

France,  Germany  and  neighbouring countries  for  their

treatment,  while  they  are  trying  to  upgrade   their

services.   If  we  do  not  follow  the  cost   recovery

principle, we will be going down this road and, one  day,

may  end  up  having to send our patients to neighbouring

countries too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second issue of ensuring that all

Singaporeans can afford to pay for their medical care, we

have the safety net.  In 1996, the number of applications

for  Medifund  assistance was 55,859.  In  2001,  it  was

157,190.   Despite  the almost three-fold  increase,  the

approval  rate  was 99.7%, and 156,780 applications  were

approved  in  2001.   A  total  of  $27.23  million   was

disbursed.  This is more than twice the amount  disbursed

in 1996.  So, I think we need to separate the two issues.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, while I

understand  the  principle of  cost  recovery,  the  cost

recovered for the recent round of increase for B2  and  C

class  wards is only $12 million.  My question is,  given

the  prevailing  economic situation, can  the  Government

not, based on cost recovery, provide additional grants of

$12  million  to  the hospitals?  Can the Government  not

afford  that,  and thereby will avoid the  increases  and

help Singaporeans to tide over the period?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we would like

to  target our assistance to those who most need it.   By

targeting  our  assistance  through  Medifund,   we   are

targeting these additional funds to help those who cannot

afford healthcare.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, does the Minister of State

agree  that  it is not so much targeting those  who  need

assistance?  The fact that the increases are concentrated

on  B2  and  C class wards, you are targeting  the  lower

income  who  cannot afford.  So, you are targeting  those

people who cannot afford the increases.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> About 70% of Singaporeans use

B2  and  C  class  wards.   For  the  majority  of  these

patients, their Medisave should be able to cover the cost

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>

even  with the 3% increase in charges.  Through Medifund,

what  we  are doing is we are using that money to  target

those  people  who cannot afford to pay their  healthcare

bills  with their Medisave, whose Medisave has  run  out,

who do not have the money to pay.  Whereas if you were to

give  the  money directly, then those who need the  money

most may not get it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Supplementary question, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Low, you have to catch my eye first,

will continue to increase, I think what is needed is more

transparency  and  also clearer justification.   I  would

like to ask the Minister of State to perhaps clarify some

of   these  apparent  contradictions  in  the  healthcare

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, he had said that part of the cost

increase  was  due  to new drugs, and  yet  in  the  same

breath,  one of the clusters had said that there was  10-15%  decrease in the cost of drugs.  And we all know that

for  non-standard drugs, in other words, new  drugs  that

are in the hospitals, usually they are hardly subsidised.

I  am  not  sure  how  new drugs actually  result  in  an

increase in the cost of healthcare.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, another contradiction is he said that

there  is financial counselling in hospitals.  But I  was

just  given  a  very  good  incident  where  one  of  the

grassroots leaders brought the mother to the hospital and

was  advised by the hospital doctor not to go to B2,  but

to  go  and  see  the tua luo koon to  get  better  care,

because  the suay luo koon could not give good care,  and

was  asked  to  go to a paying class.  So,  how  does  he

ensure that this seemingly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>

attempt  for  them  to provide financial  counselling  is

operational at the ground level?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third contradiction is that while we build beautiful

hospitals  and  we say that we have under-utilisation  of

assets, that means it is very expensive to maintain these

under-utilised  assets, and that will actually  translate

to  increased cost as well.  My question is: are we over-providing also for infrastructure as well?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least is that in this price increase,

what  I could not understand is if the Ministry's concern

was  for  the  subsidised class, why did  they  not  make

adjustments to the paying-class first?  Why do they  want

to increase the cost for the subsidised class?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> On the first question on

financial  advice  in  the hospitals,  we  have  made  it

mandatory  that every patient receives such  counselling.

If  Dr  Michael  Lim  has  a  specific  case  where  such

counselling was not given to the patient, in  writing  to

the  Ministry, my Ministry will investigate the  hospital

as  to  why such counselling was not given.  But we  have

made  it  mandatory and directed our hospitals that  they

should give such financial counselling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue is about cost going up. Why do

costs  go up?  The single biggest factor for costs  going

up is manpower cost, not drug cost.  Manpower cost in our

hospitals amounts to $1.217 billion, or 56% of the  total

hospital expenditure.  This cost has gone up because  the

wages have gone up.  Wages of doctors went up between  4%

and  5% in 2001, and for nurses it went up 5% to 8%.   In

order  to  retain  staff,  the  hospitals  have  to   pay

competitive  wages.   It is a global market  for  skilled

medical  and  nursing manpower.  In  nursing,  there  are

126,000 vacant positions in the United States.  There are

10,000  vacancies  in UK, and over 100,000  vacancies  in

Europe.   There is also a shortage of medical consultants

in  UK  and  they  are  trying to recruit  surgeons  from

Southeast Asia.  In Australia, they are short of  doctors

in rural hospitals.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these countries have made attempts to recruit

staff  from Singapore.  Some of the strategies that  they

have   used  are  distributing  brochures  in  hospitals,

advertising  in  local newspapers and  using  recruitment

agencies.   Because of our competitive wages, the  impact

of these foreign recruitment drives has been minimal.  If

we do not pay competitive wages and retain our staff, the

quality of healthcare will drop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to price rises of paying-class patients,

the hospitals are free to raise their charges for paying-class patients.  And that is not a major concern for  the

Ministry of Health because patients have a choice between

the  private  hospitals and the private class  of  public

hospitals, and the market can decide whether the price is

too  high  or too low.  It is only where there are  price

rises in C and B2 class wards that we monitor it, because

this impacts most Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Minister of State

did not answer my first question earlier when I asked why

is  it  that  the  Ministry of Health  cannot  give  more

subvention  to the public hospitals instead, in  view  of

this   economic   downturn.   I  have  two  supplementary

questions, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I ask the Minister of State whether his Ministry

would give more flexible consideration to the eligibility

criteria  for  Medifund applications to help Singaporeans

who have difficulties in making ends meet, as a result of

unemployment or less take-home pay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I also ask the Minister of State whether he

would  step  up public education on the use of  Medisave,

MediShield  and  Medifund and on the  correct  choice  of

hospital  wards.   Would he also publicise  the  detailed

charges   for   various  conditions  by   the   different

hospitals, for example, on the web-site?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> With regard to the first

question,  I have answered it.  It is more efficient  and

effective  to help people who need assistance  in  paying

their  healthcare  bills by targeting the  funds  through

Medifund.  Because through

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>

Medifund, we are identifying those who do not have enough

in  Medisave to pay for their healthcare.  Whereas if you

give  the same money directly to the hospitals, then  the

amount, or the proportion of that, which would go to  the

most  needy  would be much less.  So dollar  for  dollar,

this  is  a more effective way of helping those who  need

help most.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Medifund, over the last eight years,

Medifund  applications  that  have  been  approved   have

increased three-fold, and we are still approving Medifund

applications at more than 99% rate.  We are  quite  happy

to  open  the  Medifund  process for  inspection  by  our

Members  of Parliament.  At the press conference  earlier

in September, the Minister had invited the press to visit

the  hospitals  to  ascertain  for  themselves  that  our

Medifund process is transparent and is helping those  who

need the help.  And I am not sure how many members of the

press  took up the invitation but, so far, the press  has

not reported on any case that has been unfairly rejected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the third issue on public education,

we  will  take up Dr Lily Neo's suggestion and distribute

our  brochures  to  more people and  to  all  Members  of

Parliament  so  that they can distribute  them  to  their

grassroots leaders and to their constituents.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, the Minister of State, in

his  earlier  answer,  said that even  with  the  current

increases   in   charges  for  B2  and  C  class   wards,

Singaporeans should have sufficient Medisave to  pay  for

their  medical  fees.   Can he  assure  this  House  that

Singaporeans  who are admitted to B2 and  C  class  wards

will  not have to fork out cash to pay for their hospital

bills, since he said that there is sufficient Medisave to

pay for it?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> The majority of Singaporeans

should  have  enough in Medisave to pay for their  health

bills.   Where they have to fork out from pocket expenses

and  where  they cannot afford it, Medifund  will  assist

them.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</b> Sir, while the

Minister  of  State has acknowledged that the controlling

cost is very

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>

important and he has mentioned the difficulty he has with

manpower cost, could he confirm that in the case  of  the

KK Hospital, utility cost went up by $1.2 million in 1997

to $5 million a year today, and its equipment and medical

supplies  ballooned from $1.2 million in 1997 to  between

$7-$9  million  annually  today?   How  are  costs  being

controlled in the hospitals, like the KK Hospital?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a new

specific  question and I have to check with the  Ministry

on these figures.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, would it be correct to

suggest that such increases in costs came about after the

hospital  has  moved from its old premises  in  Hampshire

Road  to its present one?  I understand that, today,  the

KK  Hospital  is underutilised.  Would it be  correct  to

suggest that the costs of such unutilised facilities  and

the wards would then have to be borne by the patients  in

the   other  wards?   Just  a  follow-up  on  the  second

question.  If that is the case, why did we have to  build

such  a  large new hospital to deliver babies, especially

when we knew that the birth rate was declining?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the new KK

Hospital  was  built to replace the old KK Hospital,  and

the  birth rate had declined more significantly than  was

anticipated and, so, utilisation had dropped.   But  with

regard to the specific figures that the Member has asked,

I  would  have  to  go back and check  with  my  Ministry

officials on those figures because that was not tabled as

a Question.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is

the  Minister of State aware that in the debate on public

transport, I moved an amendment asking this House and the

Government to take into consideration two factors in  any

price  increase?  One factor is the state of the economy.

The  other factor is the unemployment situation  in  this

country.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Tan, are you making a speech?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> I will ask the question. Sir, I

am asking the Minister of State whether these two factors

were  taken  into consideration because I know  that  the

economy  has not improved so remarkably and I  know  that

the unemployment situation is still around 5%.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> My Ministry is aware that the

unemployment  rate is around 5% and there  will  be  more

Singaporeans  who  may  have  difficulties  paying  their

hospital  bills.  That is why our Medifund approval  rate

has  more  than tripled and the funds disbursed,  through

Medifund, has more than doubled.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Sir, my question was whether

these were two factors ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Tan, I have asked for Mr Ang Mong

Seng who has raised his hand long ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock</b> resumed his seat.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister of State has mentioned that there are some cases

like  zero payment.  I want to ask the Minister of State,

for  the last two years, how many cases had enjoyed  this

scheme  through  Medisave, MediShield  or  Medifund.   My

second  point  is, since USA spends 7%  of  its  GDP  and

Singapore  spends  only  3% of  its  GDP  on  healthcare,

whether the Government has any plan to increase the 3% to

a higher rate?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock</b> rose ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Let the Minister of State reply first.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> With regard to the second

point that we are spending 3% of our GDP, this 3% of  our

GDP on healthcare is not what the Government is spending.

This   is  what  we,  as  a  society,  are  spending   on

healthcare.  So if we enjoy a standard of healthcare that

is  comparable to Australia and Europe, and  we  can  get

this  level of healthcare at 3% of our GDP, while  others

are  paying  6%,  8% or 9% in Europe, it means  that  our

system  is much more efficient than the system in Europe.

And that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>

is  what we mean by 3% of our GDP.  So we ask why are  we

able  to  do  this  at  3%,  when  to  get  a  comparable

healthcare  system, people have to pay 6% of  their  GDP,

this  is  for  the whole country, both the Government  as

well as what the individuals pay.  The reason we are able

to  do  this is because we run our hospitals  on  a  cost

recovery  system.   Is  there  a  second  part  to   your

question?

<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Mong Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Mong Seng:</b> How many cases are zero payment?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> About 97% of the patients

should  be  covered  by  Medisave  or  MediShield  system

without out-of-pocket payment.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, I

do  not  know whether it is appropriate for me to make  a

point of clarification with regard to the KK Hospital?

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> A short one will do.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Yes. When the KK Hospital moved

from  the  old to the new hospital, the most  significant

factor   was   the  establishment  of  a  new  Children's

Hospital.   That added on an extra 60%, in terms  of  the

size  of  the  hospital, and in fact,  the  bulk  of  the

increase  in  cost related to that move was  due  to  the

establishment  of  the Children's Hospital,  rather  than

related to the capacity of the women's services.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask two supplementary questions?

May  I  ask  the Minister of State whether  his  Ministry

would  seriously  consider maximisation  of  our  limited

resource  pool  in  the integration of  the  private  and

public  healthcare  sectors in  the  sharing  of  medical

expertise, medical technology and facility?   May  I  ask

the  Minister  of State whether the two clusters  of  the

public  healthcare  groups are  in  fact  duplicating  in

management staff and healthcare services?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second supplementary question is whether, in

order  to  reduce  a patient's hospitalisation  cost,  he

would  develop  community care and  home  care  services,

train community carers and family

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>

members  to  help  look after the sick  patients  in  the

community,  expand hospital day surgery  and  train  more

doctors for day surgery?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> With regard to the first

question  on public and private cooperation in  utilising

limited resources, my Ministry is fully supportive of  it

and  I have earlier given an example of how the SNEC  had

allowed  its  facilities to be used by  private  doctors.

Likewise,   with  regard  to  MRI  and  other   expensive

diagnostic  equipment, they are open to both private  and

public  doctors to send their patients for testing.   The

Singapore  Gamma Knife Centre is another example  whereby

there  is  a  machine that is used by  both  private  and

public sector doctors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of the clusters has led to competition

between  the  hospitals in the two groups.   One  of  the

effects of this competition has been increased efficiency

by both clusters.  This also allows us in the Ministry to

compare  the  hospitals across the clusters  and  see  if

there  are  any inefficiencies that need to be  corrected

and  any  systems that are extremely efficient  that  the

other  can  copy.  We also believe that if you  can  move

inpatient  surgery  to  day  surgery,  you  can   provide

healthcare  more  effectively and  efficiently.   So  the

hospitals  have increased their day surgery capacity  and

are  encouraging  day  surgery.  On  our  part,  we  have

allowed  Medisave, which is meant for inpatient care,  to

be used for day surgery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, if a patient can be looked after at

home through home nursing, rather than being looked after

in  the hospital, that is a more efficient way of looking

after  the person.  So we have relaxed our Medisave rules

on payment for home nursing.  The trend will be, over the

next  five years, more and more surgeries will be  moving

from   inpatient  to  day  surgery  and  more  and   more

treatments,  like  chemotherapy which  used  to  be  done

inpatient,  will  become outpatient  treatment.   In  the

recent  relaxation of Medisave, we have allowed  Medisave

to  be used for IV antibiotics because, in the past,  the

patient stayed in the hospital for maybe three weeks  for

the IV antibiotics.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1085</b></font><br><br>

Now,  they can go home with the drip connected  to  their

hand  and  they come in as an outpatient and get  the  IV

antibiotics.

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, two supplementary questions.   Firstly,  I

would  like to ask the Minister of State whether he would

assure  the  House  that  the cost  of  over-capacity  of

hospitals  is not passed on to patients, and  if  it  is,

would the Ministry consider subsidising the cost of  this

additional capacity.  The second question is with  regard

to  Medifund.  The Minister of State has repeatedly  said

that  Medifund has been used to help subsidise the  lower

income group.  Indeed, that is a good sign.  However,  in

view  of  the  high utilisation of the  fund,  would  the

Minister consider increasing the amount available for the

fund  and relaxing the criteria so that more can  benefit

from it?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> With regard to Medifund, more

than  99.7%  of the applications have been approved  even

though the number of applications has gone up from 55,000

to  157,000-plus.  So we are assisting many  more  people

today than we were six years ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to any over-capacity that the hospitals

have,  we  will work with the hospitals to  see  whether,

wherever possible, they can let others make use  of  that

over-capacity so that their running cost would be down.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> May I ask the

Minister of State how would the Ministry of Health ensure

that there will be greater transparency in the healthcare

and  hospital charges and adjustments so as to  keep  the

general  public  better informed?  Is it  true  that  the

miscellaneous  component  of hospital  bills  is  getting

bigger,  the patients are not given full details of  what

they  are paying for or what they are being charged  for?

Is  it  also  the  reason  that  the  high  miscellaneous

component results in the patients having to use more cash

to pay their health bills than to use Medisave?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1086</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Every patient can find out the

cost of any service that he is getting from the hospital.

It  is  mandatory for the hospitals to tell the  patients

what it costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the hospital bills, hospitals have to

provide  a bill explaining to the patient what the  costs

of  the  services were and how he has been  charged,  and

every hospital provides that.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Soo Khoon:</b> Sir, I am now not so sure who I

should  direct my question on KK Hospital to.  But  am  I

not wrong to suggest that, earlier this year, KK Hospital

closed  down  two women's wards owing to declining  birth

rates?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, following up on Dr Tan Cheng Bock's point, may

I  also ask the Minister of State whether he agrees  that

the  latest price increases run counter to the spirit  of

the resolution which this House adopted in July, when  we

debated  the increase in public transport fares in  which

we  urged  the  Government to ensure that the  prices  of

public  services  are not unreasonably  increased  during

these difficult times.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> With regard to the first part

of  Mr  Tan's comment on KK Hospital, the reason why  the

specific questions he has asked have not been answered is

because  he  did not table a question on KK  Hospital  in

Parliament  and  has  added  it  on  as  a  supplementary

question.   He can table such a question on  KK  Hospital

for the next parliamentary sitting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second comment, what we have done

is  not  against  the  spirit  of  what  was  debated  in

Parliament  earlier.  What we are doing is ensuring  that

our healthcare system continues to run as efficiently  as

possible  in  providing its services effectively  to  the

Singaporean  public.  We recognise the difficulties  that

Singaporeans may face in paying their hospital bills  and

we  have, as a result, increased the amount of money that

we  are  giving out through Medifund to help people  meet

that difficulty.  So it is not against the spirit of what

we debated at the last parliamentary sitting.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Cheng Bock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Cheng Bock:</b> Is the Minister aware that his

answer  to  Mr  Tan Soo Khoon's question  and  also  with

regard  to  my  question was not good, and  that  it  was

obvious that the Ministry of Health did not take heed  of

this  House's motion on this price increase?  I must  say

that it is very, very disappointing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask another supplementary question. How

are these clusters run?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> The clusters are run as not-for-profit organisations, meaning that profits are not

their  motive.   If in a year they have  a  surplus,  the

surplus  is  ploughed  back into  the  hospital  for  the

benefit  of the public.  If in a given year they  have  a

deficit,  then, from their reserves, they  would  try  to

cover that.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister of State

whether,   in   order   to   promote   the   cost-cutting

initiatives,  he would implement monetary incentives  for

public  hospitals  in  accordance with  the  cost-cutting

measures  adopted  by  their  respective  hospitals,  and

encourage   inter-hospitals'   cooperation    to    share

innovative  and  cost-cutting measures, especially  those

already proven effective, for implementation by all?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I also ask the Minister whether, in order

to reduce hospitals' operating costs, he would review the

number  of managerial non-medical staff employed  by  the

two  clusters of public hospitals, review the duplication

of services by the two clusters, discourage frills by the

hospitals  that  incur costs, and delegate  further  less

demanding tasks done by doctors and nurses?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> We do not micro-manage our

hospitals from the Ministry of Health.  However, if there

are  any innovative management ideas that the hon. Member

has, she can send these innovative ideas on management to

the   hospital   management  and   they   will   consider

introducing  them  in the hospital, if  these  innovative

ideas are workable.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister of State has said that a large part of the  cost

is mainly manpower

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1088</b></font><br><br>

cost.   But, as a doctor, he is also aware that,  really,

the  cost  increases as the consumption of  services  and

drugs increases.  This definitely has an impact, more  so

than  the  manpower cost itself.  Is there  in  fact  any

system  to  ensure  that there is no over-consumption  of

services or drugs?  I am not aware of any system at  this

point in time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, when the Ministry looks at subsidies for

the  patients,  I wonder whether depreciation  costs  are

considered, because if they factor in depreciation  costs

for  the  hospitals, then actually the  man-in-the-street

has  to  help fund expensive hospitals as well when  they

pay their part of the share of hospital charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, while the clusters increase competition,

does  it not also cause duplication?  For example,  I  am

aware  that,  in  the  past, we used  to  centralise  the

services,  eg,  National Skin Centre.   Now,  with  these

clusters,  many  hospitals also want to  set  up  similar

services  and  they are in fact dangling carrots  to  the

consultants  in  the  National Skin Centre  to  duplicate

these  services in other hospitals.  While it is  claimed

that  there is competition and, therefore, better use  of

resources, it seems that, on the ground, it is otherwise.

There  is  duplication  of resources.   This  means  more

equipment, more services.  So how does all this add up to

the  Ministry  being  on  top  of  this  cost-containment

exercise?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, similar to what one hon. Member

has  mentioned,  the  Ministry  has  also  put  in  other

administrative measures, eg, casemix, which, we know cost

quite  significantly in terms of software,  hardware  and

manpower costs.  But I do not think casemix results in  a

higher subvention in the total sum for the hospitals.  It

only  adds to the cost.  So maybe the Minister  of  State

can  enlighten  us as to how the Ministry translates  all

these  very good policies into real cost-saving  measures

on the ground.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> First of all, the cost of the

hospital  is  not included in the cost recovery  for  the

hospital.   So the depreciation of the hospital  building

is not one of the costs included.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to demand for health services, if we

look  across the world, as a country gets more  affluent,

the  demand  for  health  services  increases.   This  is

because the people have more disposable income, a  larger

proportion  of which they are willing to pay  for  health

services.   Take the United States, for example.   14.99%

of  their  GDP is spent on healthcare services,  and  the

more affluent states, eg, California, spend almost 20% of

their  state GDP on healthcare.  So, as Singapore becomes

more  affluent, a larger proportion of disposable  income

may  be  spent  on  healthcare expenditure.   To  try  to

curtail  this,  we  need to make people  responsible  for

their  healthcare  expenditure, because  then  they  will

decide  how  much of their dollar they want to  spend  on

healthcare  and  how  much of it to spend  on  education.

Where  healthcare is provided free, there  is  usually  a

buffet-syndrome and there is no control over  the  demand

for  healthcare  services.  But  because  in  our  system

people  are  paying for their healthcare with  their  own

money  -  Medisave is, in effect, money  that  they  have

saved  -  Singaporeans  have  been  very  sensible.   And

Singaporeans  are not over-spending on healthcare.   That

is  why  we have managed to have a very high standard  of

healthcare, equivalent to Australia and Europe,  and  yet

our  total  healthcare spending is only 3%  of  our  GDP,

while in Europe and Australia, it is between 6-9%.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> I would like to ask the

Minister of State when Singaporeans could expect the next

round  of  regular  and  small increases  in  health-care

charges.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Our hospitals review their

costs  every year.  So, next year, they will review their

costs  and  look  to  see  if  they  need  to  make   any

adjustments.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister of State

whether  his  Ministry  will prioritise  preventive  care

further  in  order  to  cushion  future  healthcare  cost

increases, identify prevalent diseases that need special

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>

attention   now,  continuously  monitor  and  study   the

prevention  of  common diseases and the many  aspects  of

preventive healthcare?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> My Ministry fully supports

preventive care as one means of keeping healthcare  costs

under  control.  Our Health Promotion Board's  budget  is

$100 million and it supports many programmes, such as the

mammography programme.

<div align="center"><b>QURAN-READING CLASSES RUN BY JEMAAH ISLAMIYAH</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Counselling of attendees and family members)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Minister for

Home  Affairs  whether his Ministry  has  (i)  identified

those children who attended Quran-reading classes run  by

the  Jemaah  Islamiyah  (JI) to talent-spot  and  recruit

future  members;  and  (ii) made arrangements  for  these

children  and  their family members to be counselled  and

helped from being led astray by the JI.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Jemaah Islamiyah established a unit

called   "Tarbiyah   Rasmiyah",  which   means   Official

Education  Unit,  around 1992.  The unit  was  tasked  to

organise   religious  classes  and,  subsequently,   also

children's   camps.   These  activities  were,   however,

stopped  after  1998 when the Jemaah Islamiyah  began  to

narrow its focus towards preparing the adult members  for

operational functions.  This is when the training for the

Jemaah  Islamiyah  members  in  Malaysia  also  began  to

include an increasingly more military-type curriculum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jemaah Islamiyah's religious classes and camps

were  not conducted under the banner of Jemaah Islamiyah.

They  were open to all and not confined only to  children

of  Jemaah  Islamiyah  parents.  The  camps,  which  were

called  "Tamrin  Kanak Kanak", which means  Training  for

Children, began in 1995/96, and participation was  sought

through advertisements in the Berita Harian and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1091</b></font><br><br>

by  word  of  mouth.  There was also at  least  one  camp

organised for teenagers between the ages of 13 and 15.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internal Security Department investigations have

not  shown that the religious classes and the camps  were

used   to  indoctrinate  the  children  with  the  Jemaah

Islamiyah  ideology.  The religious classes for  children

centred on Quran reading, and the activities of the  camp

included  the usual youth adventure learning  activities,

such  as  abseiling, "flying fox", swimming, archery  and

physical exercises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internal Security Department is aware of some of

those who attended these religious classes and camps, but

not all.  Although the classes and camps were not used to

purvey  the Jemaah Islamiyah ideology, they were used  as

opportunities  to talent-spot potential JI  members  from

among  the participants and their parents.  The  Internal

Security Department's investigations have discovered that

in  one  camping trip, Jemaah Islamiyah fiah ayub,  which

means  cell leader, Khalim bin Jaffar, used the bus  ride

conveying the camp participants to an activity site as  a

cover to video the Sembawang Road and Pakistan Road areas

where they believe American servicemen and their families

stay.   These  are the Americans who the  JI  observe  as

frequent  users of the shuttle bus service to Yishun  MRT

which  was  a  target for a plan of attack  which  Khalim

conveyed to the Al-Qaeda in 1997.  Sir, there is no cause

for  parents  to  be  unduly alarmed just  because  their

children  had  attended  the Jemaah  Islamiyah  religious

classes or camps some years ago.  They and their children

will  also not be implicated as Jemaah Islamiyah  members

or supporters simply because of this.  If they still have

any  concern,  they  can  contact the  Internal  Security

Department.

will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1092</b></font><br><br>

review  Part  VIII of the Women's Charter on  maintenance

orders  to  ensure that the provisions  are  more  gender

equal.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Charles Chong</b> asked the Acting Minister for

Community  Development and Sports  whether  his  Ministry

will review sections 69(1) and 113 of the Women's Charter

to  include  a  means test for women seeking  maintenance

from their husbands or former husbands.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen (Minister of State for Community Development and Sports) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Community Development and Sports (Mr Chan Soo Sen) (for the Acting Minister for Community Development and Sports):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as

Question  Nos.  11  and  12 are related  to  the  Women's

Charter,   with  your  permission,  I  would  take   both

Questions together.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> The hon. Member has asked if my

Ministry  would review Part VIII of the Women's  Charter,

which  provides for the maintenance of wife and children,

to ensure that the provisions are more gender equal.   He

has also asked if my Ministry would review sections 69(1)

and  113  of the Women's Charter to include a means  test

for  women  seeking  maintenance from their  husbands  or

former husbands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the short answer is not quite yet. Let me

explain,  Sir.   Despite the progress  we  have  achieved

since  independence, gaps continue to exist  between  man

and  woman  on  the  economic front.  The  percentage  of

economically  active  women in the workforce  is  54%  in

2001.   This is significantly lower than that for men  of

78% in the same year.  As a group, women workers' average

salaries  were  lower  than male workers.   This  is  not

really because we have unequal pay for the same job,  but

rather  because women are generally still working in  the

lower-paid professions.  These are realities.  Therefore,

the  economic reality of the situation is such  that  the

law  must  continue to provide protection for  women  and

children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding this, the hon. Member might wish to

know that section 69(4) of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1093</b></font><br><br>

the  Women's Charter provides for the Courts to  consider

all   the   circumstances  of  the  case  when   ordering

maintenance for the wife.  These include:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) the financial needs of the wife;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) her income or earning capacity, property and

other financial resources;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) any physical or mental disability of the wife;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) the age of each party to the marriage and the

duration of the marriage;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) the contributions made by each of the parties

to  the  marriage  and  to  the welfare  of  the  family,

including any contribution made by looking after the home

or caring for the family;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) the standard of living enjoyed by the wife

before  the  husband  neglected  or  refused  to  provide

reasonable maintenance; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) the conduct of each of the parties to the

marriage,  if  the conduct is such that it would  in  the

opinion of the court be inequitable to disregard it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law currently provides for the Courts to make

a  fair  and  equitable judgement when making maintenance

orders,  we feel that there is no necessity for  a  means

test  as suggested by the hon. Member.   For this reason,

the   Courts   do  not  always  grant  applications   for

maintenance,  and have indeed dismissed  some,  while  in

other  cases,  have granted a lesser sum for  maintenance

than what was asked for.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  is  the  Minister of State aware that  the  present

reality  is that there are approximately 1,800 households

in  Singapore where the husband or the man is  the  full-time home-maker?  Under these circumstances, would he not

also  agree  that  in  these  cases,  the  men  may  need

financial support should their wives divorce them?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1094</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> As I have mentioned, Sir, the

court  will take all these into consideration when making

the order.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Sir, there is absolutely no

provision  for  men under the Women's  Charter  to  claim

maintenance  from  their wives or  their  ex-wives.   The

court cannot make a maintenance order.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, we are talking about the

Women's Charter, not the Men's Charter.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Would the Minister of State then

not  look into amending the title of the Charter  into  a

Family Charter rather than a Women's Charter, to make  it

more gender equal?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I think the issue of amending the

Women's  Charter  into a Family Charter makes  the  whole

matter  much more complicated.  In fact, the family  also

includes  children.   This matter was actually  discussed

some  years ago.  The decision at that time was  that  it

was  not worthwhile to complicate the Women's Charter  by

amending  it  into a Family Charter because  the  Women's

Charter was working well and it is still working well.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Is the Minister of State aware

that  the  current Women's Charter already  includes  the

protection  of  children?   Therefore,  how   much   more

complicated can it be?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I do not really feel that there is

a  need  to further complicate it.  The Women's Charter's

objective is to basically protect the women and  children

in  the case of matrimony.  This particular objective  is

still  valid  because, as I have mentioned  earlier,  the

socio-economic reality today is that the  men  are  still

stronger than the women and children.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, with your kind

indulgence,  just one more supplementary question.   Back

to my first

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1095</b></font><br><br>

supplementary question, in 1,800 households in Singapore,

the  situation  is  that the man is the  full-time  home-maker.   Would  the Minister of State not agree  that  in

these cases, men too need some protection?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> What form of protection? I think

the  reality is that if these men would like  to  go  and

look  for a job, there are various channels to help  them

to  do  so.  In our society, if a man is healthy with  no

physical  disability, to say that  he  has  got  problems

looking for a job and therefore needs a whole Charter  to

protect him, it would appear a little bit excessive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong</b> rose ---

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chong, you promised me that was the

last one.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong:</b> Yes, Sir, but the Minister of

State's  response really leaves me with no  choice.   The

protection  which  I am seeking for these  1,800  men  is

basically  the  same that is afforded  to  the  women  in

Singapore under the Women's Charter.  Would the  Minister

of  State not agree that this would be more gender  equal

and equitable?

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> I would be very happy to listen to

Mr   Charles   Chong's  proposal  on  specifically   what

protections are needed.  It does not automatically follow

that whenever there is a need for protection, we must  go

and create a whole Charter for the men.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> The Minister of State said earlier

that usually, women are in the lower-paying jobs.  May  I

ask  the  Minister of State why this is so  as  women  in

Singapore  are supposed to be given the same  opportunity

in education and in job placements.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, I think this is a totally

different  question.  The Questions are  on  the  Women's

Charter.   The  Women's Charter was  created  to  protect

women and children because of this economic reality.  The

hon. Member is asking why there is this economic reality.

Perhaps we should discuss it some other time.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1096</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Would the Minister of State not

agree  that it would be much more equitable, when we  are

talking  about  preserving families  and  protecting  the

rights  of families, that a spouse who dedicates  his  or

her  time  to  supporting the family,  thereby  sometimes

giving  up  the ability to build a career, that  whatever

gender that spouse is, should deserve the ability, if the

marriage  should  break up, to getting some  maintenance?

Specifically,  that would be the kind  of  protection,  I

believe,  that  we would be asking for - maintenance  for

either  spouse  in a marriage - for the spouse  that  had

actually  dedicated time away from building a  career  to

building the bonds and looking after the family.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen:</b> Sir, to preserve the family, the

best  way  is to ensure that the marriage does not  break

up.   Therefore, we have in line various forms of  social

services  to help the family preserve its integrity.   We

feel  that is a more positive way of solving this problem

raised by the hon. Member.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for this gender equal issue, when it comes to,

say,  a divorce, I thought my short answer was "not yet".

I  did  not  say  "no".  This question is  asked  in  the

present tense, that is, for the time being, not yet;  100

years from now, who knows?

<div align="center"><b>WORKSKILLS TRAINING PROGRAMME</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower  (a) how many unemployed workers have  taken  up

the  WorkSkills Training Programme since it was  started;

(b)  what  is the age profile as well as educational  and

skills  level  of  these workers who have  taken  up  the

Programme;  and  (c) how many of these  have  since  been

placed  with jobs, by their age profile, educational  and

skills level.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ng Eng Hen (Minister of State for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen) (for the Minister for Manpower):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Dr Amy

Khor asked about the WorkSkills Training Programme.  This

Programme was launched in December 2001.  It was a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1097</b></font><br><br>

programme to help the unemployed cope with job  loss  and

encourage  them to participate in skills upgrading.   For

the  general  information of the House,  this  is  not  a

programme  that specifically deals with skill sets.   The

training   is  more  general.   To  give  you  a   better

understanding  of the programme, it deals  with  managing

their emotions when they are retrenched, financial impact

planning,  managing expectations, job search and  writing

and  interviewing skills.  These are some of  the  things

which  we  teach.  It aims to teach workers how  to  plan

their  next  career  move, search  for  jobs  and  secure

employment quicker.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its inception, about 16,000 workers have been

trained.   Close to 83% or nearly 13,000 were  unemployed

when they signed up for the course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bulk of the participants were above 60 years

old.   In fact, 60% of them were above 35 years old.   In

equivalent proportion, 60% had secondary, NTC-2 or  lower

qualifications.  In  other words, 40% had  post-secondary

qualifications, either in Diploma, ITE or  Degrees.   The

mix  of  trainees  that  I  have just  recounted  broadly

reflects the current educational workforce profile.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have mentioned, the WorkSkills Training

Programmme does not directly place the participants in  a

job.   However, participants are referred to the  various

job-placement  agencies to facilitate  their  job  search

after this course.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the programme is not specifically

directed at job placement, my Ministry was interested  to

know  how effective this was in helping trainees who  had

attended the programme.  We are in the midst of the study

which is expected to end in October.  But I can give some

preliminary results.  The results showed that 43% of  the

sampled trainees managed to secure employment after going

through  the  programme.   We would  like  to  take  some

credit,  but  since  it was not a specific  programme,  I

cannot quite prove the cause and effect.  Nevertheless,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1098</b></font><br><br>

we  did  ask the professionals and the executives whether

they found the programme useful.  98% of the participants

rated  the  programme as helpful in their job search  and

90%  of them said that they would recommend it to someone

else.

10  of  this Convention states that, among other  things,

reiterate   that  according  to  the  Singapore   Medical

Council's survey, 90 male doctors, or 2.8%, as against 67

female  doctors, or 4.2%, were not working as at the  end

of  1999.  And was this data not further confirmed by the

<div align="center"><b>MENTAL ILLNESS AMONG SINGAPOREANS</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman</b> asked the Minister

for  Health  (a) what is the incidence of mental  illness

among  Singaporeans over the last five years;  (b)  given

the  stigma  related to mental illness, will  the  recent

increase  in  charges by the Institute of  Mental  Health

prevent  Singaporeans, who are not eligible for Medifund,

from  seeking  help  for  their  illness;  and  (c)  what

measures  are being taken to ensure that those  who  need

help  will  continue to seek them and not be hindered  by

fee increases.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan (for the Minister for Health):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1100</b></font><br><br>

Sembawang GRC asked about the incidence of mental illness

among  Singaporeans over the last five years.   The  1995

NUS  Study on Mental Health estimates that about  10%  of

Singaporeans  aged 21 to 55 years old have some  form  of

mental  ill health.  Of this figure, about 5%  have  mild

disorders,  while  5% have moderate to severe  disorders.

Major  mental  disorders  are relatively  uncommon.   For

example, the prevalence of schizophrenia in Singapore  is

estimated  to  be about 0.75%, comparable  to  world-wide

figures  which  are in the region of  0.5%  to  1%.   The

prevalence  of  certain common mental disorders  will  be

updated when IMH and NUS conduct a National Mental Health

Survey later this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member also raised his concern that Singaporeans

who  wish to seek help for mental illness may not  do  so

because of the increase in charges at IMH.  I would  like

to  highlight that the fee charges for IMH are still very

affordable, even after the fee revisions.  For  inpatient

care,  the average C Class bill size per day is only  $13

while  the  average B2 Class bill size per  day  is  $30.

This works out to an average increase of only $1 for a  C

Class  bill and $4 for a B2 Class bill, which is minimal.

Patients can also use Medisave and MediShield to pay  for

these  charges.  For outpatient consultation, the average

bill  size after the fee revision is $25, an increase  of

only  $2.   Therefore, the increase in  fees  should  not

deter   Singaporeans  from  seeking   help   for   mental

conditions if they need to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, should patients be unable to afford the

highly  subsidised  bills  even  after  they  have   used

Medisave  and MediShield, Medifund is available  to  help

them.  I wish to reassure the Member that flexibility  is

given  to  the Medical Social Workers to extend  Medifund

assistance to Singaporeans who cannot afford to pay their

bills.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamed Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamed Maliki bin Osman:</b> Sir, can the Minister

of  State  comment  on the numbers in proportion  to  the

population?   How  do the numbers stand  with  regard  to

other countries that we know of?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> There are no significant

differences  in the rate of mental illness  in  Singapore

versus other countries.

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, what kind of professional training and specialist

skills  are the nurses and caregivers given in the mental

institutes to provide for the care of mental patients?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, there are three levels of

caregivers.  First, we have the doctors.  The consultants

are all psychiatrists.  This is a medical sub-speciality.

The  nurses  are  given training in  psychiatric  nursing

before  they can work in IMH.  And then we have the  non-nursing  medical staff like cleaners, etc, and they  also

have to be orientated to work in the hospital.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1102</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong:</b> What recourse do the ex-patients of a mental hospital have if they feel that they

have  been unduly treated by the nurses?  If they try  to

complain, they are told that they are crazy, and so  they

are given a medical jab, etc.

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> They can write to the Ministry

of Health and we will investigate the case.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamed Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamed Maliki bin Osman:</b> Sir, given the recent

economic  crisis  and  stress, I would  assume  that  the

stress  level  would be going up.  The  manifestation  of

psychiatric  conditions  would  be  increasing,  but  the

numbers seem to be showing a decreasing trend.  I  wonder

if  this  decreasing trend means that people  are  coping

better  with psychiatric circumstances or whether  it  is

because  the  medical  fees  are  going  up.   Could  the

Minister of State also relate his answer to the last  fee

increases  in  terms of IMH fees and to  comment  on  the

reduction in the number?

<br><br><!-- Dr Balaji Sadasivan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</b> Sir, with regard to the

reduction  in  numbers, there is a  tendency  across  all

countries  and  also in Singapore for  patients  to  seek

psychiatric  help at outpatient clinics  and  in  private

clinics,  because  there is still  a  certain  amount  of

unease about going to a mental hospital to follow  up  on

their outpatient psychiatric treatment.  So we can expect

that  over  the next 10 years, numbers will  continue  to

decrease,  and more and more outpatient care will  be  in

settings  that are not special psychiatric  clinics,  but

you  can  see  a  psychiatrist who sees  patients  in  an

outpatient clinic.

<div align="center"><b>DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for Trade

and  Industry (a) how can Singaporeans embrace the  Prime

Minister's and Senior Minister's visions on the  need  to

focus  on  booming China in the context of  engaging  and

doing  business  in  China; and  (b)  as  the  window  of

opportunity  can run out fast, what programmes  or  plans

are there to realise these visions

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1103</b></font><br><br>

and help derive the maximum advantage for Singapore.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in July last year and, more

recently, during the Committee of Supply debate on  MTI's

budget  this year, I have outlined our China  policy  and

what  our  economic  agencies have  been  doing  to  help

Singaporeans  do  business in China.  I will  provide  an

update today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore companies have invested in close to 10,000

projects  in China, amounting to about US$20  billion  to

date.   China has now become Singapore's largest overseas

investment destination, overtaking Malaysia since 1997 in

cumulative  terms.  Our businessmen have been positioning

themselves to take advantage of the many opportunities in

China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of them have done well. For example, Khong

Guan  sold  300 million RMB (S$67 million) worth  of  its

products in China last year.  Education services provider

TMC  has attracted 1,000 full-time students in its  Xi'an

campus  alone,  thanks to its modern facilities  and  the

quality  of  its courses.  Smart Garments has grown  from

280 workers in 1985 to 2,600 workers in its three Chinese

factories today, producing 1.75 million suits a year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides investing in China, our companies have also

begun  to  partner with Chinese companies  that  are  now

seeking  to internationalise in exploring other  markets.

For  example, one of our local companies has successfully

partnered Zhejiang-based Feiyue Sewing Machine  Group  to

enter the India market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are steadily building up our China network. It

is  impossible  to  do  business in  China  without  good

networking.   Last  month,  we  launched  the   Singapore

Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  in  Beijing.  This,

together   with  Network  China  that  was  launched   in

Singapore a year ago by DPM Lee Hsien Loong and  Chairman

of    the   Chinese   People's   Political   Consultative

Conference,  Li  Ruihuan, will provide a useful  platform

for companies operating in China to network, interact and

share

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1104</b></font><br><br>

experiences  and business ideas.  Singapore  Chamber  and

Network  China  provide  a  support  base  for  Singapore

companies operating in China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao visited

Singapore  in  April  this  year,  he  raised  a  4-Point

Proposal  with  the  Prime Minister,  to  cooperate  with

Singapore  in  (i)  helping  Chinese  enterprises  to  go

global,  (ii)  high-tech  areas,  (iii)  development   of

Western China and (iv) human resource development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since April, we have been working on these four

proposals with the Chinese Government.  EDB recently  set

up  a new office in Shanghai to attract Chinese companies

to Singapore.  China's Ministry of Science and Technology

has  announced  its plans to set up an innovation  centre

for  China's  high-tech enterprises  in  Singapore.   And

during  my recent visit to China, the Zhejiang provincial

and  city  governments reacted positively to our proposal

for  the establishment of a Zhejiang Centre in Singapore,

as  a facility for Zhejiang companies to market, showcase

and provide after-sales service for their products in the

region.  In Brunei recently, I also discussed the idea of

a  China  Centre  with the Chinese Minister  for  Foreign

Trade  and Economic Cooperation, Shi Guangsheng, to  help

Chinese  companies use Singapore as a base to regionalise

and internationalise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, the Chinese Ambassador announced that the

China  Council  for the Promotion of International  Trade

will establish a regional office in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have relaxed our visa policies to facilitate the

flow of Chinese tourists into Singapore, and PRC business

travellers can now obtain multiple-journey visas  for  up

to  five years.  We are also interested to participate in

the  development of Western China.  Minister Mah Bow  Tan

visited  Sichuan  in  May  this year,  and  IE  Singapore

organised  two  business missions to Western  China  last

year, focusing on education and infocomm technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separately, ASEAN is negotiating a Free Trade

Agreement with China

within

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1105</b></font><br><br>

10  years,  and  a  Framework Agreement incorporating  an

Early  Harvest is expected to be signed when the  Leaders

meet in November in Phnom Penh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector is the prime mover in seeking out

business  opportunities in China.   The  Government  will

play a supportive role.  One area that the Government can

help is in manpower training.

<div align="center"><b>INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Senior Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill amends the International Arbitration Act

to  make  it  clear  that parties to  an  arbitration  in

Singapore  are  free  to adopt the arbitration  rules  of

their  choice to govern their arbitration, and that their

choice   of  arbitration  rules  will  be  respected   by

Singapore  law and be given the fullest effect  possible.

Examples  of  arbitration rules are the  UNCITRAL  Rules,

SIAC Rules, ICC Rules and LCIA Rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill's clarification will reaffirm Singapore's

position  as an attractive venue for arbitration  in  the

region.  It also reaffirms Government's intention  to  do

whatever is necessary to create conducive conditions  for

the conduct of international arbitrations in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The International Arbitration Act was passed in 1995

to   adopt   the  UNCITRAL  Model  Law  on  International

Commercial  Arbitration as part of  Singapore's  domestic

law.   The UNCITRAL Model Law is not a set of arbitration

rules.   It  is intended to be the applicable arbitration

law or, in lawyers' parlance - the curial

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1108</b></font><br><br>

law  or  lex  arbitri.   Like all arbitration  laws,  the

UNCITRAL  Model Law does not contain a comprehensive  set

of   procedural  rules,  but  merely  sets  out  a  basic

procedural  framework.  The expectation is  that  parties

will  supplement  this  basic procedural  framework  with

arbitration rules of their choice.  Parties are also free

to  choose  their  own alternative arrangements  in  most

procedural  matters.  Indeed, one of the key  pillars  of

the  UNCITRAL  Model  Law  is  the  protection  of  party

autonomy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, parties to a Singapore arbitration

are  free to adopt whatever set of arbitration rules they

wish.   The  Model Law is specifically drafted to  ensure

that   parties'  wishes  are  given  the  fullest  effect

possible.   Sir,  this has been the legal position  since

this House adopted the Model Law as part of Singapore law

in  1995,  and has always remained so.  And this  is  how

both  the international and local arbitration communities

have always understood the legal position to be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, some uncertainty has arisen as a result of

a  Singapore  High  Court  case, Dermajaya  Properties  v

Premium Properties, which was decided earlier this  year.

The  correctness of the actual decision in this  case  is

not in dispute.  What has caused concern in some quarters

was  a  comment  made  by  the judge  in  the  course  of

delivering  his judgment.  He commented that, if  parties

adopt   a   set  of  arbitration  rules  which   contains

procedures which are different from those contemplated by

the  Model  Law,  then those arbitration rules  would  be

regarded  as  incompatible with the Model Law  and  would

therefore   be  entirely  excluded.   This  comment   was

strictly not necessary in arriving at the actual decision

in  the  case, and therefore did not have the  effect  of

changing  the  law  on the applicability  of  arbitration

rules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, my Ministry has received feedback that

lawyers in some international law firms had advised their

clients  that,  as  a result of the Dermajaya  case,  the

legal   position  in  Singapore  is  now  uncertain.    I

understand that some of these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1109</b></font><br><br>

lawyers   have  also  advised  their  clients  to   avoid

Singapore as a venue for arbitration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has therefore decided to set out the

legal position in no uncertain terms.  The Bill does this

by   adding  a  new  section  15A  to  the  International

Arbitration Act.  The first subsection of the new section

15A   declares,   for  the  avoidance  of   doubt,   that

arbitration rules adopted by parties shall apply and must

be   given  effect  to  the  extent  that  they  are  not

inconsistent with a mandatory provision of the Act or the

Model Law.  A mandatory provision is one whereby the  Act

or Model Law does not permit the parties to derogate from

or  vary.   This  therefore reinforces the  principle  of

party  autonomy, and makes it clear beyond doubt that  no

set  of  arbitration rules ought ever to be  regarded  as

incompatible with the Act or the Model Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining subsections seek to flesh out the

concept  of  inconsistency, by referring to a  number  of

scenarios  where there could be doubts as to whether  any

inconsistency  exists.  For example, it is  clarified  in

the  Bill  that there is no inconsistency  if  the  rules

provide  for something on which the Act or the Model  Law

is  silent  or  if the Act or the Model Law provides  for

something on which the rules are silent.  There  is  also

no inconsistency if the rules provide for something which

is  already covered by a non-mandatory provision  of  the

Act or the Model Law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise, the general approach is that

arbitration  rules adopted by the parties will  be  given

full  effect.   Where  there is a  conflict  between  the

arbitration rules and the Act or the Model Law, the rules

will  prevail  unless the conflict is  with  a  mandatory

provision of the Act or the Model Law.  Hence, in effect,

with  this  narrow  exception,  parties  to  a  Singapore

arbitration   will  have  the  full  freedom   to   adopt

arbitration rules of their choice.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1110</b></font><br><br>

This   is  another  move  which  will  further  establish

Singapore's position as one of the most conducive  places

for  international  arbitration  in  the  region.   Other

measures  we  have  already introduced  include  allowing

foreign  counsel to participate in arbitrations conducted

in  Singapore,  streamlining immigration  procedures  for

foreign  arbitrators and abolishing withholding  tax  for

foreign  arbitrators.  Recently, the SIAC announced  that

it  would lower the fees charged for its services, expand

its  panel  of arbitrators and extend the scope  of  SIAC

arbitrations.  In short, Sir, we will do more to  promote

Singapore   as   a  preferred  venue  for   international

arbitrations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to

a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>(Motion)</b></div>

<br>2.14 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move*,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House, noting the concern of Prime

Minister Goh Chok Tong as highlighted in his National Day

Rally  Speech on "stayers" and "quitters" and in view  of

the  increased mobility of third-generation Singaporeans,

urges   the   Government  to  review  its  policies   and

programmes  thoroughly  and to take  meaningful  measures

that will help to strengthen their sense of belonging  to

Singapore.



<hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion also stood in the names of Dr Chong Weng

Chiew, Ms Indranee Rajah, Dr Mohamad Maliki bin Osman, Dr

Ong Seh Hong and Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong.

<hr align="center" width="100%" size="2" noshade>





<br><br><i>Background</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister's speech at the

National  Day  Rally  touched  on  a  very  crucial   and

sensitive  issue, that of stayers and quitters.   The  PM

asked,  and  I  quote, "Will Singaporeans  be  rooted  to

Singapore?  Will enough Singaporeans

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1111</b></font><br><br>

stay  here, to ensure our country's long term survival?".

He  was  concerned  about fair weather  Singaporeans  who

would  run  away  whenever the country runs  into  stormy

weather.  He called them quitters.  The speech sparked  a

series  of spirited debate over the issue of stayers  and

quitters  in  the  media and among many Singaporeans  who

cared about the issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Singaporeans resented the labels of stayers and

quitters.   They were quick to offer reasons  for  people

wanting  to leave the country.  They rigorously  defended

their decision to move out.  Some even went to the extent

of  stating  their intention to leave but  complained  of

their inability to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there were also Singaporeans who

were  passionate  about  the country  and  pledged  their

loyalty   and  commitment  publicly.   There  were   even

foreigners  who  felt  strongly enough  to  join  in  the

debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judging from the public reaction to PM's speech, the

issue  of stayers and quitters is close to the hearts  of

many  Singaporeans, if not all Singaporeans.  The PM  has

clearly achieved his intention "to jolt Singaporeans into

thinking about the issue".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we endeavour to re-position our economy and

remake Singapore, we cannot lose sight of the fundamental

issue  of Singaporeans' identity and commitment.   As  we

strive to create a new Singapore, we must be certain that

Singaporeans do want this new Singapore and are committed

enough  to  be  willing  to make personal  sacrifices  to

defend our ideals and to realise our dreams.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the gravity of this issue, I felt that it

should  rightfully  be debated in Parliament,  being  the

highest  governing  authority in  the  country.   We,  as

leaders,  must  make  a  stand  and  lead  the   way   to

strengthening  our  commitment  to  the  shared   vision.

Therefore,   after   discussing  with   a   few   of   my

parliamentary colleagues, we decided to table a motion on

stayers and quitters at this sitting.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1112</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>The Objective</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By moving the motion, we hope to provide a formal

and  official  forum where this issue can  be  thoroughly

debated.  Both the backbench and the frontbench will have

an  opportunity to express their views on  this  subject.

We  hope  that, by doing so, we can identify and  clarify

the  real issues that are confronting us today.   We  can

then begin to examine our policies and programmes from  a

balanced perspective to see if there are weaknesses  that

need   to  be  addressed  in  order  to  help  strengthen

Singaporeans'  sense of belonging and commitment  to  the

nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transparent process of parliamentary debate will

also  create greater awareness among Singaporeans of  the

issue of stayers and quitters and will undoubtedly send a

strong  signal to them on what it would take  for  us  to

meet the challenges ahead.

<br><br><i>The Motion Defined</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, allow me to explain the motion.

First,  let  me  say what it is not.  The motion  is  not

about  identifying who are the stayers  or  who  are  the

quitters.   The  labelling does nothing productive.   The

focus  of the motion is to debate on the possible  causes

of  people wanting to quit Singapore and what we need  to

do to make them stay.  What do Singaporeans want?  Can we

give  them what they want without compromising collective

national  interests?  What do we need to  do  to  achieve

that?   I am not naive enough to believe that we can  all

agree on the same answers to these questions.  But if  we

can find some common ground to start working on, we would

have made good progress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, what is the issue then? I think the key issue

facing   us  today  is  not  about  Singaporeans  leaving

Singapore,  not  about them going  overseas,  be  it  for

studies or for work.  Singapore is fast becoming a global

city.   It is inevitable that more and more Singaporeans,

especially   the   younger   generation,   or   the    3G

Singaporeans, will be going overseas to work.   This,  in

itself,  is  not  a bad thing.  The Government  has  been

encouraging our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1113</b></font><br><br>

companies to go global.  To do so, we must be prepared to

send  our managers and workers overseas.  In fact,  given

that overseas operations are often more complex than  the

home  ground, we usually end up sending out the  best  of

the   breed.   Going  overseas  to  work  does  not  make

Singaporeans quitters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, many of our forefathers came from China,

India,  and other countries.  They came here  to  make  a

living  and  most of them did not even have a  chance  to

return  to  their motherland.  However, I have  no  doubt

that  deep  down in their hearts, many of them felt  that

they  were more Chinese or Indians than Singaporeans even

till their death.  It took us more than one generation to

change  this  migrant mentality.  Surely, our forefathers

were   no  quitters  when  they  left  their  motherland.

Similarly,  many Japanese have worked overseas  for  many

years  as their industrialisation programme took them  to

where  the  markets  were.   They  are  still  very  much

Japanese in their hearts and they all look forward to the

day   they  can  return  to  Japan,  although  they  will

invariably  find  great difficulties in adapting  to  the

lifestyle at home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real issue, Sir, is an affair of the heart. It

is about our emotional linkage to Singapore.  It is about

our  sense of belonging, our sense of ownership  and  our

sense  of  responsibility to the country.  Regardless  of

where  we are physically, will we stand up and be counted

when   Singapore  needs  us?   Are  we  willing  to  make

sacrifices  for  the interests of fellow Singaporeans  or

would  we  give up instead at the first sign of  trouble?

Do  we take Singapore as our home, or do we treat it like

a hotel?  That is the question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that many Singaporeans are committed to

Singapore.   However  difficult the situation  may  seem,

they  will  stay  and  fight.  The  introduction  of  the

NEWater  in  response to the threat by  Malaysia  on  our

water  supplies is a good example of the "never say  die"

spirit.   For this, I must applaud the Minister  for  the

Environment for his efforts.  However, I think we cannot

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1114</b></font><br><br>

take this commitment for granted.  While there may not be

a  major  problem today, we need to be conscious  of  the

issue  and  continuously work at it to  prevent  it  from

becoming  a major problem.  As our economic restructuring

and  remaking of Singapore pick up momentum, the need  to

address Singaporeans' commitment to the country has  also

become increasingly urgent.

<br><br><i>The Issue</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the last 30 years, we have

built  ourselves a world-class infrastructure.   We  have

one  of  the world's best airport and sea port.  We  have

one of the most efficient transport and telecommunication

system.   We have the best hardware.  We have also  built

ourselves a world-class workforce.  Our productivity  has

been  the main attraction to foreign investors.  We  have

the  best software.  Now, we must also build ourselves  a

world-class citizen, what I call the HEARTware.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to understand what are the issues at the

hearts  of Singaporeans.  What cause them to think  about

quitting?   I  think  there are three  main  issues  that

concern most Singaporeans who are sitting on the fence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, they feel that Singapore's lifestyle is too

stressful.   Their  children face  a  lot  of  stress  in

schools.   They themselves face a lot of stress at  work.

This stress is then brought home and they face stress  in

their  family relationship which may eventually  lead  to

the  breaking up of their family.  They believe  that  by

quitting  Singapore,  they may be able  to  find  a  less

stressful   lifestyle   in   another   country,   another

environment,  and  they will be happier,  their  children

will  be happier and they can keep their family together.

Whether  they  are right or wrong is not the  issue  here

because  they may never be able to find out  whether  the

pasture  is indeed greener over the other side.  What  is

important is their perception.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, stress is inevitable. In fact, I would say

stress  is sometimes healthy, if given the right  dosage.

Singapore is a unique

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1115</b></font><br><br>

country   with  no  natural  resources  and  no   natural

advantage.  It was a miracle that we could get as far  as

we  did.  We need to continue to strive to stay ahead  of

our competitors.  Therein lies the origin of stress.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, perhaps we could examine whether the level

of stress has exceeded the safe dosage.  Are Singaporeans

suffering  from an overdose of stress?  We can also  look

into  how  we  can  help Singaporeans  better  cope  with

stress.  Can we put in some relief valves?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, some Singaporeans think that there are

greater  opportunities  elsewhere  where  they  can  make

better  progress  than  the  competitive  environment  in

Singapore  can offer them.  Instead of being a technician

here,  he can be an engineer in another country.  Instead

of  being a worker, he can be a manager.  As we bring  in

foreign  talents,  Singaporeans also can  become  foreign

talents to other countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is Singapore will always remain

competitive,  given  our unique situation.   The  key  is

whether we can offer equally attractive opportunities  to

Singaporeans.  The question is whether we can offer  them

more  than economic opportunities.  Can we convince  them

to look beyond personal career achievements?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, many Singaporeans complain about the rising

cost of living here.  They accept that this is the result

of  providing a higher standard of living.  However, they

feel  that  the  higher  standard  of  living  does   not

necessarily translate into better quality of life.   They

may  have three golf clubs, but they do not have time  to

play  golf.  They may have a big bungalow, but  they  are

hardly at home.  They hope that in a different world, the

cost  of living may be lower and they can afford to  have

lower  income.  Even if the standard of living is  lower,

at  least  they  may  have  more  quality  time  for  the

children, the family and themselves.  Their intention may

be quite noble.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While cost increases may not be avoidable, we may be

able  to  manage  the process better and to  ensure  that

better

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1116</b></font><br><br>

standard of living does translate into better quality  of

living.

<br><br><i>The Approach</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to address these issues, we need to focus on

three aspects, and I would summarise it with three  Cs  - Committed, Connected and Concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Committed people. We need to get

Singaporeans committed to our cause.  We need them to  be

committed not only to themselves, but to their family, to

their  community  and  to their country.   Commitment  to

Singapore  goes beyond the property and assets that  they

have.   Many Singaporeans have houses in other countries,

Australia,  Canada, UK and more recently,  China.   House

ownership is no longer the key to commitment.  We need to

create  in  them  a sense of ownership not  just  of  the

house, but of the nation.  Then they will have a sense of

responsibility towards the country that they own and from

there comes a sense of belonging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Connected people. We spend millions

every  year building covered linkways to connect all  the

HDB  blocks.  We must also build linkways to connect  the

hearts  of Singaporeans.  I believe that Singaporeans  do

have  a heart but they need to be linked up.  We need  to

encourage   and   build   stronger   relationship   among

Singaporeans.   Very often when a person is contemplating

quitting Singapore, the one last thing that ties him back

is  the  relationship  he has with his  friends  and  his

relatives here.  The stronger that sense of relationship,

the  more determined he will be to stay and fight.   This

relationship  must start at home.  A strong  family  bond

will  help spur a strong sense of belonging.  This  sense

of  belonging  will  then motivate us to  strengthen  our

community  bonding.   With this, we can  begin  to  build

relationship with the nation and the individuals.   There

is  no  short cut.  To try to develop a strong  sense  of

nationalism  without strong family and community  bonding

will be an uphill task.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the Concerned people. We must change the bo-chap attitude of Singaporeans. I believe that most

Singaporeans

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1117</b></font><br><br>

do   chap.    Judging  from  the  heated  response   from

Singaporeans to PM's speech, I think I am right.   And  I

hope  I am right.  The question is whether we can further

encourage this sense of ai-chap.  Can we get Singaporeans

engaged?   Can we get them concerned?  Can  we  get  them

involved?   It  is  always difficult to  walk  away  from

something you have helped to build up.

<br><br><i>Proposed Initiatives</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with these three themes in mind, I

would  like  to  urge the Government  to  consider  three

initiatives:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I would like to urge the Government to

review  our education policy to give greater emphasis  on

building  a strong character in our children.   Education

is   fundamental  in  nation  building.    The   learning

institutions have a vital role to play in the remaking of

Singaporeans.    They   carry   with   them   the   great

responsibility  of  shaping our future  generations.   In

this regard, I would like to make four suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, greater focus on character building in our

curriculum.   Our  strive  for  excellence   in   today's

knowledge-based   economy  dictates   that   our   school

curriculum  has  to  focus  primarily  on  knowledge  and

skills,   subjects  that  can  equip  our   children   to

participate  in  the new economy, subjects  that  matter.

Our  children  too  will focus on subjects  that  matter,

namely,  those  that will be tested  and  scored.   Other

subjects,  such  as  Hao Gong Min  are  given  much  less

emphasis.   The  schools  must  provide  more  than  just

knowledge  and  skills.   It is where  our  character  is

moulded and developed during the early days of our lives.

It   is  also  where  we  first  derive  our  values  and

principles.   If we focus only on the hard  subjects,  we

will  produce an army of efficient workers, but  we  will

not produce citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can still recall the story of Yuefei, which I read

during  my primary school days.  His patriotic and heroic

story has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1118</b></font><br><br>

inspired  many, like me, to feel a sense of duty  to  the

nation.  Yuefei was born in the year 1103.  When  he  was

young, his mother tattooed four words on his back,  "jing

zhong  bao  guo", which means "be loyal  and  repay  your

country".   He  later became the general  commanding  the

armies  of  the  Song dynasty.  During the 12th  century,

when  China was attacked by invaders from the  north,  he

led  the  Song  armies in defence of his  homeland.   His

attempt  to  push north and recover all the lost  Chinese

territory  was opposed, however, by a peace party  within

the  capital headed by Minister Qinhui, who believed that

further  prosecution  of the war  would  be  too  costly.

Qin's  faction  proved  more influential  and,  in  1141,

Yuefei  was  recalled to the Song court  and  imprisoned.

Later,  he  was  executed, after  being  framed  by  Qin.

Yuefei's  dedication and commitment to his country  serve

as  a  model for many Chinese patriots.  Many  songs  and

poems  written by General Yuefei are still  cherished  by

the  Chinese today, and there are even movies made  about

Yuefei,  eg,  "shi  er  jin pai",  and  I  am  sure  many

Singaporeans  of  my vintage are also familiar  with  the

story of Yuefei.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Real historical stories like these will inspire

readers to develop a sense of patriotism.  Yes, it  is  a

story  from  China,  but I am sure we  can  find  similar

stories  from  other places as well.   I  would  like  to

suggest  that  some of these should be incorporated  into

our   school  curriculum,  especially  in  the   language

lessons,  so  that there is no need to add on  the  load.

For  example,  instead of talking about  the  Tail  of  a

Squirrel  (one  of the passages I read in  my  daughter's

Chinese  textbook), we can tell stories about  Yuefei  or

about  George Washington and his cherry tree.  This  way,

we can help build the character of our students.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion is to introduce activities that

encourage   teamwork   and   inculcate   a    sense    of

accountability and responsibility in our schools.   These

can  either take the form of sports and games or  project

work.   It  is important for our children to  learn  from

young that he is not alone and he cannot work alone.   He

is part of the team and part of the big picture.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1119</b></font><br><br>

There  is a Chinese saying, "xi sheng xiao wo, wan  cheng

ta  wao",  which  means  to sacrifice  yourself  for  the

interest of the greater community.  These activities will

be  able  to  demonstrate that only by making  individual

sacrifices  -  be it time, interest or  money  -  can  we

succeed  and,  ultimately,  all  will  benefit  from  it.

Through these activities, they can also learn that  while

others  depend on them to do their best, they too  depend

on  others.   This  interdependence is the  beginning  of

relationship building and community bonding.  Let us  not

underestimate  the  impact of  some  of  these  seemingly

simple  and  childish  activities.   They  leave  a  long

lasting impression on the minds of our young ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, develop greater tolerance for failures in our

schools.   One of the causes of the kiasu syndrome  stems

from  the  fact  that we have very little  tolerance  for

setbacks and failures.  In our competitive system  today,

it  is  natural  that  failures are  costly,  whether  in

schools, society or the economy.  However, there is again

a  Chinese saying, "shi bai shi cheng gong zhi  mu",  ie,

failure  is  the mother of success.  If we cannot  accept

failures,  we  cannot achieve success.  As we  develop  a

gracious  society,  we  must also be  mindful  to  create

greater  capacity  for failures.  This way,  Singaporeans

will  be  assured  of acceptance by the society  and  the

nation, despite their shortcomings, and they do not  need

to run to another country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our children in schools must be taught to expect

failures, and that perseverance will eventually  lead  to

success.  I remember when I first went to the UK  for  my

university   education,  I  had  great  difficulties   in

handling the laboratory sessions.  The instruction sheets

given  to  me  had no instructions at all.   They  merely

stated  the requirements.  It was up to us to figure  out

what  to do.  My teammate - another Singaporean -  and  I

tried  every  other way but could not  get  the  results.

Finally,  after some four hours and after all  the  other

students  had gone home, we figured it out.  We  did  not

fail.   We  merely found a dozen ways that did not  work.

Our  schools should also consider introducing  open-ended

activities and programmes

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1120</b></font><br><br>

like  these  that require our children to  try  and  keep

trying.   This  way, we will build a strong character  in

them  that  can accept failures of others as well  as  of

their own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four, revamp our National Education Programme. The

objectives behind the NEP are good.  But if the programme

cannot  effectively reach out to our children,  it  could

not  serve  our purpose.  I believe that the  subject  of

National  Education is a subject of  the  heart,  and  it

cannot  be taught by simply reciting to them our nation's

short  history.   Colourful as it  may  be,  the  younger

generation may find it hard to relate.  Unlike the  first

and second generation Singaporeans who have lived through

the  early  years  of separation from  Malaysia  and  the

struggle   against   communist   infiltration,   the   3G

generation   has  grown  up  in  relative  security   and

prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that to be successful in our National

Education  effort,  we  need to  take  a  more  practical

approach.   I  would like to suggest that we enhance  and

expand  the  Community  Involvement  Programme  for  this

purpose.   If  we allow our students to be involved  more

actively in community and national development, no matter

how big or small it is, it will give them a greater sense

of   ownership.   We  can  even  encourage  our  tertiary

institutions to organise groups that discuss  and  debate

about  Government  policies.  This will generate  greater

awareness and engagement.  There are risks no doubt,  but

the  reward  of having a committed citizen is well  worth

the risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second initiative: I would like to urge the

Government to review our social policies to build a home,

and  not  a  hotel.   A hotel may have 5-star  facilities

compared  to my small apartment, but it is not  my  home.

What  makes  a home?  A home is a place where  I  have  a

relationship  with  my  family members,  my  parents,  my

spouse  and my children.  A home is a place where I  have

some say in how it is run.  A home is a haven that I long

to  return  to for safety and security and,  when  it  is

threatened, I would not hesitate to defend it with all  I

have got.  I am almost certain that all of us would agree

with this

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1121</b></font><br><br>

perception  of home.  The issue is: how do  we  make  our

nation our home?  I would like to make three suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, strengthen our family bonding. If we do not

feel  at home in our own home, we cannot feel at home  in

our country.  Therefore, we must start with strengthening

our family ties.  In one of my dialogue sessions with  my

residents, some of them suggested that we need more space

and  avenues  for family outings and activities.   Today,

one  of  the  most  favourite family pastimes  is  window

shopping.   This does nothing to strengthen family  ties.

In  fact, it weakens the pocket and creates more  stress.

We   must   create   more   affordable   and   convenient

destinations  for  families and  friends.   Some  of  our

attractions,  such as the zoo, the bird  park,  etc,  are

designed for tourists, and may not be resident or family-friendly.  For example, can we make a conscious effort to

review the entrance charges to promote family tickets  or

season  tickets?  Or we can even have a universal  family

pass  to  allow discounted entries to all our attractions

the  whole  year round, so long as they come as  a  whole

family.   This way, we will draw them away from  all  the

shops   to  spend  time  with  each  other  in  wholesome

activities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have a Children's Day, a Youth Day, a

Mother's Day and a Father's Day.  Maybe, we should have a

Family Day where families take centrestage, and make it a

public  holiday.   This will go a long way  to  reminding

Singaporeans of the value of our family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, strengthen social and community bonding.

Yesterday's  newspaper quoted Mr Wee Cho  Yaw  as  saying

that  there  is little meaningful interaction  among  the

various  racial groups despite the peaceful  co-existence

for  many  years.  I hope he is wrong.  But we must  have

realistic expectations.  The differences in our  cultural

and  religious background are not easy to bridge.  It may

take   several   generations  before   progress   becomes

apparent.   But  we must not quit.  We must  continue  to

build on social and community bonding.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1122</b></font><br><br>

We   must  develop  individual's  relationship  with  the

community.  From my experience, I find it most  effective

when  people work together on certain projects  and  they

develop an esprit de corp as they go through the process.

They  learn  to  respect and accept  one  another.   They

develop a special bonding among themselves.  As community

leaders,  they can then help to expand this same  bonding

to  other residents.  I would like to urge the Government

to  give more resources and greater mandate to the Inter-Racial Confidence Circles for this purpose.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for social bonding is not just among

different  races.  Even within the same  race,  there  is

also  a  need to strengthen our bonds.  When we lived  in

kampongs  in  the old days, we were much  closer  to  one

another,  although we were physically further apart.   We

need  to  re-kindle that kampong spirit to  re-build  the

depth of community bonding.  Recently, I attended several

lantern  festivals within our GRC and  I  was  pleasantly

surprised  by  the large turn-out, from different  races,

not  just the Chinese.  This is due in no small  part  to

the  hard work of the grassroots leaders, and I must also

thank our Mayor, Dr Teo Ho Pin, for his support.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it leads me to ask the question: what is in it

that  attracts the people?  Perhaps it is more than  just

the  makan  and  the goodie bags.  Some  of  them  simply

brought their kids along and joined in the fun.  They lit

up  candles on the pavement, much to the annoyance of the

town councils, and they chatted with one another.  If  we

can   promote  more  of  these  traditional  and  festive

cultural  events, it will help foster greater interaction

among our residents.  Perhaps the Government can consider

sponsoring  a few major events like these,  in  order  to

give them the resources and the recognition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, let people have some say. There has been

much  criticism of the Government for failing to take  in

feedback  seriously.  I agree that we cannot  govern  the

country  based  on feedback alone.  The Prime  Minister's

example  of seeing a doctor on slimming pills is  a  good

one.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1123</b></font><br><br>

But  I would suggest that Singaporeans' relationship with

the  nation  is  not  that  of a patient  consulting  his

doctor.   It  is a family affair.  Singapore  is  not  my

clinic but my home.  In the past, whatever my father says

goes.   Now, whatever I say, my daughters will ask "why?"

and  my wife will go "why not?", and a debate will ensue.

Eventually,  my wife or myself will make a decision,  but

not  without painstakingly explaining to my children  the

rationale for the decision.  They may not always be happy

with the outcome, but they are usually satisfied that due

consideration has been given to their views.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, it is important for the Government to

explain  its  decisions carefully and thoroughly  to  the

people  to  minimise misunderstandings.  The recent  fare

increase  is  a  case in point.  While the people  accept

that  cost increases may be inevitable, the communication

process can be improved.  Singaporeans need to be assured

that    the   Government   understands   their    current

difficulties and have factored them into their decisions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication and mutual understanding is the basic

foundation of a closely-knit family and a loving home.  I

would therefore urge all Government agencies to make  the

extra  effort  in obtaining feedback proactively  and  to

take  pains  to explain tough policies to our people,  so

that they can feel part of this big family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, other than education policy and

social  policy, the third initiative relates to the  need

to review our economic policy to strike a balance between

economic  progress and social cohesion.  As our  economic

restructuring  progresses,  there  is  a  risk  that   an

increasing  number of Singaporeans may feel left  behind.

They  either cannot adapt to the new economy or may  find

it  very  painful to do so.  They feel that they  can  no

longer fit into the family and they have no choice but to

quit.   Worse, some of them cannot even afford  to  quit,

given  the limited resources they have.  So even if  they

have  not physically quit from Singapore, they have  done

so  emotionally.  This is a real problem that  we  should

not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1124</b></font><br><br>

ignore.  To this, I would like to make three suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, make space for every Singaporean. We must

ensure  that all Singaporeans have a place in  Singapore,

not  just for the elite, so long as he tries his best and

regardless  of his achievements.  We cannot  abandon  the

meritocracy  philosophy as it is the very  basis  of  our

existence and success so far.  But if we continue to tell

our  people  that there is no free lunch  and  that  they

either  wake  up or lose out, the message we  are  giving

them  may  be  interpreted as telling them  to  fend  for

themselves and that we will do whatever it takes to  move

on.  We cannot say that to a family member, even if he is

handicapped and, especially, if he is handicapped.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, my 6-year-old daughter came home from a

cartoon  movie,  Lilo and Stitch.  She  quoted  to  me  a

phrase  from  the  show.  She said,  "Dad,  Ohanna  means

family."   Family means nobody gets left  behind.   As  a

family, we must give every member a fair chance, fair  in

relation  to each person's ability.  If one  of  them  is

slower but he has tried his best, we cannot abandon  him.

We must assure him that there is a place in Singapore for

him because this is his home.  He may not get the job  he

wishes but there are always job opportunities for him  so

long  as  he  tries and is willing to  be  flexible.   So

instead  of  telling our people that  there  is  no  free

lunch,  perhaps we should change the tune and  tell  them

that we will help them to find their lunch.  We must tell

them  that every Singaporean matters, whether you  are  a

taxi  driver or an SIA pilot, whether you are a  mechanic

or  a  biochemist, whether you are a professional  or  an

entrepreneur - you have a place and a role in  Singapore.

You  can  always contribute meaningfully.  You matter  to

us.  And in return, Singapore will matter to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, create alternative career opportunities. Not

all  Singaporeans can fit into the main stream.  Some  of

them may not be as good academically but they may be able

to  excel in other fields, arts, sports, etc.  If we  can

open up new avenues for these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1125</b></font><br><br>

people to pursue their career development, it would  help

to  demonstrate that we care about them and help persuade

them  to  remain committed to Singapore.  I  believe  the

Remaking Singapore Committee is addressing this issue and

I eagerly await its report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, balance economic progress with social

progress.    As  we pursue economic excellence,  we  must

balance  it  with  strengthening of  our  social  fabric.

Those doing better must have a sense of responsibility to

care  for  those  who  may  need  an  extra  hand.    The

Government  needs  to  take the  lead.   We  are  rightly

concerned  that our help may be abused.   But  those  who

abuse  the system are quitters because they have  already

quit  trying to do the right thing but, thankfully, these

are  the  exceptions.   The  EDRS,  for  example,  is   a

meaningful gesture to show that we care.  Although  there

were abuses, to the majority who have benefited from  it,

it  was a huge success.  I am not suggesting that we open

up  a  floodgate on our welfare schemes.  However,  I  am

suggesting that perhaps we can afford to be more  helpful

and  not  deny  help to those who really need  it  simply

because we are fearful of abuse by those who may not need

it.   This may be a fundamental shift from the Government

policy today but this is what family is all about, mutual

help and support.

<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Motion on stayers and quitters

is  intended to spark debate in Parliament on  issues  of

Singaporeans' commitment to the country.  The process  of

nation  building  has no short cut.  It will  not  happen

overnight.   But  it is a crucial issue, particularly  at

this  point  in time when Singapore is at the  crossroad.

PM's  speech  was a timely reminder that we  cannot  take

this  for  granted.  As we rebuild our economy,  we  must

also  build a home, not a hotel.  This will take not only

the  efforts of the Government alone, but the efforts  of

all  Singaporeans,  of  all the members  in  the  family.

Together, we can build a home where Singaporeans  have  a

say in its shape and size, a home where

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1126</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans  have  a  part in  building,  a  home  where

Singaporeans have relationships with one another,  and  a

home  where  Singaporeans will stay to fight and  defend.

We must build a home that is uniquely Singaporeans' home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  decided  to  move this Motion together with  the  hon.

Member,   Gan  Kim  Yong,  because  I  sense   increasing

frustration among the younger generation with  the  state

of  our society, and a feeling of disconnection with  the

present system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the various surveys and my own dialogues

with  the  younger Singaporeans, it is clear to  me  that

there is a profound longing for a new kind of society.  A

society  that  will listen to their voices,  and  respect

them as partners in the development of policy.  A society

that is rooted in a strong sense of national identity and

community, and guided by a vision of a renewed society in

which all count and none is excluded.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sense is reinforced by the recent debate on

"stayers" and "quitters" which was sparked off  by  Prime

Minister Goh Chok Tong's National Day Rally speech.  Some

say  that it is a not a new debate.  Indeed, as far  back

as  1967,  Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, then  the  Prime

Minister,  had  used  such  terms  in  his  speech  at  a

convocation  dinner of the then University of  Singapore.

His main message to the younger Singaporeans at that time

was:  "The future is what we make of it."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that future is now here. We are advanced in

social  and economic terms.  We enjoy peace and  relative

prosperity.  But something is missing.  We are  not  sure

who  we  are  and  what being a Singapore citizen  means.

What are we staying and fighting for?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms used - "stayer" and "quitter" - may be the

same as those

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1127</b></font><br><br>

used  in the late 1960s, but the debate today is not  the

same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this post-Cold War world and a very rapidly

globalising  one,  politics has become dominated  by  the

more  complex questions of identity.  We can see this  in

the  rise in ethnic and religious clashes within  states,

and  the  revival  of  global  religions  in  the  world.

Advanced IT has given ethnic and religious movements  new

opportunities for spreading their message and the  tribal

conflicts that they sometimes spawn.  Groups which do not

benefit  from  global capitalism seek  to  retreat  to  a

simpler world, often offered by the ancient religions and

traditions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With increasing democracy, some ethnic and religious

groups   are  questioning  the  way  their  country   has

constituted  itself  and what it means  to  them  as  its

members.  We can see this debate being played out in  our

neighbouring  countries as Muslim groups  questioned  how

Islamic   their  country  should  be.   In  that   sense,

globalisation  and increased democracy in this  post-Cold

War  world  have  given  a  particularly  sharp  edge  to

identity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a world and in a region that have lost the old

order,  Singaporeans cannot escape the question  of  what

their  statehood is made of.  This question rings  louder

as,  in  a  globalised world, countries  seem  to  become

increasingly similar in the political and economic  sense

through  the adoption of democracy and a market  economy.

It is as if the world is shrinking into a giant McDonalds

restaurant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mass migration is another aspect of globalisation.

People  are  increasingly mobile and they  go  where  the

opportunities  are.   This  interplay  of  trends  forces

Singaporeans to ask themselves who they are,  where  they

belong and what makes their country special.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Singaporean puts it very simply: "The world is

getting  more  global,  so there  is  nothing  that  sets

Singapore  apart from other places."  I feel that  it  is

important  to  paint  this complex backdrop  during  this

debate  because  it is too easy to frame this  debate  as

only a problem with

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1128</b></font><br><br>

soft  3G  generation born with a golden  spoon  in  their

mouth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with such a view is that, other than

being  simplistic,  it  renders any soul-searching  about

national  identity as an unearned luxury.   The  fact  is

that the attitudes of the younger generation towards  the

country has changed because the world has changed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question before us is how to strengthen their

sense   of   belonging  to  Singapore   given   all   the

uncertainties and complexities of the present.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our Motion, we called for a thorough review of

policies  and programmes and for "meaningful changes"  to

be  made.   I  would like to highlight three  reviews  in

three distinct areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, at a time when our separate ethnic identities

are  advancing to the fore, we should review  our  multi-cultural  policies and programmes to ensure that  greater

stress  is  placed on our common civic identity  and  our

common cultural heritage.  Our civic identity refers to a

way  of  life where citizens define themselves and pursue

commonly-held goals.  It includes fundamental values such

as   equality  of  treatment,  equality  of  opportunity,

meritocracy   and   multi-racialism.    This   is    what

citizenship  in Singapore is about - who we are,  how  we

live together, what type of people we want to become.  It

defines  to  what  or whom we give our  loyalty,  how  we

relate to other citizens.  It is a normative concept, and

stems from a moral point of view.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arrests of the Jemaah Islamiyah members recently

highlight how conflicting loyalties and subscribing to  a

very  different moral view of the world can threaten  the

viability  and security of our nation.  Yet,  at  a  time

when  we  should be forging common goals as Singaporeans,

my  feeling is that we seem to be dealing with the  Malay

community more and more as a separate group, to be led by

their Malay/Muslim political leaders.  For instance, take

the  announcement that the Minister-in-charge  of  Muslim

Affairs, Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim and his

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1129</b></font><br><br>

team of Malay MPs want to build a community of excellence

for  the Malay/Muslim community.  This is a laudable goal

and  I  am  sure Singaporeans of all races and  religions

would  support this.  But I would think this  is  also  a

national  goal,  to  help each other achieve  excellence.

Yet,  all  the  discussions on achieving a  community  of

excellence  for the Malay/Muslims have not  included  the

other  races, as if they are a group apart.   Even  as  a

Member  of  Parliament, I have not been briefed  on  what

this   community  of  excellence  for  the   Malay/Muslim

community  means, what does it entail, and if  my  multi-racial grassroots organisations and I can play a role  in

helping my Malay residents to achieve that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing wrong with setting different goals

for the different communities, but I would ask for a more

inclusive and multi-racial approach to helping the groups

achieve these goals.  We must give each group a sense  of

sharing  a  full and equal membership in the nation-state

and not let anyone feel singled out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is an overwhelming constituency in this

country,  especially  the younger generation,  who  would

like to see the ideals of multi-racialism and aspirations

for  racial equality upheld.  But as ever with race, such

conclusions   must   be  tempered  by  complexities   and

contradictions.  Progress towards racial harmony is often

uneven.  Attitudes  towards foreign  talents  provide  an

example.  You can be a Chinese Singaporean and yet  still

very  unhappy if a Chinese athlete from China wins medals

for Singapore under a Singapore passport.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such kneejerk responses and our less than coherent

multi-cultural policies leave new Singapore citizens with

no  clear  vision  of the country they  have  joined.   I

suspect  that this is because we ourselves are not  clear

about  it.  In the absence of a compelling, all-embracing

vision, parochial and sectarian interests are filling the

void.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to our common cultural heritage. We

are Southeast Asian, and yet

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1130</b></font><br><br>

we  do  not  highlight  or inculcate  this  as  a  common

cultural  heritage.  We encourage Singaporeans  to  trace

their  roots  to their ancestral homelands,  saying  that

such  Asian  traditions anchor their sense  of  identity.

But we are not the same with the Chinese in China and  we

know it, and the same goes for the other races, like  the

Indians  in  India  - they are quite different  from  the

Indians  in Singapore.  We have more in common  with  our

Southeast Asian neighbours than China and India and  far-off  places  that  we  call  ancestral  homelands.   Just

observe  Singaporean  students  abroad.   Whatever  their

race,  their  instinct is to group  with  Malaysians  and

other Southeast Asians when they go out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say that our national language is Malay, yet we

put little effort in getting all Singaporeans to learn it

and  speak it, other than the Malays themselves as  their

second language.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may rationalise that it may be expedient to

signal to the world that we are different from the region

-  after  all, some countries in the region are  not  the

best  advertisements for secular progress.  But  national

identity  is not to be dictated by short-term  expediency

or to be manufactured just to attract foreign investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a question of who we are and our common

destiny.   And our destiny is in Southeast Asia,  whether

we  like it or not.  We might as well embrace it and make

the  best of it.  To deny that is to rob ourselves of the

richness  of  the Southeast Asian culture  and  heritage.

And  to  allow  either  the bland,  shallow  sameness  of

cosmopolitanism  to  take over, or the  narrow  sectarian

pressures of ethnic identity to take hold.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second suggestion is to review our policy to

ensure  that our social and political development is  not

out of step with our economic development.  For instance,

women  have made great strides in Singapore and  yet  the

Government  insists  in  upholding  and  preserving   the

patriarchal system, choosing tradition over civic  values

enshrined  in  the  Constitution  and  embedded  in   our

national pledge.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1131</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the commitment to a more just society

upholding   equality  of  opportunity,  some   Government

policies  seem  to  cast women in a  secondary  role,  as

submissive, passive women whose paramount mission  is  to

fulfil the roles of a wife and mother.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could be deprived of an opportunity to become a

doctor  just  because  they  are  women;  they  could  be

deprived of equal medical benefits just because they  are

women.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A national identity that is based on patriarchy

excludes women.  Gender equality issues that we raise  in

this  House repeatedly should not be treated as  separate

"women's  issues",  as they tend to  be  in  this  House.

These are structural questions which confront society  in

general.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another fundamental question is whether Singaporeans

feel  that  they  are being treated as citizens  in  this

country, or as consumers of goods and services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since independence, Singapore has implemented rapid

economic  reforms, which brought us great progress.   But

the pace of economic reform is often out of step with our

social  and  political development.   This  has  profound

consequences for the notion of citizenship.  The language

of  the  economy places strong emphasis on the individual

-   mainly as the consumer of goods and services  -   and

it  is often an individual divorced from the wider social

and  political  context.  You do not feel rooted  if  the

country  only  appeals  to your salary  packet  and  your

pocket.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans have expressed the hope for a less

stressful society, as Mr Gan has pointed out.  The stress

factors  often cited include the rising cost  of  living,

and  a  pressuring education system.  Rather than dismiss

such concerns or defend the status quo, I would urge  the

Government to conduct a transparent and open-minded study

on these issues and see how these concerns can be eased.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revive the Cost Review Committee, if need be. Of

late, the Government agencies

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1132</b></font><br><br>

have  been  justifying some price rises by saying,  well,

prices  have to go up because Singaporeans want a  higher

standard  of living and  Singaporeans just have to  learn

how  to pay for the higher quality of services that  they

want.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such arguments treat Singaporeans like consumers

with  endless  wants,  while they  have  been  trying  to

respond as citizens wanting to have a say in the pace  of

change at this difficult time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a disconnect. Their increasing frustration

with  the system arises from a sense of impotence, a lack

of  control  over  the  future.   A  consequence  is  the

increasing  clamour for political reform  which  we  have

been  hearing, such as that put forward by the  Political

Matters and Media Group of the Feedback Unit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such ideas are worth engaging and exploring with

respect,  not  because  these are  all  good  ideas,  but

because   they   reflect   the  emerging   debate   about

citizenship.   They reinforce the recurrent  theme,  that

Singaporeans  must  now learn to take responsibility  for

their  own  destiny - and mistakes  -  and  overcome  the

tendency to blame others.  The strong desire for a better

society and community is constantly linked with the  need

for greater participation and partnership in power.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to my third suggestion, which is to

review  our  National Education programme,  a  suggestion

also  made  by Mr Gan.  I feel that we must  take  urgent

steps to prepare individuals to participate as active and

responsible citizens in a democracy.  For this, we should

consider introducing citizenship education as part of our

National Education curriculum.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Britain, it produced the Crick Report on

Citizenship  Education  in 1998 and,  as  a  result,  the

subject has formed part of the core curriculum from  this

year.  The aim of the new subject in the UK is to produce

active  and  responsible citizens, aware of their  rights

and responsibilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, I think it is a rare student who knows

clearly  the  role  of Parliament and  the  role  of  the

President.  Our students

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1133</b></font><br><br>

need  to  learn  more  about  the  political  system   in

Singapore,  how  it works, how it has  evolved  over  the

years,  how that relates to the citizens and their rights

and  responsibilities as citizens.  They  need  to  learn

that  Parliament is indeed the highest policy-making body

in  the land.  Sometimes, when I look and see students up

there  (points  to  students in the  public  gallery),  I

wonder  what they go back and tell their parents, whether

they  say,  "Really,  Parliament is  where  policies  are

made."   But  I  fear that some people are  beginning  to

question that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to restore the role of Parliament in

policy  making.   It  will be to  our  detriment  if  the

perception  that the views of MPs do not matter  or  that

they  cannot  influence policies set in the public  mind.

The  man-in-the-street would ask: if the views of the MPs

do not count, what more the ordinary citizen!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that some of these issues that I have raised

are  being addressed by the Remaking Singapore Committee,

of  which  I  am  a  member.   This  Committee  has  been

described as the social and political counterpart of  the

Economic Review Committee.  Yet, I cannot help but notice

that  the  Government has moved faster  on  the  economic

recommendations  made  by the ERC  than  the  social  and

political  ones made by the Remaking Singapore  Committee

-   some  findings have been floated such  as  on  gender

equality.   I know the Report will be out at the  end  of

the  year,  but  some findings have been floated,  and  I

cannot  help  but contrast the approach.   We  have  sub-committees   in  the  ERC.   They  have  released   their

findings.   Some  of them are very tough  recommendations

like  the  CPF cut for older workers.  Yet, we have  very

quickly  seized them and implemented them  very  quickly.

But  for the Remaking Singapore Committee, we seem to  be

taking  our  time,  and even these recommendations  which

have been floated in public have not been responded to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, this debate is about our future

and our sense of place in a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1134</b></font><br><br>

fast-changing  world.  In his National Day Rally  speech,

PM  Goh mentioned a dialogue with younger Singaporeans in

May   -  the  one  where he noted that more  than  three-quarters  of  the  students  expressed  pessimism   about

Singapore's future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I happened to chair that dialogue, as part of the

Remaking Singapore Committee's effort to consult  younger

Singaporeans.   During that dialogue, it struck  me  that

those  who  were optimistic about Singapore's future  had

one   view  in  common.   They  had  confidence  in  this

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Government has never been afraid of

change.   The  younger generation hopes and expects  that

the  new  MPs  and others in this House would  lead  that

change,  to  help  develop  a new  culture  of  openness,

accountability  and participation, in  which  the  people

really are partners in the development of policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Abdullah Tarmugi (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I propose to take the break now.

I  suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair  again  at

<br>3.30 pm.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Chew Heng Ching) in the Chair]</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>STAYERS AND QUITTERS</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, Ms Irene Ng

just now has mentioned that SM Lee Kuan Yew, who was then

the Prime Minister, in 1967 had also spoken about stayers

and quitters.  At that time, the British were withdrawing

their  troops.   That  meant that  Singapore  was  losing

something  like 20% of its income.  In the face  of  that

very  difficult  condition, I  think  when  he  mentioned

"stayers" and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1135</b></font><br><br>

"quitters",  it was a challenge to Singaporeans  to  stay

behind and help build Singapore.  Prime Minister Goh Chok

Tong  also alluded to stayers and quitters in his  recent

National  Day  Rally  speech.   But,  this  time,  he  is

referring to the younger Singaporeans who apparently have

not known hardship.  SM Lee mentioned the words "stayers"

and  "quitters" something like 35 years ago.   They  were

different  times.  At that time, Singaporeans  were  very

poor  and  unemployment  was  rife.   It  was  definitely

difficult even to get a job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I believe the class of people that SM Lee

referred to 35 years ago, the people whom he wanted  them

to  stay behind to help build Singapore, were in the same

class  as  the  people that PM Goh has  mentioned  today.

They were the educated and professional class.  They were

needed  in Singapore to help build the country.  But,  of

course, not all left when the chips were down.  Many were

still  committed to Singapore.  But, however,  apparently

today,  young Singaporean professionals are  leaving  our

shores.    There  is  an  increase  in  the   number   of

Singaporeans migrating, a rise from 14% last  October  to

21%   this   July.    It  would  appear  that   basically

Singaporeans are still the same and have not changed.  In

bad  times, some also want to leave Singapore.  And  even

in good times, they also want to leave Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the issue is: Is there anything wrong with that?

I  personally  do  not think so.  I think  the  issue  is

whether  or  not Singaporeans are committed to Singapore.

Why   is  the  Government  so  alarmed  when  there   are

professionals   emigrating   from   Singapore?    I   can

understand  why  the  PAP is so alarmed.   Probably  they

think  that  they will have less talent  pool  to  select

their  election candidates.  I think one of the strongest

reasons  why young professionals are leaving  is  because

they  are not rooted here.  There must be something wrong

with  the  education  system  that  does  not  make  them

emotionally  attached to this country.   Of  course,  the

physical environment has completely changed.  Probably in

the  earlier  years  of  these  youngsters,  they  saw  a

different Singapore.  Their early physical surroundings

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1136</b></font><br><br>

have  all been destroyed.  We see that old buildings  are

so  readily torn down to be replaced by high-rise  flats,

condominiums   and   shopping   complexes.    Their   old

surroundings are completely gone and the whole  place  is

unrecognisable  to these youngsters.  Young  Singaporeans

have become strangers in their own homeland.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the influences that cause Singaporeans to

migrate are Government policies which force some of  them

to  go overseas and want to remain overseas.  One of such

policies  is  that  the  Government  does  not  recognise

university degrees obtained through distance learning.  I

have  been  told  that degrees obtained through  distance

learning  are as good as the ones obtained from  actually

going   overseas  to  study.   But,  unfortunately,   the

Government does not think so.  The Government's excuse is

that distance learning does not involve the intermingling

of  these  students with other students.  The  Government

feels  that the intermingling of students when  one  goes

overseas to study is important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, I must say that the more important issue

is  whether  or  not the degrees obtained  from  distance

learning are as high a standard as those obtained by  the

students  going  overseas to study.  The Government  must

make  sure  that those organising distance learning  give

degrees which are of high quality and recognise them,  so

that  our  students need not go overseas.  Once  they  go

overseas, of course, there is a greater tendency for them

to live overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of law degrees, the Government has

stopped recognising external law degrees, that is,  those

degrees   obtained  by  distance  learning   or   through

correspondence course.  Those degrees that  are  obtained

by  correspondence are not recognised by the  Government.

So,  this kind of a policy, of course, forces more of our

students to go overseas to study.  Once the students have

gone overseas to study and experienced overseas life,  it

would therefore be more likely that they will migrate  if

given  a  chance to do so, since they have already  lived

overseas before.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1137</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think it is fair to call those wanting

to  live  overseas  as  "quitters".   In  fact,  all  our

forefathers  were "quitters".  Have they  done  something

wrong  by  leaving  their homeland?  I certainly  do  not

think  so.  They left their home country to find a better

life  in  the  South seas.  In fact, if it were  not  for

those  so-called "quitters", Singapore may not have  been

what  it  is  today.   Nearly all  our  first  generation

political  leaders  were "quitters".   Their  forefathers

migrated to Malaysia and, in turn, they came to Singapore

from  Malaysia.   In  fact, many of our  judges  and  top

administrators  can also be termed as  "quitters."   They

were mostly from Malaysia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think that there is anything wrong for

Singaporeans to leave Singapore and live abroad, and they

should  not be labelled as "quitters".  I think we should

not  be  unduly worried if Singaporeans do go  abroad  to

live.   I believe that many of these Singaporeans who  go

abroad  to  stay  there  still maintain  their  Singapore

citizenship.   They  all still view  Singapore  as  their

home.   Perhaps  the  Minister  can  tell  us  how   many

Singaporeans living abroad have given up their  Singapore

citizenship.  I believe the number is not that many.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is a pity, on the one hand, the Singapore

Government  encourages Singaporeans to be entrepreneurial

and to go abroad to the region and even further afield to

live  and do business and, on the other hand, we tend  to

label  those who go abroad to stay as "quitters".  So,  I

think  the Government in some respect is giving confusing

signals  to the people.  The Government should not  label

Singaporeans who go abroad as "quitters" at  all.   There

is,  in fact, nothing wrong for Singaporeans to go abroad

either  to  stay or to do business, or for  the  sake  of

their children's education.  Going abroad is not an  easy

thing.   It needs a lot of courage.  It needs  a  lot  of

effort  to go abroad.  And I think the Government  should

be  glad  that  Singaporeans  are  going  abroad  or  are

courageous  enough to go abroad.  In the  long  term,  if

Singaporeans do go abroad,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1138</b></font><br><br>

it  should  be a good thing for Singapore, as  the  world

will  then  be  open to Singapore, but so  long  as  they

remain committed to Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Thank you, Sir,

for  giving  me  the opportunity to participate  in  this

debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand in support of the Motion and before I

actually begin on the points I wanted to raise, it  would

be  useful to deal with the definition of "quitters"  and

"stayers", because there appears to be some misconception

on this.  There has been a lot of heated debate on who is

a quitter, who is a stayer, and part of the misconception

appears  to be from a misunderstanding of what the  Prime

Minister  actually said.  That same misunderstanding  was

actually reflected in Mr Chiam's speech just now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The misunderstanding is this. Some people seem to

think  that  just  because you leave Singapore,  you  are

necessarily  a  quitter.  That  is  not  what  the  Prime

Minister said.  If you actually look at the text  of  his

speech, and for those who were sitting there listening to

him,  he  made it quite clear that those who are quitters

are those who have severed their emotional links and ties

with  Singapore, those who will not come back to the  aid

of  Singapore  or  contribute to Singapore  as  and  when

needed.  Just because somebody lives or works abroad does

not  mean that he or she is a quitter.  So long  as  they

are  emotionally  connected, so long  as  they  care  for

Singapore,  so  long as they want to contribute  in  some

way, that person is very much a stayer.

So,  then, we have to ask ourselves, having regard to the

third  generation  Singaporeans and the  fact  that  with

increased mobility in today's globalised world,  what  is

it that actually makes a person want to quit or leave, or

to  sever  his  or her emotional ties with Singapore.   I

think,  in  this regard, there are actually  two  factors

that we must make a distinction.  One is the pull factor,

and  the  other is the push factor.  I think pull factors

are  where  the  person  does not  really  have  anything

against Singapore but is just

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1139</b></font><br><br>

attracted  to  opportunities  or  things  abroad.    Take

lawyers, for example, who have graduated in Singapore but

want  the opportunity to work abroad with offshore  firms

simply  because  of  being able  to  obtain  a  different

experience,  in  terms of type of work, live  in  another

country,  get  to  meet  different people,  experience  a

different  lifestyle.  There is nothing wrong with  that.

There  is every reason to believe that, in years to come,

they  will  return to Singapore and hopefully bring  with

them  the  skills  and  the  experience  that  they  have

acquired abroad.  I therefore do not see the pull factors

as particularly disturbing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I think we should be careful about are the push

factors.   People are people.  What makes a  person  feel

alienated  or  not  want to stay in a place?   That  only

happens  when  a  person  feels that  he  or  she  cannot

progress, or somehow is not part or cannot progress up in

a  system.  If you really analyse it, the human want  and

human  need  are  quite basic.  People  want  safety  and

security.  And in Singapore, that is not an issue.  We do

have  a  safe and secure society.  So that is taken  care

of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing that people want is a certain

amount  of  personal happiness and that comes from  being

able to work, being able to have a certain means by which

you can live and being able to achieve their aspirations.

And  that  brings us really to the third point  which,  I

think,  is  the most critical component of a push  factor

and,  that is, whether or not that person has the ability

to achieve his or her aspiration in Singapore.  And if  a

person  cannot,  that is when a person  feels  pushed  to

leave.  And the key to all of that is education.  I think

education  and  our education policy is the  single  most

important factor in influencing a Singaporean's  decision

as to whether or not to stay or to quit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say, at the outset, that, by and large, we

have an extremely good education system.  If you look  at

it,  Singapore in the region has one of the  most  highly

educated  populations.  It has enabled us to  achieve  an

outstanding level of economic progress.  But I  do  think

that there is room for refinement and I do think that it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1140</b></font><br><br>

is  important to listen to some of the feedback  that  we

have got from especially the young parents.  Because,  in

every  feedback  session, there will  be  something  said

about  education,  and  usually you  will  find  that  it

touches on the complaints, and the comments are many  and

varied.   But  when you actually analyse them,  it  falls

into  two large groups.  One is stress, and the other  is

the  ability  to choose or, at least, to have  a  certain

freedom  from restriction in choice of subject.  And  for

many young Singaporeans, especially couples, when I speak

to  them and I ask them about issues like these, they are

happy to stay in Singapore for themselves.  But they  say

that  if they leave at all, it will be really because  of

their children's education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps what I can do is to illustrate it by three

or four examples.  One example is school ranking.  I know

that  the  Ministry  of  Education  has  defended  school

ranking quite vigorously, and the response has been that,

to  some  extent,  it is the parents who  put  a  lot  of

pressure on the children.  But, in Singapore, people  and

parents love their children.  They want their children to

progress.  So, obviously, they want their children to  be

able to make it in the system.  So they are going to look

at  the system.  We place a lot of emphasis on scholastic

achievement and they want their children to  be  able  to

achieve  the standard that the system requires  in  order

for  them  to  progress.   So the school  ranking  system

actually  puts  a  lot of pressure on  the  children  and

parents because what will happen is that the school feels

the  need  to  perform.   So the teachers  transfer  this

pressure  down  to  the  students and  parents,  and  the

parents of course pressure their children as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do not think ranking per se is a bad thing

because you need an element of competition.  But I  think

the  system could be fine-tuned.  Suggestions  have  been

made  that,  for example, instead of ranking each  school

individually, we should rank them in band, or  rank  them

according to types of subjects.  In other words,  broaden

the definition of success, alleviate some of the pressure

and  allow people a greater degree of choice.  One of the

things that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1141</b></font><br><br>

has  happened as a result of the push for ranking is that

Literature  has  suffered simply because Mathematics  and

Science  are  perceived as the subjects in  which  it  is

easier  to  score  in.   It is not  that  you  cannot  do

Literature.    But  it is just that if you  think  it  is

easier  to  score  in Mathematics and  Science,  that  is

something that you will take, and Literature suffers as a

result.   And that also has an impact on society  because

it has an impact on the way we speak, the creativity and,

basically, Literature is good for social interaction.  So

with the doing away or people not taking up Literature as

much, it has a social impact.  That is just one example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example that has been raised is why is it

that  Singaporean children cannot study in  international

schools.   Some parents do not understand  why  there  is

this  policy and feel that they would like their children

to  have  the choice to study in an international school,

if possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third example was something that was raised in

the  feedback  session  for the  Indian  community.   The

feedback was given that an Indian boy studying in  school

was  not allowed to take Japanese because he did not have

Mandarin as a first language.  The unhappiness there  was

that Japanese was available to be taught, but he was  not

allowed to do it because he did not have Mandarin.  I  am

not  sure,  because  it was not raised  at  the  feedback

session,  whether  this was the Ministry  of  Education's

policy,  or whether it was simply the school.   It  could

well  be  that they felt he would have better chances  of

scoring  in Japanese if he had a Mandarin base.  But  the

problem is that when you tell a person that he cannot  do

something where he has an interest and he wants to do it,

it denies him a chance of a personal aspiration.  Then it

makes him feel that he cannot progress and he cannot move

up  into  the  system.  It is little, little things  like

that  that  basically make parents want to move  to  give

their children a better chance in another system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, at the end of the day, I do not think we have a

bad education system.  I happen

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1142</b></font><br><br>

to  think  that we have a very good one.  But I do  think

that  it can be fine-tuned and that the Government should

take into account the feedback.  I do not propose to  set

out  the  whole  list of recommendations for  the  simple

reason  that the Remaking Singapore Committee is  in  the

process  of doing this.  All I ask is that the Government

do   very   seriously  consider  the  feedback  and   the

suggestions  on  education policy that  will  be  in  the

Committee's  Report  because a lot of  profile  has  been

generated  by  the Remaking Singapore  Committee.   As  a

result  of that, expectations have been raised.  I  think

that  if  there is a genuine response to the  suggestions

and  recommendations,  people,  especially  Singaporeans,

will feel that their wants and aspirations are taken into

account,  that there is a direct response  and  that  the

feeling  of  connection  between  Singaporeans  and   the

Government will be much closer as a result.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Motion.

<div align="center"><b>STAYERS AND QUITTERS</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak  on  the

Motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Motion that touches me personally. I may

be  regarded  as  a "quitter" from my country  of  birth,

which  is Malaysia.  I worked in Singapore for more  than

12 years before I became a citizen.  During that time,  I

had many occasions to reflect on whether I should quit my

country  of birth for good.  It was a difficult  decision

when  the  time  came.  The catalyst surprisingly  was  a

fellow academic from abroad.  On my way to see him off at

the Airport, he made a remark

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1143</b></font><br><br>

that  has  stayed  with me to this  day.   While  passing

buildings   and  parks  along  East  Coast  Parkway,   on

returning  from  a trip abroad, he asked me,  "Don't  you

just  feel wonderful and happy setting foot again in your

own  country?"  At that time, he did not know that I  was

still  not  Singaporean.  I remember being influenced  by

this  remark and to assess what it is that would make  me

take Singapore as a country where I would stay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the major reasons were more or less

the  same  as  they  are now.  One, clean  and  efficient

Government.    Two,   good  job  opportunities.    Three,

meritocracy.   Four, fair treatment  to  all,  no  matter

whether you come from abroad or is local.  Five,  a  good

place  to bring up a family.  And, six, a future that  is

promised   by  an  efficient  Government  and  farsighted

Government.   I think priorities may have changed  a  bit

since  that time, which was about 20-odd years ago.   But

having  said that, it pains me when there are  those  who

are  born here and have had all the benefits, such  as  a

first-class  economy  can give  them,  have  very  little

feelings for Singapore, are not proud of the nation, take

the  view that if anything happens, they would leave.   I

believe  that, as the Prime Minister has mentioned,  this

is a very small group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, like the speaker before me, Ms Indranee Rajah,

I like to think that the group of Singaporeans that wants

to   forge  new  lives  elsewhere,  in  another  country,

deserves some recognition, not as quitters, but very much

like   the   forefathers  before  them  -   self-reliant,

adventurous, brave Singaporeans.  They are not  quitters,

except in the very basic sense of going abroad to earn  a

living.    Why   would   they  do   that?    Many   young

Singaporeans, third generation Singaporeans, have told me

that  they feel the best years have gone past them,  that

it  was  the  generation before that benefited  from  the

growth  in Singapore.  Many find it difficult to  compete

for the limited resources and opportunities available  in

Singapore now.  To them, the mountain of success  is  too

high to climb.  It has become an Everest.  They feel that

they  should  venture out, climb lower  hills,  get  some

expertise, get

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1144</b></font><br><br>

something  that will stand them in good stead  when  they

come  back to Singapore to compete.  I think these people

are  strong  Singaporeans.  They are not relying  on  the

Government.  They are brave enough to strike out on their

own and they face up to the practicalities of life.  They

are not quitters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is paradoxical that while we are successful

in  wooing talent from abroad, we have this deep  concern

about  keeping  our home-grown talent.   Surely,  we  can

build,  in  the  Prime  Minister's words,  "a  culturally

vibrant  city,  capable of attracting the  highly  mobile

creative people from abroad."  Should that not also  keep

Singaporeans in Singapore?  Why is it that while we  have

managed  to  attract  so much foreign  talent,  including

talent  from  the  First World,  to  put  down  roots  in

Singapore, we are now worried that our home-grown  talent

may uproot and go elsewhere?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when I talk to young Singaporeans and ask them

what is it they want to have this sense of belonging, the

answers  are surprisingly simple and have been  mentioned

many  times  before  but perhaps bear  mentioning  again.

First  of all, instead of looking at the subject, like  I

did  when  I  first came, which is clean  Government  and

efficient and meritocracy, many of them said they want  a

political   system  that  allows  for  more   alternative

representation  and  views.   There  seems  to  be   some

inexplicable,  and this I cannot explain it,  disapproval

of  the dominance of one party politics, despite all  the

good  that  the governing party has done for the  country

and for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, they want a freer society, more tolerant of

alternative   lifestyles  and   attitudes.    Though   we

recognise  that  in a small country where  it  is  multi-racial and multi-religious, there must be constraints  to

preserve  public  order, they want less interference,  as

far  as their own actions are concerned, in what they do,

what they read and what they watch - in other words, less

regulation, less censorship, more privacy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, they mention the cost of living, particularly

for those with young families.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1145</b></font><br><br>

The  increasing  medical  and other  costs  have  weighed

heavily on them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tied to this is the fourth element, ie, a good job.

To  them, getting the right job is very important.   They

have this feeling that they have been ignored because  of

the  Government's  message  that  we  must  attract  more

foreign  talent to Singapore.  They see their promotional

chances  as  adversely affected by  this  importation  of

foreign  talent.  I am sure that many of  my  fellow  MPs

would   give  all  sorts  of  suggestions  on  what   the

Government should do in order to raise national  identity

and  so  on.  But, to me, I would like to just  make  one

proposal,  ie,  that the Government look at  the  way  in

which  they can lay off certain matters, leave it to  the

individual choices of people to do, particularly  in  the

social   field,   and  try  to  cater   for   alternative

lifestyles.   One group in particular has mentioned  that

the  reason why they want to leave is because they do not

seem  to  be given the same chances.  And these  are  the

singles.   They have found it very difficult  to  benefit

from the family-oriented policies in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a new world. We have to realise that

Singapore,  as a global city competing with other  global

cities  for  the  same talent, must cope  with  different

lifestyles, different peoples and different expectations.

It  is  a  tall  order.  But I hope that  we  can  be  as

successful as we were in the past, attracting people from

abroad  as well as providing for the people at home.   At

the  end of it, it may just be a question of dollars  and

cents,  getting the right job and making  sure  that  the

family is well provided for.  But more than that.  When I

first   came,   I   said   a   clean   Government,   good

opportunities, fair treatment are key.  Now, they seem to

think,  no, not enough.  We must have a political  system

that  reflects widespread views, alternative views.  This

is a sign of the changing times.  Are we mature enough to

accept that?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, thank you for giving

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1146</b></font><br><br>

me  the  opportunity to join in this debate.  I  rise  in

support of the motion standing before the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said about the labels "stayers" and

"quitters" over the last month or so since Prime Minister

Goh  Chok  Tong's National Day Rally.  This  is  not  the

first time that Singaporeans have reacted to such labels.

A  couple  of years ago, we hear Singaporeans reacted  to

the labels "cosmopolitans" and "heartlanders".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever labels are used, there are fundamental

issues that Singapore and Singaporeans must address.  One

key  issue  is survival, and related to it is  the  issue

that  Singaporeans are needed for Singapore  to  survive.

This  issue of survival has been at the core of Singapore

society  since  we  gained  independence.   However,  the

definition  and meanings given to the word differ  as  we

look at the stages of development and who is defining the

term.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to the first-generation Singaporeans, survival

was critical during the early Singapore years - the post-war  and pre-independence years.  The struggle to  create

an  independent  Singapore amidst  severe  political  and

economic   uncertainties  made  them  stick  behind   the

Government and accept its policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second generation continued this sense of

commitment  to  the  nation, understanding  the  need  to

continue to survive and to build wealth.  The pursuit  of

economic development was the sole objective, and everyone

embraced  such a philosophy.  Policies were accepted  and

economic  progress was the visible outcome.  Intermittent

economic  crisis  set  in,  but the  previous  experience

showed  that the Government knows best and the generation

followed what was prescribed by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third-generation Singaporeans, however, seem to

define   and   give   meaning  to  the  term   "survival"

differently.  It is naturally difficult for a  generation

born  in  times of economic boom and raised  in  relative

wealth and comfort to be told

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1147</b></font><br><br>

that  they need to think of their survival.  This is  the

IRC  (Internet Relay Chat), ICQ generation who spend most

of their time in cyberspace, networking and finding their

own space, identity and sense of individuality.  The self

is  emerging  as  the central focus for  this  generation

compared to the "other".  This seems to be a change  from

what   sociologists  and  psychologists  know  of   Asian

societies - where the "other" is more important than  the

"self".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as a lecturer in the university, I meet the

third-generation  Singaporeans every  day.   It  was  not

surprising  when I asked them for comments on the  motion

and  how  the third-generation Singaporeans see it.   The

response was "What is the point?  The Government  is  not

going  to  do  anything anyway."  They seem to  say  that

their  voices  will not be heard.  Of course,  with  much

persuasion, some spoke.  In the course of this speech,  I

would  like  to share with you the voices  of  the  third

generation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what is clear to them is that they are the

product   of   the  policies  that  the  Government   has

implemented.  They do not blame the system nor  are  they

avoiding   to  take  the  responsibility.    The   highly

competitive  educational system has been  highlighted  as

being  responsible  for their sense of  self-centredness.

Time  and  again, children are reminded by parents  about

the importance of education in securing well-paying jobs.

One of my students shared and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our life scope seems to be narrow and mainly

centres  around school and achievement.  The pressure  is

at   times  -  and  "at  times"  would  actually  be   an

understatement  -  unmanageable, and  often  the  fun  is

missing  from  the learning equation.  Learning  is  seen

more as a means to an end - study hard to get a good high-paying  job.   There is no real opportunity  to  exercise

creativity  and  broaden  our horizons  as  the  teaching

schedule is often very tight.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exposed to such a harsh, unrelenting, cut-throat

competitive environment for the most part of  our  lives,

some  of  us shudder when we think of the future  working

environment.   Surely, it cannot get  any  better!   What

with    the    Government's    emphasis    on    economic

competitiveness  and being the first in everything,  most

of  us cannot envision a more relaxed or even sympathetic

environment.  There seems to be no end to our  hard  work

and  we may never be able to run away from the pressures;

not  even after slogging 20 years of our lives to finally

relax and reap the benefits of our education."

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1148</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked about their future in Singapore, another

student shared that:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The future seems to be stressed to our generation

as one based on personal merit, capability and hard work,

where  work and economic competitiveness is primary,  and

being  burnt-out at some point is a necessary outcome  of

our  country's pace.  Perhaps, many people 'quit' because

they  are disillusioned by the pace of this society,  and

are unable or frustrated to keep up with it.  To them, to

'quit' from this society would help in 'staying' on track

with  life, as they are able to better manage their lives

and stress levels and self-actualise perhaps elsewhere."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am hearing from these young Singaporeans

is  that  they need a different environment.   These  are

students  who are currently in the university.  They  are

the cream of the crop.  They are those who have succeeded

academically.   Yet, they are the ones  who  are  voicing

their   displeasure  at  the  system   that   they   have

experienced.  I cannot imagine the voices of those who do

not make it to the university, those who have dropped off

half way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These youngsters do not seem to identify with the

earlier  emphasis  on  success defined  by  academic  and

economic achievements.  They seem to want to move  beyond

that.   While  they  do  recognise  that  these  are  the

principles that were critical for our nation's  survival,

they  want  a different societal ethic.  They  understand

that Singapore needs the human capital and drive in order

to  survive in the world's economy.  Yet, they argue that

in  this  new age, where life is a lot more complex,  and

youths  are  presented  with  a  lot  more  choices   and

information,  this  same  rule of  enterprise  cannot  be

presented  to  them like a doctrine, ie,  work  hard  and

study  hard because it is good for you and good  for  the

country's  economy.   Many of today's  youths  know  that

there   are  certain  things  that  cannot  be   measured

economically in dollars and cents, and that they are more

than  simply  the sum of their education.  But  they  are

often not heard, especially those youths who choose paths

alternative   to   the  mainstream,   due   to   personal

preferences  or limitation.  Very often,  they  are  only

expected to believe in what the authority says.  How  can

they feel any sense of belonging to the country when they

are so detached from the very issues that address them?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1149</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another student shared his thoughts on such

alternative paths like the arts:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is saddening is that all this talk about the

arts  and cultural vibrancy is not seen by the Government

as an end in itself, but rather as a means to the ends of

economic  growth.  Thus, the arts is not valued  for  its

contribution to the 'human condition' but rather is  used

to generate creativity for economic purposes."

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think what the third-generation Singaporeans

are  clearly  saying  is that their  survival  is  beyond

economics  and education.  It is more on their  sense  of

self  and  well-being.  They are calling out for  a  more

relaxed  environment.  They want  to  do  well  in  other

things - not necessarily excel in these activities - just

do  well and be happy.  Maybe, what they are saying is to

stop judging success narrowly, perhaps not even to define

success  and leave success to the individuals to  define.

This will also allow us to move away from the tendency to

classify  people into neat categories like  quitters  and

stayers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was away from Singapore in the mid-90s for

several years.  When I returned, I saw a new Singapore  - a  Singapore  that was going through a process  of  self-reflection.  It was indicative of the realisation on  the

part of the Government that third-generation Singaporeans

are  not  identifying with values and principles  of  the

earlier generation, that they may need a different set of

values, expanding the economic and academic definition of

success.   The  S21  initiative was  well  conceived  and

received   by   Singaporeans.   It  prides  itself   with

gathering feedback from more than 6,000 Singaporeans.  As

a  result,  five  tenets  were  conceptualised.   We  now

attempt  to  encourage  Singaporeans  to  embrace   these

tenets.   But  I am not sure how many Singaporeans  still

remember  them.   It  was  supposed  to  be  the   social

blueprint  for  the Singapore society.  It addressed  the

issues  raised  by  third-generation  Singaporeans  also.

Yet,  we  are  still  hearing  the  rumblings  from  this

generation that we want to reach out to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Government formed the Remaking

Singapore Committee, which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1150</b></font><br><br>

promised  to leave no stone unturned.  Every policy  will

be  scrutinised and analysed.  My only hope  is  for  the

committee  to  ensure that any change in policy  be  done

with  a  systemic orientation, noting how one policy  may

affect  the  other.   I  do  not  want  to  pre-empt  the

recommendations of the committee as I am sure this  House

will have the opportunity to debate them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while the Remaking Singapore Committee is an

encouraging   process   of   self-reflection    on    the

Government's part, I think we also need to reflect on the

relationship that the third-generation Singaporeans  have

with the Government.  The first and the second-generation

Singaporeans  established a relationship by  choice  when

they  decided to migrate here.  It is like a marriage  by

choice.  But, Sir, unlike the first and second-generation

Singaporeans, the third-generation Singaporeans are  born

into   the   relationship  with  the  country   and   the

Government.   For the third generation,  it  is  like  an

arranged marriage or a marriage of convenience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it takes two to tango. It takes two to make a

marriage work.  Couples quit marriages after they realise

that  they cannot tango together anymore.  They  are  not

able to synchronise their steps any longer.  They step on

each  other's toes ever so often.  They were not able  to

meet  each  other's expectations.  Common  problems  they

face include: they cannot communicate to each other, they

do  not listen to one another, they do not share a common

vision, they do not see eye-to-eye.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before our third-generation Singaporeans quit

on the country, perhaps we need to understand their needs

and  expectations  and facilitate their understanding  of

the  country's needs and expectations.  Let us make  this

marriage work.  Do we communicate with each other?   Some

say  yes,  some  say no.  This is common in relationships

that  are  turning sour.  Communication  theorists  argue

that  "we cannot not communicate".  The Government  needs

to    recognise    the   non-verbal   communication    of

Singaporeans.  There have been suggestions that the lack

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1151</b></font><br><br>

of enthusiasm in putting out the state flag outside their

flats   was   indication   of  Singaporeans'   sense   of

unhappiness  in the recent National Day.   While  we  can

continue  to read non-verbal messages, we need to  ensure

that  Singaporeans are made to feel that they  are  being

listened to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have different mechanisms for feedback but the

common grouse is that this feedback is seldom taken  into

consideration.  Many Singaporeans, however,  hold  on  to

the  view  that  feedback is listened to and  taken  into

consideration only when it is acted upon, ie, if there is

no  action  from Government, it means that they  are  not

listening.   The transport fare hike is a  good  example,

though I am sure that there are many other examples prior

to  this.  Whatever the explanation, Singaporeans need to

be  assured  that  the decisions made  have  taken  their

concerns into consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third generation Singaporeans are more

discerning.  They  need  to be  convinced  with  rational

arguments  supported by relevant facts  and  information.

In  this  regard, Sir, I think more can be  done  to  get

third  generation Singaporeans to understand the workings

of  this  Government sector, how policies are  formulated

and  implemented, how they respond to public queries  and

how they react to new trends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to recommend that the Government

include,  as part of the school curriculum, at  least  at

post-secondary level, since the bulk of our cohort  would

have   reached  that  level,  an  industrial   attachment

programme  with  Government agencies and  Ministries.   I

think  such  a programme is limited only to  scholars  at

this  time.   Such a programme would go  a  long  way  in

giving  young  Singaporeans a glimpse into the  world  of

civil  service  and  governance.  We  have  an  extensive

programme of industrial attachments in the private sector

to  expose students to the real working world.  It may be

timely  to  expose  Singaporeans  to  the  world  of  the

Government.   This  would  facilitate  understanding  and

appreciation  of  policy formulation and  implementation.

It  will  strengthen the foundation of  the  relationship

between Government and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1152</b></font><br><br>

third generation Singaporeans.  Perhaps it will make them

stay in the marriage longer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this House is the highest policy-making body in

the   country.   It  is  sad,  however,  that  not   many

Singaporeans  are aware of what happens  in  this  House.

The  media  reports what it deems as important  and  that

shapes  what  Singaporeans think of  the  House  and  its

processes.  Apart from a few pages in the print media, we

get  15  minutes of airtime over television  (maximum  30

minutes).   Of  course,  we  do  see  the  reason  -  its

commercial viability or a lack of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was also guilty of it. Prior to being a Member of

the  House, my perception is solely guided by what I read

in  the papers and watch on television.  I do now realise

that  there is much more that happens in this House.   To

appreciate the works of the Government, Singaporeans need

to  be  exposed to such important processes  as  much  as

possible.   I  am  glad  to notice many  school  students

coming to the House to hear what is happening.  It  is  a

good  start.  However, we need to explore other  ways  of

providing Singaporeans with the opportunity to appreciate

what  goes on in the House.  Perhaps a television channel

akin  to  CSPAN  in the US where the proceedings  of  the

House  of  Representatives and the Senate  are  televised

live  may be considered.  Yes, cost is an issue, economic

viability  is  the  essence, but if  we  hear  the  third

generation's voice, let us think out of the box  and  see

if  we  can  indeed make this work.  Let us look  at  the

benefit  that  we  can reap - more informed  Singaporeans

appreciating  the works of the Government.   Singaporeans

need  to feel they belong, they need to own the processes

that  take place in the country, and I do believe  it  is

critical for them to own the processes that take place in

this House too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge MITA to seriously study this possibility.

Yes, the argument is that:  will Singaporeans tune in  to

it  even  when  it is provided for?  We certainly  cannot

force them to do so, but we can facilitate and start with

the  schools  tuning  on to it.  We can  explore  delayed

telecast over

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1153</b></font><br><br>

designated channels. The point is, Singaporeans  need  to

own  the  processes  - they need to be  partners  of  the

Government  for them to belong and want to  stay  in  the

partnership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, as we are now going through

the  process of self-reflection, let us seriously reflect

on  our  relationship with the people.  We have to  start

taking  dance lessons seriously so that we can  tango  to

the heartbeat of the third generation and synchronise our

footsteps to their tempo.  Let us make the marriage  work

- till death do us part.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Chong Weng Chiew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Chong Weng Chiew (Tanjong Pagar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the main points in my speech

today  will be:  (1) to provide a stage for the non-elite

in our society; (2) to inject into the spiritual thinking

of  all  our  people  a sense of belonging;  and  (3)  to

cultivate a third generation of Singaporeans whose hearts

are attached to their motherland.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is this famous poem in Chinese that goes as

follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The river flows 3,000 miles away,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The family letter comprises 15 lines,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing expressed in each of the lines,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the message, Please come home early!"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I accompanied the Speaker of Parliament on

a  visit to Mexico.  During the visit, I enjoyed the feel

of  the  Mexican culture and the richness of its history.

Yet, at the same time, I missed my family, my parents, my

wife,  my  siblings,  my  children,  my  friends  and  my

colleagues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the important factors that make the people

feel for the place where they were born and grown are the

land and the people.  However, under the present trend of

globalisation, many countries are developing rapidly, and

working towards building up the most advanced and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1154</b></font><br><br>

attractive  urban outlook by imitating one another.  Very

often,  we  find  that many countries are looking  alike,

except  perhaps  the weather and the climate.  Sometimes,

you  go  to  a foreign country and it looks so much  like

home that you doubt whether you have left home!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in the past, it was difficult for

people  to  go out of the country.  Most of the  time,  a

person  would  venture abroad alone to earn  a  living  - leaving  his  family,  his loved  ones  behind.  Whenever

possible,  he would work very hard, save every  cent  and

send all his earnings home.  Now, it is different.  Given

a  chance, those who have the talents and the means would

not hesitate to take along all their loved ones and their

belongings to the greener pastures overseas, and  leaving

nothing  behind.  It is therefore more difficult nowadays

for  these  people  to retain their  feelings  for  their

motherland,  at  least  their feeling  would  not  be  as

profound as the people in the good old days.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we retain these elites in our country who are

blessed  with an abundance of opportunities all over  the

world and, at the same time, let the non-elite understand

that  although we are constantly striving for excellence,

with  the hope of becoming the global or regional  centre

of this and that, we need to attract elites from all over

the  world  to help us accomplish these goals,  we  still

need  the strength of all these non-elites among us?   We

must  give  the non-elites the assurance that it  is  our

policy  to attract and retain the best talents.  To  this

end, I have two main suggestions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let us talk about how to provide a stage for

the non-elites. Recently, there was an award known as the

"Phoenix  Award", aimed at  encouraging entrepreneurs  to

get  out  of  the shadow of failure.  I read through  the

records  of  the  nominees.  One  of  them,  a  corporate

manager,  encountered many failures, two  of  which  were

particularly  serious.  On one occasion, he  met  with  a

serious flood and, on the other he bred a species of fish

from Sichuan and suffered heavy losses.  He deserves  the

award. How many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1155</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans have the opportunity of encountering so many

rounds of failures, yet stand firm enough to be nominated

for this Phoenix Award?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many non-elites in Singapore. They

diligently and faithfully serve our community and country

in  various capacities, and contribute silently in  their

own  ways to the nation.  Should we not give them a stage

or a platform to show our appreciation to them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, there are various grassroots

publications.  However, more often  than  not,  what  are

featured  in  these publications are photographs  of  the

community's  activities  and the  community  leaders  and

active  participants.  Can we not designate a  column  to

feature Uncle Wang who has been selling breakfast for the

residents  in this area for many decades, or  Auntie  Liu

who  has been sweeping the floor in the community for the

past  10 years?  I am sure the children and grandchildren

of  Uncle  Wang  and Auntie Liu can pass them  down  from

generation  to  generation as a family heirloom.  At  the

same time, such special features in the publication could

serve  as an encouragement and inspiration to other  non-elites, and let everybody know that we need not only  the

elites, but we need non-elites too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May this year, a survey conducted on Singapore's

workforce  revealed that out of 10 workers,  8  were  not

committed to their work, and one was not  happy with  his

job.   Has such unhappiness arisen because they felt that

they  were "nobody" in their company, and their  presence

or  absence  would  make very little  difference  to  the

company?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I feel that the Government has given much

thought  to  the  future of our country.  However,  while

implementing the various policies and programmes, it  was

overly  technocratic,  and  too  little  humanities   and

flexibility.  This has often resulted in the  people  not

feeling appreciative of what the Government has done  for

them, and a lot of good intentions were not appreciated.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1156</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example. Recently, the Lianhe

Zaobao  published the complaint of one  Mdm  Cheong  Peck

Wan.   Her  husband worked for 25 years  in  a  statutory

board  and  was  diagnosed to be  suffering  from  senile

dementia  at a rather young age.  This had an aggravating

effect  on the family's finances.  Eventually,  she  went

and  made a claim under the Dependants' Protection Scheme

(DPS).  The application was processed very smoothly.  But

when she went to collect the money, she was told that she

had to engage a lawyer, at her own expenses, to obtain  a

court order.  Already cash-strapped, how could Mdm Cheong

afford  the  money  to  engage a lawyer!   This  is  like

requiring  a person to have 5 katis of rice in your  rice

bin  before you can be entitled to your provision of  100

katis.  This is not too reasonable.  As such, when we are

going  to implement a good policy, do we not have  to  be

more humane and more flexible?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the NTUC Club has plans to invest $25

million to build a "Big Splash", and we aim to double our

tourist  arrivals and tourism revenue by the  year  2012.

At the same time, we also plan to become a medical hub in

Asia.  All these plans can definitely help Singapore find

a  way  out  in the globalised economy and be successful.

However,  as we are building a place here for the  global

elites  to  live comfortably in, are we causing  our  own

people  who live here to feel that they are getting  less

and  less acquainted with their own country, and even not

knowing how to position themselves in their own country?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about building up the people's sense of

belonging.  Singapore recently lost a grandmaster in  the

theatre  world, Mr Kuo Pao Kun. An intellectual like  him

knows very well that living in a spiritually impoverished

country, his chances of further development abroad are no

smaller than those of a technocrat.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of Singapore lies in the fact that we

are  always  able to find a way to survive in  a  rapidly

changing  economic  market.  But when  we  encounter  the

problem of humanities and thinking, that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1157</b></font><br><br>

is,  the so-called   metaphysical planning, we often lack

the  patience  to wait, and appear to lack the  skill  to

tackle the problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I would suggest we weave the stories of

such  patriotic intellectuals into our school  curriculum

and  passing  them  on  from  generation  to  generation.

Currently,   there  are  few  essays  on  a   Singaporean

'ideology' or 'sense of belonging' in language textbooks.

This is the right thing for us to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is that the Government has recently

declared  36  big  trees  as  'heritage  trees'   to   be

preserved.   These   trees  have  not  only   contributed

substantively to our 'garden city' image,  but  are  also

constant  reminders of our past.   This is very good.  It

is an effort to translate the inner thinking into action.

In  a fast-changing world, while we seek to be innovative

and to change, we have not forgotten the preservation  of

the  `direct  scene', so that the people living  on  this

land  will  have  the opportunity to get  in  touch  with

historical sites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at what we have in our textbooks now. Is there

anything  to  tell us why Orchard Road is called  Orchard

Road?  How many storeys were there in the earliest 'tall'

buildings  in Singapore?  How many times has the  Merlion

been retrofitted? How many times has the musical fountain

in Sentosa been restructured?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have not only to be warm and friendly to the

tourists  but, more importantly, every citizen should  be

able to tell some little stories about every little alley

and  every old tree to the tourists.   Is that not a  way

of establishing a sense of belonging?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people have said that Singapore is a paradise

for  the elites.  Look at our Master Plan for the future.

It  may  appear that there is some truth in this  saying.

But  to  inculcate  a  sense of belonging  in  our  third

generation   Singaporeans,  and  to  have  their   hearts

attached to our country,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1158</b></font><br><br>

the  most  important thing to promote  education  in  the

sense  of  belonging to the whole nation,  we  must  also

provide a stage for the non-elites among us.  Because, if

anything  is to happen to our country, it is  always  the

people  whose assets and life are inseparable  from  this

piece  of  land  who  would be  the  first  to  bear  the

responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me end my speech with these few lines

of a poem:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Qin's bright moon hanging over the fortress of Han,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soldiers on the long match have yet to return,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the flying generals of Longcheng survive,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let not the Tartan horses pass our mountain

crossing."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sincerely hope that every Singaporean will be a

flying general of Longcheng who loves this piece of  land

and love our country.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  it is said that Prime Minister  Goh  Chok

Tong  will  be  retiring  soon.   If  PM  Goh  is  really

retiring, I think the deepest impression he has left with

the people is that he likes to label our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago, PM Goh classified Singaporeans as

"cosmopolitans" and "heartlanders".  Now,  again,  he  is

classifying  Singaporeans  as "quitters"  and  "stayers".

This  is  quite  consistent with the  PAP's   stereotyped

thinking,  ie,  to  label  the  people  right  from   the

beginning   and  then  classify  them,  thereby   causing

unnecessary  confusion, argument and  even  splitting  of

among the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are "quitters" and who are "stayers"? Are those

who  have quit  really "quitters"?  As for those who have

not   quit  or  are  unable  to  quit,  are  they  really

"stayers"?    Then,  of  course,  there  are   also   the

"psychological" immigrantsNot to forget  also  those  who

emigrated  "psychologically" .  That is another story.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such labelling is a very superficial comparison

between the two types of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1159</b></font><br><br>

people.   If  the  Government is doubtful  about  whether

people  would  stay to defend their country  when  it  is

facing trouble, then I think the most important thing  we

should  do  is  that we should to read and interpret  the

signs  behind all these movements of the people and  look

at  the  problem squarely.  If the Government feels  that

this  is  not a problem, then they should not be free  to

label the people and classify them the people at liberty.

I think PM Goh should remember be reminded that saying pa

si bo jao in piping times of peace is indeed unrealistic.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Minister Lee has said disclosed many years

ago  that  one of the purposes of letting the people  own

their  flats  is  that one day when we  are  attacked  by

others,  Singaporeans will feel that they have  something

here  in  Singapore to worth defending  for.   Yet,  some

decades  later, PM Goh is pointing out that  Singaporeans

are  using the profits they made from the sale  of  their

HDB  flats  to buy cheap and big houses in Australia,  to

prepare  for  emigration.  I think this is  indeedWhat  a

mockery  to  the  PAP Government.  ! Such contrast  aptly

shows  how  the people's values have been influenced  and

changed  byAfter being ruled by the PAP Government  under

materialisticand,so-called   "pragmatic"   and   humanely

indifferent approachPAP Government , the people's  values

are  changing within the past four decades of their rule.

It  is  said that as a man sows, so he shall reap.   Such

changes are not surprising at all.  This is indeed karma.

Now that the problem is affecting our future development,

a  worried PM Goh has launched a debate among the  people

to  look into this matter.  This is like mending the fold

after  a  sheep is lost, But but then it also  gives  the

people   a   chance  to  see  the   so-called  farsighted

Government is indeed very shortsighted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's motion seeks to ask the Government to review

its various policies so that it will as to strengthen the

people's sense of belonging.  I feel thatTo me,  there is

something  more fundamental than the sense of  belonging.

Mencius  has  once said that: "everyone has a  heart  for

others.   So, ifIf the Government has a feeling  for  the

people,  then its policies should be formulated with  the

interest of the people at heart. When people see a  child

falling into a well, the first thing they think of is  to

feel sorry for the child and his parents.  They do so not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1160</b></font><br><br>

just to show favour to his parents, or to make a name for

themselves.   It  is just a natural reflection  of  their

inner feelings."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extending from what Mencius has said, I think

everyone  should have this inner feeling for  his  ethnic

group,  his own language, his own culture, his  homeland,

his  country  and his fellow citizens, and this  is  what

Mencius  has said.  It is a All these feelings  are  very

natural feelingand free from materialistic consideration.

It  is not because of any other benefits involved.  Those

who  are courageous to devote or sacrifice themselves for

their  country, their belief or their idea are absolutely

not  driven by materialistic consideration. It is a  kind

of  spiritual conditionSo I think this is something  that

is  in  the  human nature and we have to enhance  such  a

feeling through education and daily accumulation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the late Mr Tan Lark Sye who founded

the  Nanyang University, the late Professor Pan Shou  who

helped  to  set up the Nanyang University and the  famous

playwright,  Mr  Kuo Pao Kun, who  recently  just  passed

away recently.  During their lifetime, they suffered  the

inhumanity  of  having their citizenship revoked.   Would

they not be disappointed with the country?  They had  the

talents,  they  had  the  wealth,  and  they  were   well

qualified  to  migrate  to other  countries.   Yet,  they

stayed.   Why?  I think it is because they have the  love

for  their people around them, for their own language and

culture, and for their homeland and nation.  And  without

doubt,  All  all  these forefathers  of  ours  were  well

educated  immersed  in the humanities education,  through

which  the  spiritual  condition  was  enhanced  as  what

Mencius had pointed out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we could educate our people. We should

cultivate  our people so that they know how to think  not

only  for  themselves, but also for others  around  them.

Otherwise,  we  even have to go to court  to  compel  the

children  to   maintain  their parents.  This  is  indeed

regrettable and shameful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at Singapore today. There are some people who

are quite willing and happy to discard their own language

and  culture, and they do not without feeling ashamed  at

all.   Quite  a  handful of people are  migrating  simply

because  their  children dislike  learning  their  mother

tongue  and  could not even manage to pass  the  relevant

examinations  to  qualify for the university.  There  are

also those who openly declared

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1161</b></font><br><br>

that  they  will  pack  and  go  once  the  nation  faces

difficulties. Well, We we can criticise these people, but

then  we  should also think deeper into why these  people

are behaving the way they dowhere we have gone wrong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every person has his own individual character. The

people  have their collective character.  The nation  has

its  national  character.   I think  the  cultivation  of

character is important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is character? Character is fundamental to the

people's loyalty, faith, sincerity and righteousness.  At

times  of national disaster, will the people simply  quit

or  stand  up  for  the nation, it  all  depends  on  the

character.  Taking  refuge  is  second  nature   to   the

animals, but it is not necessarily human nature.  When we

have dedication to our nation, to our society and a sense

of  righteousness, it is something that is inborn in  the

human heart.  Yet, we have to constantly augment it  with

education.   The Government should educate and  lead  the

people,  so  that  they know how to cultivate  their  own

character. For this, the Government itself should possess

some  kind of character, otherwise it cannot be  expected

that  the  people will have its character and the  nation

the national character.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But look at the PAP Government. What is the

governing  principle for of the PAP Government's  ruling,

and what have they used as an examplewhat kind of example

have   they  set  for  the  people?   Regrettably,    the

pragmatic line of the The  PAP Government which it claims

has  been saying that it has helped to created create  an

economic  miracle for Singapore and it has run  Singapore

in  a very pragmatic political line.  In fact, it is  too

materialistic  and  it  is interested  only  in  material

gains.   It  has neglected humanities and has  tremendous

repercussion on the spiritual condition of Singapore.  So

when  PM  Goh mentioned the "quitters" mentality,  it  is

exactly  a  reflection  of  what  went  wrong  with  this

materialistic approach by the PAP Government. Should  the

PAP Government do a self-reflection itself or just accuse

the people sternly?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let us look at the PAP's example of political

coercion and material inducement.  The PAP Government has

been

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1162</b></font><br><br>

using  all  sorts  of  material  benefits,  such  as  HDB

upgrading programme, distribution of `ang pow',  etc,  to

induce the people to vote for them.  The people are being

conditioned   in  such  a  way  that  they  become   very

materialistic.  They will react only if there are goodies

in  the  bag  for them. If there is no benefit  attached,

they  would  not  even lift a finger.   So,  why  are  we

blaming them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think tThe feeling for the nation is evolved and

extended from the feeling for others, for the family  and

for  the  community,  through daily  accumulation.  is  a

virtue  which  can  be  augmented through  education  and

experience in life.  However, for their own benefit,  the

PAP  Government has done a lot of things  for  their  own

benefit.    Take  the  has  re-delineated  ion   of   the

constituency  boundaries freely.   Braddell  Heights  can

suddenly  become  part of Marine Parade  and,  overnight,

Cheng  San  Constituency can become a  name  in  history.

These  illogical  things  are done  just  to  suit  their

interest.In  this way, how can you expect the  people  to

build  the  community  spirit  ,  which  is  a  necessary

intermediate  step  in  extending one's  feeling  to  the

nation.  What kind of leading by example are  we  talking

about?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another aspect, the PAP Government has been using

the   fear   tactics  on  the  people.   At   its   first

anniversary,  the Speakers' Corner was so deserted.   Are

the people so happy with life in Singapore that they have

no  complaints and have nothing to say?   No.   They  are

just  afraid that by speaking there, the Government  will

take  action  against them later, and they just  want  to

play  safe  by  keeping quiet, and  not  doing  something

anything  that will jeopardise  their stay in  Singapore.

Even  this  can be a false perception, the PAP Government

is happy to let thing be as it helps to keep their power.

But  how do we expect our people to fight fearlessly  for

the  country  if  they  are living under  such  fear  and

developed into a timid mentality against strong power?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SoFurthermore, because of all thisPAP's dominance,

no  one is willing to come forward to participate in  the

governing of Singapore.  They just want to remain in  the

comfort zone, stay cosy and be happy in their own private

lives  as  long  as the Government continues  to  provide

means  for  such  an  end.  So, this  GovernmentThis  has

evolved into what we may call a "moderate autocracy", and

shed

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1163</b></font><br><br>

away  the  past  image of a tyranny.  The Government  now

takes  a  moderate  and  fatherly  approach.    It  make-believes  that it is democratic, and it conducts  regular

general  elections.   But, the fact is,  it  is  actually

ruling Singapore with a great supervisory power over  the

people.    Simultaneously,  the  self-interest  mentality

leads  to  weaker  public sphere.   And  Eventually,  the

people  feel so helpless against such bureaucrats, become

alienated, and this has caused run into a vicious  cycle,

and many are  quitting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a nutshell, the PAP Government has always been

considering their own benefits first.  The result is that

the  people will also fend for themselves.  They want  to

look  after  their own interest.  Mencius said,  "If  the

Emperor says what is good for me to retain my power,  and

the  officials  say  what can I do to benefit  my  feudal

state,  and  the  people say what can  I  do  to  benefit

myself,  then  everyone looks after their  own  interest,

they  become egoistic.  The nation cannot prosperwill  be

at risk." This is exactly what the PAP is doing!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, look at how the PAP Government has been

treating  the people.  When the economy is  bad  and  the

people  are  having  a hard time making  ends  meet,  the

Government says that we must sacrifice, take a  CPF  cut,

suffer  a  wage  freeze, in order that  the  economy  can

recover.   On  the  other  hand, the  Government  is  not

grateful  to  all these sacrifices made  by  the  people.

During  these  bad times, they increase public  transport

fares,  increase healthcare charges, etc.  The Government

says, "Well, the increase is only marginal.  Everyone can

afford  it.  Do not be emotional about it."  By the  same

logic,  if  we are being attacked by our enemy,  can  our

NSmen  ask  the Government to pump in more funds  to  buy

more  sophisticated weaponspay them a small sum in return

for  fighting for the nation, just because the Government

can  well afford it?  Will the Government do it, as  this

is  logically  sound  based on the  above  PAP  argument?

Won't  the  people be alienated by such a "rational"  but

indeed calculative mentality? Sure, they will.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst thing is that In in our present situation

where  there  is a one-party rule dominance by  the  PAP,

when the people are having so muchhave

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1164</b></font><br><br>

bad feelings against the Government, so much so that they

transfer this bad feeling to Singapore as a nation. there

There were comments that the significantly reduced number

of  flags displayed by the residents throughout Singapore

during the recent National Day month was a reflection  of

their dissatisfaction with the PAP Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this "quitting" mentality is not something

that  is  generated  overnight.  It  is  a  result  of  a

accumulation of discontentcontinuous erosion  of  natural

feeling  towards others, ignorance of humanity  education

and alienation caused by various policies over the years.

The  biggest  danger  is  that  Because  because  of  the

inconsiderate  measures adopted by the  Government,  many

people   are  "quitters"  subconsciously  and  once   the

opportunity for emigration emerges, they will pack and go

without  second thought. leaving because they  could  not

take it any more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's motion seeks to urge the Government to

review  its  policy  and to enhance the  third-generation

Singaporeans'  sense  of belonging  for  Singapore.   But

these third-generation Singaporeans are brought upmoulded

by  under  anthe  same  education  system  which  is  led

mastered  by the PAP Government.  Many of them felt  that

they  are  global  citizens, they do  not  owe  Singapore

anything.   They  have no moral obligation  to  stay  and

serve  Singapore.   So, if the grass is  greener  in  the

other courtyard, why should I stay here, and sacrifice my

opportunity  to  enjoy  the greener  pastures  elsewhere.

That  is why there are more people leaving Singapore.  If

the  Government  is  to modify those  policies  that  are

beneficial to the nation such as the mother tongue policy

to  suit these quitters in order to  retain them,  it  is

going  to  open the Pandora's box and more quitters  will

emerge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our best students, the scholarship holders

break  their  bonds, the PAP Government accused  them  of

being   irresponsible.   Apart  from  the  penalty,   the

Government publicised  their names to shame them.  By the

same  logic, will the Government also consider publishing

the names of the quitters and shame them?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think advise the PAP Government should not to be

harsh in reprimanding the people but

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1165</b></font><br><br>

lenient to itself.  When we want to remake Singapore, the

Government  should also have the courage to  admit  their

mistakes  and to give up all this materialistic  approach

in   governing,  establish  its  character,  reform   the

education  system,  strengthen  the  humanity  education,

enhance  the  people's  natural  feeling  towards   their

homeland, and share the feeling of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how prosperous and wealthy a country is,

if  the  people  have  no sense of  belonging  for  their

country, lack the will and determination to defend  their

country  and  lack  the spirit the  Government  fails  to

foster  the  national  spirit during of  nation-building,

then this country is fundamentally weak and fragile.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Soo Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Soo Sen</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I do not know whether hon. Members have heard of  a

country  called  Eritrea.   Eritrea  is  located  on  the

eastern  part  of  Africa.  It used to be a  province  of

Ethiopia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1970s, when I was studying in Oxford, I met a

fellow-student  who told me that he was from  Eritrea.  I

was a little struck since Eritrea was at that time not an

independent country. It was fighting a fierce war to gain

independence from Ethiopia.  Why did he say he  was  from

Eritrea  rather  than Ethiopia?  Subsequently,  I  learnt

that  he  was a medical student.  One day, I  asked  him,

"What  are your plans after your graduation?"   He  said,

"After I have qualified as a medical doctor, I would like

to  go  back  to my country.  Every day, every  night,  I

think  of my motherland.  My people need me.  My soldiers

in  the  frontline need me. I feel guilty living  such  a

comfortable  life  in England when my motherland  and  my

people are at war."  His heart was with his native  land.

So  he  went  back  to  Eritrea.  What  happened  to  him

subsequently, I do not know.  But he is a real  "stayer".

He  is  an  elite  in  his country.   After  his  medical

studies, he could have stayed back in England and live  a

comfortable life.  Yet, he chose to return to his  native

land to serve his people at war.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1166</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we ask our Singaporeans, I believe more than 95%

will  say  that they are staying. I asked our  grassroots

leaders  and  all of them said,  "We are  staying.  Where

else  can  we go?  Singapore is our country."  I  do  not

know  why Mr Low Thia Khiang is so pessimistic about  our

people.  He  has certainly misunderstood Prime Minister's

intention  when  the terms "stayers" and "quitters"  were

introduced. The Prime Minister is not putting  labels  on

people. He is provoking Singaporeans to think hard  about

the issue of rootedness as Singapore continued to develop

and  globalise.  Treat rootedness  as  a  test.  We  have

attained  95  marks, and we all know the  PAP  Government

will  not be satisfied until it attains 100 marks -  full

marks.  We are not satisfied with 95 marks, but know  the

need  for the extra effort and commitment to get the last

5  marks.  There is a Chinese proverb: "It is  better  to

provoke  a general than to give him an order." Hence  the

provocation  and the debate of this Motion to  facilitate

full deliberation on the issue of stayers and quitters in

the House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I mentioned Eritrea. Eritrea is an

agricultural   country,  and   by   nature,   people   in

agricultural countries have a deep-rooted love for  their

land  because they worked on their land which  fed  them.

In  ancient  China, however senior or rich you  are,  the

common  aspiration was to go back to your  hometown  upon

retirement and be buried in your native village. This  is

called  "The falling leaf returning to the root". However

in  a globalised world, will there be this same sentiment

as in the agricultural countries?  That is the question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly we are not contented with 95 marks. We

must  achieve 100 marks.  We have to work hard  to  score

100  marks.  We want to make everyone in Singapore to  be

like  the people in the agricultural countries, having  a

deep-rooted love for his motherland.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly we have to achieve 100 marks for our

nation.  Because of the need for economic development, we

have to be globalised.  Singapore cannot achieve economic

growth as an agricultural

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1167</b></font><br><br>

country  to  solve our problems.  Globalised Singaporeans

are elites of the country. There will be more amongst the

3G  Singaporeans who globalise, because of  their  higher

education   and  their  cosmopolitan  outlook.  Singapore

cannot  afford  to  lose them. Hence this  debate  is  to

stimulate our people to reflect on this issue of  stayers

and quitters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang said that we do not have

character as a people, a nation, and a political  system.

I disagree. When we Singaporeans are abroad, we feel very

close  to  each  other  when we meet  fellow  countrymen.

Unlike others, we Singaporeans queue up at counters  even

when  they  are  overseas.  We are  proud  to  have  done

national   service.   National  service  is   a   crucial

programme  that  moulds our nation. So  we  are  rich  in

character that identifies us as Singaporeans. How can  Mr

Low  say  we  are  lacking in character as  a  people,  a

nation, and a political system?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about the third-generation Singaporeans, how

are  we going to improve from 95 marks to 100 marks?   Of

course,  we  have to create conditions conducive  to  the

development of our economy, so that they feel  there  are

opportunities to optimise the use of their talents and do

well here.  We have to do better in three areas which  we

are already doing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, we must help all discover the spirit of

giving  to society. Giving produces a sense of pride  and

pleasure. Such good feelings can be addictive:  The  more

we  give,  the  better the feeling. This can  lead  to  a

greater desire to give, which in turn generate more  good

feeling.  There is a maxim, "To give is more blessed than

to  take."  This will lead to a benign circle.   In  this

way,  we  will achieve 100 marks in fostering a sense  of

belonging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministry of Community Development and Sports (MCDS)

will  facilitate more volunteerism. We need  to  increase

further  volunteer participation rate and the  number  of

people  who do volunteer work.  The Community Development

Councils  (CDCs) have introduced many programmes  on  the

ground, and have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1168</b></font><br><br>

provided more channels and varieties to volunteerism.  We

should also have more opportunities for the volunteers to

use  both  their  brains and their hands, since  actually

dirtying   one's  hand  to  get  things  done   increases

commitment  and a feeling of giving. MCDS  and  CDCs  are

continuing to improve on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to have a sense of belonging, we need to

strengthen  the  family ties of the 3G Singaporeans.  The

Government has been urging the young people in  Singapore

to set up happy families.  They should not only spend all

their  time and energy on their work alone.  They  should

consider  setting  up families as an  important  goal  in

life.  Because family is the place where their hearts are

anchored.  So the feeling for their family, the love  for

their  family  will be broadened into the  love  for  the

nation,  and  hence  become another reason  to  stay.   A

friend of mine told her friend's family story. This is  a

rather  typical family with a father, a mother, a brother

and  a  sister.   The sister went overseas  for  studies,

married  to a foreigner and settled down in that country.

She  told her brother, "There are plenty of opportunities

here.   Why don't you come here?"  After some persuasion,

the brother left Singapore and went to join his sister in

that  country.  He persuaded his girlfriend to go  along.

They  got  married, and settled down there.  Then,  after

some  time,  they invited the father and mother  to  join

them.   The parents were initially not willing to go  but

since two of their children were there, they went. Sounds

like a sad story for the stayers? Not really. A few years

later, the mother passed away. The father felt lonely and

bored in a foreign land because his friends and relatives

were  in Singapore. So father came back to Singapore.  As

the  brother missed his father, and his wife  missed  her

parents  and  friends too, they decided to move  back  to

Singapore  too.  Their feelings for  Singapore  are  even

stronger than before.   So it does not matter where  your

physical  presence  is, so long as  your  heart  is  with

Singapore, one day you will return. Family and friendship

are major pull factors for the stayers.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1169</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence MCDS has set up a 'Family Matters Singapore'

Committee to continue to work towards encouraging  people

to  set up families and strengthen their families.   This

is  an  arduous  task,  but it is a  task  that  must  be

undertaken.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, we have to consider or give emphasis to

patriotism in our Moral Education Programme.   Of course,

we  hope  our  nation will never be plunged into  serious

national  crisis,  but there are a  lot  of  stories  and

legends  in  history that show that one's true commitment

will  be reflected only in dire adversity.  This can help

inculcate patriotism in our people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that when I was in secondary school,

there was this chapter called "The Young Patriot" in  our

Chinese  textbook.  It was about a poor Italian  boy  who

was  a beggar on board a ship. One day, he came across  a

group  of tourists from England, France and some European

countries who gave him some money. These people  gossiped

about  the places they visited. They started to criticise

all  the bad things about Italy: that it was dirty,  full

of pickpockets, etc. Suddenly a few coins rained on them.

They  turned and saw the Italian boy staring hard at them

and shouted, "You insulted my country. I do not want your

stinking money!"  This story has touched me, even  today.

There  are  many  other stories that I read  when  I  was

studying,  like "The Drummer Boy" and "The  Last  Lesson"

aimed at inculcating patriotism and national pride in our

young hearts. I hope our students today continue to  read

these stories which would do them a lot of good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem we are addressing is not third

generation  Singaporeans  being  labelled  "quitters"  or

"stayers".   It is how to improve from 95  marks  to  100

marks.  Our challenge is how to retain the stay  instinct

of   an   agricultural  society  like  Eritrea,  yet   be

aggressive and successful in globalisation.   If  we  can

always  remember falling leaves returning to  the  roots,

and  always  have  our  hearts  in  Singapore  while   we

globalise, I believe

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1170</b></font><br><br>

Singapore  will thrive and flourish for many  generations

to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support this Motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Amy Khor Lean Suan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, it

would seem that Singaporeans from all walks of life  have

been  up  in  arms at various points over the  last  nine

months  about  many issues.  These range from  bread  and

butter ones, such as the transport fare hikes to the  pay

of  a  CEO  and,  most  recently, to increase  in  public

hospital charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Straits Times' journalist Ong Soh Chin puts it

"while  stayers and quitters were making their  arguments

heard, the real revolution was not the issue at hand, but

the  fact that such debate was being aired publicly" and,

I  would  add, so robustly.  Hence, contrary to what  the

hon.  Member, Mr Low Thia Khiang, has noted earlier,  the

people  are  able and do air their views.   Indeed,  does

this   not  in  itself  indicate  that  there  are   many

emotionally  connected, committed  and  actively  engaged

Singaporeans amongst us?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much displeasure has been expressed, particularly by

the  educated  young and professionals  -  the  so-called

cosmopolitans   -  regarding  the  PM's   "stayers"   and

"quitters" label even though the PM took pains to explain

that,  by quitters, he meant those who throw in the towel

and  take  flight just as the going gets  tough  and  not

simply all those who leave the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would venture to say that the "stayers" and

"quitters"  issue is an age-old problem  and  exists  not

just  in  Singapore  but everywhere.   For  instance,  in

Britain, a recent study showed that half of those  polled

wanted  to  move  to another country.   In  Singapore,  a

survey  in  September 2002 by the Singapore Institute  of

International  Affairs  of 150  junior  college  students

found  that  67%  plan to stay abroad or  work  overseas,

whilst 69% said they saw a future here.  The main reasons

for  coming back are family ties, friendship and a  sense

of belonging.  One could say that not all is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1171</b></font><br><br>

lost  for our 3G Singaporeans.  Nonetheless, efforts must

be  made  by  the Government to find out why increasingly

more  Singaporeans  appear  to  be  disenfranchised  with

Singapore,  and  do not feel a sense of  belonging.   For

those who can and do quit, or wish to quit, what are  the

roots of their rootlessness?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I submit that there are two causes for this

sense  of rootlessness - one to be embraced and the other

to be engaged.  Firstly, globalisation.  Globalisation is

an  inexorable  force  that can at one  time  enrich  and

impoverish nations.  One byproduct is the creation  of  a

class  of mobile world citizens, who are equally at  home

in  Oslo  as they might in Osaka.  They are the able  and

the  talented  ones who are sought after by  nations  and

peoples  for  the value creating power they  wield  -  in

industry,  in  entertainment, in technology  and  in  the

arts.   Think of child prodigy musicians, like  Siow  Lee

Chin, entertainer Kit Chan, or top business brains,  like

McKinsey's  Asia  Chief Hsieh Tsun  Yan.   Interestingly,

many  of these are now returning home, if not physically,

then at least in connectedness, and making a contribution

from New York, London, Taiwan or elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the world, including Singapore, embraces

globalisation  and  geographical and economic  boundaries

blur,   more  global  citizens  would  emerge   and   the

distinction between stayers and quitters would  get  even

fuzzier.  Besides, as many have already alluded  to,  one

could  feel  and  behave  like a  stayer  or  quitter  at

different points in time, depending on the circumstances.

Take  myself, for instance.  I had studied and worked  in

the  US  for two years.  At the end of two years,  I  had

thought  seriously of continuing my stay in  the  US,  at

least  for  some  time,  in  view  of  the  opportunities

available  as  well  as the different lifestyle  offered.

One  might say that I was then contemplating to  quit  on

Singapore.  In the end, family ties, my husband's  desire

to  return  and the fact that, in the US, one  could,  as

Jack  Neo  puts it, only be the second wife,  brought  me

back to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many globally mobile Singaporeans (GMS), as DPM Lee

calls them, will still

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1172</b></font><br><br>

feel a sense of belonging to their country of origin, but

their  inner  unction is to a larger  calling.   This  is

inevitable.    We  need  to  come  to  terms   with   the

aspirations  of  such  people in a global  village.   For

them,  we  should give our blessing, because so  long  as

they  carry a bit of Singapore in their heart, they  will

remain  our ambassadors and bring Singapore to the world,

even  as  we consciously bring the world to Singapore  in

our quest for global talent to our shores.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted by SM Lee, in this age of mass travel and

migration,   Singapore,  like  other   countries,   would

inevitably lose some of its own talent.  However, we must

retain  a  hard core of dedicated Singaporeans sufficient

to  form  the  cornerstone of our society.  Then  we  can

afford  some attrition.  Ultimately, enough must stay  at

any  point  in  time to look after the place,  to  create

prosperity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think therein lies the heart of PM Goh's

remarks addressed particularly to a younger generation of

globally  mobile Singaporeans, challenging them  to  make

Singaporeans tick as their forefathers before  them  have

done, rather than as an issue of labelling which the hon.

Member,  Mr Low Thia Khiang, seems to have simplistically

assumed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second cause of rootlessness is of greater

importance   and   concern.    Dissonance   between   the

Government  and its citizens, arising from disenchantment

on  a  host of issues that touches them.  Sir, I  believe

that  few  people actually quit Singapore for ideological

reasons,    bar   political   dissidents,   conscientious

objectors,  and  those who are up to mischief,  but  they

form  a small minority.  From what I observe, people quit

because  of  frustration and/or a sense  of  betrayal  on

specific  issues  that touch them and  often  touch  them

deeply, such as education, or a Singaporean society being

too regulated and rigid.  There is therefore a great need

to  reduce  this  dissonance and  create  goodwill  among

citizens  in  general,  not  just  quitters  or  would-be

quitters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in all fairness, the Government has, by the

very act of initiating the Remaking

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1173</b></font><br><br>

Singapore Committee, acknowledged that there is a need to

review  all  policies and programmes and leave  no  stone

unturned in view of the generational change taking place.

It  has started in the right direction and what is needed

now  is  for the Government to take heed of all that  has

been  said  and written with an open mind and  a  certain

resolve and boldness to implement the necessary changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations of the ERC and the Remaking

Singapore  Committee  must be taken seriously  and  acted

upon,  where  feasible, to ensure  that  the  young  stay

emotionally  connected  with  the  Government  and   with

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would now like to highlight two major areas

where  change has been called for or proposed and appears

to  be  imperative  if quitters are to be  converted  and

stayers  are to be further cultivated.  Neither are  new,

and  I  suspect  there could be robust defence  from  the

Ministers  concerned, but as there have been  much  angst

and  ill-feelings  about them, I  feel,  Sir,  that  they

deserve yet another airing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, injecting more flexibility into the

education  system.  By most standards, we have undeniably

one   of   the  best  education  systems  in  the  world.

Ironically, education also appears to be one of the  main

stress points that trigger quitting.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anecdotal evidence suggests that many Singaporeans

have  migrated to other countries due to their children's

education.   A  successful pediatrician  friend  of  mine

migrated to Australia a few years ago mainly because  his

four  children  were  all unable  to  cope  with  Chinese

lessons.  Another friend, who was a teacher, migrated  to

New Zealand, as she wanted her eldest son, who was mildly

autistic,  to  be enrolled in a mainstream school  rather

than a school for children with special needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another friend, who was already a senior civil

servant in Singapore, decided to settle for good  in  New

Zealand after the expiry of her one-year no-pay leave to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1174</b></font><br><br>

accompany  her  husband who was there on a  one-year  job

attachment.   She said that her two primary school  going

children had enjoyed studying in New Zealand so much they

did  not  want  to come back to school in Singapore.   In

fact,  she  claims  that her son's  myopia  had  improved

tremendously during the one-year stay in New Zealand!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been proposals for a through-train

secondary  school/JC programme as well  as  more  subject

choices at the secondary and JC levels.  There have  also

been calls, particularly by the polytechnic students, for

local  universities  to admit more  diploma  holders.   A

fourth  university,  or at least an off-campus  extension

university  to,  among  others, allow  these  polytechnic

graduates  who  meet the grades to enter university,  has

also been called for and is being studied by the Ministry

of  Education.   Otherwise,  many  polytechnic  graduates

leave  for overseas universities each year.  A  few  have

been  known to eventually quit the country as  they  felt

that they were treated as second-class citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have also been calls for an arts school, in

addition  to  a sports school, to accommodate  the  young

with  different  talents and abilities  besides  academic

ability.   Pleas  have also been made for  the  education

policy  of children with special needs to be more aligned

to  those  of  mainstream schools, such as  having  these

schools   come  under  the  ambit  of  the  Ministry   of

Education, special education teachers to be on  the  same

salary  scale  as  those in the mainstream  schools,  and

allowing  more  special needs children to  be  integrated

into mainstream schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These proposals have been largely suggested to give

Singaporeans  more options, inject more  flexibility  and

compassion   into  the  education  system,  and   nurture

creativity and an entrepreneurial spirit among our young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most recently, the ERC's education workgroup's

recommendation  to  lift the restriction  on  Singaporean

students attending international schools here would  also

help minimise the leakage of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1175</b></font><br><br>

local  students to overseas schools as well as  migration

due  to children's education.  As noted by the committee,

lifting  the restriction on local students would  give  a

second chance to local students who do not do well in the

public  schools, as they may be able to do  better  under

the international schools' curriculum.  This idea appears

to  have found strong support by parents.  As one  letter

writer  to  Today puts it, "International schools  are  a

good  alternative for the minority of parents  who  think

the  national  school system is inappropriate  for  their

children.  As a progressive society, we should allow  and

respect such diversity of opinion and personal values."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to urge the Ministry of Education

to  seriously  consider these proposals,  if  it  is  not

already studying them, and to be bold in adopting many of

these  proposals.  I believe that in this way many would-be  quitters  could  be converted, and  the  fidelity  of

stayers strengthened.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, engaging more Singaporeans. With regard

to  this point, I would first like to revisit what  seems

to be the perennial favourite topic - feedback.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I had, during the Budget debate in April, noted

that  a  friend of mine had asked, "Where is the feedback

to my feedback?"  Some months have passed, but it appears

that   this  is  still  a  common  refrain  amongst  many

Singaporeans.   At  a recent feedback session  for  young

Singaporeans, it was reported that the youths had  asked,

"How  much of what they said and felt would be channelled

to the Government?  To what extent did policy makers take

their  views  into  consideration when making  decisions?

And  how  could  they feel a sense of belonging  here  if

their views did not count?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a yawning gap between the

Government's and the public's perception of the  feedback

mechanism.   This  is  despite the fact  that  the  Prime

Minister  had,  in his National Day Rally speech,  pulled

out  the  example of Chek Jawa, amongst others,  to  show

that the Government does listen to and act

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1176</b></font><br><br>

on  feedback.  The Prime Minister had also noted that the

Government  cannot run a country based on feedback  alone

nor  should it bend to every whim and fancy.  But, on the

flip  side,  there is a real danger that this  perception

gap  could widen as Singaporeans become more educated and

informed,   and   increasingly  demand   greater   public

consultation and voice in policy formulation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To close the perception gap and ensure that the

feedback  mechanism is not viewed as a  black  hole,  the

Government could, as far as possible, allow for more pre-policy  rather than post-policy feedback.   It  is  noted

that the Government is already heading in this direction,

as there have been more feedback sought, eg, on the ERC's

recommendations, Remaking Singapore, and  the  review  of

the JC and secondary school education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should also make a conscious effort

to  identify changes which have been made due largely  to

feedback  received.  As Dr Ow Chin Hock  recently  noted:

"Whenever possible, acknowledge the contributions of  the

feedback  providers."  This would give people a sense  of

ownership,   that   they   have   made   a   constructive

contribution to policy making.  Perhaps, the inclusion of

my female, single MPs in Parliament today, as well as the

change  in  policy to allow male civil servants  to  take

child medical sick leave, could be attributed in part  to

some feedback received in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, ultimately, to break the perception

deadlock and reduce the dissonance between the Government

and  its citizens, there will have to be a mindset change

by  both parties.  Otherwise, the perception gap would be

a vicious cycle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people say that the Government does not listen,

whilst the Government says that it does.  We do not  like

the Government to tell us what to do.  Yet, each time  we

have  a crisis, we run to it for solutions.  We know that

our  Government  will do its best and,  thus,  are  quite

happy to leave it to do the thinking for us.  However, if

what  it  does  is  not to our satisfaction,  we  have  a

scapegoat.  We grow up

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1177</b></font><br><br>

relying on the Government to think ahead for us, and  the

Government grew up doing just that, appearing to be  more

used to giving directives than listening to feedback and,

thus, the "Father knows best" perception.  It took us  37

years to grow into this mould.  Hence, time is needed for

both parties to change and adapt to their new roles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As noted by Mr Tan Tarn How of the Straits Times,

the  Government must accept that whilst it may know more,

it  does not mean that it knows better - if I may add, at

least  not all the time.  The people must also understand

that if they want more flexibility, greater freedom, more

say  and  more  choices,  then they  cannot  run  to  the

Government  for  help at the slightest hint  of  trouble.

Will this change of style and tone create more risks  for

both the Government and the governed?  Most certainly  it

will, but taking risks and getting hurt in the process is

the essence of the new economy.  Sir, I would venture  to

say  that  in this new Internet era, governments  do  not

have  a  choice  but to accept greater messiness  in  the

social and political spheres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area for engaging the people relates to

National  Education and bonding.  Besides policy  changes

that  could  strengthen  our 3G  Singaporeans'  sense  of

belonging, many of which have already been identified  by

the  ERC  and the Remaking Singapore Committee,  National

Education,  where  our  young  are  given  lessons  about

Singapore,  would help to give them a sense of  identity.

As  the  Minister for Education succinctly puts it:   "We

want  them  to  know the Singapore Story - how  Singapore

succeeded against the odds".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that our schools are the incubators

for  our  future stayers - the citizens who are proud  of

Singapore.  Hence our National Education programme should

continue   and  should  be  further  built   upon.    The

achievements and successes of Singapore and Singaporeans,

such   as   local  literature,  locally-produced   films,

successful businessmen

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1178</b></font><br><br>

and  businesses, could be compiled for National Education

lessons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also continue to encourage family-based

activities  to  build  stronger family  units,  community

activities  to foster ties among friends and  neighbours,

as  well  as organise more national events that  seek  to

bind  all Singaporeans, regardless of race, language  and

religion.  This is especially so in the light of  the  JI

arrests,  which  have  put  our Malay/Muslim  compatriots

under an uncomfortable spotlight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, a national coordinating body could

be  formed  to organise events at the national level  for

all  Singaporeans.  One such idea that arose  out  of  my

recent IRCC focus group discussion was organising a  huge

religious "Expo" at the national level.  Talks  could  be

given  at  the  "Expo"  by various religious  leaders  to

enlighten members of the public about the basic tenets of

all  major  religions practised in Singapore, to  promote

better understanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the heart of the whole issue, Sir, is the

fundamental  question of what it is that connects  us  to

Singapore.  It is true that physical location per se does

not  make  a stayer or a quitter.  It is more  where  the

heart  is  that defines the stayer or quitter.   But  the

physical  and the tangibles are the symbols  that  define

the boundaries of our heart.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the end, I believe it is the combination of

the  people  - our families and loved ones,  friends  and

emotional  bonds  of  kinship; the place  -  the  sights,

sounds  and  smells of the familiar, and the things  that

loosely define Singaporean-ness, such as chicken rice and

the  ubiquitous HDB flats; and, finally, the privilege  - our  birth  rights  as citizens and, thus,  "first  wife"

status, as per Jack Neo, that determine our rootedness to

the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent times, the last factor - privilege - which

translates  into the opportunity to forge  a  partnership

with  the Government in charting Singapore's path,  seems

to  take  on more significance among the young.  This  is

evidenced by the young clamouring at feedback

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1179</b></font><br><br>

sessions to be heard and to know what role they can  play

in policy making.  A combination of the ability and means

to  be  more  footloose as well as Singapore's  uncertain

economic future may have led to this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's existence is in many ways a historical

accident.   We  are a nation constrained by limited  land

and  people.   Our survival as a nation  is  thus  not  a

given, and we would always have to create our niche in  a

global  village  in  order to  survive.   Hence,  Sir,  I

believe  the Government and the people need to  pull  and

work together in order to make the quitters stayers,  and

the stayers the shapers of our collective destiny.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this light, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Khalis Bin Abdul Ghani (Hong Kah):</b> Thank

you, Sir, for allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this issue was raised by the Hon. Prime

Minister in his National Day Rally speech.  As alluded to

before  me,  it is not about emigration and  immigration.

It  is  really about a sense of belonging and  ownership.

Dig deeper, it is about what it means to be a Singaporean

in  these  uncertain times.  Many Singaporeans  chose  to

dismiss  this  issue  by  saying  that  there  are   many

outstanding  Singaporeans  who  were  quitters  of  their

previous homeland, including some former and even present

Members  of  this  House.  They also  say  that  to  stop

Singaporeans  from  quitting  contradicts  the  call  for

Singaporeans  to  go  global.   With  respect,  again  as

mentioned  by  my  colleagues before me, these  responses

really  miss  the  point - the debate  on  the  label  of

"stayers"  and  "quitters",  instead  of  discussing  the

actual concerns of the Hon. Prime Minister in his speech.

Indeed,  I  am glad that the Prime Minister  raised  this

issue to a level that deserves urgent national concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I have come across Singaporeans who

really  cause  me  worry.  There was  this  man  who  was

released  from  prison  but felt  that  he  was  unjustly

sentenced.  He blamed the prosecutors,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1180</b></font><br><br>

the  justice system and even his defence lawyers for  the

alleged injustice.  He found it difficult to get  a  job,

and again blamed the legal system for casting a stigma on

him.   He took up a retraining course in PSA, but failed.

He  blamed  the  PSA  for  having  conducted  the  course

improperly and came to see me for a refund.  And then  he

accuses the Government of being biased in favour  of  the

tens  of thousands of Malaysian women who get to work  in

our  factories and he could not.  Along the way, Sir,  he

tells  me  that  he  feels a neighbouring  country  would

provide  him  a job and peace of mind.  He  threatens  to

migrate  there  and,  for good measure,  he  accuses  the

Government   of   failing  to  maintain  good   bilateral

relations with that neighbouring country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another resident wanted to rent a flat from the HDB.

She  is  married to a foreigner, and so does not qualify.

She  also earns above the means test figure, but she says

she   suffers   from  some  medical  ailment.    She   is

disappointed  that the Government or  the  HDB  does  not

help,  and  goes  into  a tirade  that  she  is  unjustly

treated.   Again,  she says she might  as  well  migrate,

where  she feels she would be better treated.  These  two

citizens  used  emigration as a threat to obtain  certain

assistance  or services.  I believe that there  are  many

such  similar examples.  It saddens me greatly that  some

Singaporeans see the value of citizenship as only that  - a weapon to be used when demanding for help.  To my mind,

such Singaporeans have quit before they even leave.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not possible to expect everyone to agree with

all Government policies.  Some people disagree enough  to

want  to leave the country as a result.  I do not  regard

them  as  having  quit  Singapore.   They  do  not  treat

citizenship  lightly.   They  considered  carefully   the

reasons for leaving and made a conscious decision.  There

are  also those who are more pulled than pushed, a  point

alluded  to  by my colleague, Ms Indranee earlier.  These

are  usually  the more adventurous among  us.  They  take

risks and usually bear no grudges against Singapore.  The

first group has to be handled differently from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1181</b></font><br><br>

the  second  and third. For the second and third  groups,

the  challenge  is  how  to ensure  that  the  links  are

maintained even while they are away.  For the first,  the

challenge is how to prevent them from reaching that point

to issue threat to leave in the first place.  In crafting

policies in this regard, we have to recognise that  there

are  different  categories  of  people  who  have  to  be

approached differently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, Sir, the common thread that runs

through  these issues is the cultivation of  a  sense  of

belonging and ownership.  How do we do this?  One way  of

many, as suggested in one of the sessions in the remaking

of  Singapore,  is  to involve more Singaporeans  in  the

decision-making   process,  to  enable  Singaporeans   to

identify  themselves with the process of governance  even

if  they disagree with Government.  One way of doing this

is  by devolving more of the governance to the people. We

already  see  this  being  put  in  place.  We  see   the

establishment  of Town Councils.  We also note  that  the

Community  Development  Councils (CDCs)  are  given  more

powers  and  responsibilities to  manage  more  and  more

aspects of their respective zones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to cite the example of COMPASS, which

stands  for Community and Parents in Support of  Schools.

It  is a committee chaired presently by the Hon. Minister

of  State  for  Education,  previously  by  the  Minister

himself.     The   committee   comprises   educationists,

businessmen,   industrialists,  community   leaders   and

parents.   I declare, Sir, that I have been a  Member  of

COMPASS for almost four years now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMPASS seeks to enhance greater school-community

partnership.     It    seeks   to   establish    stronger

collaboration   among  the  stakeholders  of   education,

schools,   the  Ministry,  parents,  community   leaders,

community  institutions, businesses,  industries,  alumni

groups,  school  management committees  and,  of  course,

students  themselves.  It allows these stakeholders,  not

just  the  Ministry and teachers, to be involved  in  the

governance of schools.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1182</b></font><br><br>

Over  the last four years, the number of parents  support

groups  or  similar  groups  in  schools  has  more  than

doubled.   Many more schools now have established  alumni

groups and networking with community institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMPASS, I believe, is succeeding in its efforts to

involve  the  various stakeholders, which is attributable

to  three  factors.   One, clear  objectives  and  focus.

Second,  dynamic leadership at the policy and operational

levels. Three, clear deliverables.  I believe, Sir,  that

the above formula can be replicated elsewhere, of course,

with  necessary changes.  There are indeed other  equally

effective  structures that have allowed many Singaporeans

to  be involved in the process of governance, such as the

S21   Committee  mentioned  earlier,  the   Remaking   of

Singapore  Committee, feedback groups, dialogue  sessions

and  so  on.   Sir, I believe that we should continue  to

expand and deepen the involvement of the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the issue of what it means to be

Singaporeans,  besides suggesting what Government  should

do, what policies should be crafted, it is also important

to  ask  what  Singaporeans  could  do.   In  respect  of

participation in the process of governance,  Singaporeans

should   realise  that  not  every  suggestion   can   be

implemented.  This point was alluded to before by two  of

my  colleagues.  If your suggestion is not  accepted,  it

does  not  necessarily mean that the  Government  is  not

listening.  The perception that the Government  does  not

listen  has  been  cited  as  a  reason  for  people  not

bothering  to  participate. The fact  is  that  in  every

issue,  there  is  always a difference of  opinion.   The

ultimate decision is more often than not an aggregate  of

all views or suggestions or the best among many.  And  in

both  cases,  it  is  not  possible  to  accommodate  all

individual  views.  I believe my hon. colleague,  Mr  Gan

Kim  Yong,  mentioned this earlier.  But  to  participate

meaningfully  in the process of governance,  Singaporeans

must  be  prepared to accept differences of opinions  and

even be defeated in arguments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1183</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans must learn and must be able to accord

greater deference to the process that allows his views to

be  heard  over the actual views that he raises  himself.

This  requires  a  mindset change. We  can  all  ask  the

Government to craft and implement policies to effect this

mindset change but this is somewhat paradoxical.  How  do

we reconcile the desire that we all participate in active

governance and yet not participate in the crafting of the

very policy itself?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that the journey towards a more

participative society where there is greater ownership of

governance and in the future of the country is off  to  a

good  start,  Singaporeans must first take  ownership  of

this  issue.  If we, as Singaporeans, are not willing  to

push  for greater participation, take the trouble to  air

views  and  face the consequences, then there  is  really

very little for any government to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, as observed by Dr Amy Khor earlier,

more  and more issues are being debated by more and  more

Singaporeans  and even more openly.  I urge  Singaporeans

to persist in doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not my intention to say that those who

keep quiet are necessarily passive and inactive citizens.

Many  Singaporeans may not articulate their views in  the

media or sit in high-powered committees but they are  all

important Singaporeans nonetheless.  They care for  their

families, they care for their neighbours, they  care  for

their  colleagues.   People still care.   There  is  much

hope.  With this hope, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

thank you for allowing me to speak on the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did we move this motion? Why are there some

people  who  choose  to leave Singapore  for  good?   The

reasons  behind all these have been very well alluded  to

by  a  number of hon. Members before me and I  shall  not

dwell on them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, we must always accept the fact that

there  will always be people looking for greener  pasture

elsewhere.  But, on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1184</b></font><br><br>

the  other  hand,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  to

realise  that  many  Singaporeans  who  are  capable   of

emigrating, have chosen to stay put.  Even many  of  them

working  overseas are still maintaining their bonds  with

Singapore. Why do they stay?  Maybe by focusing  on  what

makes  these  Singaporeans stay on, we  can  continue  to

build on the emotional linkages with all the Singaporeans

and deal with the problem that way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell you the story of an unhappy young man.

There  is this young doctor who, after his basic  medical

training,  applied for traineeship and  a  posting  in  a

specialty that he is interested in.  As a medical doctor,

if  you want to become a specialist, you have to go  into

the  area  of your interest and get a posting there,  and

then you can do the specialist examinations and become  a

specialist.  But he was turned down because  he  did  not

have any posting in that specialty before and he did  not

pass  Part I of that specialty examination.  However,  he

could  not have sat for the Part I examination if he  did

not  have  any  posting  in that area.   He  became  very

frustrated.   He  got  caught in this catch-22  position.

Eventually, he got the traineeship overseas  and  off  he

went.   He spent a few years in UK.  After he passed  his

specialist training, his consultant there had wanted  him

to  stay  on  and  offered him a  job.   One  would  have

expected him, from what he has experienced previously  in

Singapore, to accept the job, but he chose to  come  back

to Singapore.  The story did not end there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came back, the almighty MOH officials told

him  that he had to start working as a Temporary  Medical

Officer,   although  he  was  already  qualified   as   a

Registrar.  Worse still, he was offered the salary  of  a

second  year  Medical  Officer, the  point  he  left  the

services several years ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, a friend of this young man in Hong

Kong  actually  got  him  a job  as  a  lecturer  in  the

University hospital there.  The pay package, with housing

allowance, was about four times higher than what  he  got

in Singapore.  However, he chose to stay on again.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1185</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people might have taken the opportunity and

moved  on for the pay was higher and the prospect  seemed

brighter overseas.  Was this young man mad or not?   Yes,

he  might have been, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir.  This  young

man  is a psychiatrist and this young man is myself.  You

see, sometimes, psychiatrists do things quite unusually.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did I choose to remain in Singapore? I believe,

for  the  same reasons, many Singaporeans have chosen  to

stay  on.  I grew up here.  My parents who worked so hard

to  bring  me up and to send me to school were here.   My

brothers  and sisters were here.  My friends  were  here.

The  community and the people whom I grew  up  with  were

here.  I wanted my kids to receive education here despite

what  has been said about the education system.  And deep

inside my heart, I know, as a Singaporean, there is  this

sense  of  indebtedness  I have to  this  place  and  the

attachment to this country.  For these reasons, I stayed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, many people also stay on for the economic

prosperity, for the jobs that are available here,  for  a

better  life,  for the safe and secure environment  here.

But  something  might not have gone right that  nowadays,

though  our  country is doing so well,  there  are  still

younger  Singaporeans  who want to emigrate,  more  often

than  not, for economic reasons.  Why?  I ask myself that

question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I look at it, as a nation, we have a relatively

short  history.  In the past three to four  decades,  our

emphasis  has been placed on economic progress and  quite

often,  we emphasise on materialistic success.  I am  not

criticising our Government for having done that.  Indeed,

with  a  population of two million mouths to  feed,  that

should  be  the top priority of any sensible  Government.

But  the  education system, in response to  the  economic

need, has correspondingly focused on producing people for

the   job  market.   The  teaching  of  values,  national

history,   humanity  and  culture  has   therefore   been

relegated maybe to a lesser priority.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1186</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, we may have inadvertently produced a

generation   of  Singaporeans  whose  value   system   is

primarily materialistic and economic.  Their relationship

with  the country may also be measured on economic terms.

They  will see what this country can offer vis-a-vis what

they can get from another country, like doing shopping.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we want to bond Singaporeans to this country

with  purely  dollars and cents, we are doomed  to  fail.

Because, in bad times, when there is no money to be made,

they  will  pack and go.  So, we have to bond  them  with

their hearts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our call to resonate in our fellow Singaporeans'

hearts, they must have the same frequency.  The frequency

of  the heart is the value system.  We must inculcate  in

Singaporeans, young and old, to have the pride  of  being

Singaporeans.   There is no other reason.   Just  because

you  are  a  Singaporean, you should be  proud  of  being

Singaporean.  And this pride can stem from  the  love  of

the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop the love for our homeplace and our

country, many have spoken on having a sense of belonging.

I  would  like to call on the Government and  our  fellow

Singaporeans  to  develop two more senses.   One  is  the

sense  of  indebtedness;  the  second  is  the  sense  of

responsibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is sense of indebtedness? We have always been

taught  about  our rights and opportunities.   Government

should  give me this, Government should give me that,  as

if  the  world owes us a living.  We have not been taught

to define our lives by our debts and the legacies that we

have,  but  by our rights and opportunities.  So,  it  is

high time that we must inculcate this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see that maybe there are at least three types

of indebtedness everyone has.  First is to mother nature,

God,  universe  or whatever you call it,  for  giving  us

life.   Second is to our parents for bringing us to  this

world,  educate  us and bring us up.   Third  is  to  the

country for protecting us,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1187</b></font><br><br>

for  providing us with the opportunities that we may grow

and get to where we are.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our people have to, first, develop this sense of

indebtedness,  and  then will the  feeling  of  gratitude

evolve.   With  this sense of indebtedness,  we  will  be

grateful  of what our parents have done for us  and  what

the  country has provided for us.  With that, we will  be

spontaneous to have our sense of responsibility, like the

dutiful children repaying their parents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards sense of responsibility, too often, we

are  Singaporeans  who, whenever anything  happens,  will

say,  "Government  should do this, Government  should  do

that  .".  I think it is also time that we must start  to

inculcate    this    sense   of   responsibility    among

Singaporeans,  so  that everyone is accountable  to  what

happens  to  this  country.   Only  with  that  sense  of

responsibility  will there be active participation  as  a

citizen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing we need to do, I think, is to promote

patriotism,  the love for our country.  It  was  actually

very  disheartening to hear that a number of Singaporeans

did  not  display  the  national flag  on  National  Day,

because  they were unhappy with the state of the economy,

and  maybe because of bus fare hikes, etc.  But,  on  the

other   hand,  it  was  also  heartwarming  to   read   a

Singaporean  who emigrated to Holland still displays  the

national flag every August.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patriotism is the love of one's homeplace, its

people,  and to the familiar things and scenes associated

with  the  homeplace.  The love should be  unconditional.

Singapore is my home, good times or bad times.  It is  no

wonder  that  home-making and homeland make  the  central

themes of many very moving poems, songs and stories.   In

fact, I attended a choir performance last Saturday.   Out

of  the  48 songs on the list I went through, 14 of  them

actually were on either gu xiang (homeplace/homeland)  or

zhu  guo (motherland).  So, I think we need to have  this

sense of patriotism among our Singaporeans.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1188</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what type of patriotism? I think we must

differentiate  that  from  nationalism.   Someone   -   I

cannot remember who  -  said that patriotism arises  from

the  love  of your own people whereas nationalism  arises

from  the hatred of other people.  But, in Singapore,  we

are  a  country  that  consists of  different  races  and

cultures.   We  must  have  a patriotism  that  could  be

applicable  to  us.   Abraham  Lincoln's  definition   of

"patriotism" could be aptly applied to our case.  He said

that,  "Patriotism is not associated with any  particular

race  or  religion but the loyalty to a set of principles

that the country stands for."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, I think we should promote that and

uphold our belief in meritocracy, equal opportunities for

all,  multi-racialism,  multi-culturalism  and  the  able

helping the disabled.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question, Sir, is how should we go about

promoting  this.  I think we should do it in the  schools

and in the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why schools? I think we have to start promoting

this sense of indebtedness, responsibility and patriotism

when Singaporeans are still young.  Of course, it has  to

start at home also.  As the Chinese saying goes, san  sui

ding  zhong  sheng (your future is decided when  you  are

three  years  old).   And  every Singaporean  spends,  on

average,  maybe  10-15 years in the  educational  system.

And  this  is  also the period when their characters  are

formed  and  developed,  and  their  value  systems   are

developing.  We must not ask our students just  to  study

and  study.   Like  the  comment of a  young  Singaporean

during  a  dialogue session, he said, "If the  memory  of

Singapore youths are limited to studying, they would  not

have much bonding with Singapore."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, what should be taught? Our students recite

the  National  Pledge and sing the National Anthem  every

day.   We must ensure that what our system stands for  is

actually enshrined in the Pledge and the Anthem.  So,  we

should make an effort to make sure that our children, our

students,  really understand the meaning and buy  in  the

values that are ingrained in them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1189</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member, Gan Kim Yong, has also proposed the

revamping  of  the  National Education programme,  and  I

support  his call for that.  We should teach our National

Education on a more emotional level, and not just at  the

level  of maybe recounting of historical facts.   We  may

even want to structure the NEP to be more interactive and

with  more involvement.  And some of the assignments  may

be  done  with the parents and grandparents, so that  the

memories of the early generations can be passed on to the

younger generations through this programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In schools, I think we should also start teaching

the  idea  of  responsible citizenship since  young.   We

must,  as  I  said, inculcate the two senses I  mentioned

since  young.   And our youths must be  taught  what  the

system stands for, what are the rights and obligations of

a  citizen, and let them know more about the Constitution

and the needs of active citizen participation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a participatory citizenry? It should be one

that   involves   the  citizens  in  the  decision-making

process.  And it must come with a mature attitude towards

consensus  building.  More often than  not,  Singaporeans

like to complain and say that their feedback is not being

heard or not listened to because Government does not take

the  popular stand and follow what they have  asked  for.

So, I think it is also important to nurture this type  of

mature  attitude to know that for Singapore  to  survive,

sometimes  we  cannot  rule  by  popular  policies,   and

sometimes we have to make tough and difficult policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, what is more important is that we must also

not   over-emphasise  the  importance  of   materialistic

success  at the expense of other basic human values.   We

have  to  place  more  emphasis on the  teaching  of  the

humanities, science, literature and arts.  These are  the

softer sciences that will help to inculcate the values of

loyalty, honesty, responsibility and so on and so forth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I anticipate that the MOE may

respond by saying that our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>

curriculum  is already so packed, how do we  add  in  all

this.   I think if we have to forgo some teaching of  the

hard  subjects,  we may have to do it.   As  the  Chinese

saying goes, shi nian shu mu, bai nian shu ren, (it takes

10 years to grow a tree, it takes 100 years to build up a

people.)   Building  the character  of  our  students  is

investing  in the future of our nation, and  is  building

the  foundation  of  our nation for tomorrow.   And  this

should take precedence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of bonding is to create a common

memory.  Culture, in its broader sense, makes up the bulk

of  our  memories.  We have to therefore promote  culture

and arts, both in school and community.  For this, we can

do it in the community also, not just in schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, Singapore had been criticised as a

place where the development of culture and arts had  been

sidelined.   But we have been doing  catching-up  in  the

past  few  years, and much more can be  done.   Arts  and

culture  must appeal to everyone.  We should not  promote

arts  and culture that appeal only to a certain group  of

people,  but  we  must  have one that  has  mass  appeal.

Moreover,  as  we  aspire to become a truly  cosmopolitan

city,  we  also have to accept the introduction  and  the

impact of more varied forms of arts and culture that come

along  with  all the international talents  and  migrants

that  pass through Singapore.  The end result,  I  think,

would  definitely make us a more vibrant place  to  stay,

and  this  will actually help to build the  memories  for

this place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we should not forget that every Singaporean will

still  have  a race of his own.  While we place  national

interest   above  one's  interest,  we  must  also   help

Singaporeans  to  have a deep sense of his  own  culture.

Only with a culture can a person have certain roots,  and

with  this  root,  it will help them  to  get  rooted  to

Singapore.  And, of course, we should, besides  encourage

them  to  have  a deep sense of their own  culture,  also

encourage them to understand others' culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the community level, I feel that Singaporeans

also must help to promote

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>

active participation in the community.  Many things  have

been  said  by other hon. Members before.   But  what  is

important is whatever we do, it must always be done  with

this  objective  in mind.  This must  be  done  to  forge

community bonding and to build a national identity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clan associations, self-help groups, etc, could be

roped  in  to  help to promote the righteous  traditional

values.  For example, Confucian teachings stress a lot on

loyalty  to  friends, family and the country,  and  these

should be promoted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to

touch  briefly on dual citizenship.  There are  pros  and

cons   of  allowing  dual  citizenship.   The  advantages

include   the  following:  maintaining  ties   with   the

citizens, promoting their economic contributions to  this

country, encouraging their remittances back to Singapore,

and  maybe we can help to develop a sympathetic lobby  in

the  countries that they have emigrated to.   However,  I

see that there are also many disadvantages of doing so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dual citizenship is like having two sets of parents

or,  someone may like to say, two wives.  It is polygamy.

With one set of parents or one wife is already difficult.

How do you manage with two sets of parents with different

beliefs, psychology, values, and so on?  This will result

in  divided loyalties.  Moreover, having dual citizenship

also  means  that we will permit immigrants  to  come  to

Singapore to also hold dual citizenship and they may just

be   doing  likewise,  lobbying  for  their  home,  their

originating  country,  and  influence  our  politics   in

Singapore, which may not be a wise thing to do.  Last but

not least, it really devalues the meaning of citizenship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as the Chinese say, we must always give

people  a hou-lu.  So we must be like a forgiving mother,

welcome  and  embrace  our children  who  sometimes  have

wandered off and decided to come home.  We may want to be

more  flexible and more forgiving in granting citizenship

back  to those Singaporeans who choose to come back  with

good reasons.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, sad will be

the day when Singaporeans

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>

forget  their history and values, and no longer  remember

the  country  that  nurtures  them,  the  land  that  our

forefathers  had  fought and worked  so  hard  to  build.

However, I am more optimistic.  Most Singaporeans are all-weather  citizens.  They are ready to sail the  Singapore

ship together, in good times and bad times!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with that, I support the Motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the Motion.  Based  on

the  wordings  of the Motion, I am sure  the  House  will

support  the  Motion.  But, what will  happen  after  the

Motion  is  passed  is the key consideration  in  today's

debate.   I  hope  the  Government  will  come  out  with

concrete  plans to review its policies and programmes  so

as to develop a sense of belonging among Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would urge the Government to form an

inter-agency committee comprising only civil servants  to

look  into  ways of bonding Singaporeans to our  country.

The  recommendations of this committee can complement the

Remaking Singapore Committee's effort in going beyond the

5Cs for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fact that the Prime Minister has to raise

such concerns clearly reflects that some Singaporeans are

disillusioned with Singapore.  There is a need to re-look

into the needs and aspirations of Singaporeans.  As human

resource is the most valuable resource Singapore has,  we

must  make  very effort to root all Singaporeans  to  the

country.   Any  Singaporean  who  emigrates  out  of  the

country is a loss to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a fast paced society like Singapore, economic

pursuits  may  sometimes make us lose  our  human  touch.

Individuals  and  families are subject  to  high  stress,

resulting  in  people  losing hope  about  their  future.

Under such circumstances, the search for greener pastures

will  surface, thus causing a brain drain to the country.

While  Singapore  cannot relent on its pursuit  to  be  a

competitive player in the global economy, we must at  the

same

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1193</b></font><br><br>

time  inject hope in our people to lead a meaningful life

in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must develop a conducive environment for

Singaporeans  to  live,  work  and  play  in   Singapore.

Singapore  must be a place where there are  opportunities

for   all.    There   must  be  opportunities   for   all

individuals,  families,  community,  and  businesses   to

flourish.  It must be a place for Singaporeans to live  a

meaningful and happy life.  It must also be a place where

there is hope for their future and future generations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to propose the following measures to

develop a sense of belonging among Singaporeans:

<br><br><i>(1)  Housing Policies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last 30 years, our housing policies and

asset   enhancement  programmes  have  resulted  in   the

nuclearisation  and high mobility of families.   The  HDB

flat  allocation system is too rigid and does not provide

much  option  for Singaporeans to stay near their  family

members.  The resale flat policies also do not facilitate

families to live near one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the turnover of the sale of flats hampers

community   bonding   among   residents.    Today,   many

Singaporeans  are living away from their family  members.

This  physical divide, coupled with our busy  lifestyles,

has eroded the bonds of family members as they spend less

time  together.  Sir, we need a thorough  review  of  our

housing  policies to facilitate families to be  together.

HDB  must  be  more  flexible  and  pro-family  in  their

policies.

<br><br><i>(2)  Education Policies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children are the future and hopes of all parents.

Parents  are  always concerned about  the  education  and

development  of  their children.  Lots of  feedback  have

been  received  on  the  stressful  education  system  in

Singapore.  Some parents have decided to emigrate for the

sake of their children's future.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many feel that our education policies do not provide

many  opportunities for their children to maximise  their

potential.   Our  mainstream  education  system  is   too

inflexible  and  lacks  choices for  students  to  choose

subjects  that  are  of  interest  to  them.   The  heavy

emphasis on examination has also put too much pressure on

our children unnecessarily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parents also face much difficulty in coping with

their  children's  schoolwork.   Many  have  resorted  to

tuitions, which have added much financial burden  to  the

families.   At the same time, children are  not  able  to

find enough time to play and interact with their friends.

This has made our children to be more individualistic and

less street smart.  Some do not have any social skills at

all, and can sometimes be rude and arrogant.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need to provide a more conducive learning

environment for our children.  Our education system  must

be  more  compassionate  and flexible  in  nurturing  our

young.   Although  we  need to  instill  values  such  as

diligence, creativity and moral conduct in our young,  we

must  help  them  to  balance their childhood  lives  and

learning  experiences.   Otherwise,  more  children   and

parents will lose heart and fall out of the system.

<br><br><i>(3)  Community Development Policies</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To develop a sense of belonging, we need to focus on

the  hearts of our people.  The Government must take  the

lead to show care and concern for its people.  We need to

help  Singaporeans to find meaning in life.  Singaporeans

must  feel that they are useful to the society  and  must

have a sense of self-esteem to lead a meaningful life  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have done well in providing an excellent

living environment for Singaporeans.  What we need is  to

look  into the "software" of helping Singaporeans to live

happily  together.   Living close to family  members  and

friends  in  a cohesive community will provide  a  strong

sense  of belonging to our people.  Furthermore, if there

is a comprehensive network of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>

grassroots and voluntary welfare organisations to support

the community, we can build a more caring community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should provide more resources to

support  meaningful  programmes run  by  GROs  and  VWOs,

including  the  Community  Development  Councils.    More

Singaporeans should be encouraged to help one another  in

the  community.  It is through these activities  that  we

can  build  strong bonds among our people and  develop  a

true sense of belonging to the country.

<br><br><i>(4)  Opportunities for All</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in order to make all Singaporeans "stayers", we

must  inject hope in our people, their families and their

children.  We must make every Singaporean have the  "feel

good"  factor  of being in Singapore.  We must  formulate

Government policies which will provide opportunities  for

all.   Of  course,  we  shall still abide  by  our  equal

opportunity and meritocracy principles.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those Singaporeans who have done well must be able

to  see  more opportunities in the country.  While  those

who  have  not been too successful must see opportunities

for  themselves or their children in the future.  As long

as  there is hope for every Singaporean, we will not face

the problem of quitters.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zainudin Nordin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise to support the Motion  dubbed  as

"Stayers   and   Quitters"  raised  by  my   fellow   PAP

parliamentarians.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to tell you not the tale of two cities,

but the tale of two Singaporean families.  There are many

stories  and anecdotes about this topic of migration  out

there,  but  I  feel  that  it is  important  for  me  to

illustrate  how  complex this matter is.   Sometimes  the

situation that may be clear-cut and obvious to us may not

be  so.   These  are stories of Singaporean families  who

have   flirted  with  immigration  in  some   degree   of

variations and with different outcomes.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family A is a middle-aged professional couple with

four children.  Sometime in mid-1990s, the family decided

to  go  to New Zealand, and they brought with them  their

two  youngest children.  They made their living there and

even  managed  to upgrade themselves and  obtained  their

post-graduate degrees.  The two youngest children grew up

and  studied  in the New Zealand education system,  while

the  other  two elder children stayed back in  Singapore,

did  very  well in their studies and were pursuing  their

tertiary education (one in Singapore and the other in  an

overseas  university).   After  four  years,  the  family

decided  to come back to Singapore.  But their  stay  was

short-lived, and they decided to uproot the family  again

and migrate to New Zealand and maybe this time, it is for

good.  Why did this happen?  According to them, they  did

it  for  their children.  It is because their two younger

children  are  having problems to cope with our  academic

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family B is a young professional couple with two

young  children.  For many years, the wife  and  the  two

children stayed in Australia.  The kids were there  since

the  age  of  one  and  two.  The  husband  is  gainfully

employed  in  Singapore  and  shuttles  between  the  two

countries  as  much  as  he can.   Recently,  the  family

decided  to come back and they are able to overcome  some

of  the issues of the kids' education because the MOE had

given  them  the  approval to put their  children  in  an

international school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we cannot under-estimate or emphasise enough

the  importance  of  the children's  education  in  their

decision-making process of these families.

In his National Day Rally speech, Prime Minister Goh Chok

Tong  alerted us on his concern of the sense of belonging

of  our  fellow  citizens.  This  concern  is  even  more

pertinent    with    regard   to   the   third-generation

Singaporeans.  We are hearing more who consider migration

and  hope to find a less stressful place in the  sun  for

themselves  and their family.  These are generally  those

who  are  talented, mobile and can afford to  uproot  and

move.  Can we, as a country, afford this loss?  Some say,

"Good riddance."  But I am saying

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1197</b></font><br><br>

that,  for  a small country, like Singapore,  one  talent

loss  is  one  too many.  As it is, we are struggling  to

attract talent to our country.  Similarly, are we  taking

care  of  the  underdogs and the underprivileged  of  our

society to face new challenges of this new economy?   How

then, Sir, can we allay all these worries that people are

facing?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I believe that we have

arrived at the juncture of our country's development  and

growth   where  we  are  expected  to  deliver  something

different, do things differently and do not always  stick

to  the  old formula that has served us well.  In  moving

forward  to revive the economy, thus creating  more  jobs

and businesses, we must not lose track of the very reason

we are doing all these efforts, that is, the people.  Let

us give them back the self-confidence, the morale and the

self-esteem.   We know that, in the present  scenario  of

stiff  competition and rapid globalisation, we  certainly

have  to  put our priorities right, that is, to implement

measures  to  ensure Singapore remains competitive.   But

can  we  also  emphasise  on  the  soft  aspects  of  our

development, ie, our hearts and souls that will make  the

society  and  country even stronger in the face  of  more

daunting challenges in the future?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expert advices and proposals from the Economic

Review   Committee  on  Restructuring  our  Economy   are

important.   But  equally  important  and  probably  more

important  in this present climate, Sir, are  the  inputs

and  proposals  from  the Remaking  Singapore  Committee.

Ever  so  often, our efficient Government prescribes  the

medicine  that  they  believe would  solve  the  economic

malaise.   These  are often bitter pills and  expect  the

people  to swallow.  I would also strongly encourage  the

Government  to  take  heed  of  the  Remaking   Singapore

Committee's  proposals and recommendations that  will  be

coming up soon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is almost a year since the last election and we

are  slowly  recovering from the recession.  During  this

period, we have

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>

gone  through  many difficult challenges and  they  range

from the economy and security of our beloved country, and

I  am  sure we will continue to face more such challenges

in  the  new economy and the ever changing political  and

security landscape of the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the most important challenges for the

Government  is to ensure that the masses are  with  them.

They must understand that these changes are necessary and

that  we have to do it no matter how painful it is  going

to be.  Without proper communication and understanding of

what the Government is trying to achieve, I am afraid  we

may  be  creating many disgruntled citizens who  will  be

bitter, cynical and anti-establishment.  This is  not  to

mention the minimum sense of belonging towards Singapore.

We need to further improve what Mr Gan Kim Yong termed as

"connections".  These links must provide  for  a  two-way

channel   of  communication.   The  Government  and   its

agencies  must, in my opinion, take the lead in  changing

and  adapting a different style of governance for the new

Singapore.   It  must  not  be  seen  as  always   giving

directions and taking a paternalistic role, but rather it

must  be  a  partner  of the people,  that  is,  for  the

Government  to abandon its "Only Government  knows  best"

mindset.  We can tell the people to change their mindset.

But  is the Government willing to do the same in the  way

it does things?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in this Motion, the call for Government to

review its policies and programmes thoroughly and to take

meaningful measures that will help strengthen  the  sense

of  belonging to Singapore is timely and laudable.  There

must be clear indicators and not just lip service in  the

way  our key institutions run their businesses.  They are

well  known for their efficiency and high standards.   It

is   time  that  they  showed  the  same  high  level  of

compassion  and  humanity, if  not  cynical  remarks  and

reviews  about  the  Government not  being  sincere  will

continue  to persist, and the able will not come  forward

to  take  part in this process of change.   Let  us  work

together to change this negative thinking and get as many

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1199</b></font><br><br>

able and willing citizens to participate in the process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government's willingness

to  change  its  mindset  will  be  a  bold  effort  but,

nevertheless, a  necessary one.  We cannot afford to have

our  strong and able simply leave to places or  countries

which  they think can provide better for them  and  their

families.  Sir, this effort in our long journey of nation

building  is essential and all concerned members  of  our

homeland should be part of it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, in the long term, Singaporeans

must   also  accept  the  fact  that  there  must  be   a

constructive effort to lessen the reliance or  dependence

on  the  Government in all areas.  In the  same  vein,  I

would  also  say  that Singapore needs  to  readjust  its

perception   and  perspective  on  law  and   punishment.

Singapore should not be solely operated on laws and rules

alone,  but  must  instead encourage  its  people  to  be

responsible and thinking citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to highlight the importance of

education  in this process of change.  From the  feedback

from  my residents and grassroots, I have concluded  that

many  parents  are very concerned about their  children's

future.   You  can see from the two stories that  I  have

told  you earlier.  The parents worry about whether their

children   can   cope  with  the  extremely   competitive

environment  in  Singapore.  Yes,  we  parents  are  very

concerned  about  our children's education.   We  are  so

afraid  that  our  children will not  get  enough.   Some

cynics  may  say otherwise.  But the majority does  agree

that we do have a good education system in Singapore.   I

believe we can still fine-tune it to make it even better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to propose to MOE to put more resources

and  emphasis on early childhood education, that is,  the

foundation  years.  Our education system  should  prepare

the  future generations for the rapid changes and produce

nimble,  creative  and innovative  minds.   We  know  the

importance that the Government puts in education  by  the

sheer size of resources

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1200</b></font><br><br>

they  have  imported  into  education.   This  cannot  be

denied.   We  cannot afford not to invest in  our  young.

Furthermore,  we  should  have a more  holistic  approach

towards  education.  Academic excellence should not  only

be  the  thrust of education.  A child should be nurtured

on  values,  such  as community spirit,  social  service,

voluntarism  and sports and arts.  This would  nurture  a

well-rounded  individual  with  strong  community   ties.

Ultimately,  our education system should aim  to  develop

citizens  who  are  able to put Singapore  and  community

before self.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the new generation of Singaporeans is

different.  I think it is as expected.  This  is  due  to

the success of our past leaders, the rapid development of

our country and - surprise - our education system itself.

I  know  it  is  paradoxical that  most  of  our  younger

generation   and   young  parents  are  complaining   and

criticising our stressful education system that  has,  in

no small means, contributed to their own success.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has a sound meritocratic system which has

produced   a   society  of  achievers  and   success-only

products,  with  little  room for  failures  and  errors.

Singaporeans have also been moulded to be conformists and

uniformists.  We are now faced with difficulties to allow

and,   let   alone,  encourage  creativity  and  bohemian

lifestyle.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore needs to accept other avenues of

success,    meaning   non-academic   success,   different

lifestyles,  being non-conformists, and  entrepreneurship

with  tolerance  for failures.  We should allow,  promote

and  encourage  pluralism and diversity of  opinions  and

views.   I believe it is the basic tenet of our existence

in a multi-racial and multi-religious society.  We should

be as inclusive as possible and avoid being exclusive and

elitist in our approach.  Every Singaporean matters,  and

we should re-emphasise this notion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Sir, Singaporeans and the Government

alike  need  to  acknowledge there are other  avenues  of

meritocracy   and   talents   whilst   maintaining    the

fundamentals of these two policies.  There

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1201</b></font><br><br>

should  be no fixation of either foreign or local  talent

and failures in academic or business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the Motion.

<div align="center"><b>DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mdm Ho Geok Choo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Mdm Ho Geok Choo</b> asked the Minister for Trade

and  Industry (a) how can Singaporeans embrace the  Prime

Minister's and Senior Minister's visions on the  need  to

focus  on  booming China in the context of  engaging  and

doing  business  in  China; and  (b)  as  the  window  of

opportunity  can run out fast, what programmes  or  plans

are  there  to realise these visions and help derive  the

maximum advantage for Singapore.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July last year and, more recently, during the

Committee  of  Supply  debate on  MTI's  budget,  I  have

outlined  our China policy and what our economic agencies

have  been doing to help Singapore do business in  China.

I will provide an update today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore companies have invested in close to 10,000

projects  in China, amounting to US$20 billion  to  date.

China   has  now  become  Singapore's  largest   overseas

investment destination, overtaking Malaysia since 1997 in

cumulative  terms. Our businessmen have been  positioning

themselves to take advantage of the many opportunities in

China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of them have done well in China. For example,

Khong Guan sold 300 million yuan (S$67 million) worth  of

its  products  in  China last year.   Education  services

provider  TMC has attracted 1,000 full-time  students  in

its  Xi'an  campus alone, thanks to its modern facilities

and  high quality courses.  Smart Garments has grown from

280  workers  in 1985 to 2,600 workers in its  3  Chinese

factories today, producing 1.75 million suits a year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides investing in China, our companies have also

begun  to  partner with Chinese companies  that  are  now

seeking  to internationalise, in exploring other markets.

For  example, one of our local companies has successfully

partnered Zhejiang-based Feiyue Sewing Machine  Group  to

enter the India market.

<br><br><i>Programmes and Plans</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are steadily building up our China network. It

is  impossible  to  do  business in  China  without  good

networking. Last month, we launched the Singapore Chamber

of  Commerce  and  Industry in Beijing (SingCham).  This,

together   with  Network  China  that  was  launched   in

Singapore a year ago by DPM Lee Hsien Loong and  Chairman

of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

Li  Ruihuan, will provide a useful platform for companies

operating  in  China  to  network,  interact  and   share

experiences  and  business ideas.  SingCham  and  Network

China  provide  a  support base for  Singapore  companies

operating in China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When PRC Vice President Hu Jintao visited Singapore

in  April,  he  raised  a 4-Point Proposal  with  PM,  to

cooperate   with   Singapore  in  (i)   helping   Chinese

enterprises  to  go global, (ii) high-tech  areas,  (iii)

development  of  Western China and  (iv)  human  resource

development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since April, we have been working on these 4

proposals with the Chinese Government.  EDB recently  set

up  a new office in Shanghai to attract Chinese companies

to Singapore.  China's Ministry of Science and Technology

has  announced  its plans to set up an innovation  centre

for  China's high-tech enterprises in Singapore.   During

my  recent  visit to China, the Zhejiang  provincial  and

city  governments reacted positively to our proposal  for

the establishment of a Zhejiang Centre in Singapore, as a

facility  for Zhejiang companies to market, showcase  and

provide after-sales service for their products in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>

region.  In Brunei recently, I also discussed the idea of

a  China  Centre with Chinese Minister for Foreign  Trade

and  Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng to help  Chinese

companies  use  Singapore as a base  to  regionalise  and

internationalise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have relaxed our visa policies to facilitate the

flow of Chinese tourists into Singapore, and PRC business

travellers can now obtain multiple-journey visas  for  up

to 5 years.  We are also interested to participate in the

development  of  Western China.   Minister  Mah  Bow  Tan

visited  Sichuan  in  May  this year,  and  IE  Singapore

organised 2 business missions to Western China last  year

focusing  on  education and ICT.  We are discussing  with

our Chinese counterparts on ways to operationalise VP  Hu

Jintao's proposals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Separately, ASEAN is negotiating a Free Trade

Agreement  with  China within 10 years, and  a  Framework

Agreement  incorporating an Early Harvest is expected  to

be  signed  when  the Leaders meet in November  in  Phnom

Penh.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private sector is the prime mover in seeking out

business  opportunities in China.   The  Government  will

play a supportive role.  One area that the Government can

help is in manpower training. Since I announced the Asian

Business  Fellowship Programme a year ago, more  than  50

fresh  graduates and young executives have been  sent  on

training  attachments with companies in various parts  of

China  under  the  Programme.  We expect  the  number  of

trainees to reach 100 by the end of this year.  Recently,

IE  Singapore launched its Overseas Manpower  Program  to

equip  executives with overseas experience in  China  and

elsewhere.   Through such initiatives, we  hope  to  make

available  a  pool  of Singaporeans  with  deep  business

knowledge of China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mdm Ho suggested, the window of opportunity for

our  engagement  with China will not be as  open  in  the

future.   Our  companies can and should leverage  on  our

good  relations with China and our reputation for honesty

and  reliability.   But  we have to  keep  upgrading  our

capabilities,  so that we do not lose our relevance.   At

the same time, we must be aware of the pitfalls.  Not all

our  companies have done well in China and we should also

learn from their experiences.

<div align="center"><b>PREVENTION OF HEAT BUILD-UP IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Dr Teo Ho Pin</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  (a)  what  are the  measures  taken  by  the

planning and building authorities to prevent the build up

of  heat  in our built environment; and (b) what are  the

energy   conservation   measures   taken   to   encourage

sustainable development in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the planning of the physical development of

Singapore,   the   Government   has   always   emphasised

comprehensive and integrated efforts to provide shade and

greenery  to  our urban built environment.    Our  Garden

City  initiative has succeeded in providing  a  pervasive

garden  environment for Singapore.  Our  roadside  trees,

the  planned parks and green spaces provide the necessary

green  lungs  and  aesthetics as  well  as  work  towards

ameliorating the heat build up in our environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BCA, NParks, HDB and NUS are jointly studying the

causes and impact of heat build up in our environment. So

far,  the study has shown that rooftop gardens can almost

halve  the temperatures of the roof surfaces of  highrise

buildings,  resulting  in  less  heat  radiated  to   the

surrounding areas. NParks is therefore promoting  rooftop

gardens to owners and developers through public education

and awareness programmes.  To encourage skyrise greenery,

URA allows for certain GFA exemption for the provision of

sky  terrace.  URA  also  allows  developers  to  provide

balcony  floor  area up to 10% above  the  GFA  allowable

under the Master Plan in the design of residential, mixed

residential and hotel developments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1207</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance the energy efficiency of buildings in

Singapore, BCA has set more stringent standards to reduce

the energy consumption of building services. These are in

areas   such  as  the  design  of  air-conditioning   and

mechanical ventilation systems and the minimum efficiency

of  equipment and lighting systems in buildings. BCA also

intends  to set a stricter compliance value of  the  heat

gain  into  a  building which is to be incorporated  into

building  designs. This will lessen the load on the  air-conditioning  system in new buildings and therefore  help

reduce the electricity consumption. In addition, BCA  has

started the Building Energy Efficiency Indices (EEI) as a

guide  to  the industry for the amount of energy consumed

by  the  various  building types.  It is also  conducting

research on the use of solar energy in our local context.

<div align="center"><b>WRITTEN ANSWER TO QUESTION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Charles Chong</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  whether his Ministry will review Article  122(1)

of  the  Constitution of the Republic of Singapore making

the  conditions  for according Singapore  citizenship  by

descent  to  foreign born children of a Singapore  parent

more gender equal.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Constitution does not make any distinction

between a child born in Singapore to either a Singaporean

father   or   Singaporean  mother.   Such  children   are

Singapore  citizens by birth.  This would apply  to  most

cases,  as the majority of children born to a Singaporean

parent or parents, are born in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Constitution also provides for children born

overseas to at least one Singaporean parent to be granted

citizenship.   Children born overseas  to  a  Singaporean

mother  (and  foreigner father) are  not  deprived  of  a

chance to be citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 122(1) of the Constitution allows for

citizenship  by  descent to be granted to  a  child  born

overseas to a Singaporean father, provided that the child

is   registered  within  one  year  of  birth.   If   the

registration  is not done within one year of  birth,  the

Constitution allows for citizenship by registration to be

granted to such children.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 124 of the Constitution allows for children

born  overseas  of  a Singaporean mother  (and  foreigner

father) to be citizens by registration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Constitution has made this

differentiation for births overseas, the practical effect

is  not  great.   The great majority of applications  for

citizenship  of children born overseas to  a  Singaporean

parent are approved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other discernible difference between

citizenship  by  descent and citizenship by  registration

lies  in  Article  129(3)(b) of the  Constitution,  which

states that the Government may deprive the citizenship of

a citizen by registration if, within 5 years of the grant

of  citizenship by registration, he has been sentenced to

imprisonment for a term of more than 1 year or to a  fine

of  more  than  $5,000  or  if he  has  been  engaged  in

activities  which  are prejudicial  to  the  security  of

Singapore,  or  the  maintenance  of  public   order   or

essential   services,  or  in  any  criminal   activities

prejudicial to the interests of public safety,  peace  or

good  order.  For  most  people,  these  conditions   are

practically not applicable.  Thus, while the form of  the

citizenship  differs between a child born overseas  to  a

Singaporean   father  and  mother,   the   substance   is

practically the same.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not the only country to make such a

distinction.   We  are guided by the reasoning  that,  in

communities like ours, the man is traditionally the  main

or  in  many  cases, the sole breadwinner of the  family.

The  man's  place  of employment would therefore  usually

decide where the family would reside.  It would therefore

be  more practical for the citizenship of the child  born

overseas to follow that of the father's.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the substance of the citizenship granted to

children born overseas in either case is practically  the

same, my Ministry is of the view that, for now, we should

not amend Article 122(1) of the Constitution.
