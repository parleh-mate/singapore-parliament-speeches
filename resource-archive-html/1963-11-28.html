<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I beg to move the motion*

standing in my name.

<hr size="2" noshade>

*The motion reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) that notwithstanding the Standing Orders the days allotted for discussion

of the 1964 Estimates in Committee of Supply be

reduced to three days, that  is  to say,

Thursday, 12th December, 1963,  Friday, 13th   December,

1963,  and  Saturday,  14th December, 1963;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) that the Assembly do sit on Saturday the 14th December, 1963.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will have noticed that this year's

Estimates  are contained in a much thinner  volume

than in the case of previous years'. The reason is

very clear. It is because certain Departments have

been  transferred to the control  of  the  Federal

Government. In fact, the number of Heads has  been

reduced  from 57 to 40 this year. If that  be  the

case, the Government feels that the number of days

for  discussion of the Estimates in  Committee  of

Supply,  which is fixed at five under the  present

several  respects Standing Orders of our  Assembly

will  be  out of date, and it is the intention  of

the  Government to amend the Standing Orders  both

in regard to procedures on Estimates as well as on

other matters.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Assembly approves the financial policy

of the Government for the year 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fifth Budget which I have the honour

to present to the Assembly. It is characteristic of

our  bustling and dynamic City State that  each  of

these  budgets  appeared under  markedly  different

circumstances from its predecessor. Once again this

holds  true this year for the present Budget  which

this  Assembly  is  considering.  This  Budget   is

considered  when  Singapore  is  now  a   part   of

independent Malaysia. Being the first Budget  under

the  new Federation of Malaysia, the Estimates show

in detail the operations of the financial agreement

of   merger,  that  is  to  say,  the  division  of

departments  and responsibilities  as  between  the

State  and the Centre and the division of  revenues

between the State and the Centre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In normal circumstances, this would in itself be

a memorable occasion. However, the establishment of

Malaysia   has  brought  about  the  severance   of

diplomatic  relations between Malaysia and  two  of

our  neighbours, the Philippines anti Indonesia  as

well as the suspension



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



of  trade  between  Malaysia and  Indonesia.  Since

Singapore  is the most important trading centre  in

this  region  and since we depend to a considerable

extent  on the entrepot trade, it follows that  the

trade  severance  will  have  important  and   far-reaching  effects.  I propose  to  deal  with  this

subject in some detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First I wish to undertake a brief review of

economic  conditions in 1963. After the  Referendum

in September, 1962, much of the uncertainties which

then prevailed in Singapore were dispelled and with

a  new  upsurge of confidence, there was a  decided

improvement in trade as well as private  investment

and   public  investment.  The  State's  Four  Year

Development Plan gathered momentum in all fields.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indications are that for the first nine

months  of  1963 Singapore was having a substantial

rate of economic expansion. Bank deposits increased

from  an average of $984 million in 1962 to  $1,090

million  by  the end of September this  year.  Bank

loans and advances show an increase of 18 per  cent

from  $707  million  in 1962  to  $786  million  by

September  this year. All the other  indicators  of

trade, shipping, building and construction point to

a  picture of a thriving economy. For instance, the

value  of our imports which average $336 million  a

month  in  1962  increased by 8 per  cent  to  $364

million per month over the first three quarters  of

this  year.  A similar increase of 8 per  cent  was

experienced  in the value of our exports.  Shipping

figures  also  show corresponding increases,  cargo

loaded increasing from 639 thousand tons per  month

in  1961  to  716 thousand per month in  1963.  For

cargo  discharged the figures were  1,117  thousand

tons per month for 1962 and 1,206 thousand tons for

1963.  There  was  a 15 per cent  increase  in  the

registration  of  new motor-cars,  a  16  per  cent

increase in the registration of new trucks, and  45

per  cent  increase in the registration  of  motor-cycles and scooters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can quote many other figures, but I think

I  have established the point - which will not be in

serious dispute - that up to Malaysia Day Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



appeared to be heading for an unprecedented rate of

economic  expansion.  While Malaysia  gave  us  our

independence,  it  also brought in  its  train  the

hostility   of  our  neighbour,  the  Republic   of

Indonesia.   After  the  severance  of   diplomatic

relations  between  the  two  countries,  Indonesia

decided to suspend trade relations as well.



<br><br><i>Indonesian Confrontation</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision of the Indonesian Government to

suspend trade relations with Malaysia was motivated

by   political  considerations  arising  from   her

hostility  towards the establishment  of  Malaysia.

This  policy  stems from a fear that a  progressive

and prosperous Malaysia may have, from her point of

view, an undesirable impact on some islands of  the

Indonesian Archipelago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to understand the full implications of

Indonesia's  confrontation,  it  is  necessary   to

examine the traditional Indonesian attitude towards

trade  with  Malaysia, particularly her trade  with

Singapore which forms the bulk of this trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian Government had for more than a

decade looked with suspicion and resentment at  the

volume  of  Indonesian  goods  which  were  handled

through the port of Singapore on their way  to  the

markets  of  the world. The imports  concerned  are

principally tropical produce such as rubber, copra,

coffee,  rattan, pepper, timber and other  products

grown  or cultivated in the islands of Sumatra  and

in  South  Kalimantan. These products are grown  in

the  hinterland of these two territories  and  they

find their way to the river ports, from whence they

are   transported  in  small  coastal  vessels   to

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The logistics of the situation make these

Indonesian territories dependent on external  lines

of  sea  communications for the movement  of  these

products.   Singapore,  because  of   its   central

position,  serves as the central market  for  these

products.  Further, there is not only the  question

of  physical  transportation but also the  need  to

process and grade these products to conform to  the

requirements of the world market. And,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>



of  course,  a substantial and complex  network  of

business and financial relations grew up to support

and  sustain  the  trade.  The  trade  is  of  long

standing,  its origin going back virtually  to  the

founding of Singapore in 1819.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is to be expected that with the foundation of

the  Republic of Indonesia in 1949, a review of her

traditional marketing pattern must take place.  New

Nationalist  Governments, for good or bad  reasons,

strive  to be self-sufficient in economic  matters.

It is not unexpected that the Indonesian Government

would  take  a  series of measures by which  direct

trading  contacts will be made between the Republic

and   the  rest  of  the  world  thereby  bypassing

Singapore. For example, the best grades  of  rubber

such  as R.s.s. 1 and R.s.s. 2 were not allowed  to

be  exported direct to Singapore. Only  the  poorer

grades  were  permitted. Similarly, the Indonesians

imposed  a ban on the export of copra from Sulawesi

to  Singapore.  We  could only  obtain  copra  from

Sumatra  and the neighbouring islands on  a  barter

basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian Government continued the agreement

of 1947 concluded between the Dutch and the British

Governments  whereby the proceeds of  exports  from

Indonesia through Singapore could be made available

to   the  Indonesian  Government  in  the  form  of

convertible U.S. dollars. In the immediate post-war

years when sterling was a soft currency and subject

to rigid exchange control, this was of considerable

advantage  to  Indonesia. So  long  as  the  rupiah

remained  a  stable  currency  there  would  be  no

particular  difficulty for Indonesia to obtain  her

full  proceeds of foreign exchange earnings.  When,

however,   the  financial  position  in   Indonesia

deteriorated as a result of inflationary  practices

adopted by the Government, the rupiah weakened  and

inducement  to  export  capital  through  non-legal

channels became increasingly greater. One method by

which  capital can be exported without the  consent

of  the authorities is through the foreign trade by

over-invoicing and under-invoicing of  imports  and

exports   respectively.  So   a   growing   concern

developed in Indonesia over her foreign trade with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>



Malaya  and with Singapore in particular in  regard

to  foreign exchange losses. Matters came to a head

following  the  PRRI revolt in  Sumatra  and  other

islands  of  Indonesia in 1958. The rebel  movement

exported  large  quantities  of  rubber  and  copra

through  Malaysian  ports  for  which  the  Central

Government received no payment in foreign exchange.



<br><br><i>Indonesian Trade Agreement, 1961</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the P.A.P. Government assumed office in

1959,   it   was  obvious  that  the  question   of

normalising trade relations with Indonesia  had  to

be accepted as being of great urgency. Accordingly,

one  of  the  first acts of the Government  was  to

approach  the Indonesian Government for discussions

on  normalisation  of trade relations.  Previously,

the  Colonial administration had taken the attitude

that   the  safeguarding  of  Indonesia's   foreign

exchange was entirely a matter for the Republic and

that  Singapore  could not be held responsible  for

breaches    of   customs   and   foreign   exchange

regulations through activities originating  at  the

Indonesian end.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Government adopted a more realistic

and  more  sympathetic approach to the problem.  We

took   cognizance  of  the  fact  that  substantial

leakages  occurred and that we should do everything

that  lay  within our power to reduce or  eliminate

these  leakages. The Indonesian Government had  all

along pressed for strict control measures and their

attitude was made clear as far back as 1955 when  a

Singapore trade mission visited Jakarta.  The  same

demands were made in 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain difficulties, however, stood in the way

of  accepting the full proposals of the  Indonesian

Government.  First,  if Singapore  were  to  impose

complete control over her entrepot trade this would

not  be  of  value to Indonesia if it  led  to  the

diversion  of the entrepot trade from Singapore  to

other  ports  of  Asia.  Control  measures  of  the

stringency that the Indonesians had in mind  to  be

effective   had   to   be   mounted   through    an

international agreement with several governments.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 74</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indonesian officials proposed an extensive

regime  of control including joint customs patrols,

complete  examination  of  cargoes,  licensing   of

traders  and so forth. It was pointed out  to  them

that  the customs administration in Singapore  does

not  have  the capacity to mount the controls  that

were  sought. Further, such controls may  have  the

effect of completely paralysing Singapore's trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We put forward a counter proposal which, if

accepted,   would  go  a  long   way   to   solving

Indonesia's  problem of foreign exchange  leakages.

Briefly,  the  basic object of our  scheme  was  to

eliminate   any  advantage  which  the   Indonesian

exporter   would  have  to  contravene  Indonesia's

foreign  exchange  regulations,  and  to  give  the

exporter  adequate incentive to accept  payment  in

rupiahs  in  Indonesia while delivering the  export

proceeds   of  hard  currency  to  the   Indonesian

exchange  control. This was to be  done  under  our

scheme by the issue to the Indonesian exporter of a

counter-import certificate to the value of  60  per

cent of the products exported. These counter-import

certificates  could be used to import  freely  from

Singapore  the consumer goods which were  in  short

supply in Indonesia. These would fetch a high price

in  the free market and the exporter would then  be

able   to  make  substantial  profits  either  from

importing  these  commodities  themselves   or   by

selling  the counter-import certificates  to  other

businessmen  in  Indonesia.  The  prices  of  these

certificates   would  then  be   related   to   the

profitability of imports and this, in  turn,  would

reflect   the  relative  scarcities  of  goods   in

Indonesia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our proposed scheme, the Indonesian

exporter  would be reimbursed with 40 per  cent  of

the  value of Indonesian exports to Singapore,  the

balance  of  60  per  cent will  be  held  back  in

Singapore  banks and this will be used to  pay  for

purchases  made from Singapore. In return Singapore

will  mount  the necessary controls to ensure  that

there are no leakages. Regrettably, the scheme that

we   outlined   to   the  Indonesians   was   found

unacceptable  on the grounds that the  question  of

incentives



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>



to  their  exporters was a matter  solely  for  the

Indonesian  Government to decide. As  a  matter  of

interest,   in  late  1962,  when  the   Indonesian

Government  introduced measures  to  stabilise  the

rupiah  they  adopted  a scheme  of  counter-import

certificates not dissimilar to the one that we have

proposed  to  them.  However, these  measures  were

related to Indonesian exports in general and  there

was   no  particular  tie  up  with  the  Singapore

exchange control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our inability to accept the

control  measures proposed by the  Indonesians  and

the  inability  of the Indonesians  to  accept  our

counter-proposals,  the trade agreement  which  was

signed  between the two governments  in  1961  left

these  matters  open. The agreement  sets  out  the

general objectives to be pursued in trade relations

between  the  two  countries and  both  Governments

agreed  to endeavour, within the limits of its  own

laws,  to assist in putting the trade on a  healthy

basis.  On  Singapore's part,  we  urged  upon  our

merchants  the  necessity for correct  transactions

and,  in  certain  cases, assisted  the  Indonesian

exchange control in prosecuting certain cases where

violations  of  Singapore's laws  had  concurrently

taken place. The trade agreement was the best  that

could  be  reached  at  that  time  and  under  the

circumstances  then prevailing.  It  led  to  rapid

growth  of trade between the two countries both  in

regard to import and export.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, our imports of rubber, by far the

most important commodity, showed an increase : -



<pre>

                1960               285,000 tons

                1961               332,000 tons

                1962               375,000 tons

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our exports, consisting of rice and foodstuffs,

textiles, building materials and other consumer

goods also increased. In money terms they were: -



<pre>

                1960              $ 121 million

                1961              $ 194 million

                1962              $ 293 million

</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1962, i.e. last year, the earnings of our

import and export trade with Indonesia had been  of

great value to us. The earnings on trade alone  are

estimated at $184 million in 1962, while



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>



our  ships earn another $25 million, making a total

of  $209  million. This represents 8.7 per cent  of

our national income of that year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July this year, in view of worsening relations

between  the Governments of Indonesia and Malaysia,

the  Government undertook a study of  the  possible

impacts of the suspension of trade between the  two

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies are still continuing to assess the

effects of economic confrontation, Apart from  loss

of earnings and a net reduction of national income,

the  employment  situation is also  affected.  Some

8,200  workers directly affected by cutting off  of

supplies of rubber and other produce and the laying

up of ships may eventually lose their jobs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest available figures show that 901

workers   and   seamen  are  on  the   Government's

emergency  scheme whereby employers and  Government

each pay one-third of the worker's normal wages.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course Indonesia cannot escape the economic

consequences  of  her  own  policy.   Her   foreign

exchange earnings which are already in a precarious

state  will  be  further reduced by  suspension  of

exports  to Singapore. The withdrawal of Singapore-based

ships  from Indonesian waters has  caused  a

severe dislocation in the Indonesian transportation

system. This has resulted in an accumulation of raw

materials at Indonesian ports and an acute shortage

of  rice and other imported consumer goods.  It  is

common  knowledge  that  the  immediate  impact  of

economic  confrontation has brought  about  greater

disarray  on  the  Indonesians themselves  than  on

their  adversaries.  Food prices  have  doubled  or

more,  prices of their export goods have  declined,

and in the free market the price of rupiah weakened

considerably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as our own position is concerned, the

severance  of trade between Indonesia and ourselves

has  brought  about  an adverse  situation.  It  is

important that we see this position in its  correct

perspective. The loss of income at the rate of $209

million  a  year  or 8.7 per cent of  the  national

income represents a severe blow to our economy  and

it is no use for anyone to pretend that this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>



is  a trivial matter. Having said this, I also want

to make it clear beyond all doubt that severance of

trade  with  Indonesia  will  not  bring  about  an

economic collapse in Singapore or anything remotely

approaching it. Severe though its effects are,  the

economy  of  Singapore is in a sufficiently  robust

state to ride confrontation. I shall deal with this

aspect in more detail after I have made a review of

Singapore's economic growth in the last few years.



<br><br><i>Economic Defence</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to turn now to the more immediate and

pressing  problems  created by  this  severance  of

trade.  The  Singapore Government had decided  upon

certain  measures once the confrontation policy  of

the  Indonesian Government has been assessed by  us

as being likely to be of long duration. The earlier

studies  made  in July indicated the need  to  take

positive  counter-measures, particularly to  combat

unemployment.  The  first  step  was  therefore  to

ensure that those who are more severely hit by  the

trade suspension and who are most vulnerable to its

effects  should  be given a measure of  protection.

These are the seamen on ships on the Indonesian run

and workers who are directly employed in industries

which  process  the  raw  materials  imported  from

Indonesia and whose supplies are now cut off. These

are  the  rubber mills, rubber packing and  grading

establishments, coconut oil mills, sago  factories,

processing  of  coffee, rattan. In all  121  firms,

including  shipping firms, are  affected  and  they

give  a total employment of 10,800. As I have  said

before, some 8,200 will eventually be laid  off  as

stocks of raw materials get exhausted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier this afternoon, I introduced two Bills to

give  legal authority for the measures to be  taken

to   protect   workers  affected   by   the   trade

suspension. At the Second Reading of these Bills  I

shall  go  into greater detail into their contents.

Here  I  shall  confine  myself  to  their  general

nature. The first Bill, the Economic Defence  Bill,

allows a worker laid off as a result of closure  of

his factory to receive 6 months' income at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>



two-thirds  his  normal earnings.  This  scheme  is

already in operation on a voluntary basis with  the

full  co-operation  of  employers  and  responsible

trade union leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payments made by the Department of Economic

Defence  to workers are intended to tide them  over

for a period of time during which, if confrontation

is  not  called off, it would be necessary to  find

these  workers  some other suitable employment.  To

achieve this with the minimum amount of dislocation

to  business and the minimum delay to the  workers,

it  is necessary for the Government to have certain

powers  to  direct  employment.  These  powers  are

sought  in  the  Economic  Defence  (Direction   of

Employment) Bill, the second Bill to be  introduced

on this subject.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction of employment is a novelty in

Singapore.  The Government is aware of the  dangers

of   misuse  of  authority  in  the  direction   of

employment.  I wish to assure the public  that  the

utmost  care  will  be  taken in  implementing  the

provisions   of  the  Bill  to  ensure   that   the

industries absorbing the workers laid off will  not

be  injured  or rendered inefficient by  having  to

employ  an  unsuitable  working  force.  There  are

sufficient safeguards in the Bill for the rights of

both  employers  and employees. But  basically  the

operation   will  succeed  only  by  sensible   co-operation

between  all parties concerned,  labour,

employers  and the Government, with the  object  of

working the scheme successfully. I shall deal  with

these  matters in more detail at the Second Reading

of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an ancillary to these emergency measures, the

Government   intends   to   expand   the   training

facilities  now  available in the State.  For  some

time,  this  subject has been under  consideration,

but  it has been made all the more urgent under the

impact  of  confrontation  when  large  numbers  of

workers   may  have  to  be  re-deployed   to   new

employment  for  which they must be given  adequate

training.  Apart from this, the expansion  of  some

industries has already been retarded by the lack of

adequate  numbers  of suitable  grades  of  skilled

labour. The shipbreaking industry in Singapore, for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>



instance,  is  unable  to  expand  because  of  the

shortage  of  certain  grades  of  workers  and   a

training programme has now commenced to train these

grades of workers.



<br><br><i>Assistance to Businessmen</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two measures I described will be sufficient,

for  the  time  being at any rate, to  protect  the

interest   of   the   workers.  The   interest   of

businessmen  must  also  be  considered.   I   have

discussed  a  plan with officers  of  the  Economic

Development Board whereby special arrangements will

be  made  to make it easy for owners and management

of  establishments affected by the confrontation to

gain  an  entry  into the new industries  that  are

being planned for Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scheme has three aspects. The first covers

equity   participation  in  some  large  industrial

enterprises which have been planned by the Economic

Development  Board  and are in  various  stages  of

implementation.  The  industries  include  a  sugar

refinery,  a fertiliser plant, a solvent extraction

plant,   an   iron   ore   loading   terminal   and

benefication  plant,  a grain silo  operation,  the

Jurong shipyard and others. The total share capital

in  these projects exceeds $65 million. It will  be

possible to reserve a portion of the share  capital

for   subscription  by  owners  of   establishments

affected  by  the  trade suspension.  The  Economic

Development   Board  itself  will   be   a   direct

participant in most of these enterprises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a number of small promising

industries which have been carefully studied by the

Economic Development Board. These include a bicycle

assembly  and  manufacturing plant, a  fruit  juice

cannery,  meat processing, manufacture of preserved

ginger,  mosquito  coils, building  hardware,  fire

crackers,   plastics,  automobile  components   and

others.  In  most  cases,  the  capital  investment

ranges  from  $100,000  to $500,000.  The  Economic

Development   Board  will  provide  technical   and

managerial   assistance   in   establishing   these

industries.  However, the businessmen who  wish  to

participate in these enterprises should be prepared

to  give  their full attention to both the planning

and operation of these enterprises. They



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>



should   contribute  not  only   money   but   also

management.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, some of the businessmen affected may

wish  to pool their resources together and form  an

industrial  investment company to undertake  equity

participation  in  industrial  enterprises  and  to

promote  new  industries. The Economic  Development

Board  is  prepared to provide technical assistance

in the organisation of such a new project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly all the firms affected by confrontation

are  local businessmen. Their establishments  range

from  small-sized grading and processing plants  to

substantial  industrial  undertakings.  We   should

remember  that just over twelve years ago  Hongkong

experienced  a  similar need  to  re-orientate  her

economy from a purely trading port to an industrial

economy.  The  success which Hongkong  achieved  in

effecting  this  change has been a spectacular  one

and  there  is no reason why we in Singapore,  with

the  advantage  of  a  protected  Malaysian  common

market, cannot do even better. The businessmen  now

affected  by confrontation are in a better position

than their Hongkong counterparts were a decade ago.

They  have  the  advantage of  positive  Government

assistance   and  the  services  of  an   effective

industrial  promotion agency. I  shall  be  holding

meetings  with  them  shortly to  discuss  in  more

detailed  and concrete terms the general  proposals

which I have outlined to the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interests of our local shipping companies

also deserve protection. Various possible ways  are

being investigated with a view to ensuring that the

ships  which used to ply in Indonesia are not  laid

up too long.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the measures of economic defence which

the  Government is taking in the face of Indonesian

confrontation.  What  the  Indonesians  have   done

amounts to waging economic war on Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot watch passively any action that is

being  or will be undertaken by any foreign country

which  assists Indonesia in pursuing her policy  of

economic confrontation to our detriment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  is  a free and open market  to  all  the

industrial  countries  in  the  world.  The   large

industrial  countries  have  an  export  market  in

Singapore  of $300 million a year or more.  Even  a

small  country  like Holland has an  export  market

here of $70 million a year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian market is more than twice this. Any

profit  which  the businessmen of  these  countries

hope  to  obtain by assisting Indonesia  either  by

supplying  ships or by direct purchases  of  rubber

and  other  tropical produce for re-export  and  by

managerial  and  technical  assistance  to  achieve

these  ends  can only be marginal. It would  derive

from  the margin between low prices of produce  now

accumulating  in  Indonesian ports  and  the  world

prices for these products. These countries will  do

well to balance the possible profits from hazarding

into Indonesia against the earnings which they  now

enjoy  from  their  established  export  market  in

Singapore. They should not sacrifice a bird in  the

hand for half in the bush.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we find that any country which now enjoys a

thriving export market in Singapore goes out of her

way   to   assist   Indonesia   in   her   economic

confrontation  of Malaysia, then we shall  have  to

take steps to ensure that such action does not pay.

This will be done by closing our markets to exports

from  these  countries. The goods  will  be  placed

under  a  system of specific licensing and  may  be

banned.  The interest of our own local traders  who

have  links with that country will be protected  by

allowing  them  the  quota of imports  of  licensed

commodities, provided these goods are imported from

any other country.



<br><br><i>Financial Position, 1963</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to a review of the financial position

in  1963.  There  arc  two  special  points  to  be

mentioned:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) Expenditure for the first half of this year

was met from a vote on account: and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the apportionment of certain revenues and

expenditure



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



between  the  Central  Government  and   the

State after Malaysia Day on 16th September.





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the expenditure by a vote on account, there is

nothing  much  to comment, except that  I  wish  to

mention   that   no   special   difficulties   were

encountered.  All  Ministries by judicious  control

over  expenditure managed to keep within the limits

allowed them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Malaysia Day, the Central Government is

responsible  for  the  expenditure  of  Departments

dealing  with Federal matters. Certain revenues  on

the  other hand are apportioned between the Central

Government  and the State on the basis  of  40  per

cent  and 60 per cent. As an interim measure  until

the end of the year, the State continues to pay for

the  expenditure  of  the  Federal  Departments  in

Singapore on behalf of the Federal Government, from

the  portion  of  revenues that is payable  to  the

Central Government.



<br><br><i>Malaysia Arrangements</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrangements for the collection of National

Revenue   in  Singapore  since  Malaysia   Day   in

accordance   with  agreed  Financial   Arrangements

recorded  in Annex J to the Malaysia Act have  been

proceeding   smoothly.  By  that   Agreement,   all

National  Revenues  collected  in  Singapore,  with

certain exceptions, were to be paid into a separate

fund  in  a  branch  of  the  Central  Bank  to  be

established in Singapore. This fund would  then  be

divided  in the proportion of 60 per cent  to  the

Singapore Government and 40 per cent to the Federal

Government.   Unfortunately,   owing   to   various

factors,  these arrangements could not  be  brought

into  operation this year. However, by means of  an

agreed  Federal Revenues (Singapore)  Order,  1963,

made by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong under Article 112

E  of  the  Federal Constitution, National Revenues

were  collected  by the Singapore  Government.  The

State   Government  then  paid   to   the   Federal

Government  the  difference between the  Federation

share  of  the revenue collected, which is  40  per

cent,   and  the  actual  expenditure  on   Federal

Departments in Singapore. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



difference is remitted to the Federal Government at

the end of each month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated expenditure on Federal Departments

in  Singapore has been of the order of $5.5 million

per month since Malaysia Day. The average estimated

monthly  share of revenue accruing to  the  Federal

Government  has been about $8 million. The  average

balance   of  about  $2.5  million  per  month   is

therefore due to the Federal Government since  16th

September, 1963. By the end of this year, a sum  of

$9.25  million  would  have  been  payable  to  the

Federal  Government  as  a  consequence  of   these

arrangements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Revenue and Expenditure Estimates for 1963

were  prepared  without  taking  into  account  the

apportionment    with   the   Central    Government

consequent  on  Malaysia,  I  shall  for  ease   of

comparison  deal with the expenditure  and  revenue

for 1963 as though no change had occurred.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key-note for 1963 as far as possible was to

maintain  services as they were in anticipation  of

merger  arrangements.  Revenue  has,  nevertheless,

exceeded  the  estimates by $44.5  million.  $454.2

million  of  both  State and National  Revenue  was

actually  collected  when  we  expected  to  obtain

$409.7 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from an un-anticipated sum of $25 million

transferred  to revenue on account of City  Council

assets  which  came to Government as  a  result  of

integration,  a  further $10 million  was  received

from  the British Government in respect of holdings

of  State Land by the U.K. Government in Singapore.

Generally  good  economic  conditions  account  for

increases  in revenue, which reflect the growth  of

the  economy rather than the results of any  change

in taxation policy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The collection of Income Tax exceeded

expectations  by  $4 million. Property  Tax,  Stamp

Duty  and  Estate Duty taken together yielded  $5.2

million in excess of estimates, Duties collected by

the  Customs Department exceeded estimates by  $4.3

million. There was a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



modest increase of $600,000 in Entertainment Duty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other notable increases are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) services rendered by the Government - $2.5 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) Interest on Investment - $3.6 million.



<br><br><i>1963 Expenditure</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expenditure for the year is expected to come to

$611  million.  This  includes  transfers  to   the

Development  Fund of $230 million  and  $9  million

being  the balance mentioned above which is payable

to  the  Central Government. By deducting the  City

Council surplus and the $10 million U.K. grant from

revenue and capital transfers from expenditure, the

revenue for the year will stand at $419 million and

expenditure  at $381 million, giving a  surplus  of

$38  million  to the State. Together  with  the  $9

million  payable  to  the Central  Government,  the

surplus of current revenue over current expenditure

amounts  to $47 million, as compared with a surplus

of  $97.1  million  last year.  This  fall  in  the

surplus  of $50 million, in spite of the fact  that

revenue  has increased by roughly $11 million  over

the  previous  year, reflects  the  steep  rise  in

expenditure of $60 million. This rise is partly due

to  the  expansion  of services especially  in  the

field  of  Education, Police and Defence,  and  the

establishment  of  Television.  Excluding   capital

transfers  the total expenditure for  the  year  is

expected  to  fall short of the original  estimated

sum of $381.7 million by about $9 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short fall in expenditure of $9 million is

very  much smaller than in previous years. This  is

partly  due to more careful estimating. Expenditure

for  most  of  the Heads is expected to  come  very

close to the amounts estimated. The only Heads that

show  substantial savings are Head 13 - Ministry  of

National  Development, Head 18 - Hospitals Division,

and  Head  34  - Ministry of  Culture.  The  savings

occurring  in the Ministry of National  Development

are   mainly  due  to  under-expenditure  on  Work

Brigade  projects.  The savings  of  the  Hospitals

Division and the Ministry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



of  Culture are due to the usual reasons,  which  I

have explained in previous years, partly because of

over  estimation and partly because  certain  posts

were not filled for the whole year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Heads where expenditure is expected to exceed

the  original  Estimates are Head 21  - Ministry  of

Finance,  Head 22 - Charge on Account of the  Public

Debt, and Head 39 - Social Welfare. The increase  in

expenditure under Ministry of Finance is due to the

transfer  of  an additional $200 million  from  the

Consolidated  Fund to the Development  Fund  and  a

transfer  of  an expected sum of $9 million,  being

balance   of   revenue  payable  to   the   Central

Government. The increase under Charge on Account of

the   Public  Debt  is  because  of  sinking   fund

contributions and interest on new loans floated  in

1963.  The  rise  in Social Welfare expenditure  is

caused  by  an  increase in public  assistance  and

expansion in Community Associations.



<br><br><i>1964 Estimates of Expenditure</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1964 the number of Heads of Expenditure is

reduced  from  57  in  1963 to 40  because  certain

departments     which    fall     under     Federal

responsibilities  in Malaysia no longer  appear  in

the    State   estimates.   The   estimated   total

expenditure for these 40 Heads including a  capital

transfer of $16 million to the Development Fund  is

$326.4 million. Excluding the capital transfer  the

estimates of expenditure amount to $310.4 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say a few words on the general lay-out of

the  Estimates of Expenditure now before the House.

At  the cover page, I have introduced an innovation

in   classifying   expenditure   under   the   main

functional  heads. A classification of  revenue  is

also  attempted. Members will at once  notice  that

the  bulk  of our expenditure is now on the  Social

Services.  Two-thirds of the  $300-odd  million  we

will  be  spending next year will be on the  Social

Services. Our function is to see that our  children

get  the best possible education, that our citizens

are usefully employed on good



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



conditions,  that the sick are adequately  treated,

and  that the families of our citizens are decently

housed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1963 Estimates for these 40 Heads of

Expenditure less capital transfer amount to  $306.5

million.  The total likely to be spent in  1963  is

$299.6  million.  The increase in  1964  over  1963

estimates  is  small, although  compared  with  the

amount  likely  to  be spent in 1963  there  is  an

increase of approximately $11 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small difference between 1963 and 1964

estimates is due to an attempt in 1964 to determine

only  what will be actually required and to provide

for this only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the estimates have been trimmed of all

margins,  it  is  likely  that  certain  Heads   of

Expenditure may require supplementary provisions in

the  course  of  the  year if unforeseen  items  of

expenditure  should occur. The Head of  Expenditure

that  will  almost  definitely  require  additional

funds   in  1964  is  the  Ministry  of  Education,

although  it  has  the lion's share  of  the  total

expenditure for the year. The sum of $94.85 million

provided under this Head is almost one-third of the

total  estimates of expenditure. Included  in  this

sum  is  a vote of $8.5 million as contribution  to

the  University  of Singapore.  This  vote  may  he

increased  depending on the outcome of  discussions

that will take place between the University and the

Government.   Nothing   has   been    entered    as

contribution  to  the Nanyang University.  This  is

because  certain related matters  have  yet  to  be

settled.  Once  the  difficulties  are  cleared,  a

substantial   sum   will  have  to   be   provided.

Supplementary provisions are therefore likely to be

required in 1964 in respect of these two items.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the 40 Heads of Expenditure, the estimates of 17

Heads are smaller than their 1963 provisions. Of

the rest, whose estimates show a rise, only Head 22

- Charge  on  Account of the Public  Debt,  Head  24

- Contributions and Charitable Allowances, and  Head 19 - Public   Health  Division,

show   substantial

increases. The increases of the rest are small  and

are due to normal expansion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>1964 Revenue</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to 1964 Revenue. The revenue estimates

for  1964  have  been prepared separately  for  the

State shown on pages 17 to 36 of the 1964 Estimates

and  for National Revenue shown as Appendices A and

B on pages 331 to 341 of the 1964 Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revenue estimates for 1964 are based on

actual  revenue realised provisionally in  1963  on

the assumption that the general economic conditions

existing  in  the State in 1963 will continue.  The

pattern  of  distribution of  revenue  between  the

different taxes in the 1964 estimates is  the  same

as for 1963.



The  total State Revenue for 1964 amounts to $326.7

million  including  the  State  share  of  national

revenue  which  is  60  per cent  of  all  National

Revenue collected in Singapore. This is expected to

amount   to  $175.6  million.  The  total  National

Revenue  for  1964 will probably amount  to  $292.7

million. Of this, 60 per cent by agreement will  be

paid to the State, leaving an estimated balance  of

$117  million to be paid to the Federal  Government

for  1964.  The total combined State  and  National

Revenue  for  1964  amounts to $443.8  million.  As

compared  with  the  Estimated  Revenue  for   1963

amounting  to $409.7 million, the 1964  revenue  is

increased by $34.1 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main increases in the State revenue will be

obtained  from the following sources: Property  Tax

$8.2 million, Other Services $3.21 million, Arrears

of   Contribution  by  the  Federal  Government  on

account   of  expenditure  on  the  University   of

Singapore $8 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main increases in respect of National Revenue

are with Income Tax $6 million, Selective Sales Tax

$2.1  million,  Import Duties $6.8  million,  Motor

Vehicle  Road  Tax $1.2 million, Property  Transfer

Tax $2 million, Other Services $1.4 million.



<br><br><i>1964 Revenue Proposals</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now deal with the 1964 Revenue proposals. The

main change in the revenue pattern next year over

this year is an increase of 10 cents per gallon in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



the  customs duty on motor and aviation spirit  and

other petroleum having a flash point of below 73�F.

In  Singapore the full rates and excise  rates  are

$1.20  per  gallon. In the Federation the  rate  is

$1.30.  As  a  first step to the  harmonization  of

duties with Malaysia, which is to be carried out in

accordance with the provisions of the Agreement  on

Common Market and Financial Arrangements in Annex J

to the Malaysia Act, the concurrence of the Federal

Government,   which  is  responsible  for   customs

duties,  has been obtained to amend these rates  in

the  Customs (Duties) Order, 1962. This will  yield

an  additional total of $3.2 million by next  year.

Of  this  amount, $1.9 million or 60 per cent  will

accrue to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Government will make two

concessions in the new year. Despite our efforts to

provide  large  numbers  of  low-cost  housing   as

quickly   as  possible,  many  people  for  various

reasons  are  still living in attap  dwellings.  In

January  1963  the  property tax on  owner-occupied

houses  in the 36 per cent rating area was  reduced

to  27  per  cent  as an initial  concession.  With

effect  from 1st January, 1964, the tax  burden  on

owner-occupied  attap  dwellings  will  be  further

reduced  to  a concessionary flat rate  of  $6  per

owner-occupied house per annum. This  will  mean  a

fall  in the State revenue for this item but, as  I

stressed  in  my  Budget speech  last  year,  these

properties  do not enjoy the benefits  like  roads,

lighting,   water,  electricity,   that   permanent

dwellings invariably do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, for some time professional boxing in

Singapore  has been in the doldrums. Promotions  of

good  fights  have been few and far between.  Those

interested  in  the sport claim that  entertainment

duty  on professional boxing has been far too high.

It  is  33�  per cent of ticket money collected  in

Singapore, while the duty up-country is half of the

Singapore  rate.  To  give  the  sport  a   fillip,

entertainment duty on professional boxing  will  be

reduced to 15 per cent with effect from next  year.

So  that  as  many people as possible may  see  and

enjoy  this sport, arrangements will be  made  with

the  boxing  promoters for Television Singapura  to

obtain rights to film

without  charge  the fights for re-broadcasting  on

T.V.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Review of State Development Plan, 1961-63</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, before I deal with the Development plans for

1964,  I  wish to present to the Assembly a general

review  of  progress achieved in the State's  Four-Year

Development Plan. The end of this  year  will

mark  the  three-quarter stage  of  this  Plan  and

members  of  this Assembly as well as the  general

public  will undoubtedly be interested in a  review

of progress so far achieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I proceed in detail, I should perhaps

explain  that the Four-Year Plan relates to capital

expenditure in the public sector. That is  to  say,

it  covers  the development projects of  the  State

Government,  the  Statutory  Boards,  namely,   the

Harbour  Board,  the  Public Utilities  Board,  the

Housing  and  Development Board  and  the  People's

Association.   It   does   not   include    private

development expenditure as, in an open economy like

ours,  it is unrealistic to set targets for private

investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to

circulate  to Members a set of tables* standing in my

name which  give details   of   the  performance  of

the   State's Development  Plan.  They  will  assist  Members  to

follow my explanation with greater ease.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Appendix I

<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1963/19631128/19631128-HA-0220109.pdf"">Annual Budget Statement(Cols 0109-0112)</a><br>

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the public sector, a total capital outlay

of  $871  million was envisaged in the plan  period

1961/64 [Table I]. For the period 1961/63, that  is

the  period  under  review, the  plan  estimate  of

public sector capital expenditure was $651 million.

The  actual  expenditure that  is  expected  to  be

incurred  during this period is $516 million.  This

means an achievement of the plan of 79 per cent  of

the target figure. However, if we take into account

that some of the projects originally entered in the

plan have been abandoned or severely modified,  the

rate  of  implementation  is  about  84  per  cent.

Bearing  in mind that some time must elapse  before

the machinery of implementation gets into top gear,

the   rate   of   performance  can  be   considered

satisfactory.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the performance rate of 79 per cent was

achieved  for  the  plan as a whole,  the  rate  of

progress  varied in the principal  sectors  of  the

plan.   These  are  Economic  Development,   Social

Development and Public Administration. The projects

grouped  under  Economic Development  achieved  the

highest rate of performance, namely, 80.9 per cent.

This  means an actual expenditure of $306.4 million

as  against $378.7 million envisaged in  the  plan.

Social Development registered a performance rate of

76.7  per cent; the actual expenditure being $200.4

million  as against a plan total of $261.4 million.

Public  Administration, a small  sector,  shows  an

actual  expenditure of $8.7 million  as  against  a

plan outlay of $11 million, which gives a figure of

79.4 per cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I want to deal with each of the sectors in

some  detail. In the field of Economic  Development

[Table II], projects can be conveniently classified

under   three  main  headings:  namely,  Land   and

Agricultural  Development; Commerce  and  Industry;

and   Transport   and   Telecommunications.   These

projects  are designed to strengthen the sinews  of

our  economy, to increase our earning power and  to

increase  employment opportunities. As  such,  they

were  accorded high priority both for the provision

of personnel resources and of money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Land and Agricultural Development [Table III], the performance was well below the average

for  the  economic  development  sector.  The  main

projects  consist  of  Flood  Alleviation  Schemes,

Rural Development Schemes, Purchase of Land, Animal

Husbandry  and  Station, and equipment  for  public

works.   General  Rural  Development  Schemes   are

progressing on schedule, $1.6 million to  be  spent

as  against  $1.64  million in the  plan  estimate.

These  schemes  have provided more than  250  rural

streets  and kampongs with lights and extension  of

electric   supply.   239  stand-pipes   have   been

installed for rural dwellers. Farmers and fishermen

have  received  extension services in agricultural,

fishing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



and  other veterinary services from seven  centres.

Fertilisers,  technical advice and  other  services

are  also given to farmers and fishermen at  little

or  no  cost  to increase their farming or  fishing

productivity  and  lower the  cost  of  production,

thereby increasing their incomes. Purchase of  land

exceeds  the plan estimates, being $10  million  as

against  $8.8 million. As against these  successes,

the  swamp reclamation schemes hardly got  off  the

ground,  $0.24 million being spent as against  $2.7

million   ear-marked  for  these   schemes.   Flood

Alleviation  is  also  well behind  schedule,  $1.7

million being spent as against the plan estimate of

$9.0  million. This lack of progress is mainly  due

to   the   obstruction  by  squatters   which   was

engineered  and encouraged by pro-Communist  groups

as  part  of  their deliberate policy to  frustrate

development in the State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projects under Commerce and Industry detailed

in Table IV*, show a satisfactory rate of progress,

namely  92.7 per cent. Actual expenditure  incurred

amounted  to  $228.8  million  as  against   $246.7

million  in  the plan. All projects except  two  in

this  sub-division went according  to  schedule  or

even  ahead of it. The two projects behind schedule

are the Kallang project, that is, the filling up of

the  Kallang swamp and utilising reclaimed land for

housing  and industry. Some 380 acres of land  were

planned  to  be  reclaimed. Up to the  present,  40

acres  have been filled. Progress has been retarded

because  of a major change in policy as to how  the

swamps   should   be  filled.  The  original   plan

envisaged the fill to come from one of two sources:

first,  earth  from Paya Lebar and  Changi,  to  be

transported by a miniature railway to Kallang;  or,

second,  the use of sea and river mud to be  pumped

into  the  swamp and held together by a  system  of

polders. Both these methods were rejected in favour

of  fill from the Toa Payoh district. This  is  now

being done by the Housing and Development Board and

the work is progressing satisfactorily.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other project which falls behind the plan

estimate  is  water development. The original  plan

estimate is $54.2 million for the period 1961/64 or

$40  million for the period 1961/63. In fact,  only

$21.9  million  is  expected to be  spent  in  this

period, representing a performance rate of 54.5 per

cent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the Scudai River Water Project is now

under implementation. Progress is being made in the

construction  of the Scudai water works.  Pipelines

measuring  more than four miles have  already  been

laid  to link the source of the water works at  the

Scudai  River in Johore, to distribution  pipes  in

Singapore. The project should be completed by  June

next  year  with  a supply capacity  of  15  to  30

million gallons of water per day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, preliminary work and designs for the

bigger  Johore  River Project have been  completed.

Actual  construction work would  begin  early  next

year.  The  project  should be  completed  in  four

years'  time  with  an initial capacity  to  supply

about  40  million gallons of water  per  day.  250

million  gallons  a  day is claimed  by  the  Water

Engineers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the other projects in the sector went on

schedule  or  exceeded  the targets.  The  Economic

Development Board is now in full swing. The  Jurong

project  is going ahead of schedule. $35.4  million

will  be  spent by the end of this year as  against

the plan estimate of $30 million.



<br><br><i>Jurong industrial Estate</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,040 acres of the Jurong Industrial Estate have

been  levelled and prepared for occupation.  Forty-seven

industrialists  have  been  allotted  sites

covering  380  acres. Another  35  applicants  have

received  tentative allocations of  sites  covering

another 329 acres. Of the remaining 300 odd  acres,

199  acres  are  reserved for public  housing.  220

flats and houses have already been constructed  and

another  3,000 will go up by the end of  1964.  The

remaining  areas are reserved for  or  occupied  by

roads, wharves and drainage canals.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Port facilities for Jurong are also being

developed. Work on the 3,000 feet deep water  wharf

and  the  2,000  feet coastal wharf  costing  $14.5

million  has begun and should be completed  by  the

end of 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach roads to the Jurong Estate, namely

Boon  Lay  Road from Jurong Road, the  Main  Access

Road, Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim from the West Coast Road,

are  almost  completed and are  already  opened  to

traffic.  Within the Estate itself,  ten  miles  of

road  network  together with the required  drainage

have been completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earthworks on the eight-mile railway track from

the  Bukit  Timah  Railway Station  to  the  Jurong

Industrial  Area costing $600,000 is more  than  80

per cent complete.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present phase of Jurong construction is

proceeding satisfactorily. The seven hundred  acres

already  allocated to industry exceeds in size  any

other   industrial   estate   in   Malaysia.    Ten

enterprises are in production or are in an advanced

stage   of   completion.  Another  seventeen   will

commence  construction within six months. By  early

next year, we expect some twenty-five factories  to

be  in production. In addition, the 73 acres and 96

sites in the smaller industrial estates at Redhill,

Tanglin  Halt  and  Jalan Ampat are  fully  booked.

Twenty-eight  factories are in  operation.  Thirty-three  are expected to be in production by the  end

of 1964 and the rest by the middle of 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extension of our power supplies is also

proceeding  satisfactorily. In fact, $75.5  million

have  been  spent as against $55.6 million  planned

for  the  three years 1961/63 giving a  performance

rate  of 135.7 per cent [Table IV]. Members already

know that a World Bank loan of $45 million has been

concluded successfully. The foundation stone of the

new  power  station has recently been laid  by  his

Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan Agong during his  State

visit this month.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The construction of the new power station at

Pasir Panjang is on schedule.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



Orders for two 60 Mw. steam turbo alternator  units

have  already been made. One unit will be installed

by  February 1965, and the other in July  1965,  to

bring  plant  capacity to 120 Mw.  The  demand  for

electricity has been increasing steadily. In  1960,

the  peak  demand was 113.5 Mw.; in  1961,  it  was

128.5  Mw.;  in 1962, it was 139 Mw. and  in  1963,

this year, it was 150 Mw. It is envisaged that  the

peak  demand for electricity would be much  greater

in  the  next  year  and  the  following  5  years,

particularly  due  to the rapid  expansion  of  the

industrial sector. As the new 120 Mw. Pasir Panjang

Power plant would not be ready until 1965, two  new

11.25  Mw. automatic  gas  alternator  units  have

already  been  installed at  the  St.  James  Power

Station to meet the expected increase in demand  in

1964 and early 1965.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 3 years under review, more than $25

million  as compared to the target of $24.1 million

was  spent  to  provide distribution  net  work  of

electrical supply main lines and feeders to various

parts  of  Singapore, especially  to  the  outlying

districts  and  kampongs and the Jurong  industrial

area.  The  total length of electrical cables  laid

during the 3 years measured about 1,000 miles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the expansion of gas supplies, $10.3 million

will  be spent in 1961/63 as against a plan  figure

of   $10.2  million  [Table  IV].  The  number   of

consumers  will increase from 23,000  in  1961,  to

45,000  by the end of 1963. It will reach a  figure

of  57,000 by the end of next year and a new  plant

will  be  necessary  in the  next  plan  period  to

provide the additional gas supplies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport and Communications [Table V] present a

varied  picture of success and set-backs. The  East

Wharf  Scheme  had been completed on  schedule  and

represents  a  valuable extension  to  our  harbour

facilities. The Improvement scheme of the Singapore

River  has  been  abandoned after  an  overall  re-appraisal of port development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the completion of the East Wharf, four new

berths,  measuring 2,500 feet, were  added  to  the

deep



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



water wharves of the Singapore Harbour Board.  Even

with  these  additions there is  still  a  pressing

demand for further wharf facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last three years, the tonnage of vessels

anchored  at the wharves of Singapore has  shown  a

steady  increase; 13.2 million tons in 1960, rising

to 14.2 million tons in 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed to construct another 4 new deep

water  berths measuring over 2,900 ft, at the  East

Lagoon   with   complete  harbour  facilities   and

equipments  to  handle  all  types  of  cargo.  The

project would cost about $44 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civil Aviation is progressing according to plan

[Table  V].  The  extension  to  the  runways,  the

construction   of   the  new   passenger   terminal

building,  and improvement in electronic  equipment

are  progressing  satisfactorily;  they  will  make

Singapore  one  of  the best equipped  airports  in

South-East Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The completed extension of the runway from 8,000

to  9,000  feet  has  made it one  of  the  biggest

runways  in Asia, capable of meeting the  needs  of

all  types  of aircraft including the latest  high-speed  jets.  The  new Passenger Terminal  Building

would be ready for use in April 1964. It would have

a  floor  area  of over 122,000 sq, ft.  The  Main

Concourse,  Transit  Lounge  and  reception  rooms,

covering an area of more than 29,000 sq, ft., would

be  air-conditioned. The Terminal Building would be

ultra modern with three murals in various parts  of

the  building, portraying the cultures of Malaysia,

the  Singapore  Water  Front,  and  the  races  and

religions of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expansion of our telephone system is

progressing  at  a faster rate than  was  expected.

$16.4 million is to be spent in the years 1961  /63

as  against a plan target of $14.1 million.  During

the  three  years under review the  number  of  new

subscribers  increased  by  10,378.  This   is   an

increase from 37,383 lines and subscribers in  1961

to  47,741 subscribers and lines in 1963. Three new

telephone  exchanges were installed  at  Nee  Soon,

Changi and Jurong. They are all in operation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the success stories. As against these,

however, construction of roads, drains and  bridges

is  well behind schedule. Only one-half the  roads,

one-third  the  drains and one-fourth  the  bridges

that  were expected to be constructed have in  fact

been  constructed. The reasons are partly shortages

of   technical   personnel  in  the  Public   Works

Department.  A more important reason has  been  the

difficulties   encountered  in   the   removal   of

squatters. In all $22.3 million was spent on roads,

drains  and  bridges as against a plan estimate  of

$51.7 million. The Ministry of National Development

is  now  making  a  determined  effort  to  improve

performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telecommunications like Posts, and Civil Aviation

are  now  Federal departments. Development  in  the

expansion   of   telecommunications  services   was

retarded    pending    a   merger    between    the

Telecommunications Department and Cable & Wireless.

The Singapore Government had completed an agreement

with  Cable  &  Wireless for such  a  merger.  With

Malaysia  on  the  horizon the  Federal  Government

decided  against  proceeding with the  merger;  and

hence  final  decision on development projects  was

withheld.   Essential   services,   however,   were

proceeded  with  and there was no deterioration  of

efficiency  in  the  services  provided.  In   this

connection  I  wish to mention that the  Round  the

World  Commonwealth Cable scheme was agreed  to  by

all  participating countries and  this  cable  will

have its terminal in Singapore. Work is in progress

in the construction of this terminal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new project introduced in this sector is the

Multi-storey  Car Park, now under  construction  in

Cecil  Street. It will be completed  in  June  next

year. It will be a six-storey building with parking

bays for 700 cars and also bays for motorcycles and

scooters.



<br><br><i>Social Development [Table VI]</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of social development we are

concerned  with public housing and the  development

schemes  of  the Ministries of Culture, Health  and

Education. As I have said earlier, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



actual  performance  has  been  76.7  per  cent  of

planned expenditure, i.e. $200.4 million as against

a plan estimate of $261.4 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of public housing, the performance

of   the   Housing   and   Development   Board   is

acknowledged by everyone to be outstanding. No less

than  $130.3  million had been spent in  the  three

years  as  against  an estimated amount  of  $109.1

million  [Table  VI].  In  terms  of  houses   this

represents completion of 29,550 homes as against  a

plan total of 26,521.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of Culture has embarked on an

expansion  programme,  the  main  items  being  the

establishment of T.V. services and the installation

of  more  powerful sound transmitters. $6.6 million

was spent in the three years as against a plan cost

of $10.7 million. The television service has proved

to be very popular and the technical quality of its

transmission high. By August this year,  more  than

20,000  T.V. licences have been taken out  and  the

number  of sets actually in houses is estimated  at

25,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The performance of the Health expansion schemes

fell  way behind the plan as set out in 1961.  $6.8

million was spent on capital expenditure as against

a  plan  total  of $24 million. The explanation  is

that  the  original plan of the Ministry of  Health

was unrealistic both in relation to staff resources

and  to  the needs of the population, a  number  of

projects had to be abandoned or deferred, including

the    second   District   Hospital.   Nevertheless

expenditure of $6.8 million on new health  projects

resulted  in  valuable  additions  to  the   Health

services  which the citizens of Singapore  can  now

enjoy,  particularly  those  in  the  lower  income

groups.  No  less than eleven Polyclinics,  outdoor

dispensaries and Maternal Health Clinics were built

during   1961/63   and  another  five   are   under

construction.   In  addition  to  this,   extension

projects were commenced at the General and  Thomson

Road  Hospitals.  The expansion in outdoor  medical

service  brought  about  a  severe  strain  on  the

available medical staff, and nurses and doctors had

to work



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



long  and  punishing hours to maintain the enlarged

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 1961/63 the Ministry of Education built 23

Primary schools, nine Grammar/Technical schools and

four  Vocational Commercial schools - or a new school

every  month. Another twenty-six schools are  under

construction  of  which 18 will be  completed  next

year,  or  one  new school every three  weeks.  The

increase in the number of new schools together with

the enlarged output of trained teachers has enabled

the  State to keep pace with population growth.  We

have  now  reached  a stage where  every  child  of

school-going   age   can   receive   free   primary

education, and nearly all of them are, in fact,  so

receiving. The cost of schools constructed  in  the

three  years amounted to $32.5 million  as  against

$73.2  million envisaged in the plan. It  is  clear

that  the targets set out in the plan were much  in

excess of needs and this will be taken into account

when the plan for the next five years, 1965-69,  is

drawn up.



<br><br><i>1964 Development Estimates</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I now turn to the 1964 Development Estimates.

This  will be the last year of the Four Year  Plan.

The  Development Estimates for 1964  is  mainly  to

provide  for  the  continuation  or  completion  of

projects  which I have already described.  As  such

they do not call for further comments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three matters of note. First is the

deletion  of  a number of projects entered  in  the

original  plan.  The  two  Heads  under   which   a

significant number of projects have been deleted or

deferred  are Head D18 Hospital Services  and  Head

D37  Fire Brigade. The second District Hospital has

been deleted from the present plan as also has been

the  second  Maternity Home and  the  Chronic  Sick

Hospital. Similarly all proposed clinics  for  1964

have been deleted. The second District Hospital and

the  Chronic Sick Hospital have never got  off  the

ground. These are matters which may be raised again

in  the  second Five Year Plan or some  other  Five

Year   Plan.  The  Orthopaedic  Hospital  and   the

Radiography   unit,  for  which   there   is   more

justification than



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



the  other  projects, may be reconsidered;  in  the

second  Five  Year Plan. It will  be  necessary  to

assess the availability of doctors when these major

projects are reassessed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassessment of the needs of the Fire Brigade

will  have  to be made, and a criterion established

to  determine  the  number of  new  stations,  fire

fighting  equipment  and  personnel  in  the   Fire

Brigade.  It  appears that the  original  expansion

plans of the Fire Brigade were excessive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of new projects that have been

included in the 1964 Estimates. Customs and Excise,

Head  D26, will need to build new bonded warehouses

to  ensure adequate warehouse space for the storage

of  goods  that  will  be made dutiable  under  the

Malaysian common market.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government Printer will acquire new line

composing  machines to enable a more speedy  output

of  work.  Some  of the machines of the  Government

Printing Office are now more than 20 years old.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head D39 Social Welfare, a sum of $1

million  has been allotted for the construction  of

the Youth Leadership Training Centre. The Centre is

sited  in a former large Community Centre in  Buona

Vista Road. Additional buildings will be needed  to

serve  as dormitories for trainees, a dining  hail,

staff quarters, lecture rooms and other amenities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head D42 we have included estimates of the

cost of development projects of Federal departments

such  as telecommunications and prisons. Under  the

terms  of  the financial arrangements for Malaysia,

Singapore  will  meet  the  full  cost   of   these

development  projects.  These  departments  perform

important services in Singapore and their continued

efficient  operation is vital if we want to  retain

our  status as a well organised and efficient  port

and  training centre in South-East Asia.  The  sums

included in the 1964 Estimates are mainly based  on

the  original  plans for these departments.  It  is

possible that there will be variations or changes



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



in  these items if and when the Federal departments

undertake a re-appraisal of their needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry of National Development will

commence  the work of rebuilding the city in  1964.

Many  houses  in the central areas are decrepit  in

the  extreme and an effort must be made  to  remove

these. City re-development will require some  basic

and  far-reaching changes in Government policy  and

these matters are under urgent consideration. A sum

of  $10  million has been allotted  for  urban  re-development but as the operation proceeds,  we  are

likely   to  require  substantially  larger   sums.

Another  new project of the Ministry is  the  Bedok

Reclamation.  Work has already commenced  and  $1.5

million  is allotted in the estimates for  1964.  A

record  sum  of $76.8 million has been allotted  to

the  Housing  Board next year. In addition  to  the

normal  development projects,  there  is  need  - to

which  I  have referred - to build flats and  houses

for  workers  who  will  be  employed  in  the  new

industries rising in Jurong. $15 million  has  been

provided for this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Head D21, Ministry of Finance, two new

items  appear.  They are the $30 million  loan  for

development  assistance to  Sarawak  and  Sabah  in

accordance   with   the  terms  of   the   Malaysia

agreement. There is also provided $25 million being

the loan which we expect the Public Utilities Board

will  require  in  1964 to finance their  expansion

schemes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has been the impact of the State's

Development Plan on the growth of the economy?  The

expenditure of $500 million over three  years  must

have  an impact on the economic growth. There  are,

of  course,  the visible signs such as new  houses,

roads, street lighting, industrial estates, wharves

and   other   physical  manifestations  of   actual

construction.  Undoubtedly over the  last  four  or

five  years,  there has been a marked  increase  in

economic activity and in the standard of living and

in  general prosperity. In every budget  address  I

have   quoted  in  extenso  figures  of  increased

consumer spending



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



occurring  each  year. But  these  do  not  give  a

comprehensive measure of progress, being  selective

or subjective or both.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best single indicator of economic growth is

provided  in the national income statistics  [Table

VII]*. National income covers the whole  range  of

economic activities undertaken within the country.



<hr size="2" noshade>

* Appendix II.

<br><a  target='_blank'  href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/1963/19631128/19631128-HA-0220109.pdf"">Annual Budget Statement(Cols 0109-0112)</a><br>

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several entities going by the name of

national  income  and  the  one  which  we  use  in

Singapore  is known as the gross domestic  product.

In  non-technical terms, this is the value  of  all

goods  and  services produced within the  territory

during  the  given  period.  These  estimates   are

compiled  each year by the Department of Statistics

and they are reported each year to the Colombo Plan

Conference which assesses progress, or lack of  it,

in the developing countries of Asia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959, our national income was $1,934 million;

in  1960,  $2,020 million; in 1961, $2,307  million

and  in 1962, $2,437 million. Therefore in the four

years,  there  has  been  a substantial  growth  of

national  income  by  26 per cent  and  this  is  a

remarkable achievement by any standard. Most of the

growth  occurred in the years 1962 and  1961  since

the implementation of the State's Development Plan.

It  will be inaccurate, however, to claim that  the

whole  of  this  growth has been due  to  the  Plan

itself. Undoubtedly, the general prosperity brought

about  by  good prices of rubber in the years  1960

and  1961  contributed substantially to our  recent

prosperity.  But without a well conceived  plan  to

channel resources into the desired sectors  of  the

economy,  it  could  well be  that  the  prosperity

generated  by  good rubber prices  in  those  years

would  he  frittered away. This, however,  did  not

happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can be said that the atmosphere of confidence

generated  by  the  sound  financial  and  economic

policies of the Government was also responsible for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



bringing   about   a  larger  volume   of   private

investment and a general increase in trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that not only was there an

increase  in the absolute level of national  income

between  1959  and  1962,  but  there  was  also  a

substantial rise in the per capita national income.

Our  population grew from 1.58 million in  1959  to

1.73  million in 1962, but the growth  of  national

income   outstripped   population   growth   by   a

substantial margin so that the per capita  national

income in 1962 was 14.9 per cent higher than it was

three  years ago. This is a performance  which  has

very  few  equals in under-developed  countries  of

Asia and Africa.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say a few words about estimates of

gross domestic capital formation during the period.

Gross  domestic capital formation is the  value  of

total  investment taking place in the economy  both

for  replacement of used capital assets as well  us

the  construction  or acquisition  of  new  capital

assets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first two years 1959 - 1960, the level

of capital formation was dismally low, being $146.5

million  and $138.5 million. Those were  the  years

when the P.A.P. had just been returned to power  in

the    State's   first   general   elections.   The

uncertainties  of the pre-election period  and  the

nervousness following the election and the  economy

measures  enforced then explain  the  low  rate  of

capital investment. Business confidence was then at

a  low ebb and the State's Development Plan was  in

the  process of preparation. The year  1961  saw  a

turn   of   events  when  gross  domestic   capital

formation  saw a substantial increase  from  $138.5

million  to $226.4 million, an increase of  97  per

cent. The rate was further accelerated in 1962 when

total  investments  in  both  the  Government   and

private sector totalled $247.6 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of percentage of national income, the

rate of gross capital formation in Singapore saw an

increase from 7.6 per cent in 1959 to 10.2 per cent

in 1962. Although this increase is welcome,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



it is still very low for a country with Singapore's

per  capita national income. The paramount need  is

to increase the rate of gross capital formation. In

an  economy which wants to expand its basic  wealth

at  a  fast rate, a target like 20 per cent or more

should  be  aimed at as the rate of  gross  capital

formation.  Nations  which have  recently  achieved

spectacular  expansion rates,  such  as  Japan  and

Australia,   have  attained  a  rate   of   capital

formation of more than 20 per cent of the  national

income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The national income figures and capital formation

figures  for 1963 are of course not available,  the

year not having ended. All the indications are that

the  rate  of  capital formation in  1963  will  be

considerably  larger  than  it  was  in  1962.  The

statistics  on  output  and  imports  of   building

materials  in 1963 show very substantial  increases

over  the  figures for the preceding  year.  It  is

likely  that  the  total investment  in  1963  will

exceed $280 million this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is against the background of economic growth

in  the  last  four years that we must  assess  the

impact  if  Indonesia's economic  confrontation,  a

subject  to which I referred earlier. The  loss  at

the rate of $200 million national income a year  is

a  serious  blow to our economy. If unchecked,  the

ultimate  decline  in our National  Income  may  be

larger  than  this as secondary repercussions  make

their  impact.  We can limit the  extent  of  these

secondary  repercussions by accelerating growth  in

other  sectors. In the immediate future,  there  is

need  to increase Government expenditure on  public

work  projects by stepping up the programme of road

and  drainage construction. Similarly the  building

of  houses  both by private developers and  by  the

Housing  Board,  now already at a  high  tempo,  is

likely  to reach new heights of activity  when  the

Urban Renewal Scheme of the Government gets on  the

way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, however, are the short-term measures. The

permanent and basic remedy lies in the creation  of

new sources of wealth which would generate a steady

stream  of  incomes over future years.  Fortunately

for us, the basic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



groundwork of our industrialisation programme is in

an advanced stage of completion and in the next few

years  we  are going to see the growth of many  new

industries.  The  Common  Market  arrangements  are

likely  to come into force next year and this  will

give an additional impetus.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Board estimates that the

new  industries which are now being established  in

Singapore  will generate by 1965 an additional  $90

to  $100 million National Income a year. The normal

growth  of existing industries may add another  $50

million  by 1965. The industrial sector, therefore,

alone  could fill up more than half the gap  caused

by confrontation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we must not forget our own potential for

economic growth in other sectors. In the last three

years,  the National Income has increased  by  $500

million  and  the  $200  million  direct  loss   of

National  Income caused by Indonesian confrontation

means  that  if  we  could sustain,  in  the  other

sectors of the economy, the rate of growth  of  the

last  three  years, we could make good  the  losses

caused by confrontation in something like two years

or  less.  Of course, if in the meantime  trade  is

restored, then all the better. My view is that some

decline  in the economy is unavoidable in the  next

few  months, but by 1965 we should have  completely

recovered if no other major economic setbacks occur

in   the  meantime.  In  other  words,  Indonesia's

confrontation sets back our time-table of  progress

by two years. This is a severe blow but it does not

add up to a crippling blow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back to the years 1958-59 when political

ebullience  threatened to overwhelm the State,  few

would  have  dared to predict the  robust  rate  of

development that was actually achieved. No  one  in

his  senses in 1959 could have prophesied that four

years   later  merger  with  Malaya  would  be   an

accomplished fact. And not many could have foreseen

the  spectacular  decline in the  fortunes  of  the

Communists and their open front organisations.  Yet

in  the  space  of a bare four years, these  things

were accomplished.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now in Malaysia and our fortunes are

irrevocably  tied  with the rest  of  Malaysia.  We

enter  Malaysia in a strong financial position  and

with  a  stable political background. Confrontation

notwithstanding, the future holds great promise and

opportunity for us and our achievements in the next

four years should exceed those of the last four.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection(2) of

section  490  of  the  Merchant Shipping  Ordinance

(Chapter  207),  resolves that the  Singapore  Port

(Amendment)  Rules. 1963, published as Notification

No.  Sp. S 29 in the Gazette Subsidiary Legislation

Supplement  No.  10  dated 1st November,  1963,  as

contained  in Sessional Paper S.L. 14 of  1963,  be

approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the North-East monsoon last year

considerable congestion was experienced in the more

sheltered western anchorage of our port.  In  April

this  year a committee of Marine officials and port

users  recommended  a  new  layout  of  this   area

designed  to obtain the maximum benefit to shipping

by the avoidance of crowding. These recommendations

are  being included in the Singapore Port Authority

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to redesign the anchorages as

early  as possible during the prevailing North-East

monsoon,  and we cannot wait for the Port Authority

Bill to be passed. I therefore seek the approval of

this House to enable the Singapore Port (Amendment)

Rules,  1963,  to  be brought into operation  which

will  give  effect  to  this rearrangement  of  the

anchorages I mentioned earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (2) of

<div align="center"><b>RECLAMATION (SOUTH QUAY)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj) (on behalf of the Prime Minister)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr

Speaker, I have been asked by the Prime Minister to

move the motion standing in his name, viz.,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly in accordance with section 4

of  the Foreshores Ordinance (Chapter 246) approves

the  reclamation by Government of that  portion  of

the foreshore and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



sea-bed  containing  an area  of  approximately  19

acres  along South Quay as delineated on  the  plan

which is deposited at the Land Office, Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the area to be reclaimed is within the port

limits  of  Singapore and under section  4  of  the

Foreshores Ordinance where the area to be reclaimed

exceeds  5,000  sq, feet,  the  approval  of   the

Legislative   Assembly   is   required   for    the

reclamation.  This  motion,  therefore,  seeks  the

Assembly's approval to enable the Singapore Harbour

Board, as agent of the Government, to reclaim  this

area.  The  area to be reclaimed is  shown  on  the

plan,  a  copy of which is in the Assembly Library,

which  I  had earlier deposited with the Clerk  for

inspection by Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This reclamation is in connection with the

further  development of the East Lagoon  scheme  to

provide  for  four additional berths together  with

ancillary equipment and buildings such as go-downs,

warehouses,  and  so  on. The reclamation  is  also

connected with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



proposals of the Singapore Harbour Board to develop

the  Telok  Ayer Basin which includes the provision

of   a   finger-pier  for  coastal  vessels.   This

reclamation, therefore, is part and parcel  of  the

further  development of the port  area  in  keeping

with our position as the fifth largest port in  the

world.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly in accordance with section 4 of

the Foreshores Ordinance (Chapter 246) approves the

reclamation  by Government of that portion  of  the

foreshore  and  sea-bed  containing  an   area   of

approximately   19  acres  along  South   Quay   as

delineated  on the plan which is deposited  at  the
