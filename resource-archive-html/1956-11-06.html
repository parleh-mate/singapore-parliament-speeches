<div align="center"><b>DETENTION OF MEMBER</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Constitutional position)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Honourable Member for Tanjong

Pagar, in moving the motion standing in his name,

in effect invited me to look into the

constitutional position relating to the detention

of the Honourable Member for Bukit Timah under the

provisions of the Preservation of Public Security

Ordinance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 495</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take it the question uppermost in the hon.

Member's mind is the question of privilege. I had,

of course, already looked into the position.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under subsection (3) , paragraph (e) of section 47

of the Singapore Colony Order in Council, 1955, -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The seat of an Elected or Nominated Member of

the Legislative Assembly shall become vacant -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if he shall be sentenced by a Court in any part

of Her Majesty's dominions to death or to

imprisonment (by whatever name called) for a term

of or exceeding twelve months;".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would therefore appear from that section that

Mr Lim Ching Siong is still a Member of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Member, he has, of course, prima facie, a

right to enter the Assembly and take his seat in

this Chamber. Whether or not his detention

deprives him of that right is debatable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 65 of the Singapore Colony Order in

Council- I quote -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It shall be lawful, by laws enacted under this

Order, to determine and regulate the privileges,

immunities and powers of the Assembly and its

Members; but no such privileges, immunities or

powers shall exceed those of the Commons' House

of Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great

Britain and Northern Ireland or of the Members

thereof."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, as hon. Members know, the Legislative

Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Ordinance, 1955,

and I can only draw the attention of hon. Members

to paragraph (a)  of section 15 of that Ordinance

which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any stranger in respect of the Assembly who -

hinders or obstructs any member of the

Assembly coming to, going from or being within the

Chamber or the precincts thereof

shall be guilty of an offence...".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the House of Commons the detention of a Member

under regulation 18 (b)  of the Defence (General)

Regulations, 1939, made under the Emergency Powers

(Defence) Acts of 1939 and 1940 led to the

Committee of Privileges being directed to consider

whether such detention constituted a breach of the

privileges of the House. The Committee reported

there was no breach of privilege involved.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 496</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law now stands in Singapore, it is not for

me to express any opinion in the matter. The

question is one which will, if raised, have to be

resolved elsewhere.

today's sitting. May I have your assent, Sir,  and

the  consent  of this House to move  a  motion  to

suspend Standing Orders?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Have I the assent of hon. Members?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Members</b>: Aye.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down for

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the proceedings on the business set down for

this  day  be  exempted  from  the  provisions  of

Standing Order No. 7.

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNMENT ACTION UNDER THE BANISHMENT ORDINANCE,THE PRESERVATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4>OF PUBLIC SECURITY ORDINANCE, AND THE SOCIETIES ORDINANCE</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Motion-[5th November, 1956]:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House deplores the further action of

the  Labour Front Coalition Government  under  the

Banishment Ordinance, the Preservation  of  Public

Security  Ordinance,  and the Societies  Ordinance

against    persons   and   organisations   without

producing  any  evidence to justify  its  action." -(Mr Lee Kuan Yew).



<br><br>10.06 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I was saying yesterday

afternoon before the moment of interruption of the

Assembly  at 4 p.m., this House should be reminded

of the election pledges made in 1955. It would, of

course,  be easy for me to snap my fingers  at  my

own election pledges. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 497</b></font><br><br>

voters  can  do nothing, at least until  the  next

election.  Of course, a lot of things  can  happen

before  the  next election comes,  but  I  am  old

fashioned enough to believe that election  pledges

are  solemn  undertakings which must be discharged

to  the  best  of one's ability. If,  having  been

elected, I find that it is necessary to change  my

election  promises, then the only  honourable  and

decent  thing to do is to go back to  my  electors

and  seek  a  new mandate. I would do  this,  Sir,

rather  than  try and explain away those  flagrant

breaches  of  promises  as  honourable   acts   of

patriotism.  This  motion  before  the  House   is

therefore  a  challenge to all elected Assemblymen

whether they intend to stand by their own election

pledges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that there may be a move on the part

of  some  Members  to  amend this  motion.  I  can

understand  such a move. The motion as  it  stands

can  be  an uncomfortable reminder of those  happy

days  when  we made clear to every voter  that  we

were  anti-colonial fighters pure and simple.  Our

election manifestoes and our election speeches are

there to prove what our sentiments were like  then.

It  may be thought that by amending this motion  it

may  be possible to conceal those noble sentiments

which have become embarrassing to some Members  of

this  House, but however much this motion  may  be

amended, our election manifestoes and our election

speeches confront us. However much we may twist and

turn  the  people, remember that  we  went  before

them; we were pledged to fight for freedom against

those  who  had  deprived us  of  it.  During  the

election we made it quite clear to the people that

we  had  to fight the British to get it. I do  not

remember,  Sir,  any Assemblyman  saying  that  it

would  be  necessary to fight subversive elements,

and  yet  two successive sessions of this Assembly

have been devoted to getting this House to approve

the  arbitrary  dissolution of  organisations  and

arrest  of  individuals.  One  can  see  how   the

character  of  this Assembly has  changed  in  the

course  of  the last few months. Until  the  Chief

Minister's unexplained visit to London early  this

year, the fight



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 498</b></font><br><br>



for  merdeka was a straightforward one between the

people of this country and the colonial power. The

majority of speeches made in this House made  this

clear.  The  battle was with the Colonial  Office.

The emphasis was one of a united front of all anti-colonial  parties  and organisations  against  the

forces of colonialism. Now it is a question of the

Colonial  Office, the colonial officials  and  so-called  nationalists in the Labour  Front  joining

together  to  fight  against so-called  subversive

elements  of  the  local  population  to   achieve

merdeka.  But  who  are and  what  are  subversive

elements?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Ask yourself.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> What constitutes

subversion? Is militant trade unionism subversion?

Are systematic and constitutional efforts to bring

about  the  downfall of colonialism and the  local

groups   associated   with   it   subversion?   Is

constitutional  action,  however  embarrassing  to

Government  and  the colonial powers,  subversion?

The  Government has given no clear indication what

it  means  by  subversive elements.  Sometimes  it

claims   that   it  is  proceeding  only   against

Communists and Communist-front organisations,  and

since  the  Malayan Communist Party  is  in  armed

revolt   against   constituted   authority,    the

Government's anti-subversion campaign is  directed

against those connected with the M.C.P. If this is

the  case, then it is important for the Government

to  give  proof that this anti-subversion  is  not

directed against the nationalists dedicated to the

overthrow of colonialism by constitutional  means.

This  the  Government  can do  by  bringing  those

arrested  for  subversion  to  trial  and  proving

conclusively   that   they   were   involved    in

unconstitutional and illegal acts. The  Government

has  claimed  that  it  has documentary  evidence,

which  has  convinced it that those arrested  were

subversive.  If  that evidence  is  sufficient  to

convince the Government, it should be good  enough

for  the courts also. It has been the proud  boast

of   democracy   that,  unlike  the   totalitarian

countries, a man is imprisoned only when proved to

be  guilty  of  a specific crime.  It  is  no  use

praising democracy as a superior way of life  when

it, too, finds it necessary to do



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 499</b></font><br><br>



things  that the Communists are accused of  doing.

At  least the Communists often bring those charged

with subversion to public trial. If Government has

proof  that  those arrested are guilty of  illegal

acts, let this proof be tested in a court of  law.

It  is necessary for the Government to do this  if

only  to quell doubts that these arbitrary arrests

are  a  prelude  to the crushing of constitutional

nationalist and trade union activities. It is  not

enough  for  Government  to  claim  that   it   is

satisfied with the proof it has. The Government is

not   an   impartial   judge   in   this   matter,

particularly  as these arrests have been  directed

against organisations and individuals who are  not

friendly  to  Government.  Certainly  the   recent

arrests  have  been taken by certain employers  to

mean  that  these are not directed solely  against

violent Communist subversion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I am free, I assume that Government is not

of  the view that I am a subversive character, but

the  authorities of the Naval Base,  Sir,  take  a

different  view. I and the legal  adviser  to  the

Naval  Base Labour Union (Mr Lee Kuan  Yew)  were

certainly   treated  as  undesirable   characters.

Though   elected  by  the  voters   of   Sembawang

Constituency, I was denied entry to the Naval Base

area.  I  must assume that responsible and  fairly

intelligent men run the Naval Base area.  If  they

can  construe the Government's action to mean that

even  those  not  arrested by the  Government  are

subversive characters, how much more so  will  the

other  employers not as enlightened as  the  Naval

Base  authorities? They look upon the clean-up  as

encouragement to carry on a clean-up of their own.

If  an  elected Assemblyman like me can be treated

in  this high-handed manner, what is the treatment

meted  out  to thousands of simple trade unionists

and anti-colonialists?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Prison!



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim:</b> I am not alone in these

fears.  Even the Trades Union Congress thought  it

necessary  to warn employers not to take advantage

of  the  recent disturbances. Some employers  have

already  begun  their  own  purge  of  what   they

consider   are  undesirable  elements.   This   is

inevitable. The Government makes it clear that it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 500</b></font><br><br>



would proceed against those who take advantage  of

the  present  uncertainty and  fear.  Whether  the

Government  likes  it or not,  the  employers  are

today  confident and the workers are living  under

the  shadow  of  fear. These  fears  can  only  be

removed by making it clear to all that the  clean-up  of so-called subversives is not a clean-up  of

trade  unionists and anti-colonialists.  The  best

way  of  doing this is to bring those  accused  of

subversion  before the courts and  either  convict

them  for their acts or free them unconditionally.

Otherwise   the   Government   must   take    full

responsibility for all the consequences  of  their

actions, including the ruthless break-up of  trade

unions  by employers and the persecution of  anti-

colonialists.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.16 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Chew Swee Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move an amendment to

the substantive motion standing in the name of the

Member  for Tanjong Pagar. The amendment I propose

to  move is by deleting the word "deplores" in the

first  line of the motion and substituting  therefor  the  word "supports" and by deleting all  the

words  "against persons and organisations  without

producing any evidence to justify its action", and

substituting a full stop at the end  of  the  word

"Ordinance" in the third line. The amended  motion

will thus read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House supports the further action of

the  Labour Front Coalition Government  under  the

Banishment Ordinance, the Preservation  of  Public

Security Ordinance, and the Societies Ordinance."



<br><br>Sir, I beg to submit copies of the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of the amendment handed in.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think it would be for the

convenience  of  hon.  Members  if  the   proposed

amendment should read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To leave out all the words after the word

'House'  in  line  one  and to  insert  the  words

'supports  the further action of the Labour  Front

Coalition    Government   under   the   Banishment

Ordinance,  the  Preservation of  Public  Security

Ordinance, and the Societies Ordinance'."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister can then proceed on those lines.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 501</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  much obliged to you. I therefore formally move

the amendment as just stated by you, Sir, that is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out all the words after the word "House"

and  to  insert  the words "supports  the  further

action  of  the Labour Front Coalition  Government

under  the  Banishment Ordinance, the Preservation

of  Public  Security Ordinance, and the  Societies

Ordinance".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar, in moving his

motion, asked, "Who began the riots?" He tried his

very  best  to  put the blame on  the  Government,

saying  it  was  apparent that the  thousands  who

gathered  in front of the Chinese High  School  in

Bukit  Timah  Road were collected  there  for  the

purpose  of the riots, but he conveniently  forgot

to  mention that it was after the Member for Bukit

Timah  and  his henchmen had arrived at the  scene

that  the riots began. The Member for Bukit Timah,

as   pointed  out  by  the  Chief  Minister,  made

inflammatory  speeches at the  Beauty  World,  and

soon  after  the  meeting, those who  attended  it

drifted  along  to  the High School  vicinity  and

almost at an instant jeered at the Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is significant to note that the Member for

Bukit  Timah at that meeting said that instead  of

shouting  "Merdeka" the people should  now  shout,

"Pah  Mata",  which means "Beat  the  Police".  Is

there  any doubt whatsoever as to who sparked  off

the riots?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar also, if I remember

rightly, mentioned the word "hyprocrisy".  To  put

it mildly, I think that the hon. Member himself is

a hypocrite.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That, of course, is a

completely unparliamentary word. Will the Minister

please withdraw it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> I withdraw that word, Sir. I

was  about to mention this fact, that although the

Federation  Chief  Minister in  his  speech  quite

recently flayed politicians who made use of school

boys  in  the political game, yet at many  of  the

meetings  held by the P.A.P., there were thousands

of students present at those meetings. As against



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 502</b></font><br><br>



this  glaring  fact, the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

sought  to  blame the Government for its  actions.

The  Government  was responsible for  rousing  the

emotions   of  the  Chinese-speaking  people   and

separating  the  Chinese-speaking population  from

the  English-speaking population. May I remind him

that among those arrested were his friends - Messrs.

Devan  Nair  and Puthucheary and two  other  Malay

gentlemen.  Surely those people are  not  Chinese-speaking?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> That was the last stage.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Now let me turn, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  to the question of the expulsion of the  142

pupils which caused a lot of misunderstanding  and

misinterpretation. It would be interesting to note

that  among  those  142 pupils  there  were  young

adults  ranging from the age of 21 to 25 and  that

none  of  them  were under 15 years old.  Even  in

spite  of  this  fact and in  order  not  to  deny

education to those who genuinely seek it,  I  have

given  the  undertaking  that  if  those  expelled

students  would apply personally to me with  their

guardians,   I   would   consider   their    cases

individually and that there might be a possibility

of  providing  them with education by  segregation

from other pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar also touched on the

question  of mass signature campaigns. My reliable

information  on this subject is that young  pupils

have  been  made  use of in forcing  ignorant  and

illiterate people to sign. The lies that were used

were that if 200,000 signatures could be obtained,

all  those  arrested would be  released  and  that

there would be a guarantee for non-Singapore  born

aliens  to  be immune from banishment. Here  again

Members will see that young pupils were being made

use of in the political game.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been said that students in Hungary staged

mass  demonstrations and that they were termed  as

courageous students. The Member for Tanjong  Pagar

attempted   to  draw  a  parallel  between   those

students  and  our students, but he  forgets  that

those students in Hungary are University



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 503</b></font><br><br>



students  and  not pupils of middle  schools.  The

word  "student" in Singapore has assumed a meaning

indicating  anyone  from  a  toddler  attending  a

kindergarten  to one doing post-graduate  work  in

the  University. The pupils in the middle  schools

are still children and it is their primary duty to

finish their studies before they take part in  any

adult activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would draw the attention of the House and the

public  to  a very glaring fact among the  Chinese

middle school students. A Communist flag was found

in  the  Chinese High School. Does the Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar suggest that the Government  should

sit tight and watch these children wave the Hammer

and  Sickle  in  front of our eyes and do  nothing

about  it?  As  soon  as the sit-down  strike  was

organised  in  the two schools, the  Chinese  High

School and the Chung Cheng High School, a student,

in a fiery speech, said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Our strength being invincible, should the Police

take  any  action  against us we would  unite  our

strength to go against the police batons and  guns

to the last drop of our blood."



<br><br>Another student said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arm ourselves in time of necessity when facing

another struggle."



<br><br>Is  there any difference between workers who armed

themselves  with bottles, stones,  iron  bars  and

acid  in  the  riots and the pupils who  vowed  to

battle the Police with their blood?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday a body of pupils distributed a circular

to  all pupils and parents. They styled themselves

as  "The  Entire  Body of Fellow-Students  of  the

Chung  Cheng  and  Chinese  High  Schools".   This

"entire body" forgets that there are 2,513  pupils

who refuse to follow their steps and who refuse to

join  themselves with this unworthy  lot.  I  will

quote passages from this circular:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We have broken camp or dissolved our assembly in

the  schools according to plan. This does not mean

that  we  are afraid of criminal force or that  it

tantamounts  to failure. Our planned dispersal  or

break  camp is mainly for the sake of achieving  a

more   effective  form  of  safeguarding   Chinese

education and of striving for the interests of the

teachers  and students of the Chinese schools.  At

the present junction, we must stick firmly to four

points.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 504</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To restore Chinese schools to normalcy

unconditionally.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) To resolutely oppose the re-registration of

students sponsored by the Ministry of Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To stop further arrests and sacking of

teachers and students of Chinese schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) To rescind the order of expelling 142 fellow-students.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will oppose the intrigue of the Ministry of

Education  to  re-register and to  reorganise  the

Chinese schools. It is the first step taken by the

Government to wrest the right of management of the

Chinese schools from the Management Committees  as

a  prelude to the complete domination and  control

over Chinese schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fellow-students of Singapore! Unite together to

make  active  preparations  for  the  struggle  to

safeguard  Chinese education.  We  appeal  to  the

parents out of a sense of righteousness to  oppose

the  unreasonable attitude of the  Government  and

not to send their sons and daughters to register."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a document which is not surprising to me.

All  they attempt to do is to lay the blame on the

Government  and  nothing is said about  their  own

acts.  They presume that what they have been doing

is  right  and that they are above the  law.  This

document shows the arrogance on the part of  these

children - children  who are  conceited,  who  think

they are infallible, who think that they can go on

flouting  the  authority of their  parents,  their

teachers  and  the Government. It is  quite  clear

that  they are not interested at all in education,

that  they  intend to fight Government, to  subdue

Government, so that they can stage another victory

march.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving this amendment, Mr Speaker, Sir, I ask

all reasonable people to support the Government in

its Operation Liberation - liberation of the workers

from  exploitation, from pseudo  trade  unionists;

liberation   of   the   pupils   from    Communist

indoctrination  and the masses  from  totalitarian

tyranny. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I rise to second the amendment  and

reserve the right to speak at a later stage in the

debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The original Question was,

<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there is only one issue before the sober people of

Singapore,  one political issue which  overshadows

everything  else  to an extent  that  every  other

issue shrivels to the point of no importance.  And

that  issue  is - Can this Government obtain  a  new

constitution  that will end colonial  rule?  I  am

conscious, Sir, that that is the only key question

for   any   decent  citizen;  and  the  subsidiary

questions of the basis of the new constitution and

the  date. Operation Merdeka is the only operation

of  significance to everyone of us, and looking at

that  issue, we must recognise that in these  five

months  during which the Government  has  been  in

office, the Chief Minister has gained not only the

confidence of large sections of the population  of

Singapore,  including those who were  timid  about

Merdeka,  but  what is of far more importance,  he

has  gained the absolute confidence and  trust  of

British  military and commercial interests.  Early

last  year I recognised that it was vital to  gain

that  confidence in order to achieve  Merdeka  for

the  people.  I  tried desperately  to  gain  that

confidence  by sweet reasonableness and ultimately

by  shock tactics. I failed. In five short  months

the   Chief   Minister   has   succeeded   to   an

extraordinary   extent.  I   personally   am   now

convinced that the Chief Minister is the only  man

that  Singapore  has in today's circumstances  who

can  bring  us  Merdeka in the  shortest  possible

time.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Down with the personality cult!

<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> I seem to hear the voice of

Khrushchev!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mao.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Sir, Mao too. Sir, it may be

thought that I am now playing the role of a  loyal

stooge,  but I would like to say this:  I  entered

politics  because I passionately believed  in  the

democratic  process, the process of  parliamentary

democracy  and freedom for the people of Singapore

as  essential  for their healthy  growth;  and  in

order  to attract their faith and their confidence

in  that  process, I have at all times  sought  to

tell them only the truth. I have never lied to the

people of Singapore, whatever the difficulties and

the  pressures; and whatever the difficulties  and

the  pressures today, Sir, or tomorrow, I will not

lie  to  them.  Therefore, Sir,  let  me  repeat - I

believe the Chief Minister is the best man we have

today  to  bring  home a decent  constitution  for

Singapore  within the shortest possible  time.  It

therefore follows that any act which weakens  this

Government  weakens our drive for Merdeka;  and  a

censure  of  this Government or the fall  of  this

Government  would mean the indefinite postponement

of stability and peace and freedom. The Government

is in a unique position, Sir, that whether it does

right or whether it does wrong, the decent citizen

of  Singapore who wants freedom from colonial rule

must give it all the strength and support he can.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was very heartening yesterday to hear the

Chief Minister declare that he is aiming for a new

constitution and full and free elections not later

than  August  next. A concrete statement  of  that

character  goes a long way to dispel  such  doubts

and  anxieties as may have been building up. I  am

only  sorry that the Chief Minister has  not  been

able   to   give  us  a  definite  date  for   the

constitutional talks. From what he said, I  gather

that  he  is ready but the Secretary of State  for

the  Colonies is not and he is trying to  push  it

off.  That  is understandable. The Chief  Minister

has indicated that he is going to London



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 507</b></font><br><br>



in  mid-December  to discuss the agenda  with  the

Secretary  of  State  for the Colonies.  Sir,  the

Chief Minister was with me last December in London

and  he knows that the fixing of the agenda  is  a

wholly minor matter which we freely admitted could

have  been  done by letter. There were then  other

matters  to  be attended to. I would urge  him  to

consider  fixing the agenda by cable and utilising

the  dates he has with the Secretary of State  for

the  Colonies  in December for full constitutional

talks.  He knows the feelings of the Labour  Front

on  the subject. I add the voice of the people  of

Cairnhill   in   this   plea   that   he    pursue

energetically the matter of an early date for  the

talks.  The  psychological moment in  London  for

these talks is, I believe, soon. An early date for

the constitutional talks, Sir, would also help  to

restore  the morale and confidence of some  decent

citizens  of  Singapore  who  have  been   gravely

disquieted by recent events.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar has stated that the

actions  of the Government have identified  it  in

the  public mind with colonial rule. As far  as  I

can judge, that is only partly true, Sir, of small

minority  sections,  not  unimportant  because  of

that. Under the Rendel Constitution, which we  are

working,  the Chief Secretary, a Colonial  Office

official,  is the central authority in respect  of

internal  security.  All information  on  internal

security matters is channelled through him. He  is

the  person whose duty it is to advise the Council

of  Ministers on matters of internal security. The

final  say  in internal security is  his  and  the

Government's.  Any  major  action  taken  by   the

Government in the field of internal security must

necessarily  be  based  on  the  information,  the

guidance   and  the  co-operation  of   the   Chief

Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many arrests have been made not only of rioters

and  curfew breakers but also of persons under the

Preservation of Public Security Ordinance, arrests

which  to some are reminiscent of the mass arrests

in  India  and  Burma before independence.  It  is

true,  Sir,  that  today we recognise  that  those

arrests  in  India  and  Burma  were  arrests   of

nationalist forces.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 508</b></font><br><br>



But  let  us  remember that many  of  the  persons

recently arrested are believed to be ardently anti-colonial individuals. We have used British  forces

against our own citizens. Let us face frankly  the

fact  that  all this builds up to a picture  which

gives  disquiet to some perfectly decent and loyal

citizens  of Singapore. It is the tragedy  of  the

Rendel  Constitution that those Malayans who  seek

in all sincerity to work it for the welfare of the

people are often identified with colonialism. Sir,

if the Colonial Office says to us that two and two

makes  four,  we  in  Singapore  must  accept  the

correctness  of that arithmetic. Let me  say  now,

with  no axe to grind, that the advice of Colonial

Office officials I have often found to be sensible

and  right. If we try to show our independence  by

going  contrary in every instance to every  advice

of  colonial officials, then we create  chaos  for

Singapore;  and  yet  because  the  Government  is

believed to have followed the guidance and  advice

of  colonial officials, it is damned, as I  in  my

time  was damned, as a running dog of the Colonial

Office by certain sections of the population. That

is  the  price  of  the  Rendel  Constitution - that

decent  Malayans seeking honestly to work  it  for

the  welfare of Singapore are suspected  of  being

traitors to the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways, Sir, in which Government can

seek to regain the confidence of those sections of

the  population; and let us remember this:  though

we  may  have a hundred with us, the shepherd  who

has  a hundred sheep but has lost two goes out  to

seek  for  those two - they should not be discarded -

and  I  say  that  the Government can  regain  the

confidence  of these minority sections  which  are

gravely disturbed today in two ways:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) By a renewed and vigorous drive on the

merdeka road; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) By giving the maximum possible information of

the  clear  and  present  danger  of  a  Communist

conspiracy to overthrow the Government by force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is freely recognised, Sir, in every democratic

country  in  the world that secrecy  is  sometimes

necessary, but it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 509</b></font><br><br>



also  true  that  secrecy  and  democracy  do  not

generally go together. The Government has given no

indication that Operation Liberation is at an end,

nor  has  it  stated  that the  present  quiet  is

permanent peace and not a temporary lull.  If  the

inference   is   that  Government  fears   further

trouble,  that  is all the more  reason  why  this

House  and the people of Singapore should be taken

into its fullest confidence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two other matters, Sir, arising out of

this  unhappy tragedy that has befallen  Singapore

on  which I wish to touch. The first is concerning

the arrest of the Member for Bukit Timah. I do not

think  it  is proper at this stage for  anyone  in

this  House - nor  perhaps  would  you  permit   it,

certainly  I  would not permit myself - to  indicate

what  I  know or what I learned in London  of  the

character  and  the views of this young  man.  But

this  I can say, Sir: I agree wholeheartedly  with

the  Chief Minister that no citizen is immune from

the process of law. When it comes to utilising the

process  of  the  Preservation of Public  Security

Ordinance intended for use where there is evidence

of  an  attempt  to  overthrow the  Government  by

force,  but  such evidence it is not  possible  to

produce  in  court - when  this  Ordinance  is  used

against   a   representative  of  the  people   of

Singapore,   and   one  of  the   most   prominent

Opposition Members - that is a very grave act. This

I know the Chief Minister is aware of. I also know

that  the Chief Minister will, if he can, seek  to

bring charges against this young man in a court of

law.  If  he cannot, we have this solace  in  this

House - that  the  Member for Bukit  Timah  has  the

right  to appeal to three judges - but I would  like

to  add my plea in respect of this case which must

disturb  many.  I  would like  to  ask  the  Chief

Minister   if  these  three  judges  confirm   the

detention: that a special secret sitting  of  this

Assembly  be  called; and that the report  of  the

judges  be communicated to us so that we would  be

satisfied in our own minds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other aspect of the tragedy which has

befallen  us  is  the widening  rift  between  the

English-speaking,  the  Malay-speaking   and   the

Indian-speak-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 510</b></font><br><br>



ing  sections of the population on the  one  hand,

and the Chinese-speaking Chinese on the other.  It

is  utterly  false  to suggest  that  the  Chinese

youths  are  disloyal monsters. It  is  completely

untrue to think of the Chinese-speaking Chinese as

having their loyalty orientated towards Peking.  I

think,  Sir, it is appropriate at this  time  that

the  people of Singapore - all of us - should face the

facts and recognise the dangers of this facile but

dangerous way of thought. For decades the colonial

education  policy in Singapore  has  been  a  very

simple one. Education costs money, they say. If we

are to give education to the children of transient

immigrants,  we  must have income  tax.  Introduce

income  tax  to educate the children of  transient

immigrants  who  may  be  here  today   and   gone

tomorrow? Nonsense! And anyway, education may give

them   ideas.  What  does  a  coolie   want   with

education?  So  because clerks  and  tambies  were

needed  for  commercial houses, we had schools  to

produce   only  clerks  and  tambies.   Missionary

societies did valiant work in trying to fill  part

of  the vacuum. The clerks and the tambies and the

products  of missionary schools learned  something

of  English culture. The English cultural  pattern

which with its refinements of Greek philosophy and

Roman  jurisprudence became  our  main  source  of

inspiration,  involving our way of  life.  We  who

were educated in English schools tried to meet our

problems  with the techniques of English  culture.

We  did not become English but we learned what was

helpful   in  designing  our  way  of  life;   and

incidentally, Sir, we learned respect and  loyalty

to  the  Crown, faith in the rule of  law,  and  a

longing for democratic institutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of the others? The mass of Chinese had to

fend  for themselves. They either had no schooling

and  grew  up in the gutter, or they had  to  find

places   in  so-called  schools  run  by   Chinese

merchants,  many  of whom donated  generously  but

none of whom knew anything of education or running

schools.  The  teachers  were  poorly  paid.   The

products of those schools and those who never went

to  school  know a little of Chinese history,  the

Chinese classics, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 511</b></font><br><br>



Chinese philosophy, and consequently their  source

of  inspiration in meeting life's problems is  the

techinique of Chinese culture. They know little of

the rule of law. They know little of parliamentary

democracy     or    Commonwealth     ideals     of

internationalism.  When you say  to  me,  Sir,  be

loyal   to  Singapore.  I  understand  that  means

loyalty   to   the   democratic   way   of   life,

constitutional       progress,        Commonwealth

relationship.  When you say to a  Chinese-speaking

Chinese, be loyal to Singapore, he thinks  of  the

Chief  Secretary, of the Governor, of the Colonial

Office. He thinks of the decades of discrimination

and exploitation. He wants to change this, and  so

do I.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Silence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> He has no access to Western

literature  and  philosophy,  so  he   seeks   the

technique for the change in Chinese literature and

Chinese  philosophy.  He tries  to  adapt  Chinese

techniques to his problems as we, who are English-educated,   try  to  adapt  English  concepts   of

parliamentary democracy to our problems. These are

the  sources  of our inspiration.  Those  are  the

sources  of  his. We are not English,  nor  is  he

Communist. My father, Sir, anglicized our name  by

putting an "r" in it. I sing Auld Lang Syne.  Does

that make me a Scot?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> No!



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Says the jealous Englishman! The

Chinese-speaking Chinese, given a  chance,  is  as

loyal  a  Malayan as any Straits-born. It is  true

that   Communists  are  seeking  to  utilise  this

cultural   affinity   to  impose   the   Communist

ideology.  But  it  is  not true  that  they  have

succeeded, and they will not succeed. The  Chinese

have  equal  rights  as  the  rest  of  us  in   a

constitution compatible with human dignity.  Those

who fear Peking's domination must surely have been

heartened, Sir, by the advice of Premier Chou  En-lai  to our fellow citizens that they should  give

their undivided loyalty to Singapore for their own

welfare, for the welfare of Singapore, and for the

friendly  relations  that  China  seeks  with  its

neighbours. I know the most memorable incident  of

my visit to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 512</b></font><br><br>



China,  Sir,  was  when Premier  Chou  En-lai  was

provoked to anger by my remark that the concept of

dual  nationality  was  a remnant  of  imperialist

thinking,  and  the  logical consequence  of  that

concept  was that Singapore with its 76  per  cent

Chinese is a colony of Peking. "Me," he said, Sir,

in   English,  "an  imperialist?  I  have   fought

imperialism   for  30  years!"  And   through   an

interpreter   he  told  me,  "China   has   enough

territory, China has enough population.  We  think

colonialism is evil. We want no colonies. We  want

friends. If ever China tries to dominate Malaya, I

hope  you  fight us." And turning back to  me,  he

said in English, "That is not only for us but  for

the  future and you tell the people of Singapore."

Sir,  I believe he was completely sincere when  he

said  that  China  seeks  no  colonies,  it  wants

friends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Singapore should discard this idea

of  disloyal  Chinese. We must get  together  with

them  and  seek  to work out with  them  a  common

approach  to  our common loyalty. We must  try  to

understand the Chinese-speaking Chinese and  I  do

ask them to try and understand us. We, the English-speaking  section  of  the  population,  are   not

colonial  stooges because we seek  to  follow  the

English  pattern  of approach in respect  of  the

problem of merdeka. We are as sincere as they are.

They  must  also realise that there  are  elements

which   seek   every  opportunity  to   damn   the

Government, and they have been working not only in

schools   but   also  amongst  responsible   adult

Chinese.  Just  to give you one instance,  Sir,  I

know how ardently, how sincerely my colleagues and

I worked on the White Paper on Education. We tried

with  complete honesty to make up for the  decades

of  disgraceful government neglect of the  Chinese

community. We insisted on full equality for  them,

irrespective of cost. It was a radical, I  thought

it  was  a  magnificent, departure from the  past.

Instead  of  relief  and  appreciation  from   the

Chinese  community,  we were  told  that  we  were

trying  to destroy Chinese culture. That  horrible

charge, Sir, is one that I will never forget. Till

today  I  find it difficult to understand how  the

reasonable and practical Chinese people,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 513</b></font><br><br>

after reading the White Paper, can truthfully say

that  it  is  discriminatory or seeks  to  destroy

Chinese culture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why the campaign of vilification against

Government?   The   Chinese  themselves   do   not

understand   how  they  have  been   pushed   into

believing  the  White  Paper  to  be  evil,   into

believing   that  it  seeks  to  destroy   Chinese

education. Sir, I think it might be helpful  if  I

were to explain a little of what I have learnt of

the Stalin concept of the technique of revolution.

Broadly  speaking, Sir, Stalin believed that  only

the   workers   are   capable  of   a   successful

revolution;  also  that the workers  are  normally

ignorant and illiterate. Therefore they have to be

politically  educated  to a  revolutionary  pitch.

`The  political education consists  in  constantly

saying:  "The  present is bad. The  Government  is

wrong."  Whether  the Government  does  right,  or

whether  the  Government  does  wrong,  you   must

always   say:  "The  Government  is  wrong,   the

Government  is  wrong, the Government  is  wrong",

until you have aroused their anger to the pitch of

violence.  It  seems  that they  conceive  of  the

worker as being one who is like a sheep, unable to

remember  today  the falsehood he  was  told  last

week, and they are like sheep which a noisy sheep-dog  can stampede in one direction. This has  been

to  some extent successful in the colony, but I am

glad   to  note  that  today  many  Chinese   are

conscious that they have been gravely misled about

Government's  intentions  in  respect  of  Chinese

education. That is a good start.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who, because of their study of the

Chinese  technique  of approach  to  freedom,  are

inclined  to  be friendly to Communism,  I  would

like  to  say  this, Sir: I spent  two  months  in

China. I had travelled very extensively and I  was

given  very  considerable facilities to  meet  and

talk  with  innumerable officials  throughout  the

length  and breadth of China. I have seen Shanghai

which  was  once a prosperous commercial  city.  I

have   discussed  Communism  in  the  context   of

Singapore   with   many,  many   leading   Chinese

Communists. Not one of them denied my thesis  that

in a territory where there is neither industry nor

agriculture,   nor  mining  nor  fishery,   in   a

territory which survives economically by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 514</b></font><br><br>



virtue of the activity of capital, Communism would

mean  our economic death. In fact, Sir, I remember

with  pleasure that one leading Communist said  to

me, "Well, maybe in the freak economy of Singapore

Communism is inappropriate." I would like  to  say

for myself that I am more than ever convinced that

those  who seek to impose a Communist ideology  on

Singapore  are,  whether  they  know  it  or  not,

seeking  to  break our rice-bowl and to  drive  us

starving  into the sea. Those who think  they  can

gain  merdeka by following the Communist technique

of violence have had a fulldress rehearsal warning

in recent days of what would befall them. Violence

is  evil in itself, and in Singapore it is  doubly

evil,  because in Singapore it is certain to  fail

and  the  people only will suffer tragedy and  the

misery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, Sir, to appeal to all who may be

disturbed  or  antagonistic by  recent  Government

actions  to  recognise  that  the  Government   is

seeking  sincerely the welfare of the  people.  By

its own act this Government has given clear notice

that it will terminate its own life not later than

nine  months hence. That, Sir, is surely  evidence

of  its  sincerity? Let us all during  these  nine

months cooperate together with the Government  for

Singapore's  welfare.  To  those  sitting  on  the

fence, the antagonisms of the past one and a  half

years have caused enough damage, and merdeka  will

never  come,  and  if it comes  it  will  have  no

meaning unless we all learn to cooperate with each

other  and with Government. I ask all sections  of

the  population to stop this traditional suspicion

that seems inherent in certain quarters and to try

for  the  next nine months a positive approach  in

full  co-operation with Government; and I say, Sir,

that  in these nine months we can still learn  how

to  live  together  as  equal  brothers,  for  the

Chinese-speaking  Chinese  cannot  rule  Singapore

against  the will of the rest of us. Nor  can  we,

who  are so preponderantly representative in  this

House  rule  Singapore against  the  will  of  the

Chinese-speaking Chinese. For our  survival,  Sir,

we must learn to respect, to understand and to co-operate  with each other. Let there be an  end  to

this violence which threatens the very possibility

of merdeka. Let us all remember



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 515</b></font><br><br>



that  there is but one issue before us -  Operation

Merdeka!



<br><br>11.09 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

it is unfortunate that within a year and a half of

the   life   of   this  Labour   Front   Coalition

Government,   we  are  saddled  with   two   major

disastrous  riots  with its usual  loss  of  human

life,   injury   to  hundreds   of   people,   and

inconvenience   to   the   whole   population   of

Singapore.  This  state  of  affairs   has   given

Singapore  a  notoriety that is  going  to  affect

adversely the future of this island. The world  at

large  is going to ask whether Singapore is really

a  happy place to live in, whether the people here

observe law and order, and, most important  still,

whether it is a city safe enough for investment in

its industry and other developments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning of this year, when Singapore was

pressing   for  political  advancement,  questions

affecting  the  internal security of  this  island

figured  prominently  in the talks.  Some  leaders

then  were of the opinion that we needed no troops

to  defend this island. Even the suggestion by  my

Party   about  raising  immediately  a   Singapore

regiment was not well received. The past ten  days

found  us  asking for assistance in the matter  of

troops  and  policemen from  the  Federation,  and

indeed  Singapore owes much to the Chief  Minister

of the Federation, Tunku Abdul Rahman, for sending

us  the much needed aid so promptly. Without  such

help,  this city could not have attained  normalcy

in  such  a  short time, and this help  must  have

saved  Singapore  from further loss  of  life  and

property. In Singapore, up to today, the  material

loss  is  estimated  at  a  few  hundred  thousand

dollars.   Everywhere  we  hear   expressions   of

hardship and suffering. The workers were prevented

from going to work and therefore lost the earnings

that   should  have  been  theirs.  The  students,

especially  the majority of them who are  keen  to

learn,  lost the opportunity to study during  this

critical  period. I sympathise with those students

in their final year, in fact, their final month of

study in school before graduating.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 516</b></font><br><br>



Over  ten years of hard work has already been  put

in  and  if  the results of this last  examination

were  disappointing or if they were  compelled  to

abandon their school careers, those who engineered

this  riot  must take the blame. The ordinary  and

peace-loving  citizens,  by  and  large,  must  be

praised  for  the manner in which  they  conducted

themselves, keeping within and observing the  laws

of  the country. Imagine the immense inconvenience

experienced by such citizens. 20 hours out  of  24

cooped  up  in  their houses. What a horrible  and

intolerable  bore  it  must  have  been  to  those

families  of eight to ten children, or even  more,

that live in cubicles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the most important question to ask now is:

Who  caused  all this trouble? On whose  shoulders

must  the blame for all this loss of life and limb

be  placed? The blame must rest squarely on  those

who  engineered this riot and civil  disobedience.

These are the enemies of the people. These are the

cowards and dishonest politicians who made use  of

innocent  and helpless young students and  workers

to  serve  their  own ends. These are  the  people

whose  greed for power and selfishness of  purpose

go  all out to incite violence when they know that

they  will  not be the people who will suffer  and

get  hurt. I  am referring to the People's  Action

Party   and  its  affiliates.  The  pseudo   trade

unionists,  instead of assisting  the  workers  to

improve  their conditions of work,  seize  on  the

gullibility of the workers and convert  the  trade

unions into political front organisations. Here  I

must  say  that  the  majority  of  workers,   the

backbone of our industries and services, are  good

and  law-abiding citizens who are eager  to  avoid

trouble  and  earn  an honest  day's  wages.  They

denounced violence and complained of their loss of

earnings.  In fact, many of them were quite  at  a

loss as to how to raise money to pay for the needs

of  their  families the next day. It was indeed  a

relief  to  all  when normalcy was  restored.  The

return  of  the  majority of transport  and  other

workers  immediately after the curfew  is  a  good

pointer to this.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 517</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the students, what do children between

the  ages of 11 and 15 know about politics? During

my  days,  when I first attended a Chinese  school

and then an English school, it was on the lips  of

most  Chinese  parents that  an  English  type  of

education  taught  the students  to  forget  their

parents.  Chinese  culture demands  that  children

must   honour  their  parents  and  respect  their

teachers. Today we hear of students ignoring their

parents,  going against them, and will not  relent

even  when  the  parents beg them to  comply  with

requests beneficial to the children themselves. In

the  classroom,  instead  of  the  teacher  giving

instructions,  the students give  orders.  I  ask,

Sir,  where  is it shown that Chinese  culture  is

being  preserved? However, it must  be  said  that

such  an  attitude is exhibited by only a few  so-called student leaders. I do not know about  their

advisers,  but if they agree that it is  wrong  to

honour  their parents and respect their  teachers,

then they are also no more fit to be human beings.

The  majority  of  students  are,  by  nature  and

tradition,  keen  to study. They  know  that  they

belong to families and that they have parents  who

not  only  are responsible for bringing them  into

this  world, but are also responsible for  feeding

them,   clothing   them,   educating   them,   and

protecting  them. However, acting in circumstances

not   within  their  control,  these  very   young

students  are powerless. Intimidation and  boycott

go  a  long way to compel the majority of innocent

and   young   students  into   toeing   the   line

distasteful to their own conscience. Sir,  I  must

speak  up  for this large group of young citizens.

The  blame  cannot be placed on them. It  must  be

placed  on  those  who engineered  the  riot,  who

incited  them, who prevented them from  doing  the

right  thing.  We must consider their  future.  We

must  help  them to become useful citizens.  Where

they  have  strayed  against their  will,  let  us

create  conditions  for their  quick  return.  The

Government should see to it that their schools are

opened  at  the shortest possible time,  and  that

steps are taken to inculcate into young minds  the

differ-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 518</b></font><br><br>



ence  between  right and wrong. True  Chinese  and

other great cultures, which are, in fact, the most

valuable  assets  for any man living  in  society,

should   be   taught  in  all  schools - Government,

Government-aided, as well as private  schools.  If

there   is  any  difficulty  in  finding  suitable

lecturers,  I can assure the Government  that  the

Public Morals Committee will help.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there had been rioting in many parts of

Singapore  and incidents totalled  up  to  over  a

hundred,  it must be pointed out that, apart  from

serious  incidents  involving  arson  and   brutal

manhandling  of  innocent  citizens,  many   minor

incidents  were caused by hooligans  and  ignorant

youths.  This  is an indication that  support  for

lawlessness, was only confined to  a  very  small

minority. I understand that many people, numbering

not  less than a thousand, have been detained  for

breaking   the   curfew  or   rioting.   In   this

connection, may I point out that many citizens did

not understand that the curfew imposed was a house

curfew?  As a result, many thought that  it  would

not  be an offence to stay in their compounds  or

on  the  five-foot way so long  as  they  did  not

venture on to the roads. Many other citizens,  who

happened  to  be on the scenes of incidents  after

the event, were unfortunate enough to be detained.

I  would  like the Government to use its sense  of

justice  and  discretion so that the innocent  may

not be punished with the guilty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what was the underlying cause of these

disorders? I am afraid that Singapore politics  is

always  gravely  affected by the politics  of  our

great neighbours. There is a need now to cultivate

a  real Malayan outlook and loyalty. No doubt many

people  have  come  from India, China,  Ceylon  or

other  countries. Let me say that China  today  is

already  a  great  nation, and so  are  India  and

Ceylon.  These countries do not need the loyalties

of  their children overseas to make them great. In

fact,  Nehru, through the Commissioners of  India,

has  in the past stated that the Indians who  want

to  be  citizens of Malaya must be loyal  to  this

country. So it has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 519</b></font><br><br>

with  Ceylon.  The Prime Minister of  China,  Mr

Chou  En-lai, in a recent news release,  has  also

stated  that China does not accept membership  for

his  Party from the overseas Chinese. He has urged

that the Chinese living in Malaya should be loyal

to  Malaya and he has also stressed the importance

of  the  Chinese people living here  to  live  in

harmony  with  the other races. People  from  many

nations  of  the world, particularly from  Europe,

emigrate to America. They are Americans and are to

the very last loyal to America. I remember that  a

Canadian Prime Minister was once asked whether  he

was  first  a  Canadian  and  then  French,  which

happened to be his race; and his reply was that he

was  Canadian first and Canadian last. These  are

examples  that  we can profitably follow.  Let  us

cultivate  a  true Malayan outlook, a hundred  per

cent Malayan loyalty, and let us be Malayans first

and Malayans last. If we can achieve this, and  at

the  shortest  possible time, then I believe  that

this  will  be  the beginning of the  end  of  our

troubles and an era of co-operation, mutual respect

and prosperity will follow.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to this question of the recent trouble

again,  we,  the Liberal-Socialists, while  giving

our  support  to  the Government in  carrying  out

measures  to  maintain  law  and  order  in   this

instance, cannot help making a few observations on

its   faults.  The  year-and-a-half  Labour  Front

Coalition  Government cannot escape entirely  from

criticism.  As I have said earlier, in this  short

period  we  have  had two riots, and  here  I  say

emphatically that the present riot is due  to  the

backfiring of the previous riot. The 1955 riot was

claimed by the trouble-mongers at that time to be

a  victory. They had been encouraged by government

action  then,  and now in a state of  drunkenness,

they  have staged the second riot. I hope this  is

the last.



<br><br>11.25 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there is nothing much that I have ever admired  in

this  stand of the P.A.P., but there is  only  one

thing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 520</b></font><br><br>



that  I  admire, and that is their consistency  in

maintaining that whatever they have done is  right

and  that  whatever the misfortunes that Singapore

has  seen throughout the last 16 months since  the

election  have been no concern of theirs and  have

not  been  started by them. Who then  started  the

Hock Lee bus riots? They said, "Not we. It was the

Government  who started the riots by  the  use  of

force  on the poor bus strikers." Who started  the

300 strikes? They said, "Not the Middle Road group

of unions nor the P.A.P." What they did was to get

better living conditions for the workers and about

40,000  membership.  But when  challenged  on  the

point that, by staging so many strikes, they  were

forcing   factories  to  close  down  or   curtail

production, they demanded us to produce one single

instance  of  such a thing happening.  Of  course,

they  never  kill the goose that lays  the  golden

eggs.  They  all die a natural death so  that  the

P.A.P. can prosper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who again started the near riot at the Kallang

airport? They denied they were responsible. But  I

was  there.  I stayed on to the end.  That  near

riot  never  started  until  the  mass  of  P.A.P.

supporters  and their friends came  along  to  the

airport  terminal  building.  There  they  started

chanting  songs, shouting merdeka  and  trying  to

climb  over  the railings into the building.  When

they  were  prevented from doing so,  stones  were

thrown.  Of course, they said, "They were not  our

men. They were other people."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again what about these strikes? What about

the  riots  that  we  have had recently?  Who  was

responsible?  Can the P.A.P. and the  Middle  Road

group  disclaim responsibility for having  incited

and  worked  up  the disorder,  the  challenge  to

Government, so that the riot could start?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang, in seconding the motion

moved by the Member for Tanjong Pagar, asked  this

morning,  "What is subversion? What is  subversion

so  long  as  we carry out our election  pledges?"

Surely the answer is that subversion is an attempt

to overthrow the legally constituted



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 521</b></font><br><br>



government by any act whatever to undermine  their

authority  or to challenge their right to  do  any

act. That, to my mind, is subversion, but to their

minds  it  is  a  perfectly natural constitutional

struggle.  What  is constitutional  about  it?  By

constitutional  struggle, other people  understand

it  to mean fighting an election or bringing up an

issue which can unseat the government and so start

another   election.   Surely   not   by   inciting

disobedience or demanding all those who have  been

detained to be brought to trial?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is that wrong?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> No, it is not wrong. You can

ask  for anything. But you could not deny that the

Government  has the powers under these  Ordinances

to  which  you are objecting. On this  occasion  I

notice  that the Member for Tanjong Pagar was  not

and  could  not be very vehement about disclaiming

responsibility for starting the riot. What he said

was,  like a good lawyer, "Prove it! We  have  got

nothing  to do with it." In his motion before  the

House he asks:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That this House deplores the further action of

the  Labour Front Coalition Government  under  the

Banishment Ordinance, the Preservation  of  Public

Security  Ordinance,  and the Societies  Ordinance

against    persons   and   organisations   without

producing any evidence to justify its action."



<br><br>What    further   evidence   and   what    further

justification  is  necessary after  what  happened

last week? His motion was filed on 24th October. I

wonder whether he would have had the nerve to file

a similar motion if it was after 26th October.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I have declared my stand, that I support

the  Government in its actions carried  out  under

these three Ordinances, I do wish to bring another

matter before the House. I spent the whole of last

week - and I think many Members of the Assembly  did

the  same - trying to find out for parents and wives

where  their sons and husbands and relatives were,

and  I  am very grateful to the Assistant Minister

to the Chief Secretary for so promptly acceding to

my  request to set up a central authority  whereby

anyone  can ring up and find out where the missing

persons



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 522</b></font><br><br>



are; but, to my mind, that alone is not enough.  I

understand about 500 people have been remanded  in

the  civil  prisons pending trial for rioting  and

breaking   the   curfew.  The  administration   of

justice,  as  I understand it today, will  not  be

able  to cope with this number of cases on top  of

the  ordinary day-to-day work which they  have  in

hand.  I think it takes at least three months  now

to  get  a  date  fixed for a hearing  before  the

court. Among these 500 odd people you will have to

sort out the sheep from the goats. I am convinced,

from  the reports that have come to me, that quite

a  number of these people arrested for rioting and

curfew breaking are innocent members of the public

who  happened to be near the scene of rioting when

the police came. My experience is that the man who

starts  a  riot  and who is the real  troublemaker

never  stays  to  take the consequences.  He  just

bolts away and leaves the consequences to be faced

by  the  people  who happen to  be  there,  either

hawkers or just passers-by.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one particular case in my mind. On the

26th  of October, the first day of the trouble,  a

cyclist was coming out of Alexandra Road near  the

military hospital. Unfortunately he collided  with

another  cyclist who was very anxious to get  home

before  the  curfew. He fell from  his  cycle  and

broke  his  head. He was picked up by  a  military

ambulance  and  taken  to the Alexandra  hospital.

Unfortunately  for  him, after  treatment  he  was

detained  there till about seven o'clock and  then

sent  to the General Hospital, by which time other

rioters with broken heads were pouring in, and  he

was  also detained. Fortunately, however,  I  have

been able to produce evidence to the investigating

officer  and  I  have been told that  he  will  be

released as soon as he can leave the hospital. Now

that  is  one case, but I am sure there  are  many

cases like that. I would therefore urge Government

to do something about these 500 odd people so that

they  can be brought to trial before the court  or

be  discharged as soon as possible. I also suggest

that, except for those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 523</b></font><br><br>



against whom there is clear evidence, the bail  of

$5,000  fixed for such cases at the present moment

should be reduced to $500, because it seems to  me

that  it  is impossible for these people  to  find

such  a  large  sum of money before  they  can  be

bailed out. I would also suggest that extra courts

be  constituted to deal with these cases and  that

more  investigators  should  be  appointed  to  go

through  these  cases  very quickly  so  that  the

innocent  can be discharged. I am quite sure  that

there  are many members of the Bar and members  of

the civil service who have experience on the Bench

who  would willingly volunteer to go through these

cases  and  report  to the Attorney-General  which

cases  ought to be discharged or withdrawn against

the  accused  persons. I hope Government  sees  my

point.  We  have  given Government  our  unstinted

support when it was a question of maintaining  law

and order. On my part, I feel that the maintenance

of law and order is above party politics, and I am

very  glad  that my support has been justified  by

recent  events,  but  I  do  urge  Government   to

consider very sympathetically the 500 odd  persons

who are now locked up.



<br><br>11.38 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr C. H. Butterfield (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr C. H. Butterfield):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, the Member for Paya Lebar was  good

enough to indicate to me this morning that he  was

going  to raise a point which he has made  towards

the  end  of  his  speech, that is,  that  he  was

concerned  about the large number of  persons  who

are  on  remand  on  charges arising  out  of  the

disturbances last week and who have not  yet  been

brought  to trial. He said, I think, at  an  early

stage  in his speech that it now takes about three

months  from  the  date of his  arrest  before  an

accused is brought to trial and he urged that  the

Government should do something about it. As I  was

saying,  I am grateful to him for having indicated

to  me  that he was going to raise this  question,

because in the short time which I have had, I have

been able to obtain some particulars which I think

will  go some way towards setting his mind at rest

on this particular point.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 524</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not want to weary the House with

details,  but  perhaps the hon. Member  and  other

Members  would  like  to  know  something  of  the

numbers  of  persons who are at  present  awaiting

trial.  The figures which I am going to  give  the

House  are  the figures as at 6 o'clock  yesterday

morning, and I think, for the purposes of  what  I

am going to say, the persons awaiting trial can be

divided into two categories. In the first category

are  persons charged with offences under the Penal

Code,  for  the  most  part  for  the  offence  of

rioting,  and  the  other  category  consists   of

persons who are charged with the offence of curfew

breaking.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the number of persons charged in

the  courts and awaiting trial for offences  under

the  Penal  Code,  that  number  as  at  yesterday

morning  was 326, of whom 290 were on charges  of

rioting.  I cannot say how many are at present  on

remand,  and  with regard to these cases,  I  know

that  this  figure is one which  the  hon.  Member

would  like to have. But I am afraid that I cannot

give  him that figure now but I shall try to  give

it to him later on. But it is a fact that bail has

been offered in all cases. So we have there, under

the   Penal  Code  in  effect,  persons   awaiting

trial - 326.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the curfew breakers, the number

against whom charges have been preferred is  1,034

and  over  half of those have already  been  dealt

with by the courts. So we have then 326 under  the

Penal Code and just over 500 for curfew offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I am coming really to what the hon. Member

wants  to  know. Arrangements have been  made  for

four  courts to deal exclusively with these  cases

starting   on  Monday  next,  and  I  have   given

instructions this morning that priority is  to  be

given  to  persons who are not on bail,  in  other

words,  to  persons  who are in  custody.  In  the

circumstances, I hope that what I have  said  will

satisfy  the  Member for Paya Lebar  and  also,  I

think,  the  Member  for Serangoon  who  expressed

doubts  and  concern in this matter. I  think  the

Member for Paya Lebar would also like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 525</b></font><br><br>



to know - he was worried about persons being charged

who  should not have been charged, but  I  do  not

accept  that  at  all  and I say  that  with  some

confidence  because over 1,172  persons  who  were

picked  up,  so  to speak, have been  released.  I

hope,  Sir,  that what I have said will  help  the

hon. Member concerned in the matter and will, as I

say, satisfy him.



<br><br>11.42 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chew Chua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Chew Chua (Ponggol-Tampenis):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, the elected Government has  of  late

been  using  a procedure which is even  very  much

more advanced than what we have been accustomed to

when  the  Colonial Office ruled us directly  with

the  support of members of a political Party which

has  now  ceased  to  exist.  Citizens  have  been

arrested  and detained under the powers  contained

in  the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance,

and  when  the persons arrested were not  born  in

this  country, they have been banished even though

they  have  family  ties  here.  The  Government's

excuse  has  been  that  these  persons  had  been

engaging   in   subversive  activities.   Is   the

information  at the disposal of the Government  so

secret  as all that, that they should always  want

to  act in secret rather than make use of the open

judicial  processes which are available  to  those

who have nothing to hide?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, recently in the case of the arrest of a

Chinese  journalist on suspicion, with a  view  to

banishment, on the charge that he had been engaged

in   subversive  activities,  the  Chief  Minister

admitted at a Press interview that it was possible

that   the  Police  could  have  acted  on   false

information. Sir, how long are we to tolerate this

unhappy  state of affairs? If `Government believes

that  those  it  has caused to  be  arrested  have

violated  the law of this country, then it  should

make every effort to have them produced before the

courts  of  law, so that the public may  know  why

they  have  been arrested and they  may  have  the

benefit  of  a fair and open trial.  Sir,  if  the

Government  states  that I  am  wrong  in  what  I

believe, then let it show by its act that  it  has

confidence in our judiciary and produce before our

courts of law those it has arrested on a suspicion

of having been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 526</b></font><br><br>



engaged  in subversive activities. It is  only  in

this  way that the fears of our citizens  will  be

allayed and confidence in the Government restored.



<br><br>11.46 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary's Ministry (Mr M. P. D. Nair): Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am  in  favour of the amendment moved by  my  hon.

Friend  the Minister for Education. Sir, to render

any  support to the original motion moved  by  the

Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar  would  be  to  render

support  to  the  actions and further  actions  of

lawless elements which have brought about a  grave

situation  in Singapore, resulting in  so  chaotic

and  so frightening effects on the peaceful  lives

of  the  vast majority of the people. The  reasons

and  justification for Government's action are not

far to seek. They have been repeatedly told to the

people in the past few weeks, and furthermore both

the  Chief Minister and the Minister for Education

mentioned  this  in  the  Assembly  yesterday  and

today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt, Sir, that violence was the

theme  of  the  students and  other  organisations

which started the riots and such acts were done in

the  name of ideals of democracy, human rights and

the struggle for freedom. The policy of individual

or  mob violence, intimidation, throwing of stones

at  the Police and at innocent people, and setting

fire  to institutions is a bankrupt creed.  It  is

the  creed  obviously  of  immature  students  and

politicians and incompatible with the interests of

the  people  as a whole. To think of violence  and

the  insurrections  of the  early  18th  and  19th

centuries is entirely to misunderstand the present

position  in  Singapore and of the  world.  It  is

unfortunate,  Sir,  that some of  our  people  are

being  advised, directly or indirectly, to  resort

to   insurrection  and  violence  to  achieve  our

freedom.  In order to fight for freedom  today,  I

think  the  non-violence  technique  is  the  only

desirable   technique  in   regard   to   internal

conditions in Singapore. The thought that by using

and  rushing into some kind of sporadic action the

people are speeding up the revolution in Singapore

is  very  misleading. Violence can do  nothing  of

that kind. Such a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 527</b></font><br><br>



technique   is   only  just  hindering   mankind's

progress   towards  the  peaceful  attainment   of

independence. The growth of violence is a  symptom

that we have left the path of righteousness in our

politics.  The insurrectionary type of  action  is

always  the action of a small minority and a  weak

minority,  which tries to capture  power  by  some

sudden  action. We in Singapore are  neither  weak

nor a small minority. We have a powerful organised

movement for attaining political freedom,  and  to

indulge  in  sporadic violent action  is  just  to

ignore and not to utilise this movement. It is, in

fact, hindering its functioning. We have the will,

which  is  a  great weapon, in our hands,  and  we

should use it to our best advantage. To think that

we  can  do  a  great deal with  a  pair  of  nail

scissors, as opposed to a big gun, is absurd.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students are being taught to defy the Police.

Who  compose this Police Force? Our own  brethren.

What is their duty? They are the guardians of  the

peace,  security and well-being of  their  parents

and  their fellow citizens. The internal  security

of  any  country must depend on the understanding,

moral  support  and active co-operation  which  the

people of this country render to the Police.  This

must  be so in Singapore too. The Police Force  is

there   to   ensure   internal   peace.   Whatever

government  is in power - whether it is  the  Labour

Front  Coalition,  the  P.A.P.,  or  the  Liberal-

Socialist - the Police act under the  direction  of

that  government.  For  what  purpose  should  the

youths  of Singapore be taught to hate the Police?

Is it to start a fight against our Police, a fight

against  our own fellow citizens, against our  own

well-being?  Sir, I heartily endorse  the  remarks

made  by the Chief Minister when he commended  the

restrained actions of the Police Force during  the

time of emergency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is also evidence that innocent workers

and  students were and are being incited to a very

high  pitch  of  violence  by  propaganda  and  by

inflammatory   speechs   directed   against    the

Government and its leaders who have devoted a fair

portion of their working life and have given their

all to the welfare of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 528</b></font><br><br>



people  of  Singapore. Sir, I venture  to  suggest

that it is discourteous for any movement, designed

to  achieve  political  freedom  by  peaceful  and

constitutional  means,  to  launch  a  series   of

propaganda  campaigns against the  Government  and

misrepresenting facts to achieve their  own  ends.

They must fight clean and win the hearts and minds

of the people by truthful propaganda. By truth and

only  by  truth  can we raise the dignity  of  our

people in the eyes of the world. We may be able to

fool some people sometimes by wild propaganda, but

we will not be able to fool all the people all the

time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will quote an instance where the ideals of

civil  rights  were  put to the  Members  of  this

Assembly  by the so-called Singapore Civil  Rights

Convention.  This letter, which was  addressed  to

me, reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Civil Rights Convention of major trade unions

and  other organisations in Singapore have  reason

to  believe  that  the majority of  votes  of  the

Assembly in support of the recent arbitrary arrest

of  trade union and civic leaders and equally  the

dissolution   of   peaceful   and   constitutional

organisations,  does  not reflect  public  opinion

generally and the opinion of the great majority of

your own electorate."



<br><br>Sir,  I  will  not  think this is upholding  civil

rights.  This appeal was not directed  to  Members

who   voted   against   Government's   motion   of

confidence  at  the last sitting of the  Assembly.

This appeal shows very clearly that freedom can be

dangerous  sometimes  and how  easily  it  can  be

abused  to  the  detriment  of  the  people.   The

secretary  of this organisation, sitting  down  in

his  office, could easily say that I do not  enjoy

the  confidence of the people. I, who am  in  very

close  touch  with the people and who  utilise  my

energies and place my services at the disposal  of

the  people, must surely know better than the  man

who  sits  down  and writes this letter.  That  in

itself shows very clearly what civil rights  these

people   have  been  championing.  That   is   not

championing civil rights, but it is one  of  those

bogeys that have been directed against me. Sir, if

a  democratic  decision of  the  Assembly  can  be

interpreted in this way, I have no doubt that this

Civil  Rights  Convention  does  not  believe   in

itself. You can only have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 529</b></font><br><br>



confidence   in  another  person  if   you   have

confidence in yourself first.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Labour Front Coalition Government will

continue the struggle to achieve political freedom

from   colonial   rule   through   peaceful    and

constitutional  means. We will not  believe  in  a

shortcut to freedom by violence. We shall continue

to  carry  on  the  principle of non-violence  and

truth  in  our struggle which we believe is  right

and  proper for peace, security and the well-being

of  our people. We shall continue our struggle for

freedom from fear, intimidation and exploitation.



<br><br>11.57 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I listened with

great  interest yesterday to the speech  in  which

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar moved his  motion - as

indeed  I  read  his speech on 4th  October - and  I

felt,  in what he said and in what I read, a  note

of  genuine  personal feeling, almost a  sense  of

personal tragedy - which is not so far from being  a

public tragedy - because there is a consistency  and

solidarity  in his actions which, regrettably,  is

based  I  think on an incomplete analysis  of  the

circumstances   in   Singapore,   an    incomplete

political  analysis  which  leads  to  injudicious

political acts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is much in his speech which was very

practical  and very constructive. He stressed  the

need to avoid deep political cleavage, the need to

unite public opinion and to win the hearts of  the

people  for a socialist programme centred  on  the

life  of Singapore. But there is an incompleteness

in  his  analysis,  I  think,  which  I  can  best

illustrate  by  reading one or two  extracts  from

what he said on 4th October. Here is one:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"if they cannot get the men who are prepared to

organise  the masses on their side, then  how  are

they going to get the masses on their side?"



<br><br>In  other words, he says you have got to have  the

organisers  in order to get the masses,  and  that

seems to be basic to his political philosophy  and

basic to his political Party. Then earlier on  the

same day he said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...take away all the supports, all the ground

organisations  that  sustain the  People's  Action

Party,  and then you will have removed the  sinews

of the Party."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 530</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the idea of the masses is one that I do not

accept  in Singapore. In a country like Russia  in

1917  or  China  in  1947, a backward,  tottering,

ruined, collapsing country, you do have masses  in

the  sense that the people have been reduced below

their status of decent healthy human beings into a

terrified  and  helpless mob.  Countries  in  that

state are not capable of democratic life and  they

have  to  be  organised with a  strong  hand.  You

cannot make any pretence of democracy about it any

more  than  Lenin made a pretence of democracy  in

organising Russia after the 1917 Revolution.  But,

Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is not politically or

socially  or  economically  bankrupt.  It  has  an

enormous  reservoir  of  political  strength   and

political  goodwill.  It has  the  possibility  of

democracy. It has, in fact, considerable  elements

of  democracy now existing; and in a democracy you

do  not  have masses - you have individuals. You  do

not  have  a  desire  to  be  organised  by  young

intellectuals.  You  do not  have  a  need  to  be

organised. In a democracy the people can  organise

themselves.  They  are not blinded,  oppressed  or

terrified.  They can make their own judgments.  It

is  most dangerous to think in terms of the masses

in  Singapore.  It is an intellectual  error,  the

same  error that Karl Marx made when he  spoke  of

the  "lumpen  proletariat" - "lumpen" not  meaning

"lumped"   but   meaning  "foolish",  "shiftless",

"purposeless", "loafer" proletariat. We have  not,

I  think, a lumpen proletariat in Singapore.  Our

people  are higher than that and they are  capable

of political life. The lumpen proletariat attitude

is  the attitude of a man standing up on high  and

looking  down at the crowd beneath him, and  there

they  are - the anonymous crowd of people - you cannot

distinguish  one  from the other. Sometimes  their

faces  are  blank, sometimes they laugh, sometimes

they   shout - ah - ah - ah!  But  they  are  just   the

responsive  instrument on which  the  intellectual

plays.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the point of view of the man looking down

on  the  masses, but when you are down  among  the

masses, it is not like that. You are an individual

and you are surrounded by individuals, and to the

man down below, it is individual



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 531</b></font><br><br>



freedom  that  counts. It is, I  think,  the  most

important thing in a man's life that he should  be

individually      free.     National      freedom,

merdeka - yes - but  they  are only  a  means  towards

individual  freedom, which is the final objective,

the  full  flowering  and fruiting  of  the  human

personality,  free from its chains and  free  from

exploitation and oppression. And because  we  have

this  desire for personal freedom, we do not have

amongst the people a desire to be organised.  They

are reluctant to be organised. You do not have  in

a healthy democracy a hundred per cent trade union

membership.  You  do not have a hundred  per  cent

vote for the head of the State. You do not have  a

hundred  per  cent of anything.  You  do  not  get

people  turning  out  to vote  for  the  different

Parties.  You  do not have all the voters  turning

out. You will think yourself lucky to get 70 or 80

per cent of them out. Because they do not want  to

be  organised.  It  is  only  where  you  have   a

totalitarian  country, a Communist  or  a  Fascist

country,  that people are organised and bludgeoned

and  compelled to come out and give  themselves  a

hundred  per cent to an organisation. You  do  not

need  it  in  a democracy. You can get spontaneous

organisation  as  the  need  arises.   They   have

apparently  a spontaneous organisation in  Hungary

against  a  government kept in  power  by  foreign

support. The people rose against it and organised,

and, as far as I can gather from the reports, just

rising  up  to say, "We do not want to  be  pushed

around and organised. We want to do the things  we

like  and  disagree with each other when  we  want

to."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> You should ask American

intelligence agents what they know about Hungary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I thought I should be queried about

Hungary,  so  I  will take an example  during  the

riots  in  Singapore.  I  have  anticipated   this

interruption!  I was away when the incident  I  am

about  to  relate occurred. My house stands  on  a

rather small road called Meyappa Chettiar Road. My

family  were  all  there, one evening  during  the

riots,  when an organised body of rioters  marched

down  Meyappa Chettiar Road towards the  vegetable

farming area called Potong



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 532</b></font><br><br>



Pasir.  The  people  on the  sides  of  the  road

spontaneously organised themselves. A considerable

number - I do not know how many but enough  to  fill

the  house apparently - came up to my house and  the

women and children were put up in the bedrooms and

down  below the men stood guard outside with their

parangs  and their sticks. They had not  organised

beforehand. They saw what seemed to them to  be  a

danger  coming  along and they took  refuge  where

they  thought there was a good defensible position

on  top  of  a  hill; and they got the  women  and

children quickly upstairs and they stood  by  down

below and they were ready to defend themselves  if

they  had  been  attacked. That  seems  to  me  an

example  of  free  people moving into  spontaneous

organisation against other people who are  not  in

spontaneous  but in pre-arranged organisation.  As

the  rioters went on - they did not, in fact, attack

the area where these people had taken refuge (they

were humble people and did not deserve attack, but

they  thought they were going to get it) - they came

to  the Bailey bridge, which was put up after  the

floods  of 1954, and when the people on the  other

side  of the river realised they were approaching,

Mr  Speaker, some of the farmers started  beating

their buckets and tin cans in the same way as they

beat  them when an eclipse is coming, and all over

that valley of humble vegetable farmers the lights

went  out.  That was all - just like  that.  I  have

described two different kinds of people. It was an

extraordinary thing to see - little houses going out

into  darkness under the threat of the approaching

rioters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that was spontaneous organisation, and I

set against this analysis of organising the masses

the  principle  of human individuality,  of  human

freedom  and a society that seeks to liberate  the

individual,   to  set  him  free  for   the   full

development of his personality. That is  an  ideal

but we have not got it yet in Singapore. We have a

long way to go. We have only democracy in part.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember in one speech the Member for Tanjong

Pagar  said that if you believe in democracy,  you

must  believe in it absolutely. I agree in a sense

but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 533</b></font><br><br>



I  do  not  think  that it follows  that  you  can

immediately and always maintain all the  machinery

of  democracy.  It does not always  operate.  Open

trial,   free   speech,   free   assembly,    free

publication - all the democratic rights  which  you

can  find listed in the political books - they  are

machinery and a very desirable machinery, but they

do not always work. If you are going on a journey,

it  is  usually a very good thing to have a motor-car  and  go  in a motor-car. But a motor-car  can

break  down; a motor-car can be misused and turned

into a means of danger. If the motor-car will  not

work,  then  you had better abandon the  motor-car

and  finish  your journey on foot as long  as  you

want to get on with your journey. In the same way,

I  am afraid sometimes the machinery of democracy,

as  generally accepted, does not always  work  and

you  may sometimes have to by-pass it and try  and

complete   your   journey   and   get   to    your

objective - and your objective is personal  freedom.

Now   where  organised  intimidation  exists,  Mr

Speaker,  some parts of the machine are definitely

unworkable. The machinery of open trial is not  an

easy machine to operate. It never has been.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote another example from what I am told

is  a  very reliable source about the riots. I  am

going  to conceal this slightly because I  checked

up before I decided to use this in my speech and I

was asked not to mention it at all; but I am going

to  mention  it  and I am going to  conceal  it  a

little bit so that it will not be easy to put  the

finger   on   my  informants.  A  Chinese-speaking

Chinese looked out of his window and saw a gang of

rioters    starting   to   make   a    road-block,

accumulating their bottles and their iron  bars

and  getting themselves into position to  try  and

trap  a car. This Chinese was horrified. He  spent

some time trying to make up his mind whether to do

anything, and finally he got to his telephone  and

telephoned  to a friend to tell him about  it.  He

said,  "Will you, my friend, please telephone  the

police  because  I dare not? I fear  these  people

should  somehow  get to know  that  I  have  given

information about it. But I do not know  who  they

are.  They  are just figures down the street-three

or four



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 534</b></font><br><br>



storeys down below there. I can see them but I  do

not  know who they are. I dare not tell the police

that they are there." That was how the police  got

to  know  of  it,  through  second  or  third - hand

telephone  calls before somebody was  found  brave

enough to telephone the police. That is the degree

of  fear  under which the people are operating  in

Singapore - under the threat of riots, intimidation,

acid in your face and a bullet in your brain.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that seems to be perhaps a doubtful example

because that was a time of great stress and  fear,

let  me take one example of unwillingness to  give

evidence  in a time of relative peace  and  quiet.

Another  Chinese  took  a  child  to  the  General

Hospital  for treatment. The Chinese doctor  there

was extremely uncivil and insisted on delivering a

lecture on political theory instead of getting  on

and  giving the child the treatment that it should

have  had.  He was very uncivil to the  person  in

charge of the child. But I heard of this; my blood

did  not  quite  boil but it  simmered  a  bit.  I

managed  to  contact the original person  to  whom

this had happened. I checked up and the reply was,

"Yes, the story is correct." "Will you give me the

time,  the day, and, if you can, the name  of  the

doctor,  and as many other details as you  can  so

that  I can get some action taken?" But the  reply

was "No", and I worked for half an hour trying  to

convince this person that it was right and  proper

that the information should be given, so that  the

doctor could be told that he must do his duty as a

doctor   and   not   mix  it  up  with   political

indoctrination. But I could not get permission  to

give  that  information and I could  not  get  the

details.  That is the degree to which some  people

in  Singapore are afraid to come forward and  give

evidence. Anybody who knows anything about it will

be  able  to  give  you dozens and  hundreds  more

examples of the same kind of thing, because  there

has  been so much intimidation and people who have

tried to do what they knew was right have so often

to pay a bitter and terrible price. I hope that in

this case we shall have the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 535</b></font><br><br>



evidence and that some trials will be possible but

we  have  to have that background in our minds  of

the  fear of coming out and saying openly, "I  saw

this. I swear that this is true."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This demand for open trials has been made again

and  again by the People's Action Party, but  they

had  better check up because, if I may quote  from

experience  of  five years ago in  rather  similar

circumstances,  it  is not always  true  that  the

person  who has been detained wants an open trial.

This  sounds  surprising, but I know  this  for  a

fact. In 1951, at the beginning of the first  term

of  the  schools, a large number  of  people  were

picked up by the Special Branch and detained under

the  Emergency Regulations. Amongst them were  the

President of the Singapore Teachers' Union, Mr P.

V.  Sharma,  and the Secretary, Mr  C.  V.  Devan

Nair.  The  Union  Committee,  very  rightly   and

properly,  immediately called  a  general  meeting

which  I  attended; and the proposal was that  the

Union should unanimously demand an open trial  for

these  two  valued  officers and  that  the  Union

should  raise  a  large fighting fund  and  should

employ  Mr D. N. Pritt, Q.C., as the counsel  for

the  defence. I was in sympathy with that,  but  I

got  up and made one point, and that was they  had

better  check  up first whether  or  not  the  two

valued officers of the Union did, in fact, want an

open  trial,  as  the  Union  thought.  The  Union

therefore elected a Committee of three - two  others

and  myself - to go to Changi Prison and  see  these

gentlemen  and to find out whether they wanted  an

open trial or not. We went off. The police gave us

every facility. We had a private room in which  to

see  them - that was not a facility we  should  have

been   given;  we  should  have  had  a  policeman

present, I believe, but I think by now the offence

(if  there  was  one)  against the  regulations  is probably  cold. I think we spent about  20  or  25 minutes  arguing with them, and trying to convince them  that an open trial was feasible and possible and  right,  that we could get a  good  lawyer  to defend them and that we could find

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 536</b></font><br><br>



the money. But the answer was "No". Subsequently I

had  a  letter from Mr Devan Nair,  when  he  was

removed to St. John's Island, saying that  I  had

been  spreading  false rumours about  him  to  the

effect  that  he  did not want an open  trial.  He

said, "It is not that we do not want a trial.  It

is  because we have no faith in any trial that  we

can  get in Singapore." As far as I can recollect,

that was the point. It was a difficult point to me

because, as far as I could gather, he had no faith

in  any  trial which could be given in  Singapore.

Therefore presumably he did not want any trial. It

was with difficulty that we accepted this position

because we felt that it put a stigma on the  whole

Union - that these two officers were not willing  to

take  the  justice of the courts of Singapore.  In

fact,  the money which was raised had to be  spent

on  cigarettes  and biscuits and books  and  other

things, because they would not have a lawyer, they

did not want to go into the courts of Singapore. I

am  dropping this into the People's Action Party's

mind  because  they may come up against  the  same

sort o difficulty again. I do not say it will;  it

may not be so, but there it is, it is a matter  on

record. I have the file.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to under-stress the dangers of by-passing any of the democratic safeguards

which are parts of the democratic machinery - open

trials and other matters of that sort -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It does appear that the Minister will take some time. I think this

is an appropriate time to suspend. I will take the

we  broke  for  our lunch that there were  certain

practical limitations



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 537</b></font><br><br>



on  the machinery of democracy in Singapore and  I

spoke  particularly of the difficulties over  open

trials,  whether from those who will give evidence

or from those who are going to be tried. I am most

anxious  that I should not in any way misrepresent

Mr  Sharma  and Mr Devan Nair, particularly  Mr

Devan  Nair,  who  now perhaps  faces  open  trial

again.  I have not looked at the file in  which  I

have all these records for some months. I used  it

to  write  a  letter  to Fajar of  the  University

Socialist  Club.  I  do  not  know  whether   they

published it but I sent it to them explaining  the

facts I have given in this Assembly today. I think

it  might be right to add that my impression, when

I  saw  Mr  Sharma and Mr Devan Nair  in  Changi

Prison, was that it was Mr Sharma who was opposed

to  the open trial and Mr Devan Nair seemed to me

to  have been willing to go to trial if his senior

and  Union President had not been unwilling.  That

is  only an impression and I would not like to say

anything  more about it in case I did misrepresent

in  any  way. I do not want also, Mr Speaker,  my

remarks  about the difficulty of getting  evidence

to  be  taken  as misrepresenting  the  people  of

Singapore. I have given examples of the reluctance

to  speak up and give evidence to lay bare  things

that  were wrong but that is not the whole  story.

There  are plenty of cases of people who  do  show

great  courage and willingness to face the burdens

of  citizenship and those people I  am  sure  have

been  much encouraged and strengthened by the firm

leadership of our Chief Minister and by the action

of  the  Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of his speech,

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee  Kuan  Yew)

said  that  he  and his Party had lived  with  the

problem   of  winning  people  to  democracy,   of

avoiding a political cleavage, for two years. Some

of my colleagues and myself have lived with it for

eight years since the founding of the Labour Party

of Singapore -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> It died a natural death.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> We went into that Party as amateurs.

We  made  mistakes and our political net  included

some rather odd fish. Many of them, I am happy  to

say here, as the Opposition has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 538</b></font><br><br>



pointed  out,  died  a natural  death;  others,  I

think, are moribund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might illustrate the difference in our

approach - what  I  regard as the  fully  democratic

approach - and  the rather less democratic  approach

of  some sections of the People's Action Party  by

referring to the history of the Member for  Farrer

Park  (Mr A. R. Lazarous) who did beat Mr  Devan

Nair  of  the People's Action Party in  open  free

elections  in  Farrer Park in  1955.  I  will  say

nothing  of the methods by which he achieved  that

victory.  Later  in  the same year,  he  tried  to

become  President of the Labour Front.  He  failed

and I will say nothing of the methods by which he

tried to achieve that other victory which ended in

defeat. He subsequently left the Labour Front  and

crossed  to  the  Opposition and in  ally  on  4th

October,  he  gave  his voice in  support  of  the

People's  Action Party motion - a most  embarrassing

moment.  I am sure, for the People's Action  Party

and  one  which they will have some difficulty  in

living  down.  But I will give them  courage  that

although  it  must have been embarrassing  at  the

time,  I  am sure they need not fear that he  will

stay  with  them very long without his  allegiance

being   transferred  elsewhere  on  a   convenient

occasion. I would not have spent much time on  the

Member  for  Farrer  Park  except  that  he   does

illustrate so well the limitations on democracy in

Singapore  and  the fact that, in spite  of  those

limitations,  democracy  can  work.  We  do   have

breakdowns;  we  do have errors; we  slip  and  we

stumble and we lose our way in the half-light  but

we  do go forward. We do overcome the difficulties

and  as the Member for Tanjong Pagar pointed  out,

you do get a natural political death for those who

are unsuited for a healthy political life.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time, Mr Speaker. Sir, when I

personally hoped that the Member for Tanjong Pagar

might  have been one of a united social democratic

labour movement in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I was a true Democrat-Socialist.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> There was an opportunity but the

opportunity  came  to  nothing.  After  no   doubt

careful thought



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 539</b></font><br><br>



and study, he did not feel able to make that unity

and  the  result was that the Labour movement  was

split  into three: the Labour Front influence,  the

People's  Action Party influence and the Communist

influence. The result of that was that there was a

great  deal  more  freedom of  manoeuvre  for  the

Communists.  Now,  I assume his reasons - I  do  not

know  his reasons but he can correct me  if  I  am

wrong - that  he looked at the Socialist Party,  the

Labour  Party, the Labour Front and he saw certain

things  that seemed to him somewhat comic. He  saw

some  rather odd fish, as I have said.  He  saw  a

lack  of  the  cadres and the ground organisations

and the emotional appeals, and so forth -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Integrity!



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> - to which he gives the very highest

value   and  I  think  that  he  undervalued   the

discrimination  and the ability of the  individual

voter. He thought us ill-organised; he thought  we

lacked  drive and dynamism and he thought that  we

lacked  integrity. I think he still  thinks  those

things  about us to some extent. Probably we  have

more organisation that he gives us credit for.  We

have  a  membership of between 11,000  and  12,000

people  who  have joined the Party as  individuals

and not as a mass organised membership but we have

never  sought  to  organise  the  masses  in   the

Communist   method.  We  have  sought   individual

support - people who can judge for themselves, think

for  themselves and decide for themselves.  We  do

not want masses who are manipulated. I do not deny

the value, Mr Speaker, of the masses approach  in

certain  circumstances. If I had been in China  in

1947  or in Russia in 1917, I should probably have

given my support to Mao Tse-tung or to Lenin but I

hope  I  should have had the courage to refuse  my

support  to Stalin when he turned the system  into

an  abominable tyranny. The point I am  trying  to

arrive  at, Mr Speaker, is that you have to  take

account   of   the  realities  of   a   particular

situation.  When  the Greek classic  law-giver  and

politician Solon was asked, "What is the best form

of government?", his reply was. "For



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 540</b></font><br><br>

whom,  at what time?". For Singapore at this time,

I  believe  that  the best form of  government  is

democracy  but I also believe that it is necessary

to  ensure the growth and strength of democracy by

removing  the weeds which seek to strangle  it.  I

know  that there is a danger in by-passing any  of

the  machinery  of  democracy, of  the  safeguards

which are established and recognised and proved in

past  experience: one of them is open trial  which

we  have been discussing, but it is only a part of

the  machinery. The vital purpose of democracy  is

the  freedom of the individual - the full growth  of

the  human  personality. Communism  in  Singapore

would  be a step backward, a step downward  and  a

step  away from our achievements and it  would  be

social,  economic and political  suicide  for  us

because  we are beyond that stage and I hope  that

we shall never be driven back to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the people of Singapore understand

and  accept  the  purpose  of  the  Labour  Front-Alliance Coalition Government. I believe that they

share our faith in the individual. I believe  that

they share our conviction that the individual must

be  protected against conspiracy, intimidation,  a

life  of fear and the threat of having his freedom

taken  from  him.  It is in that  conviction,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, that I urge this House  to  support

the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Minister

for Education.



<br><br>2.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, we have heard many speeches today and some of

them,  to  my  astonishment,  made  no  reference

whatsoever  to  the  original  motion  or  to  the

amendment and so I am saying at the start  that  I

support the amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have frequently noticed, Sir, following the

dull  periods of plain legislating in  this  House

especially  the  Committee stages of  Bills,  that

whenever  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar  (Mr  Lee

Kuan Yew) rises to his feet to move a motion or to

speak in a debate, a hush falls over the House and

hon.   Members   and  the  public  gallery   await

expectantly the flow of controversial matter,  the

castigation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 541</b></font><br><br>



of Government and the animadversions of whiteskins

that  one  associates with all utterances  of  the

hon. Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday it was as I thought it would be: I

think   I  could  have  forecast  with  reasonable

accuracy at least 90 per cent of what he said  but

never, if I may say so, has the hon. Member to  my

ears sounded so unconvincing or so utterly biased.

He  was  quick to bring references to Hungary  and

Poland  into his speech because he could  scarcely

omit  reference  to these places  as  it  was  his

intention  later on in his speech to  make  a  big

play  of Suez. The interpretation he gave of world

affairs in his speech yesterday seemed to me to be

only  remotely  connected with the motion  but  it

certainly gave him an opportunity to sing  a  hymn

of  hate against the British. I assert - and I  care

not how much the elected Members on both sides  of

the  House  may laugh - that the British  have  very

little to be ashamed of and much to be proud of in

the  history of the administration of this country

and  that it was achieved with blood and sweat and

exploitation is, to my mind, a myth cooked  up  by

the     latter-day     have-nots     and     their

representatives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member took a great deal of time in

recapitulating the series of events which  led  up

to  the riots. In this, he told us nothing. He did

however  tell us that the Member for  Bukit  Timah

(Mr  Lim Ching Siong) was actually waiting to  be

picked  up  by  the  Police which  also  does  not

surprise me not, as he suggested, because the Hon.

the  Chief  Minister  in his  earlier  speech  had

revealed   his  intention  in  this  respect   but

probably because he was guilty.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Come, come. Mr Speaker, Sir,

on  a point of order. You have just heard the Hon.

the   Chief   Minister  and   the   Minister   for

Communications and Works mention this morning  the

possibility  of the Member for Bukit  Timah  being

brought forward for open trial and I think that it

is  absolutely  unheard of for a  Member  of  this

Assembly to say beforehand if he thinks the Member

for Bukit Timah is guilty.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 542</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Probably.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if that was

said  in court, Mr Sutherland will serve  a  term

for contempt.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The relevant Standing Order is

Standing Order 31 (2)  which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reference shall not be made to any matter which

is  sub  judice,  in such a way as  might  in  the

opinion  of the Speaker or Chairman prejudice  the

interests of parties thereto."



<br><br>I  do agree with the Member for Tanjong Pagar that

that  matter is, in fact, sub judice and  I  think

the hon. Member ought to withdraw his remarks.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I gladly

withdraw  in  the light of your interpretation  of

the  remarks I made. The Member for Tanjong  Pagar

did  say  that  the  Member for  Bukit  Timah  was

expecting  to  be picked up and  I  only  gave  my

interpretation of why he thought so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar asked yesterday,

"Who began the trouble and who is responsible  for

it?"  Surely, these questions were rhetorical.  In

his   lecture   to  the  Government  Benches,   he

suggested  that  the  Labour Front  Coalition  had

cooked  its goose because they used British troops

to  help the Police in, suppressing the riots.  In

so  doing,  according to him, they have  lost  the

support of the masses. It would be interesting  to

know  just how many people in Singapore, excluding

the  British,  gave thanks at the  time  of  these

riots  for the very presence of these troops.  His

remarks   about  the  General  Officer  Commanding

Singapore  Base  District and the Commissioner  of

Police  seemed  to me to be scarcely  adult;  that

their pictures appeared in the Press showing  them

as  directing operations may have annoyed the hon.

Member  but the Commissioner of Police happens  to

be  British and surely no one would be so naive as

to  except  that  anyone  else  would  direct  the

disposition  of  Police  forces  in  an  emergency

except  him.  This is after all  still  a  British

colony.  That the forces the Government have  been

fighting against were subversive in every sense of

the word will be denied by no one except



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 543</b></font><br><br>

the 2� per cent representation of the population

of the People's Action Party plus the few thousand

misguided  school children - God pity them - who  have

been led astray by people who are scarcely capable

of  thinking straight. If only those opposing  the

Government would pause to take stock of the damage

they  are  doing  in retarding  progress  in  this

country  towards self-government, they might  have

another think about it. Of course, I realise  that

this is the sort of thing one might expect to come

from  a  person  in my position.  The  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  has told the House that  he  would

have me deported if he had the chance. I think, in

this  respect,  he  may  be  slipping  because   I

remember  about  a  year ago  in  this  House,  he

indicated  that  when he was in power,  he,  as  a

gracious host, would welcome the British.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Only to polite guests.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> But what about the Chief Minister

of  the  Federation in this respect? Is he  too  a

colonial  stooge? Whether he is or is not,  it  is

plain  that the events of the past two  weeks  can

have  done  little  to help  the  cause  of  self-

government   or   to  bring  the  Federation   and

Singapore  together  and the realisation  of  this

fact  has  been  implicit in some of  the  Tunku's

recent utterances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sir, I often think that the bitterness the

Member  for  Tanjong  Pagar  lets  flow  into  his

speeches  particularly in regard to all  questions

relating to expatriates and colonialism stems from

a  conviction that he is the intellectual superior

of  most  businessmen in Singapore  and  indeed  I

think  he  is  right but this I  submit  does  not

excuse  what  appears  to  me  at  times   to   be

arrogance, arrogance that leads to such statements

as  he  made  on the 4th of October last  when  he

said, "... little men in Singapore do not understand

that we are a part of a world revolution." But  in

what context did he utter these words? He had been

speaking  of  Russia!  Russia,  whose  action   in

Eastern  Europe  makes  the  Franco-British   Suez

affair sound like a school picnic. Anyway,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 544</b></font><br><br>



the  hon.  Member  said, "The whole  international

Communist and anti-Communist position has  changed

with the hydrogen bomb." Frankly, I did not follow

the  relevance of that statement but if  he  meant

that  the Communist plan for world domination  has

been  halted because the West is at least  as  far

ahead  in the knowledge of nuclear fission as  the

Russians, he is right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then went on to speak of the whole Communist

philosophy having radically changed following  de-Stalinisation, peaceful co-operation and  peaceful

competition.  As  I  see  it,  the  hon.  Member's

refusal  throughout the life of this  Assembly  to

join in what he and his Party call "anti-Communist

hysteria"   was   just   as   great   before   de-Stalinisation   but  how  utterly  ludicrous   and

laughable are these words of the hon. Member  that

I  have  just read in view of the events in Poland

and  Hungary. I suppose the P.A.P. will deny  that

those  who  rose in revolt against their Communist

masters -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Were nationalists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> - were not the people, the

masses, that the P.A.P. are always talking  about.

What  a  shock  it  must have  been  to  Communist

supporters  to  have heard that the insurgents  in

Budapest appealed to the British Legation there to

inform the world of the justice of their struggle!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my mind, Sir, the terrible thing about the

speech the Member for Tanjong Pagar made yesterday

is  that although his motion is a condemnation  of

Government's arrest of sundry persons under sundry

Ordinances, he was able to say nothing  to  refute

the  charges  of - shall I say, if  I  may  coin  a

phrase -  "un-trade unionism" levelled against  the

backbone  of his Party, the Singapore Factory  and

Shop   Workers'  Union  and  could  only  complain

because  the  employers had also instituted  their

private  purges following the shining  example  of

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tacitly too, he seems to approve of school

children  who  have no business whatsoever  to  be

mixed up in politics,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 545</b></font><br><br>



being the spark that sets off the big blaze.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, the one good thing coming out of this

debate,  to my mind, is that it has revealed  that

the  extreme Left is beginning to squeal. Although

the  elected Members of the Government claim  full

responsibility  for  their actions,  attempts  are

still being made to blame it on the British.



<br><br>2.54 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I rise to support the amendment  to

the  original motion introduced by the Member  for

Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What arguments has the Member for Tanjong Pagar

advanced   to   support  his  motion?   Absolutely

nothing!  The  sum total of what he  has  said  in

favour  of the motion is, "What evidence have  you

got for arresting the persons under the Ordinance?

If  you  have any evidence, let us have it."  Have

not  hon.  Members and members of the public  been

supplied with ample evidence?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar spent an hour in a

tirade  against  Sir Anthony Eden and  his  policy

regarding  the  Suez Canal. That  course,  as  Mr

Sutherland has rightly said, was expected. He also

venomously attacked the British. I fail to see the

analogy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is our country, the country we love and

the  country  in  which we hope  to  die.  In  the

cemeteries  of  Singapore are  the  graves  of  my

forefathers  and the forefathers of  many  of  the

elected  Members on both sides of this  House.  We

are  all striving for a merdeka in which Singapore

can  be  governed, as I said in my  broadcast  the

other  night,  by true and loyal Singaporeans  and

not  by  those  whose thoughts and  loyalties  lie

elsewhere. We want a Singapore where all races can

live in peace and harmony. Although, as yet, we do

not  have a fully-constituted self-government, the

decision  to  clamp down on the pernicious  groups

existing  in  our midst was made  by  the  elected

Ministers  who take full responsibility for  their

action.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 546</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister and the Minister for

Education  gave  hon. Members and members  of  the

public  as full an account as was possible of  the

background and it is hardly necessary  for  me  to

recapitulate the history and causations  of  those

disturbing days but I would ask Members especially

those who feel inclined to criticise Government or

who are a little undecided as to which way to vote

to please give a little serious thought to certain

aspects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 4th of October and again yesterday

morning,  the Hon. the Chief Minister stated  that

through    certain   channels   of    information,

Government   was   aware  of   vicious   Communist

activities  in  what were, on the  face,  innocent

organisations. The Hon. the Chief Minister and his

colleagues made it clear that Government would not

leave a stone unturned in its endeavour to deal  a

crushing blow to this menace so that the people in

Singapore in all walks of life and, in particular,

the   workers,  the  farmers,  the   hawkers   and

students - yes, the students who, in refusing to  be

indoctrinated with the pernicious ideologies, were

living  in constant fear and intimidation - so  that

they  may go about their normal chores and studies

free  and  unfettered as every citizen is entitled

to.   The  intended  campaign  of  Government  was

welcomed  by hon. Members of this House  who  have

the  interest  of  Singapore at heart  except,  of

course, the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did a Member of this Party say - a Member who

is conspicuous by his absence - to what the Hon. the

Chief Minister said the other day? He said:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A hundred Hon. Mr Lim Yew Hocks cannot destroy

this  movement. A hundred Hon. Mr Lim  Yew  Hocks

will only find their political graves in trying to

destroy  this invincible movement for freedom  and

democratic  rights for the people of this  country

This  movement  is an organic part of  the  mighty

current  of  the  Asian revolution.  The  greatest

military powers of the Western world have  had  to

retreat  before this invincible current,  and  the

Hon. Mr Lim Yew Hock is nothing in comparison."



<br><br>And he wound up with this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One last warning to the Chief Minister. My Party

(that  is, the P.A.P.) and my Union (that is,  the

Singapore  Factory and Shop Workers'  Union)  have

already   said  that  we  will  use  all  possible

peaceful  and  constitutional  means  to   protest

against Government's



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 547</b></font><br><br>



action,  and  the  Chief Minister  has  assured  a

delegation from my Union that he will afford every

facility  for peaceful and constitutional protest.

I shall hold the Chief Minister to his promise for

his own good."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Police raided his Union overturning and

burning   of  motor  cars  belonging  to  innocent

citizens.  Were these ingredients a constitutional

and   peaceful  process  which  the  hon.   Member

painting  of the President of the Middle  Schools'

Union  were found in the schools. Workers'  Union)

in  Bukit Timah (his constituency), what did  they

find? The place was housed by a large number of so-called  unionists and students who put up a strong

resistance. Home-made weapons, bottles  containing

acid  and  documents  were seized - documents  which

clearly  indicated  a programme  of  violence  and

destruction. The same were found in other premises

from   which  the  rioters  were  receiving  their

directives and among the rioters were students who

(that is, the Singapore Factory and Shop took part in  the  throwing  of  bottles,  spoke  of?  Large victory  banners  and  a were  these  not  all  in readiness to proclaim the victory which they  with the  support  of pseudo-unionists and  thugs  were confident in gaining? There was plenty of evidence to justify Government's action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hon.  Members  must  have faith  in  the  elected

Government  and  if their faith is  misplaced,  no

single person on this side of the House will wish

to  remain a single day longer nor will he be able

to  face the decent citizens of Singapore with a

free conscience.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I thought we have lost it a

long time ago.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Government was aware that there were

destructive  forces  who were working  behind  the

apparent calm and it was imperative for action  to

be  taken  then and there and not later. From  the

outcome  of  events  which  followed  Government's

action,  it  is abundantly evident that Government

acted in good time and in this Government had  the

full  and  able  co-operation of the military,  the

Police  and the Federation. Hon. Members can  well

imagine   the   complete   chaos,   the    wanton

destruction of life and property which would  have

ensued if these pernicious groups had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 548</b></font><br><br>



their  way  and compare that with the little  that

was suffered when we had the full co-operation  of

the  forces.  Victory  over constituted  authority

would  have  been celebrated with a procession  of

these  banners no doubt accompanied with  jubilant

singing and dancing. The "invincible power"  would

flourish  and  Members of this Assembly - at  least,

those  who  would  be  in the  seats  then -  would

probably  be expected to do the yanko  dance  when

the Speaker enters with a hammer and sickle in his

hands,  instead  of  standing  with  respect   and

dignity as we do now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge all hon. Members of this House to support

the  amendment and thus support the Government  in

its "Operation Liberation". "Operation Liberation"

is  an  integral  part  of  what  the  Member  for

Cairnhill  (Mr  D. S. Marshall)  referred  to  as

"Operation Merdeka". We all know why we failed  in

the  constitutional talks but with the  successful

"Operation Liberation" (or substantially  so),  we

will  be  in a position to attain merdeka  from  a

position of strength and I agree that there is  no

better  man capable of doing that than our present

Chief  Minister  and then, when we  have  attained

merdeka,  to have Singapore governed,  as  I  have

said,  by true and loyal Singaporeans and  not  by

pseudo-politicians or politicians who  seek  power

or  politicians who have a nest-egg  elsewhere  to

which they can fly when Singapore is in a bad way.

1  support the amendment, Mr Speaker, Sir, and  I

urge all Members of this House to do the same.



<br><br>3.03 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

yesterday  after  I heard the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar  deliver his speech in which  he  moved  his

motion,  the first impression that struck  me  was

that  the  Governor of Jerusalem, Pontius  Pilate,

had  come to life in Singapore again, and  he  had

washed  his hands and said, "No, I had nothing  to

do  with the Israelites. I had nothing to do  with

the crucifixion of Jesus Christ."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unusual speech delivered by the most learned

and  brilliant orator in this country, the  Member

for  Tanjong Pagar, appeared to me to be so  weak,

so vague



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 549</b></font><br><br>



and  so confused that I could not understand  his

intentions. What does he stand for and what is his

policy?  Today  I  have discovered  that  he  is

prepared  to make use of the Member for  Sembawang

(Inche  Ahmad Bin Ibrahim) - I think he is a member

of the P.A.P. by now - to defend his Party's policy.

I   admit  that  after  I  heard  the  Member  for

Sembawang  speak, I felt that it was  P.A.P.,  stuff,

but  definitely  not  the kind  delivered  by  the

Member for Tanjong Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I am not in the Government, I do not

have -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What a shame!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng:</b> - the opportunity of getting

information from the Special Branch. Therefore, I

cannot  say  whether  those  arrested  and   those

dissolved organisations are subversive or  not.  I

am  also not a member of the P.A.P., and I have no

connection with those arrested and those dissolved

organisations. Therefore, I cannot definitely  say

whether  they are subversive or whether  they  are

not  undesirable organisations. But one  thing  is

very  clear in my mind, and that is that  all  the

troubles  that we have are very closely  connected

with the P.A.P. and with the mover of the original

motion.  The Member for Tanjong Pagar can  lie  to

anybody, but he cannot lie to me, Sir. He can say,

"No,  the  P.A.P. has  no  connection  with  the

student  movement. The P.A.P. has never  used  the

students for its political campaigns."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind the Member for Tanjong Pagar - if he

can  recall  as far back as the year  1954 - of  the

time  when the new Bedok settlement suffered  from

floods.  Then, the leader of the P.A.P. led  five

lorry loads of Chinese school students to the  new

Bedok   settlement  to  start  relief   work,   to

distribute  sweets - genuine sweets - and sweet  words

too,  after  the Chinese Chamber of  Commerce  had

joined  with  the  Social  Welfare  Department  in

spending more than $100,000 on flood relief.  That

was  the first time that I realised how clever the

P.A.P. are in their planning and tactics to  make

use of Chinese



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 550</b></font><br><br>



students. If the P.A.P. are not supported  by  the

Chinese school students, I wonder whether they can

still  claim that the P.A.P. is the only Party  in

Singapore  that stands alone today.  If  the  hon.

Member  were honest when he answered the statement

made  by  the  Chief Minister of  the  Federation,

Tunku Abdul Rahman, condemning any politician who

tries  to  make  use of students  as  a  political

criminal, then, by now, I hope that all Members in

this  House,  as well as the people of  Singapore,

can  clearly understand and point out who are the

political criminals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Member for Tanjong Pagar was the adviser

to the dissolved Chinese Middle Schools' Students'

Union, Mr Speaker, Sir, I wonder whether I am  at

liberty  to ask him a few questions. Did  he  give

any  advice  other than from the  legal  point  of

view?  Can he tell us, "No, I was only an honorary

legal  adviser. I only give advice  to  the  Union

from  the  legal point of view."? Can  we  believe

that, Sir? Can we believe that such a dynamic  and

powerful  and  influential political  leader  just

gave only legal advice to the Union? I believe the

hon. Member has the ability and thinks it even his

duty to advise the Union other than from the legal

point  of  view. Further, as he claims to  be  the

leader of Singapore, did he ever tell the truth to

the  Chinese  school students  that  this  country

lives  only  on entrepot trade, especially  as  we

have little chance to merge with the Federation of

Malaya?  Then,  did he consider  it  advisable  to

encourage  the Chinese school students to  believe

that  the Communist system must be introduced into

this  country?  Did he advise the  Chinese  school

students that, although every Chinese in Singapore

is  entitled  to  express his admiration  for  new

China,  loyalty to Singapore must come first?  Did

he  tell  the  students that we cannot  afford  to

create unnecessary class hatred, one indication of

which  is  that  the  students always  charge  the

Chinese  Chamber of Commerce as being capitalists?

Therefore,  down  with  the  Chinese  Chamber   of

Commerce!  Class  hatred  is  so  rooted  in   the

students'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 551</b></font><br><br>



minds.  What  capitalists are  there  existing  in

Singapore?  To me, the many millionaires  that  we

have   here  are  not  all  capitalists  but  just

professional    gamblers.    What    can     these

"capitalists" invest in this country? Most of  our

capitalists  rely on telephones to  conduct  their

business.  Sometimes  I think,  if  our  telephone

system  goes out of order for just one  day,  many

millionaires will be bankrupt!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, did the Member for Tanjong Pagar say that

the short-cut towards merdeka for this country can

never be achieved by a violent revolution? We have

heard  the hon. Member always professing to follow

the  Nehru line. The Nehru line shows us  that  we

can  achieve  independence by peaceful  evolution.

Did  he  also  make clear to the  Chinese  school

students  that he himself and the P.A.P. are  not

only   strongly  against  colonialism   but   also

strongly against Communism? I wish the hon. Member

can give me an answer to these questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that yesterday, when the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar moved his motion, he never  touched

on  it  but  referred  to  international  affairs:

Hungary  and the Suez Canal. I was very interested

when  he mentioned the Suez Canal, especially when

he   put  this  question - I  think  twice - to   the

Minister  for Communications and Works,  "What  is

your  stand on the Suez Canal?" Now I want to  ask

the  hon. Member himself, "What stand do you take?

As  an Asian, as a believer in the Asian / African

Conference  spirit, what will your Party  give  as

aid  to President Nasser of Egypt? Why can you not

call  your colleague, Mr Jamit Singh, to start  a

water-front  strike in moral support of  President

Nasser? Why do you not make a statement expressing

your feelings on the Suez Canal issue? Why do  you

not also make a statement to express your feelings

when  thousands  of Russian tanks  rolled  towards

Budapest and you claim that you are for liberation

and  the crushing down of counter-revolutionaries?

What is the P.A.P. stand on that?"



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, despite my strong support of the Government

action against subversion,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 552</b></font><br><br>



I feel   that   it  is  my  duty  to  make   certain

criticisms. The Government, it seems to me, cannot

fully   understand  the  masses,  especially   the

Chinese-speaking  masses.  Sir,   the   Government

cannot   understand  that  the   Chinese-speaking

population  in  Singapore are more sensitive  than

any  other race in Singapore. They have long  been

regarded   as  second-class  citizens,  especially

where   their   education  policy  is   concerned.

Therefore, on account of this, the Chinese  school

students do not feel that they are treated equally

with other students in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total number of Chinese students registered

in  the colony is more than 200,000. The number of

Chinese  middle school students is  slightly  over

10,000,  but  they  believe  that  their  movement

represents  the whole Singapore student  movement.

When  Chinese school students leave school,  they

are  faced with problems ahead. There is  a  well-known proverb amongst Chinese school students that

"Graduation means disappointment". When they leave

school,  it  is very difficult for  them  to  find

jobs.  Their  certificates are not recognised  and

their  future  is  not secure.  Their  citizenship

status  is  not  on  an equal footing  with  other

races.  As a result of all these factors, many  of

the  Chinese-speaking population  suffer  from  an

inferiority  complex. I hope that  the  Government

will  give  careful consideration to the  Chinese-speaking  masses,  and  try  to  understand  them,

especially   since  we  have  not  achieved   full

national  status and bearing in mind the  forceful

attraction  exerted from the Chinese mainland.  By

tradition  and culture, it is quite  difficult  to

expect  all  Chinese-speaking  people  to  express

their genuine loyalty to Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that I wish to criticise is

that,  since  the Government took action  on  18th

September,  they have done very little  to  inform

the  public of what they have done. Instead,  they

have  a  very strong organised movement  which  is

going  all  out  to do damage and to  mislead  the

masses, especially the lower income group.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 553</b></font><br><br>



Therefore  public opinion towards this  issue  has

become  divided and the Government seems  to  have

taken  no steps to prevent it. I am sure that  all

of  us could have foreseen the trouble coming  but

what  measures has the Government taken to prevent

it?  Anyhow, the damage has been done. However,  I

venture to suggest a few points to Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Hon. the Chief Minister has promised

and  named  a  date for merdeka,  why  do  we  not

immediately revive the All-Party Merdeka Committee

and sign a joint truce not to fight one another or

play  party politics any more, so that we  can  be

united into a solid body towards independence? Why

can  we not face facts? Today, the Hon. the  Chief

Minister addresses the Hon. the Chief Secretary as

"my  dear  colleague Bill", but I wonder  whether

the  Chief Secretary will sit next to Mr  Lennox-Boyd  next spring? Why should we not try  hard  to

have  peace during this transitional period  of  a

few  months only? In this particular case, I  wish

to  give a few reminders to the P.A.P. Why  should

they  shout  so loud to demand that the Government

must   resign   and  have  an  immediate   general

election?  For  what? For the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar's ambitions as a Prime Minister? Has he done

anything good for the independence movement?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to mention the Press. The Press in

Singapore,  I  am sure, must have a  double  duty.

They must report truly and honestly what they hear

and   what   they   see.  They   also   have   the

responsibility  of  educating our  people.  Public

opinion,  as  has  been  clearly  shown,  is  much

divided  between  the two groups - the  non-English-speaking and the non-Chinese-speaking - and  I wish

to  remind  the English Press, when reporting,  to

consider  at  the same time that they  print  over

100,000  copies  of their papers and  to  remember

that  there  are  also hundreds  of  thousands  of

readers  of  Chinese newspapers  who  are  reading

their  views.  We cannot deny the  fact  that  the

vernacular  papers, from time to time,  contradict

the English papers. We must find out why.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 554</b></font><br><br>



What  creates  that?  If these different  cultural

groups  cannot  fully understand and  respect  one

another  mutually, there will be  trouble  in  the

future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a Chinese, it is my fervent duty to speak as

a  Chinese, because the problems facing  us  today

are  so closely connected with the Chinese. I wish

to  tell  the  Chinese in Singapore that  we  must

recognise  one  very clear fact:  if  we  want  to

achieve  independence,  we  must  merge  with  the

Federation  of  Malaya, and if we merge  with  the

Federation of Malaya, our population will be  just

slightly over 50 per cent of the total. Therefore,

we  must learn how to understand and to co-operate

with  our brother races, the Malays, Indians, etc.

We  cannot always bear ourselves up traditionally,

culturally  or historically if we are too  closely

connected with the mainland of China and  we  may,

unintentionally    but   emotionally,    try    to

"chinanise" everything in this country, where many

other   races   are  living  together   especially

concerning   political  beliefs.  China   is   now

practising  Communism  and  we  cannot  say  that,

because   we  are  Chinese  and  China   practises

Communism,  we  should therefore  bring  Communist

China's  formula and pattern of living  into  this

country.  It will be very wrong and it  will  slow

down our progress towards independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that the Member for Cairnhill (Mr D. S. Marshall) mentioned the arrest of

the  Member for Bukit Timah (Mr Lim Ching  Siong)

and  he  suggested  that  this  House  should   be

informed  of  the  findings of the  trial  of  the

Member for Bukit Timah. I take this opportunity to

say  that, no matter how much I disagree with  the

Member  for  Bukit Timah, at least, he is  sincere

and honest in his beliefs - unlike the person who is

now washing his hands of the Middle Road Group.  I

wish  to point out to the Member for Tanjong Pagar

that,  since he has informed this House  that  the

Member for Bukit Timah is going to learn to master

the  English and Malay languages, it will be  very

amusing  to think that when - I do not know when - the

Member for Bukit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 555</b></font><br><br>

Timah  has  mastered them, it will  then  be  the

right time for the Member for Tanjong Pagar to get

in  to  learn  Chinese! Those are their  political

differences. As a result of the 13 deaths and over

a  hundred injured due to the riots, I realise for

the  first  time  now  how  cold-blooded  are  our

politicians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my friends told me that, from the look of

things at present, it would appear that the Labour

Front  is  ready to cash a cheque but  the  P.A.P.

wants  a  post-dated cheque. I was  asked  for  my

opinion as to who is right and who is wrong. I say

that  no matter whether the Labour Front wants  to

cash  the  cheque  now or whether  the  P.A.P. is

prepared to accept a post-dated cheque, they  both

must  make sure that the money is good,  that  is,

good  in  the  interests of  the  people  of  this

country.



<br><br>3.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

promised  support to the present  Government  till

the  next merdeka talks but that promise  was  not

unconditional. We reserved our right to  criticise

the  Government if it errs. Also, if any  Minister

misuses  his power and shows too much favouritism,

it is our right in the public interest to bring it

before this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will start on the question of curfew

first. Not only do I wish to criticise but just to

request  the  Government that,  perchance  such  a

situation arises, to avoid the hardships which had

been  unnecessarily  imposed on  the  public.  The

Government is bound to preserve law and order  but

by  taking  action  in  that  way  it  will  cause

hardships   which   will   create   a    lot    of

dissatisfaction and bitterness in the minds of the

masses. I will give you, Sir, some instances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, curfew was imposed in order to keep away

members  of the public from going about the  roads

to  create mischief but, Sir, where is the harm if

any man sits down in his verandah with his family?

It  is  surprising that he is ordered to  get  in!

Representations have been made to me from  my  own

constituency and they say, "The Ministers have got

air-conditioned offices and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 556</b></font><br><br>



beautiful  bungalows. It is very easy to  talk  to

the  public  from there and to ask the  public  to

excuse  them for the hardships. But what about  us

who  stay  in  shop  houses and  cubicles  without

ventilation?" In my constituency, the people  were

commanded to close even their windows. A group  of

thirty or forty workers living together were asked

to  close their windows. What do you expect  their

feelings  to  be? Yes, the Police might  say  that

missiles  might be thrown from those windows.  The

proper  thing  to do is that such mischief  makers

should  be  watched and arrested but not everybody

should  be asked to close their doors and windows.

Certainly not!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will mention one or two cases in which

innocent  people have been arrested. A coffee-shop

proprietor  opened his door to let a  customer  go

out.  Both he and the customer were arrested. This

is surely stupid.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Curfew!



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Persons returning from work were

also  arrested.  Certainly  the  Police  can   use

discretion. There were many such people  who  were

innocent  and  they  have  unnecessarily  suffered

hardship. I believe that they were only bailed out

for $5,000 by their friends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, I will quote another instance of what

happened  to me personally. After the long  curfew

from 3 p.m. on Saturday it was announced publicly

through the radio that the curfew would be  lifted

from  8 a.m. to 10 a.m. on Sunday morning to  allow

the  people to do their shopping. I was  going  at 8.35 a.m. from Stamford Road to Orchard Road and  I

saw a stream of cars being stopped at the Orchard

Road  Circus.  When my turn came, a British  Tommy

asked me, "Where is your pass?" I said, "There  is

no curfew between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m." He then said

curtly, "No, there is a curfew on. You must have a

pass. Go back." All the cars turned back and I had

to  travel two to three miles, more to reach home!

Sir,  why  this inefficiency? I do not  understand

how the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 557</b></font><br><br>



Hon. the   Chief   Secretary   who   has   been

administering the Government all along should have

found such negligence in his Ministry. That should

be  avoided if - God forbid - such an occasion arises.

The  funniest part was that I had to send  someone

to  a  Police station to get me a pass  because  a

British  Tommy  or  a Gurkha  did  not  know  that

Assemblymen  do  not  require passes.  The  Police

officer  said,  "Oh,  no passes  are  allowed  to

Assemblymen or otherwise." That was on the 29th at

the  Orchard Road Police Station at 9.30 a.m. I saw

a  Police circular dated the 28th that Assemblymen

are not required to have passes. However, this was

the confused state of affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was very amusing to hear non-Chinese

Ministers  during the curfew period talking  about

Chinese  education and culture. I think  the  best

people  to speak about Chinese culture are Chinese

Ministers. I will be very much annoyed if  a  non-Indian  talks  about  my  culture  with  a  little

knowledge. He has no business at all to do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have the greatest respect for my friend

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee  Kuan  Yew)

for his intelligence and for his study of politics

for  attaining  freedom for  this  country - a  non-Communist  and democratic Malaya. I  have  a  high

respect for him because during the last year and a

half,  I have found him never to be personal  even

when  he  is  attacked. Sir, personal  differences

should  be  forgotten when dealing  with  national

interests.  We  have  a brilliant  orator  in  the

person  of our former Chief Minister whose absence

was  so  much missed by the public. The  galleries

were  empty. "Romeo" was away. I am glad that  the

galleries are now full. The former Chief  Minister

confessed his failure this morning. The Member for

Tanjong Pagar and he are both brilliant men but  I

have   said   before  that  they  lack   practical

experience in politics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To win merdeka, tactics have to be adopted though

the   principles  should  not  be  sacrificed   or

compromised.  Tactics  which  are  most   suitable

should be adopted to achieve our aim. A great  man

like Gandhi took 30 years to perfect his weapon of

non-violence. There



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 558</b></font><br><br>



were riots and troubles. He advised his people  to

stop this violence and ultimately he succeeded. As

I  said, Sir, tactics are very necessary. Now, can

you  win  merdeka by violence? You  have  got  the

example  of  Cyprus before you. The British  rifle

there is to see things resume their way. Take also

British  Guiana. The Leftist Party  tried  to  run

things  in a leftist way and the constitution  was

suspended.   Take   another  example,   the   Suez

position. Britain is defying 62 nations. That is a

fact.   Then,  how  can  you  achieve   merdeka - by

violence? Certainly not! What will be the  result?

Our people will be shot and damage will be done to

our  own properties for which we will have to pay.

I  say that there should be a complete negation of

violence,   Then,  Sir,  is  the  United   Kingdom

Government  going to give us merdeka on  a  silver

tray  if we do not go their way? I have said  that

it   is   almost  impossible  to  get   from   the

Conservative Government any freedom unless  we  go

their  way. One thing is definite: violence should

be counted out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second way is by constitutional means and

peaceful  methods. You can see books and books  in

India  to  show you how freedom can  be  achieved.

They  are  worth reading. My advice is to  take  a

leaf   from  these  pages  and  follow  the   same

constitutional means of those countries which have

achieved freedom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, students who are below the voting age should

devote  their time to their studies  and,  at  the

same  time, to keep their eyes open as to what  is

happening  in  this  country  without  giving  any

allegiance  to  any Party but my advice  to  those

students who are of voting age and who will be our

future  leaders  is  that they should  take  every

possible  interest in politics and  to  study  for

their  own sake and for the sake of their country.

In every country, the movement has started through

the  students. It is also our duty  to  give  them

proper  advice to follow the proper constitutional

methods.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I firmly believe that the United Kingdom is

not  going  to  give up this strategic  island  of

Singapore very easily because she has her interest

in  white  Australia,  New Zealand,  Hongkong  and

other places. She is not going to hand



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 559</b></font><br><br>



over her power to some other alien country or  its

followers. My advice to our people is that  if  we

want  to achieve merdeka, we must show our loyalty

to  Singapore and not to any alien power; we  must

eschew  foreign or alien influence and drop  their

symbols.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not a Communist but, at the same time,

I am not an anti-Communist. England has recognised

Communist Russia and Communist China. What is good

for  the gander is good for the goose! I say  that

while  not  being against or for, we must  protect

our   own   interest.   The   Bandung   Conference

introduced the principle of Panchsheela, that  is,

co-existence which means that while following  your

own  politics  and your own way of life,  you  can

still remain friendly with other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my personal advice to my good friend the

Hon. the  Chief Minister is not to delay,  for  a

single  moment, the opening of the merdeka  talks.

During the last fifteen months there have been two

serious  riots  and discontent. The  former  Chief

Minister  said this morning that he does not  want

the  colonial rule. In other words, it  is  now  a

colonial rule and nobody can deny that it  is  not

because after all the Government is run with three

ex-officio Members and four Nominated Members.  It

is not the elected Government which is running the

Government.  Yes,  there are elected  Members  but

they  are running the Government with the help  of

the  ex-officio  Members  and  Nominated  Members.

Therefore, my advice is to open the merdeka  talks

immediately.  Of course, the United  Kingdom  will

try  to  delay this. Certainly, any country  would

like  to do this if it has power in its hands  but

you can force her hands. If we cannot, let us have

an  election so that any one Party with a majority

can come into power. I do not mind which Party may

be in power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, finally, I would like to say that there has

been a lot of destruction during the riots but who

suffers and pays for it? I would advise the people

of Singapore to refrain from violence. If anything

is destroyed, we pay for it and the United Kingdom

does  not  pay for it. No one pays except  us  and

that will harm us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 560</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday, the Member

for  Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) analysed the

present  position  of politics  in  Singapore.  He

analysed  for  our benefit that  there  are  three

camps  existing  today: first, the Colonial  camp;

second,   the  Communist  camp;  and  third,   the

Nationalist camp. When I challenged him across the

Floor  to  announce to which camp he belonged,  he

said,  "Nationalist, of course." Sir,  I  did  not

have  any  doubts as to his nationalistic leanings

up  to  the  time these riots started.  I  always

believed in his sincerity to work for the national

interest of Singapore but when these riots started

and  when  I  saw his statements in the  Press,  I

started having doubts as to whether he was  really

sincere or whether he was sitting on the fence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the first statement that he issued as

reported in the Press on 27th October reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A serious crisis has arisen as a result of the

inept  handling  of the situation  by  the  Labour

Front Coalition Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of heeding the warning signs of unrest

and   tension  and  taking  steps  to   ease   the

situation,  the Labour Front Coalition  Government

has   made  the  situation  worse  by  its  recent

actions."



<br><br>Sir,  the  next  statement  that  he  issued   was

reported  in  the Press, I believe,  on  the  30th

October, which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the eyes of the people, the incidents that

have  occurred during the past four days have done

more harm to the Labour Front Coalition Government

than what the P.A.P. could say or do."



<br><br>"The  Labour  Front Government's handling  of  the

situation was inept and the action that the Labour

Front  Government  was taking made  the  situation

worse!"  According to him, Sir, and his  Party,  I

suppose  the  best  action that the  Labour  Front

Government should have taken which would have made

the  situation  better was  to  surrender  to  the

rioters  and to arsonists, to let them have  their

way  and to let mob violence rule Singapore.  That

would  have been, Sir, a good Government according

to him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 561</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, he goes on to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meanwhile, the P.A.P. appeals to the people of

Singapore to be calm and steady."



<br><br>The  P.A.P. with its sinews and ground organisations

incited and started the riots and then they  went

on to appeal to the people to be calm and steady.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, up to that moment. I had no doubts of the

sincerity  of  the  Member for Tanjong  Pagar  but

since  these  statements when it was the  duty  of

every  Member  of the Assembly to go  out  to  the

people  to talk to them and to pacify the passions

that  had been aroused as a result of some of  the

active leaders of the Labour Front unions inciting

them  to  violence - sorry, Sir, I meant the  P.A.P.

unions -



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> They have not got any unions.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Thank God for that! Not that

type  of unions! Sir, as a result of some  of  the

leaders of the P.A.P. making speeches and inciting

to   violence,  it  was  the  duty,  Sir,  of  the

Secretary-General  of  the  P.A.P.,   instead   of

issuing  statements calling on the  Government  to

resign  and leaving the situation to take care  of

itself and letting mob violence rule Singapore, to

go  out to the people, to speak to them, to pacify

them  and to make them understand. But has he done

so?  Where  was  he during those times?  Even  the

Chinese students in the Chinese High School on the

night  before they were dispersed when  the  first

signs  of  violence started said, "We are  waiting

for  the coming of Mr Lee Kuan Yew." But Mr  Lee

Kuan Yew was nowhere to be found.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> In Cameron Highlands!



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, looking at these

statements  and  the claim the hon.  Member  makes

that  he  is a Nationalist, cart anyone say  that

these statements were in the national interest  of

Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, he said that there are three camps and

he  urged that to achieve merdeka, we should  play

one  camp against the other: the colonials against

the  Communists. Sir, I cannot believe that he  is

so naive as not to see the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 562</b></font><br><br>



dangers  that such a situation may create.  He  is

not  a  political child, Sir, and I am sure  that

when he said that, it is not that he was not aware

of  the  dangers that might be created. What  will

happen,  Sir,  if  we  achieve  merdeka  with  the

Communists  as  our allies? Will  we  get  a  true

merdeka?  Will we get a merdeka that will  benefit

the people? Will it be a merdeka, in fact? It will

just  be an apology for a merdeka. It may be  from

the frying pan into the fire.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we strive for merdeka, we must choose

our allies very carefully and we must see that  we

march  to merdeka on our own strength and  not  on

the  strength  of doubtful allies as advocated  by

the Member for Tanjong Pagar. Sir, I appeal to him

to  do a bit of heart-searching and not to sit  on

the  fence. If he is a true Nationalist, he should

work  for the national interest. He said that  his

Party  and  his  ground organisations  filled  the

vacuum  which was created since 1948  up  to  the

time  of the present Rendel Constitution. To  what

purpose  have  they filled this  vacuum?  He  has

himself   confessed  that  they  have   built   up

organisations and that they have the men  to  talk

to  the masses and organise them. Sir, is that  an

acceptance  of the fact that the P.A.P. has  been

involved in all these disturbances? I ask him that

question,  Sir. If he is a true  Nationalist,  he

should work for the Nationalist cause but not  for

a  cause that will make merdeka a farce. We  live,

as  the  Member for Cairnhill (Mr D. S. Marshall)

has  pointed out, on trade and on the activity  of

capital  and if we get merdeka, we should  not  do

anything that would jeopardise our position  as  a

trading  centre. We have no basic economy  of  our

own.  The Member for Tanjong Pagar knows  it  very

well  and  admits  that fact. And  yet,  if  these

activities are carried on, I am sure that when  we

get merdeka, we may have all our people starving.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the riots and the curfew have created a lot

of  difficulties and discontent and we have  heard

the Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy) giving

us  examples  of  the difficulties experienced  by

innocent people who technically broke the  law  by

coming out during the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 563</b></font><br><br>



curfew   hours.   Sir,  perhaps  some   of   these

difficulties and some of the arrests  of  innocent

people  were due to our not having been  organised

to  deal  with such situations. Perhaps they  were

due   to   our   inexperience  in  handling   such

situations. It is possible, Sir, that  the  P.A.P.

may  make  us well experienced in this before  we

get  our  merdeka. We have had two examples,  Sir,

during  the  last year and a half or  so.  Perhaps

then, we may be more experienced in handling  such

affairs. But the fact, Sir, is that there has been

physical  damage which has not been very great - few

buildings  burnt,  some traffic lights  broken,  a

number  of  cars burnt, and so on. Then there  has

been  damage  in other respects. Many  people  who

were   labourers  have  been  deprived  of   their

earnings because they could not go to work  during

the  curfew  hours. Shopkeepers had to  close  and

lose trade, Hawkers could not go out for three  or

four days because of the curfew. Farmers could not

market  their  produce and so had to  go  on  what

meagre savings they had and the housewives and the

general public had to pay more for their food  for

the  few days that the disturbances lasted.  This,

Sir,  is  the tangible damage. Shipping  suffered,

the workings of this great port suffered and trade

suffered.  This, Sir, is visible damage but,  Sir,

the  amount of invisible damage that has been done

is  that we have lost prestige as a trading centre

and we have lost the confidence of those who trade

with  us and those who might have come and set  up

industries here to give employment to our  people.

That loss of confidence is a damage that cannot be

easily  repaired. We were hoping that we would  be

able  to  invite and to entice foreign capital  to

come  here  to  set  up  industries  so  that  our

increasing  population might get  employment  but,

Sir, with all these disturbances - two riots: one of

them a full-fledged affair - in the short space of a

year and a half, I ask you whether that is the way

to  get  the confidence of foreign capital.  I  am

afraid,  Sir, that if this sort of thing goes  on,

we  are  not  going to get any foreign capital  to

come here and who will be the sufferers then?  The

sufferers  will be our own people. Let  them  open

their eyes and see the truth.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 564</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I appeal to the people of Singapore not to

let   their   passions  run  wild  but   to   work

constructively and solidly and not  to  listen  to

the  poisonous  rumours that have  been  purposely

spread by some of the subversive elements so  that

we  can march towards the goal of merdeka in peace

and  harmony and when we achieve merdeka,  we  can

achieve  it with the minimum difficulties  arising

from  the  change  of one form of  government  for

another  or  the  change from  colonialism  to  an

independent  government. Sir, in the  transitional

stage, there is bound to be some upset but  if  we

approach  this problem peacefully, I am sure  that

we can achieve it with the minimum of upsets.



<br><br>4.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

how  many times have we heard the words: "It  must

not  happen  again."  Everyone  in  Singapore   is

getting  fed  up with this except, of  course,  the

People's Action Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Events of the past few weeks have proved beyond

all  doubt  that riot is a sport of  the  People's

Action Party. Just because they have lost a  match

very  badly and just because they have lost a  few

of  their  rough and tough players, they  are  now

trying to introduce a motion to amend the rules of

the  game  to suit their purpose. In the  interest

and wellbeing of the country and for the sake  of

good  order as well as to keep the game clean,  it

is  the duty of every hon. Member of this House to

support the amendment to the motion.



<br><br>4.02 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Assistant Minister for Education (Inche Mohamed Sidik Bin Haji Abdul Hamid): Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise to support the amendment moved by  the

Minister for Education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like this House to know what I

experienced  on the evening during the  expiration

of  the time when the school students were ordered

to  leave  the two schools. I happened  to  be  in

Geylang  that evening and I saw a crowd  attacking

public  transport  which  carried  people  of  all

races.  On  Thursday evening I was at Bukit  Timah

Road and I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 565</b></font><br><br>



saw  a  big crowd. I heard the Member for  Tanjong

Pagar  (Mr Lee Kuan Yew) say in this House, "What

did  the  Police do on that evening to  allow  the

crowd  to  gather?"  He should remember  that  the

crowd which was gathering at Bukit Timah consisted

of  parents of those students in the schools. They

were  there to collect their children to take them

out of danger.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to know the persons who were

responsible for the riots. Sir, who were

responsible  for advising the people  to  start  a

riot?  Are  these people in this House, Sir?  They

have destroyed everything they could find in their

way  and  yet they were not satisfied  with  that.

They  started spreading malicious rumours  to  the

Malays that the Chinese were going to attack them.

Sir,  the  Government took action and appealed  to

the  members of the Malay community and we managed

to  stop them from doing anything by telling  them

not  to believe in the malicious rumours that were

being  spread. I can tell this House that  on  the

morning  of Saturday, a number of Malay  community

leaders  went up to where there were  hundreds  of

Malays who were supposed to attack the Chinese, to

calm them down. The Malays were told that whatever

rumours  they  had  heard were malicious  rumours.

They then realised the truth and they responded to

the call of the Government to side and support the

Government  in  restoring peace on  this  colonial

island. Had it not been for the efforts of some of

the  Malay leaders, I think Singapore would  still

be in a mess today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Party and I fully supported the action of the

Government in detaining those who were supposed to

be  carrying  out  subversive activities  in  this

country.  The Police have papers and documents  to

prove  that  those  who are  being  detained  were

responsible for the riots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I fully support the amended motion moved by

the Minister for Education.



<br><br>4.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, a month ago the People's Action



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 566</b></font><br><br>



Party  tabled a motion which was roundly  defeated

by almost all sections of this House. The Liberal-Socialists  supported the Government amendment  on

the  basis that the preservation of law and  order

was  a  paramount  obligation, that  the  internal

security of this island must be firmly upheld, not

merely  as  a  principle of our Party  policy  but

rather as one of national importance, and that  it

was time for Members of the Assembly to declare on

which side of the Communist fence they stood.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these last weeks we have seen the security of

the  State  threatened, and  constituted  law  and

order seriously undermined by subversive criminals

who  have  not  hesitated to use  the  weapons  of

violence  and of ugly pernicious rumour  and  also

the  craven cover of young students and  children,

who knew not where they were being led. And now we

have  before  us  a motion which  the  Member  for

Tanjong  Pagar  (Mr  Lee Kuan  Yew)  must  regret

having  tabled, however eloquently he may  try  to

hide  his  confusion. I say "confusion" because  a

month ago the hon. Member used these words in this

House:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree with the hon. Gentlemen opposite that

if  any act is done to overthrow the Government by

force, that act must be suppressed."



<br><br>If  he had meant what he said sincerely, he should

have  had the honesty to withdraw this motion  and

not to have attempted to defend it. What I say  to

the  hon.  Members opposite is this:  If  you  had

failed  to warn the nation of our impending danger

a  month ago, it would have been evidence of  your

incapacity to govern. If you had only taken  half-

measures  to  combat the dangers when  they  broke

loose ten days ago, having learned the uselessness

of  half-measures employed last  year,  you  would

have betrayed your country and the trust placed in

you  as a Government. But because you have had the

courage   and  good  sense  to  act   firmly   and

decisively  to quell a rebellion which could  have

assumed   alarming  proportions,  you   have   the

assurance  of  renewed  support  of  the  Liberal-Socialists. Indeed, you could expect no less from us.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 567</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A national emergency demands national-mindedness

when  both Government and Opposition Members  must

rally   to  the  national  interests  above  party

politics. Unless we in this House can learn to  do

this,  democratic government on this  island  will

never  prosper. Having reiterated our  support  of

the action taken by the Government - action which it

would have been criminal not to have taken knowing

what   they  knew -  let  me  say  this:   In   all

insurrections  of this kind, the innocent  or,  if

not the innocent, the foolish are liable to suffer

to  some  extent with the guilty. It  may  be  the

student  who got mixed up in a rebellion  for  the

fun  of  the  thing because he was  too  young  to

realise   into   what  dangers   and   with   what

unscrupulousness  he  was  being  led  and  it  is

evident he is still being led. It may be the young

trade  union  member  who was  forced  to  join  a

certain  group  or  lose  his  job  and  therefore

followed  the  crowd  because  he  dared  not   do

otherwise.  It  may  be the  foolish  or  ignorant

citizen  who  committed the stupidity of  breaking

the  curfew just because he wanted to see what was

going  on. I would ask the Government to  exercise

the  greatest care to see that the people who  can

learn from their mistakes are separated from those

who  were  the  real  plotters  and  schemers  who

engineered the riots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Members opposite have restored

order and rid us, for the time being at least,  of

the  forces of destruction. But they have scotched

the  snake, not killed it. They have not  cleansed

the  Augean stables but only opened the doors wide

so  that the people may know the truth. Ahead lies

the  task  of construction. Ahead lies  the  vital

problem of finding and encouraging the right  kind

of  leadership in our Chinese schools, remembering

that  young  people respond quickly to  leadership

and  new forms of inspiration. Ahead lies the task

of   convincing  every  section  of  the   Chinese

community  that all political Parties are  pledged

to  the  preservation of Chinese culture within  a

Malayan framework. Equally, the trade union member

must be made to realise that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 568</b></font><br><br>



the  arrests  of the past weeks have  been  forced

upon  the  Government in order  to  safeguard  the

proper development of the trade union movement and

not  to destroy it. The Liberal-Socialists believe

in  the need for that development just as much  as

the hon. Members opposite.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally the man in the street must be brought

to  understand that the law is intended to protect

and  not  to  persecute him. Unless the Government

tackles  these problems of construction  with  the

same  vigour and the same sense of urgency as  was

applied to the recent riots, we shall be in danger

of  their recurrence and Singapore will soon  lose

its  status  as one of the greatest  free  trading

centres of the world. The Liberal-Socialist  Party

will watch with extreme anxiety how these problems

are tackled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hon. the Chief Minister has called for an

"Operation Liberation". That operation must be one

of  co-operation because only with the willing  and

active  support of all the right-minded people  of

this    country - and   they   are   in   the   vast

majority - will we be rid of the evils  which  beset

us.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang (Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  think  the  leader of  my  Party  and  my

colleagues  have said all that has to be  said  as

regards the attitude of our Party. In that case, I

think  there  is no need for me to repeat  it  but

there  are one or two things that I would like  to

touch  on in the speech by the Member for  Tanjong

Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan Yew).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday afternoon, I heard him say that the

Farmers'  Association held eight meetings.  During

the  recent troublous week, several farmers in  my

constituency asked me what all those meetings were

for.  I  admitted  that I knew nothing  about  the

meetings  but I told them that I guessed that  the

Association might be trying to help them get  more

land, to which some of them said, "No, no!" One of

them even spat. That is not all but it all goes to

show  that the meetings were not meetings  of  the

farmers  but  of a handful of officials  who  were

themselves not farmers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 569</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar also said that the

Middle Road Group knew that they were going to  be

arrested.  Was  that not a guilty  conscience?  If

not,  did  they  consider  that  their  stocks  of

sticks,  bottles of acid, crowbars and  what  not,

were enough to beat the Police away? And yet, they

are  trying to create an impression that they  are

as  innocent  as  the babies or as  pious  as  the

saints and that they are being persecuted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the amended motion of

the Minister for Education,



<br><br>4.17 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock):</b> Mr

Speaker,   Sir,   yesterday,   I   listened   very

attentively  for nearly an hour to the  speech  of

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar (Mr Lee Kuan  Yew).

It is a speech of contradictions. First of all, he

tried  to  distort facts and blamed the Government

for   the   riots.  His  delivery,   Sir,   lacked

conviction and I began to wonder what prompted him

to cut such a ridiculous figure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he got on his hobby horse and repeated what

he has said in this Assembly many, many times: his

idea  on  how Communism can be defeated.  He  said

that  by our action we have taken the bull by  the

horns  and  he wished us well. Well!  Well!  Well!

What an admirable speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member deliberately distorted facts when

he  said  that the arrests of the leaders  of  the

Middle  Road  Group took place shortly  after  the

outbreak  of  the  riots on the  evening  of  25th

October.  He said that these arrests were  carried

out  in the early morning of 26th October and thus

making  it appear that the Government had  already

planned  these  arrests. This,  Sir,  is  a  grave

distortion  of facts. The Police took this  action

in  the  early morning of the 27th October,  after

they were satisfied that the Middle Road Group was

actively connected with the riots,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave an account yesterday of ,the raids and

arrests  made  on  the premises of  the  Singapore

Factory  and Shop Workers' Union and  I  need  not

repeat  it here. I would like to stress,  however,

that this `action had brought about a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 570</b></font><br><br>



significant  change in the riot  situation.  There

was  an  immediate subsidence of  trouble.  In  my

statement yesterday, Sir, I gave an account of the

events   which  took  place  prior  to  the   riot

incidents beginning 25th October. It was clear  to

all  of  us where the responsibility lies and  yet

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar indulged  in  wilful

perversion of facts -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot allow expressions of

that  nature to be passed about a Member  of  this

Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> I withdraw that, Sir. And

yet,  the  Member for Tanjong Pagar  by  a  clever

distortion of facts -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not any better.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> And yet, the Member for

Tanjong  Pagar by a distortion of facts  tried  to

accuse  the  Government of  being  the  fuse.  The

Government's action was made necessary and I  have

already explained why it was necessary. Each  time

we  acted, we acted to meet a situation created by

the  Middle  Road  Group. By their  actions,  they

stand   condemned  both  here  in  Singapore   and

elsewhere.   The  hon.  Member   said   that   the

Government  lost  the propaganda battle  from  the

10th  to  the  24th October. This is a  deliberate

misrepresentation.  In  fact,   it   was   because

peaceful meetings and the signature campaign  were

having no marked effect that the Middle Road Group

had  to  change  their tactics. They  changed  the

character   of   their   meetings   and    adopted

inflammatory, rabble-rousing speeches. Our records

prove this, Sir. They fomented positive action  by

the  misguided  students,  hence  the  visits   by

hundreds of workers to the Chinese High School and

the  Chung  Cheng  School on  the  20th  and  24th

October and the resulting pickets and intimidation

of other middle schools from the 22nd October. The

failure    of    constitutional    meetings    and

parliamentary  language  forced  the  Middle  Road

Group to a more positive phase of struggle. It was

because  the  same pattern of events  as  happened

during the Hock Lee riots in 1955 was taking shape

that  the  Government had to take action to  clear

the two schools of stay-in students.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 571</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member said that if the speeches

made  by the Middle Road Group were seditious,  we

should  prosecute.  This  is  a  dangerous   over-simplification.  What is inflammatory  at  a  mass

meeting  may not be found to be seditious  in  the

calm  of  the courts weeks later. Whether  or  not

prosecution  follows,  the  Government  must  take

immediate action to prevent further mischief.  And

this  is what we did by the arrests. Twice now  we

have learned the hard way how quickly inflammatory

speeches  can  produce  riots,  death  and  injury

whether or not they are seditious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member said that this Government

admitted that it did not have internal security in

its  control.  This Government has  made  no  such

admission.  In  fact, I pointed out  very  clearly

last  month  that  internal  security  is  in  the

control  of the Council of Ministers in which  the

elected  Ministers have a majority of 6 to  3.  I

repeat  what I have said so often: this Government

takes  full responsibility for what we have  done,

The only limit to our control of internal security

is in the Governor's reserve powers of over-ruling

us and, of course, in the strength of the security

forces  at our disposal. The appointment, Sir,  of

Mr  M.  P. D. Nair as Assistant Minister  to  the

Chief  Secretary  is intended  to  bring  internal

security closer to the elected Ministers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar and the Member for

Sembawang (Inche Ahmad Bin Ibrahim) touched on the

Protected  Places  Ordinance vis-a-vis  the  Naval

Base.  I agree, Sir, I dislike any Member of  this

Assembly  being denied access to his  constituents

but  I  dislike too the suggestion that the action

taken by the Naval Base authorities arose from the

Protected Places Ordinance. As far as I am  aware,

Sir, it was taken simply in exercise of the common

right  of any authority to exclude strangers  from

its  premises. And was it in all the circumstances

of widespread riot and curfew so unreasonable that

the   Naval   Base   authorities   should   refuse

admittance  at  this time to one  who  had  openly

associated himself with the Middle Road Group  who

had  instigated the disturbances? I  suggest  that

the hon. Member should blame his friends in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 572</b></font><br><br>



Middle  Road who created an atmosphere of  tension

which the Naval Base authorities had to take  into

account.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar draws attention to

the  action  taken  by certain  employers  against

their  employees. I must accept  the  danger  that

certain  employers  may  take  advantage  of   the

Government's  action  to victimise  genuine  trade

union   leaders.  Indeed  I  have  already  stated

publicly  that employers must beware of just  this

mischief. In my statement yesterday, Sir, I called

on  all employers to take note that trade unionism

is  here  to stay and that any attempt to  smother

it,  any attempt to exploit the workers, will give

fertile  ground for subversive elements to thrive.

I would ask all workers of Singapore who are being

victimised  to report to the Labour Department  so

that we can investigate into their complaints  and

render  all possible assistance. But, Sir, I  hold

no  brief for spurious trade union leaders who  do

not  genuinely seek the welfare of the workers but

seek  to exploit them for their own selfish  ends.

The  hon.  Member quoted certain  instances  to

support  his point. I have with me, Sir, a  report

of the Labour Department, and I quote:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tay Koh Yat. The Transport Employees' Union was

formed  in  October  1955  by  the  Trades   Union

Congress and not by the Company."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Worse for the T.U.C.!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> It goes on to read:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Singapore Bus Workers Union Agreement with

the  management  in  December, 1955  stated  there

would  be  no  lightning strikes, By their  strike

action   on  Friday  26th  October,  the   workers

violated  this  Agreement.  There  are  no  2-hour

shifts in the Company. The Reserve Unit is on an 8-

hour  and  not 4-hour shift, due to the  continued

absence  of  certain  employees - for  reasons  best

known to themselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Yew Lee Cheong Tin Factory. The allegation

was untrue. There have been no dismissals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hume Industries. Three employees who absented

themselves  for four working days without  reason,

have thereunder terminated their services and have

been so informed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 573</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malayan Textiles. One tester and one oiler

have   been   dismissed  arising  out   of   their

activities  in  the recent unrest. The  management

did not move from prepared positions."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tanjong Pagar described the

use of British troops as having a poisonous effect

on  the  population.  I wonder  how  many  of  the

ordinary  people of Singapore would have  accepted

that  description  when  they  first  saw  British

troops  manning road blocks on the morning of  the

26th  October  after  a  night  of  constant   mob

violence  or  during  the  days  and  nights  that

followed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Sir, we were grateful that prompt help came

in  our  hour of need to ensure that the situation

could  not get out of hand just as we are grateful

to  our  friends in the Federation for sending  us

Police reinforcements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Sir, Britain now has the military

power in Singapore. Apart from our splendid Police

Force  and a few local forces, we have no military

forces. We are dependent for help in time of  need

on  our friends. But this Government does not  for

one  moment  admit that that denies  us  political

power nor will it deter us from pressing for  full

internal   self-government  when   we   meet   the

Secretary of State early next year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British troops were there to help our Police

Force  to  protect life and property.  With  their

help  in providing road blocks and reconnaissance,

the  Police Force was left free to operate against

rioters,   arsonists  and  subversive  elements - an

operation which they conducted with great credit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember, Sir, that on the debate on the

Governor's  Address the Member for  Tanjong  Pagar

ridiculed  the Government for wanting to  raise  a

Singapore Battalion. On the one hand, our  attempt

to raise a Battalion of our own is ridiculed while

on  the  other  hand  when we have  to  depend  on

British troops to guard life and property  in  our

time of need is again ridiculed. I really find  it

difficult  to  understand the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the hon. Member tells us that we shall get

no concessions from the British Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 574</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I said you will.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> You said, "We shall not."

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Oh, we shall see! We

certainly  will not, Sir, if we follow the  advice

of  the  hon.  Member to try and wrest  the  rifle

barrel out of British hands. I believe the British

Government is less likely to yield to threats  and

violence  than to claims that are based  on  right

and on our maturity to govern ourselves, which  we

have in good measure. The hon. Member says that he

is determined to wreck the present colonial system

as  quickly as possible. That is not our  way.  We

are not out to wreck anything. We seek to build on

the  foundations  laid, to change  and  adapt  the

present   system  to  our  needs  and   to   self-government. We seek to construct, not destroy  and

to  build a better Singapore with merdeka, not  to

destroy it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the fight against colonialism cannot be

separated   from  the  fight  against   subversive

elements.  In fact, to win the one, we  must  also

win the other. The stronger we are internally, the

stronger   will   be   our  case   in   the   next

constitutional talks. How long are we to hold  our

hand  and  allow this conspiracy of subversion  to

carry  on  unchecked? To have done so  would  have

been to try to build up the house of merdeka while

allowing the termite swarms to grow unchecked and

to   permit  them  to  keep  eating  away  at  the

foundations of the house.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the vile rumour spread by the Middle Road

Group that the Government's action is aimed at the

Chinese-speaking  population   is   just   another

example  of  the  extent to which this  Group  was

prepared  to  go  in their acts of subversion.  In

taking  action against this Group, the  Government

is not attacking the rights of trade unionists, or

farmers, or teachers, or Chinese education, or the

Chinese-speaking  population.  We  are  liberating

them  from  a  vile form of political exploitation

and  to protect their interests. Sir, while we are

on  the road to merdeka, it is wrong to divide the

population  into  the various races  and  to  sub-divide   the  races  into  the  various  languages

spoken. It is time we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 575</b></font><br><br>



stop  talking this. To me, to my Party and to this

Government, there is only one kind of  people  and

one kind of loyalty - Malayans with a common loyalty

to  Malaya. Sir, the new constitution which we are

all  looking  forward  to  will  give  citizenship

rights to all those who were not born in Singapore

and  I  hope  that when these rights are  won  for

them, full advantage will be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanglin (Mr Ede) said that in the

case  of "Operation Liberation" one must also have

"Operation Co-operation". You will recollect in  my

statement  yesterday that I  called  on  each  and

every  one  in  Singapore to  co-operate  with  the

Government in our "Operation Liberation"  so  that

we  can  all  work together for a  better,  for  a

happier Singapore, free from subversion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the speeches

that have been made on this amendment to my motion

can be divided into two categories: electioneering

and  non-electioneering speeches.  I  congratulate

Mr  Francis Thomas, Mr Sutherland and the Member

for   Tanglin  (Mr  Ede)  for  not  having   gone

electioneering. Two of them do not have to  bother

with   elections.  Of  course,  Members   on   the

Government side, with the exception of  one,  were

not in a position to electioneer. They took the -



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Bull by the horns.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - bull by the horns. Yes, the

bull  can  be more fierce and more dangerous  than

they thought, and they might find it necessary  to

bring  the  rifle  barrel out  again.  But  I  was

cheered  to watch the subjective strengthening  of

attitudes.  At  the  time when the  merdeka  talks

broke  down, there were 13 of us in London.  Never

in  my  life  had I felt more sick  and  tired  of

seeing  weak need and wobbly characters.  When  it

came  to a moment of crisis and a decision had  to

be taken, all were in a flutter: "What will happen

now?  What  will  happen to the  jobs?  What  will

happen  to my seat? What will happen to  me?"  And

not  what  will  happen  to Singapore!  Well,  for

better  or  for worse, that phase is  over  and  I

think the coming year till



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 576</b></font><br><br>



next  August  will see a further settling  of  the

positions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways of looking at the matters we

have  been  debating. One is the short-term  view,

the other is the long-term view. In the short-term

view,  we  have  been  arguing  about:  "Who   was

responsible?  Why were they arrested?  Who  caused

the  riots? Did they cause the riots and then they

were  arrested,  or  were the  riots  conveniently

engineered  for  their  arrests?"  We  can  go  on

arguing   and  the  Government  will,   like   Dr

Goebbels,  keep  on repeating:  "They  caused  the

riots and therefore we nabbed them. We imposed the

curfew and the riots subsided." It proves nothing.

If  the Government can prove its case, let us have

a public enquiry, let us have evidence laid before

some judicial tribunal and let the allegations  be

proved. But I knew and all my Middle Road Group of

friends  knew that they were in for a  big  purge.

That  purge  started on the 18th of September.  If

there  were no riots on the 24th and 25th October,

perhaps they would not have been arrested  on  the

27th, But there would have been some other issues.

It was inevitable. It was coming and they knew it.

It  was  not "guilty conscience". They  knew  they

were in for a purge. They made the Government  pay

a price, and that price is the long-term view. For

the time being, they are snuffed out, punctured -



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Thirteen deaths!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Yes, we all do not like riots,

but this was one which I knew, and I am convinced,

was  not  in any way sought or engineered  by  any

subversive group. This was a situation  which  was

created  because of the Government's determination

to  carry out a purge. And in the last resort,  it

was  the rifle barrel that settled it. As long  as

that is the situation the Government can make  all

kinds of silly mistakes but the ring will still be

held and all will not yet be lost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is not so easy either for the British,

the  Communist or the Nationalist to foretell what

lies  ahead. It is like the song that goes:  "What

will I be when I grow up? Will I be handsome, will

I  be rich?" And the refrain is: "The future's not

ours to see." If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 577</b></font><br><br>



we  want to know what is going to happen in  the

future, we must know what are the forces at work.

And  having decided our position, we then try and

work  these  forces  in our favour.  We  heard  a

magnificent  lecture this morning on  spontaneous

organisations    from    the     Minister     for

Communications and Works. No doubt, that  is  the

way the Labour Front works. I can assure him that

spontaneous organisation will lead to spontaneous

exit in the next elections.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> August 1957.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> August 1957. Sir, in the long-term view, whether we survive or we go

under - perhaps  it  is  outside  our  control - will

depend  upon  whether  Indonesia  survives  as  a

democracy  or whether the P.K.I. will  take  over

Indonesia  and  make  it  Communist.  These   are

international  forces beyond our control  but  as

long  as  the international position is held  and

the  rifle  barrel is here in the  hands  of  the

British,  we have got the set positions  which  I

have been trying to explain. The British has  the

rifle  barrel,  then you have got the  Communists

and the Nationalists. I agree with the Member for

Tanglin  (Mr Ede) that the Nationalists  are  in

the   majority  but  the  reason  why  they   are

ineffective  is  that  they are  unorganised  and

perhaps   because  they  believe  in  spontaneous

organisation.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are

those  who  believe that this  situation  can  be

resolved  by dynamism of personal leadership  and

the  individual  voices  in  the  wilderness  can

transform  the  situation, I do not  share  those

beliefs, If we want to make this country  survive

on  a  democratic  basis, then  we  have  got  to

organise  the masses and the people on our  side.

It  is  not a question of the P.A.P. coming  into

power  or  the  Liberal-Socialists  winning   the

elections   or  the  Labour  Front  winning   the

elections.  It is a question of which  particular

cause   is  advanced.  The  Communists  are   not

interested in who is going to be the President of

the Republic of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 578</b></font><br><br>



Malaya or who is going to be the Commissar.  They

are  interested  in  advancing  their  cause  and

anybody,  whether he is Communist,  non-Communist

or  anti-Communist, who helps  to  advance  their

cause is used. That is what we must learn.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a

premonition  that  this happy  state  of  affairs

where  the  rifle barrel is securely  pointed  at

those who might want to liquidate us might not be

there  for very long. What is this revolution  in

Malaya? Let me read this:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Revolution in Malaya. People usually think

of  a revolution as an armed uprising against the

existing    Government.   The    great    classic

revolutions in history have been of this type - the

French,  Russian,  and  Chinese  revolutions.   I

think,  however, the use of armed  force  is  not

always an essential part of a revolution. Indeed,

certain types of uprising where armed forces  are

deployed  hardly deserve the name of revolutions.

In  certain South American states, for  instance,

armed   revolutions   are  regular   occurrences,

Admiral  De-Soto with the backing of the  Marines

and  the  Navy takes over from General  Santiago.

The  General then retires to a neighbouring state

and lives there happily ever after. The rules  of

the  game lay down that ex-Presidents should  not

be  hounded  to  death but should be  allowed  to

enjoy  the  fruits of their previous  enterprise.

With foresight, all ruling Presidents observe the

rules of the game.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sort of thing used to take place regularly

in  our  neighbouring state of Siam until  Phibul

Songgram, the present Premier, put an end to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sort of revolution that matters is one

in  which everybody is affected. People's  lives

are changed

irrevocably; some for the better, others for  the

worse.  This  kind at revolution is  not  brought

about  by  soldiers or generals. This  revolution

results  from  historical, social, political  and

economic  forces  which bring  about  such  rapid

changes  in a country that the way in which  each

person  lives and thinks is profoundly  affected.

It  is  in  this  sense  that  we  speak  of  the

"Industrial Revolution" in Europe and  it  is  in

this  sense  that we speak of the  revolution  in

Malaya."-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the hon. Member

identify that pamphlet? I did not hear him

identify it.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 579</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> This is the organ of the

Malayan Forum in London called Suara Merdeka,  and

this  is an article which is headed The Revolution

in  Malaya.  It  analyses for  students  what  the

revolution  is all about and I think hon.  Members

in  this House would do well to subscribe to  this

magazine  and read it. Let me read just  one  more

passage from this analysis:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In Malaya, we have seen the failure of the armed

revolution staged by the Malayan Communist  Party.

We must at a later stage examine the causes of the

failure  of the M.C.P. rebellion. As things  stand

today,  it appears to most people that it  is  the

constitutional struggle that will win independence

to Malaya. Tunku Abdul Rahman's Government came to

London  this  year to negotiate with  the  British

Government  the transfer of power from Britain  to

an  elected  Malayan Government. The  negotiations

succeeded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How and why did this happen? Is there a catch to

it?  Or  is it the result of some sudden and  long

overdue  visitation of providence upon the  tender

conscience  of the British Government?  These  are

questions worth pondering. Our answer is  that  it

is  none  of  these  things. Our  answer  is  that

this - for  is - happy state of affairs is the  first

result  of an intense power-struggle in  a  three-cornered fight in Malaya between three forces:

British  imperial power, Malayan  nationalism  and

international Communism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first round in the fight has gone to the

Nationalists    united   under   Tunku    Rahman's

leadership.  The  Communists, who  had  for  years

called the U.M.N.O. "a feudal, reactionary, stooge

organisation  subservient to British  imperialism"

suddenly  awakened to the fact  that  Tunku  Abdul

Rahman and U.M.N.O. enjoyed the massive support of

the  Malay  people.  The  British  on  their  part

realised,  especially after the  demonstration  of

strength  staged by Tunku in 1954-55, that  unless

they  came to terms with him they would ultimately

be  faced  with  a Dien-Bien-Phu. Of  course,  the

negotiation itself was carried out with  goodwill,

courtesy  and  decorum. But this  very  cordiality

itself  is  the  result of the awareness  on  both

sides  of  the reality of the power-situation.  Of

course,  in public statements, both sides declared

that  they were motivated entirely by the  highest

moral considerations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final count: What of the second, third and

subsequent  rounds?  It would  be  a  delusion  to

believe  that  Tunku's  victory,  in  London  last

February heralded the conclusion of the fight  for

an  independent and democratic Malaya. It would be

an  even  greater  delusion  to  expect  that  the

promulgation of the Constitution now being  worked

out  by  the  Reid Commission will in itself  make

Malaya secure for freedom and democracy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 580</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of power is only the first stage of

the  revolution in Malaya. The revolutionary  tide

now  sweeping over Malaya has yet to work out  its

course. The three-cornered power-struggle will  by

no  means be over by August 1957. By then  we  can

safely  predict  that the Malayan Communist  Party

will still have its armed detachments deployed  in

the jungle and its underground organisations still

in  operation. The British armed forces will still

be  in  Malaya. British civil servants will  still

occupy  important  positions. A  Malayan  Cabinet

responsible to the Legislature will be  in  charge

of the nation's affairs under these conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three antagonists will therefore occupy the

stage  in August 1957, though the balance of power

would  have  shifted.  What are  their  respective

chances  of ultimate victory? What is the strategy

which  each is likely to adopt? These are some  of

the questions to be considered in the next section

of this article."



<br><br>Read next week's exciting installment of Suara Merdeka.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I think if Members in this

House   do  not  grow  up  and  rise  up  to   the

revolutionary  situation, then we certainly  will

perish.  These  are the problems which  we  should

have  faced some 20 or 30 years ago when we  would

have  had  a  much  better  chance  of  survival.

Unfortunately  for  us, Malayan  nationalism  only

became  a  force after the Japanese invasion  when

they  knocked the local people about and  suddenly

awakened them to the fact that their fate was tied

up with the fate of the country. It was only after

the   war   that  the  Nationalists  got  started.

Ultimately, if we want to survive in a  democratic

Malaya,  we  must be able to hold that  ring,  and

within  the  ring allow a free play of forces  for

peaceful persuasion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Cairnhill (Mr D. S.

Marshall) talked of these nine months till August

1957  and then presumably he thinks our  problems

will  be  over when we get this new constitution.

Then there will be elections and there will be  a

Prime  Minister and a new government. The problem

will  still be there. It is here now, it  will  be

there in August 1957. In fact, after August  1957

it  will  become more acute. Today the  Tunku  can

say, "Let us not discuss Suez. Foreign affairs are

out of my hands. Let us pray for peace." But after

August  1957,  the Nationalists must  provide  the

answer  because we can no longer give this excuse:

"Ah, but it is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 581</b></font><br><br>



the  British." Therefore, the three-cornered power

struggle  will  become more intense  after  August

1957,  not less. And to fight the Communists,  one

must   understand   how  they  think.   One   must

understand what they are after. Is it evil?  I  am

not  convinced myself that Communism  is  an  evil

force. In fact, I agree with about 75 per cent  of

what  they want to do. But it is that 25 per  cent

of how they do it, that I object and oppose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why we formed the People's Action

Party  instead of joining the Labour Party or  the

Socialist Party was because we did not believe the

people  who were then in the Labour Party and  the

Socialist  Party  had  the  slightest  desire   or

conviction  to bring about a social revolution  in

Malaya   or  indeed  knew  anything  about  social

revolution.  If in fact, my colleague  the  Member

for  Bukit  Timah  (Mr Lim Ching  Siong)  were  a

Communist, then I would say, "I agree 75 per  cent

with him. But I do not agree even 25 per cent with

Members  on the other side." Some people say  that

we  sit on the fence. We do not. We are positively

competing, trying to organise. But we say  to  the

elected  Members  of this Government:  "It  was  a

political  mistake. While the rifle barrel  is  in

the hands of the British, to go round the back  of

the British and start the shooting was wrong."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I said yesterday that a wellknown Marxist

dialectician said, "A new society comes out of the

rifle  barrel." I think I ought to read to Members

in  this  House  this extract from  the  collected

works of Mao-Tse-tung, Volume II, page 272 - one  of

the  rare brains in this world. One may or may not

agree  with certain objectives he wants to achieve

but one ought to listen to what he has got to say:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In foreign countries, no bourgeois party needs

armed  forces under its direct command  but  China

presents  a  different case; owing to  the  feudal

divisions  of  the  country,  whichever,  of   the

landlord or bourgeois blocs or parties has the gun

has power, and whichever has more guns has greater

power.  The  party of the proletariat  that  finds

itself  in these circumstances should see  clearly

to the heart of the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communists do not contend for personal military

power (they should never do that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 582</b></font><br><br>



and  let  no one follow the example of Chang  Kuo-tao) but they must contend for military power  for

the  Party and for the people. As, a national  war

of resistance is going on, we must further contend

for  military  power  of the nation.  If  we  fall

victim  to infantilism on the question of military

power,  we  shall get absolutely nothing.  As  the

toiling  masses  have  been for  several  thousand

years a prey to the deceit and intimidation of the

reactionary  ruling classes, it is very  difficult

for  them  to awaken to the importance  of  having

guns  in  their own hands, Now that the oppression

of   Japanese   imperialism  and  the  nation-wide

resistance  have pushed the toiling masses  on  to

the   stage  of  war,  Communists  should   prove

themselves  the most clear-headed leaders  in  the

war.   Every  Communist  must  grasp  the   truth:

"Political power grows out of the barrel  of  the

gun. Our principle is that the Party commands  the

gun  and  the gun will never be allowed to command

the  Party, But it is also true that with guns  at

our  disposal, we can really build  up  the  Party

organisations, and the Eighth Route Army has built

up  a  powerful Party organisation in North China.

We  can  also  rear  cadres  and  create  schools,

culture  and mass movements, Everything  in  Yenan

has  been  built up by means of the gun.  Anything

can grow out of the barrel of a gun. According  to

the  Marxist theory of the State, the Army is  the

chief component of the political power of a State.

Whoever wants to seize the political power of  the

State  and to maintain it must have a strong army.

Some people have ridiculed us as advocates of  the

"omnipotence of war"; yes, we are, but we are  the

advocates  of the omnipotence of the revolutionary

war,  which is not bad at all, but is good and  is

Marxist.  With  the  help  of  guns,  the  Russian

Communists  brought  about socialism.  We  are  to

bring about a democratic republic."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the first lesson we must learn, namely,

that if the Malayan Communist Party had more guns,

then   we   would  not  be  talking  today   about

parliamentary democracy, its merits and  demerits.

But  I  ask,  "In  this power situation,  do  hon.

Members  on  the other side honestly believe  that

the  British Conservative Party is going  to  say,

'Here  is  the  gun.' Quit Malaya like  they  quit

Suez?  Do hon.. Members on the other side  believe

that  they can identify themselves with the white

man  who has the gun and hold the support of their

Asian  people?" The British are not here to  build

parliamentary  democracy for us.  They  are  here

because  of  tin and rubber interests, because  of

their  economic  investments in the  country.  We

should  not  be so stupid as to lend ourselves  to

their  scheme  of  things. They yield  only  under

pressure.  In this three-cornered power  situation

as long as the British



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 583</b></font><br><br>



are  here  with a gun, our first objective  is  to

dislodge  them  and  take over  the  gun  and  the

government of the country. When you take over  the

gun, then your battle begins. Then you can say to

yourselves  and  to  the country:  "What  kind  of

Malaya  are  we going to have? This is ours  now."

Then   you  can  decide,  and  if  one  is  really

democratic, then one says, "All Parties can preach

whatever     it     believes    peacefully     and

constitutionally but we shall hold the gun to  see

that  it is done peacefully and constitutionally."

That  is  the power situation. To get the  maximum

advantage  out of this power situation,  one  must

build  organisations and not wait for  spontaneous

combustions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one Organising Secretary in the

Labour  Front  Party - only one - has brought  out  a

marked and noticeable transformation in the Labour

Front  Party  because  he happened  to  have  been

trained  once upon a time by the Malayan Communist

Party.  He knew how to organise. Had it  not  been

for  him,  I think the Front would be in bits  and

pieces. Look what happened, for instance, when the

Press  rang up four Ministers and asked, "What  do

you  think  about  the Duke of Edinburgh's  visit?

Should  it be called off or not?" Four Ministers,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, responsible men,  collectively

responsible for the government of Singapore,  gave

four different opinions to the Straits Times  and

reduced their Party and the Government to a  state

of  contempt.  But because of this organiser  in

the  Labour  Front whatever internal  differences

there were in the Party did not spill out and they

appear to be fighting as an organisation. That  is

the  first  prerequisite before joining  political

battle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we have preached non-violence

and  we  have  preached  it sincerely.  Those  who

believe that the P.A.P. engineered the riots  must

be  utterly  mad. Apart from the moral reasons  of

not   using   violence  to  achieve  a   political

objective,  there  is this vital  factor  in  this

power situation in Malaya, namely, that the Police

are  predominantly  Malay, the  armed  forces  are

predominantly Malay and the towns where



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 584</b></font><br><br>



rioting will take place are predominantly Chinese.

We   knew - in  fact,  we  predicted  in  our  Party

statement which we issued in July - that any attempt

by any group or by any sector of the population to

impose  its  will  on  another  by  force  and  by

coercion means, in effect, the danger of race  war

in   Malaya.  The  danger  is  over  now  but  the

Assistant  Minister for Education knew  how  acute

that danger was during the recent riots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it is being asked: "Where was the Member for

Tanjong Pagar? Why did he not tell the rioters  to

keep quiet?"



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Yes, why did you not?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> The Member for Tanjong Pagar

never ran away and never will.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in my own mind, I was convinced

that  the Government asked for this. And once  the

mobs  were  on  the streets, the only  answer  was

force.  Of course, there are people like  Mossadeq

who  can  go before a mob and weep, laugh and  cry

and  make them disperse. But this is Asia, not the

Levant, and whoever one can be - Tunku Abdul  Rahman

or Chin Peng - when a mob is out, the only answer is

force. You cannot appeal to a mob that is out  for

blood.  A  mob  is  already something  beyond  the

control of reason and will only respond to  force.

Whatever  the  rights and wrongs of the  riots,  I

think  the Government knew it was coming  and  the

Government  moved  into  prepared  positions   the

moment  it  happened. In fact, the policy  of  the

Government  was  such as to have  made  the  riots

inevitable.  Once the situation had  been  created

and the cry was the defence of Chinese culture and

civilisation,  with students in a stay-in  strike,

did  the Government expect that only parents would

go outside the Chinese High School to wait and see

whether their children were beaten up or not in  a

flush out?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has won this round of the battle

because  ultimately force was the answer.  But  if

you  want  to win the long-term battle,  then  you

have got to organise the people on your side.  And

you  must  get  the  people who  can  organise  to

organise  on  your  side. The first  task  is  not

fighting the Communists.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 585</b></font><br><br>



The  first task is to wrest the rifle barrel from

the hands of the British. When you have done that,

then  you decide what kind of Malaya you are going

to  have.  That has been the stand of the People's

Action Party and will continue to be the stand  of

the  People's  Action Party. I  can  think  of  no

greater  tribute than the one Mr Sutherland  paid

me - I hope personally he does not think that I have

anything   against  him - when  he  said  he   could

forecast  90  per  cent of what our  attitude  was

going  to be. That shows the consistency  and  the

firmness  of  the People`s Action Party.  We  say

that   the   Government's  tactics   were   wrong.

Politically,  the overall plan was made  on  false

premises. Tactically, they were out-manoeuvred. It

does not matter what happens in this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it does not matter what happens in the

next  few months. The Member for Cairnhill  wanted

to  know  if there would be a halt to this  purge.

How  can  there  be?  Once the  ball  has  started

rolling,  where does it end? They cannot stop  it.

Having  gone  half the way, they have to  complete

their  plan.  Completing  their  plan  means   the

creation of a vacuum. The creation of a vacuum  is

possible as long as you have the rifle barrel. But

if you cannot fill up that vacuum and you have got

to  hold the situation by the rifle barrel all the

time  like Syngman Rhee in Korea and Diem in South

Vietnam then there will be many people like myself

who  have  got that 25 per cent disagreement  with

the  Communists.  But faced  with  the  choice  of

suppression and repression in a dictatorial  semi-fascist  state  and  the controlled  democracy  of

Communist  state, we will not have  the  slightest

doubt which one we prefer.
