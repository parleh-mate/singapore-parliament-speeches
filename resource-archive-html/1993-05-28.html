   <b>HDB RENTAL FLATS</b>
  </div>
  <div align="center">
   <b>(Demand)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo</b> asked the Minister for National Development whether applications for rental flats increased significantly in 1991 and 1992, and whether there are adequate rental flats to cater to the increase in demand.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang (Minister of State for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister of State for National Development (Mr Lim Hng Kiang) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the total number of applications for HDB rental flats increased from 2,400 in 1989 to about 5,900 in 1991 and 1992.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have explained to this House last year, the increase in demand for rental flats is largely due to the lowering of the minimum age limit for rental applicants. In 1989, the age limit for rental applicants who apply with a proper family nucleus was lowered from 29 to 21 years of age. In 1991, the age limit for rental of HDB flats by single persons, under the Joint Singles Scheme, was lowered from 40 years for males, and 35 years for female applicants, to 35 years for both male and female applicants.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to say that, despite the rise in demand for rental flats, HDB has succeeded in maintaining the number of applicants on its waiting list at a steady level of around 3,000 by releasing more flats for rental. At present, there are about 3,100 applicants on the waiting list for rental flats. About 1,400 flats are currently available for rental to citizen families. To meet the rise in demand for rental flats, HDB has increased the supply of rental flats. An additional 700 flats will be released for rental in the coming months. HDB will endeavour to keep the waiting time for rental flats as short as possible.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar GRC):</b> Sir, are there any plans to upgrade, parti-
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> cularly, the 1-room flats so that the environment will be made more palatable?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Both 1-room and 2-room flats which are located in the precincts earmarked for either the Demonstration stage or the steady state phase of the upgrading programme have been included in the upgrading.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam GRC):</b> Sir, may I know from the Minister where does he get the supply of available flats for rental? The other question is: How long do the applicants have to wait before they are allocated the rental flats?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> For some time now, since the mid-80s until 1989, the demand for rental flats has been reducing. As a result, there was an increasing number of vacancies in many of the rental blocks resulting in some security problems, especially when the vacancies reached levels of 30-50%. For blocks which are more than 50% vacant, we conduct a relocation exercise to move the tenants to other blocks which are occupied. With this increase in demand, blocks which have been mothballed for demolition are now put back on the market.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the average, applicants would wait about nine months before they are allocated a flat. This is because many of the applicants are quite particular about the location of the flat. If they are prepared to accept the 1-room flats in less prime locations, they can be allocated their flats earlier.

   <b>SURGE IN RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY PRICES</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for National Development if he will explain the surge in residential property prices and whether the current selling prices of public and private residential units are realistic and sustainable.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I first declare my interest as a director of a property company. Question No. 2.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang (for the Minister for National Development):</b> There are two categories of residential units in Singapore: firstly, new HDB flats sold by HDB, and secondly, HDB resale flats and private housing units sold on the open market.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me first address the first category. New HDB flats are priced to reflect the construction and land costs, premium factors such as good locality, storey height, and so on, as well as design improvements.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last nine months, from July 1992 to April 1993, construction costs for HDB flats have been stable. As a result, price increases for new HDB flats have averaged only 1.8%. HDB expects the price adjustments for 1993 to be minimal. If construction and land costs continue to remain stable, purchasers of new HDB flats need not worry about higher prices.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to HDB resale flats. Although there are restrictions on the sale and purchase of HDB resale flats, their prices are largely determined by market forces. HDB's records show that resale prices have increased by about 5-10% since HDB announced on 23rd March this year that it would increase the amount of mortgage financing it provided to buyers. One possible reason for this increase is that the larger HDB loans have made buyers more willing to pay higher prices for a flat of their choice. HDB expects the increase in resale prices due to this reason to be a one-off phenomenon.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason why prices of HDB resale flats will stabilise is the bigger expected supply of resale flats. Because HDB is building more new flats and a higher proportion of the purchasers are upgraders, more flats will be offered for resale. This will dampen further increases in the resale prices. In 1993, more than 20,000 purchasers will take delivery of their new HDB flats. Of this number, 45%, or 9,000, are upgraders. They will put their existing flats on the resale market. In comparison, in 1991, the corresponding figure was 6,800 and in 1992, this was
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 260</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 8,300. So the number of flats going into the resale market, because of upgrading, will increase.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to private residential properties. Prices of private residential properties are determined by the developers' calculations and what buyers are prepared to pay. Residential property prices have increased because of many factors. They include a growing economy, greater investor confidence, rising incomes, low interest rates, and the easing of some CPF investment rules. In addition, perceptions and expectations of sellers and buyers of properties and the booming stock market also play a part in the rising prices.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the long term, property prices in Singapore will almost surely rise in step with economic growth and prosperity so long as the fundamentals of the economy are sound. But our property market is also subject to short term cyclical ups and downs, like property markets everywhere. Thus, while current selling prices may reflect supply and demand in the present circumstances, we cannot assume that present prices are sustainable, or predict when the property market will cool down.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to the different types of property buyers. There are many types of property buyers. Some wish to upgrade their homes or buy new ones to live in. When these buyers choose to make their purchase is their personal decision. However, such buyers should not panic into buying their homes because they are worried that there will be a shortage of supply.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential house buyers should take note that the supply ofnew private properties will increase substantially. Over the next eight years, URA's Real Estates Statistics Quarterly show a potential supply of 52,340 dwelling units or an average of 6,500 per annum. For the years 1993 and 1994, the estimated supply coming onstream is 7,366 and 9,468 dwelling units respectively. This is much more than the average historical demand of 3,900 dwelling units per annum and supply of
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 261</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> 4,200 units per annum over the last 10 years. Indeed several real estate developers have expressed their concern to the Ministry of National Development that we may be heading for an over-supply of private properties.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is sufficient land in Singapore for both private and public housing. Government plans to release land for development of 3,000 dwelling units a year, and will release more if the demand justifies it. This is in addition to the supply of housing land available in private hands.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to another group of property buyers. These are the ones who buy expecting property prices to rise, whereupon they will sell at a profit. Such speculation is a normal part of the free market, provided it is not fuelled by excessive lending from financial institutions. Persons who derive regular income from such property transactions must of course declare and pay tax on this income. However, their greater exposure is to the risk that the market will turn, catching them with unsold and overpriced properties. In every property boom, sooner or later this happens.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck:</b> Sir, with the recent rises in URA's land tender prices, how would that affect HDB's pricing? As the Minister has said, the price of land is one big determinant and now the tender prices of URA's land would definitely move up the land value?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> HDB purchases land from the Government at a price determined by the Chief Valuer. The Chief Valuer, in setting the prices for sale of land to HDB, takes the transactions of land in the market as one of the factors for consideration. If the land prices that are transacted, both in the sale of Government land as well as other private transactions, show a clear trend of increases, then of course this will be factored in by the Chief Valuer. If this is a sporadic and unusual occurrence, then the Chief Valuer may well ignore this price increase.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 262</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck:</b> Under such circumstances, in the current speculative mood of driving the prices up and land prices have moved up, inadvertently HDB prices will move up and this will be a trend. How is the Government going to assure, as the Minister has said before, that the new entrants into the workforce can afford to buy future houses, especially when the tender prices of land are low, the Government may withdraw the sale of land?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Just to give an example. Even though the private developer may tender for a piece of land at $3,000 per square metre, HDB continues to purchase land from the Government, as valued by the Chief Valuer, at $1,800 per square metre. So the price that HDB pays is determined by the Chief Valuer and, over the years, this has been fairly stable and it is not reflected in the escalating cost of HDB prices. The main parameter for the pricing of HDB flats is the construction costs and, as I have said, in the last nine months, construction costs have remained stable and, as a result, HDB prices have also remained stable. For 1993-94, we hope that the construction sector will not be overheated and we expect the tender prices for HDB flats to remain stable. Therefore, we do not see major price increases for HDB new flats.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck:</b> Sir, could I take the Minister's earlier answer to mean that they will leave speculators alone, as the Minister has said that there will be more than enough houses to go around and genuine house buyers need not panic into rushing to buy their houses?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> There are two aspects to my answer. The first aspect is that there is a substantial supply coming on. Genuine home buyers should take note of this substantial supply and make their decision accordingly. My answer did not say that speculators will be left alone.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me clarify the Housing Developers Rules. Over the years, the Government has put in place a comprehensive set of rules called the Housing Developers
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 263</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Rules. These rules are intended to regulate the practices of housing developers so that the interests of home buyers are protected. In particular, the Housing Developers Rules provide guidelines on booking fees, impose partial forfeiture of booking fees if a purchase is aborted, and also disallow transfer or assignment of option to purchase. These rules strike a balance between safeguarding the interests of genuine home buyers and deterring speculation. These rules are vigorously enforced by the Controller of Housing.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also explain what these rules mean so that we do not go away with the idea that it is very easy to buy an option and speculate. The first rule is that you must pay not more than 10% of the price in your booking and that gives you the right to exercise the option three weeks after the sale and purchase agreement is given to you. So whoever books gets an option and he has three weeks to exercise the option. He exercises the option by paying 20% of the purchase price. It is only after that stage that he is allowed to assign his option to a subsequent purchaser. So it is not true that somebody can book today and sell off tomorrow. He cannot sell it off to another person tomorrow. The developer would not allow it. The developer will only sell the unit to somebody who has booked it and he will only sell to that particular person whose name is in his register of booking and only after he has paid up 20% of the purchase price. After that stage, the initial option holder can then assign his option to somebody else. The Controller of Housing monitors the booking register of every developer and compares the names in the booking register with that of the sale and purchase agreements to make sure the developer does not sell the option to somebody else and a different person has bought the unit. This is vigorously enforced.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to give an example. In a recent development of about 300 units, 14 option
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 264</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> holders in the end failed to exercise their options and have to forfeit their booking fee. One was successful in a resale later on, 10 weeks after the option. There was one case of transfer of option, but this was because the lady who booked could not get a bank loan for some reason and she applied to the Controller of Housing to allow her option to be transferred to her daughter who could get a housing loan. So the Controller of Housing exercised his authority and allowed the transfer. Otherwise, no transfer of such option is allowed under the Housing Developers Rules. So it is not that we do not bother about speculation. We control and enforce the rules.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister whether the Government has considered some form of capital gains tax in order to dampen speculation in the private property market?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> This has been considered and obviously it is not in our law books.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck:</b> The Minister has said that options are not transferable but, from what is happening, we see people queuing up and the very next day they are already selling the units. The other question is whether the forfeiture is a bit too low and that people who are looking at the gains that they can get out of selling may think it is worth taking a small risk.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Whether people take risk or not, I leave it to their personal decision. But let me just illustrate an example. For a unit going for half a million dollars in the market, you have to pay 10%, which is $50,000, to get the option. That gives you a three to five weeks' window before you exercise the sale and purchase agreement where you have to pay the 20%. If you fail to book, you forfeit 10% of the $50,000, which is $5,000. So effectively, you are putting $5,000 for the period of three to five weeks. What happens in the market is that somebody books and he hopes to be able to assign to another person during these five weeks.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 265</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> That is not recognised by the developer, nor is it recognised by the Controller of Housing. So what the option holder does is that he has a side agreement with the subsequent purchaser. The subsequent purchaser must foot the 20% of the purchase price for him to make the option valid. After that, he can assign to the second purchaser.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During this period, there is a sub-deal between the option holder and the purchaser. It is not recognised by the Controller of Housing and it is not recognised by the developer. The developer cannot accept the second person's name. So if anyone of them reneges on the deal, that is up to him. Anybody who enters into this agreement must do so with his eyes open. First, the prospective speculator knows that he has to forfeit a substantial amount if he forgoes the option fee. The subsequent purchaser, if he enters into a side agreement with the option holder, does so at his own risk because he would not get any protection from the Controller of Housing or from the developer.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> I would like to find out from the Minister whether such rules that he has enunciated also apply to the developer of overseas properties which are marketed in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> Let me take this opportunity to also sound another word of caution. All property developers in Singapore are only allowed to market their properties if they have a licence to sell before completion. To obtain the licence to sell before completion, he has to follow fairly stringent rules in terms of approval of building control plans and collection of downpayment and instalment payments. Singaporeans who buy from local developers within the ambit of such rules are fairly well protected. Singaporeans who buy from overseas developers who advertise in Singapore will not have such a protection. So let buyers beware. If you buy and you
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 266</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> are hoping that your developer from another country will deliver to you as promised in the advertisement, it is not the job of the Controller of Housing in Singapore to control such development because it is outside his purview.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck:</b> Could I take the Minister to mean that he is quite happy with the current controls and that he is also quite happy with the current state of affairs?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b> The Controller of Housing monitors all transactions in the booking register and the sales and purchase agreements. This recent spate of so-called speculation has yet to play itself out because the recent developments put on sale in April or May have not seen the expiry of the option period yet. So we are still monitoring the names in the booking register and we are making sure that the names which are subsequently entered in the sales and purchase agreements are the same persons. If not, we will go for the developer and he will lose his licence to sell before completion. I am not saying that I am happy with the present situation. My concern with the present situation is that genuine purchasers ought not to be carried away by these sentiments. They ought to look at the numbers coming on-stream and make their own personal decision when they want to enter the market. My Ministry is also looking at these rules. If we find it necessary, we will tighten the rules to make them even more difficult for speculation to take place.

  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 267</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The admission standards, curricula, research records, student population, staff and other factors such as library resources, areas of specialisation and distribution of class honours.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Whether the university is a traditional source for the training of Singapore law students. In the past three years, these 15 universities produced more than 50% of the total number of law graduates from Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Committee also considered that the courses offered by the university should, as a rule, have pure law subjects and the courses which are opened to "A" level holders should at least be 3-year full-time courses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I believe the Member is aware that these recommendations are not retrospective and will not adversely affect students in the universities where they were enroled or were accepted in the universities before the date of the Committee's report.

  <div align="center">
   <b>(Improvement to procedure and execution)</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong</b> asked the Minister for Law whether the procedure and execution of departmental summonses will be improved with a view to cutting down the number of offenders having to attend court.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, procedures already exist whereby such offenders can avoid having to attend court. This is so in respect of compoundable offences. They need not attend court if they pay the composition fee.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the majority of departmental summonses referred to by the Member, the offenders are offered composition. The problem of the large number of court cases arises only because many people
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 268</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> ignore offers of composition and allow them to lapse, leading to summonses requiring them to appear in court. Whey they do appear, most of them plead guilty.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in relation to many departmental offences, an offender may plead guilty by letter and agree to pay the fine which may be imposed. This also does away with the need to appear in court.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many of the offenders could be unaware of the benefits of composition payment to avoid attending court, efforts are now being made to educate and inform the public of the advantage of compounding offences. In his address at the Opening of the new Subordinate Courts in January this year, the Chief Justice has emphasised the need for offenders to fully utilise the composition facility available in the majority of departmental summonses. Recently, the Housing and Development Board, the Urban and Redevelopment Authority and the Traffic Police followed this up by mounting a joint initiative to educate motorists on the advantages of paying composition fines promptly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, a number of departments have introduced various measures to make composition payments easier, eg, payment by telephone banking, automated teller machine, electronic fund transfer or payment at post office.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I wish to inform the Member that the Attorney-General and the Ministry of Law are now reviewing the law to ascertain if the composition fee or pleading guilty by letter can be extended to further categories of offences.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Minister has mentioned about educating offenders. I think in this area perhaps the Police are not doing enough. I hardly see any posters or pamphlets being circulated to get offenders to compound their fines. So I ask the Minister whether his Ministry is willing to widen this education process to offenders.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Sir, the authorities as well as the judiciary, I am sure, will
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 269</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> welcome any useful suggestions from the Member or anybody else which would help to facilitate this process of getting people to pay the composition fees. As far as the Police are concerned, the department in the Police which would be most interested, as far as composition of fees is concerned, would be the Traffic Police. As I have just mentioned in my answer, the Traffic Police is one of the departments which has recently embarked on this educational and awareness campaign.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yeo Cheow Tong):</b> Sir, there has been a marked increase in the number of Singaporeans taking up medical studies in overseas universities and medical schools in recent years. There has also been an increase in the number of applications by non-Singaporean doctors for registration with the Singapore Medical Council to work or train in Singapore. This trend, if unchecked, will result in Singapore having an excessive number of doctors after the year 2000. This will lead to emigration, especially of specialists. Experience in the developed countries has also shown that an excess of doctors will lead to a higher health care expenditure.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are currently 176 foreign universities and medical schools whose medical degrees are recognised for registration in
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 270</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Singapore. My Ministry is now reviewing the Schedule in order to reduce the number to a more appropriate and manageable level.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to Dr Toh's second question, foreign doctors in possession of degrees in the Schedule are eligible to apply for registration with the Singapore Medical Council. However, as to whether they are granted registration will depend upon a number of factors such as whether they possess any special skills or expertise and where they intend to seek employment.

  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Health whether Medifund will provide the same level of support to full-time housewives who are covered by Medishield but who do not contribute to Medisave, as to those who contribute regularly to Medisave.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, Medifund is meant to support Singaporeans who are unable to meet their medical expenses, even though they have made their best efforts to look after their own needs by contributing to Medisave and participating in Medishield. It is not meant to relieve Singaporeans of the need to save for their medical expenses. If a person has not consistently contributed to Medisave while working, or has consciously opted out of Medishield, then when he runs into difficulties with his medical expenses, he will receive less support from Medifund.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 271</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full-time housewives do not contribute to Medisave as they have no employment income. The help they will receive from Medifund will depend on whether their husbands have participated in Medisave and Medishield. Medifund will naturally consider the case of a housewife more sympathetically if she is covered by Medishield. But Medifund cannot treat identically two housewives, both with Medishield, if one husband has contributed to Medisave while the other husband has not. The exact amount of help will depend on the circumstances of each case, and will be determined by the Medifund Committee of the hospital according to these guidelines.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, does the Minister agree that housewives who are looking after their children and families, and hence enabling their husbands to work with a peace of mind, are also contributing to society and the economy? If Medifund does not provide the same level of support, does the Minister not think that it is unfair and discriminating? And why is it necessary that it be tied to the husband's Medisave contribution?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b> Sir, the Medisave scheme is meant to be a family-oriented scheme whereby the breadwinner contributes to Medisave and thereby uses Medisave to help pay for the family's overall hospital expenses. So if one housewife's husband is contributing to Medisave as well as being covered by Medishield, then that family could be eligible for greater support than another family where the husband has not contributed to Medisave or has opted out of Medishield.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <b>Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon (Yuhua):</b> Question No. 7, Sir.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang (for the Minister for National Development):</b> The Parks and Recreation Department maintains 130 parks and open spaces in private housing estates. These vary in size from less than 0.1 hectare to about 2 hectares, and occupy a total area of nearly 76 hectares.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department regularly inspects these parks and open spaces as part of its normal maintenance and upkeep programme. Facilities and equipment which require upgrading or replacement are identified during these regular maintenance inspections. Based on these inspections as well as other feedback, the Department carries out the required upgrading and improvement work to ensure that equipment provided is safe and that facilities remain adequate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fiscal year 1992, 49 of these parks and open spaces were upgraded at a total
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 273</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> cost of $426,000. The upgrading included repair and replacement of play equipment and footpaths, addition of play equipment, benches and other basic facilities, and improvements to drainage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department will continue with this approach in upgrading playgrounds and open spaces in private housing estates.

  <!-- Mr Cheo Chai Chen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.
  <b>Mr Cheo Chai Chen</b> asked the Minister for National Development if he will state, for each year from 1989 to 1993, (i) the total funds available to the Community Improvement Projects Committee for community projects; (ii) the percentage of these funds allocated to projects with Town Council participation and the amount given to each Town Council; and (iii) for which projects were the funds given.

  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Lee Yiok Seng) (for the Minister for National Development):</b> Sir, I am answering on behalf of my Minister.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Community Improvement Projects Committee (CIPC) Scheme was implemented, in its present form, in April 1990. The total funds available to the CIPC for community projects from FY 90 to FY 93 amounted to $65 million. The breakdown is as follows: FY 90, $10 million; FY 91, $15 million; FY 92, $20 million; and FY 93, $20 million.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CIPC funds are allocated to the constituency as a whole through the Citizens' Consultative Committees (CCCs). The constituency has HDB areas administered by Town Councils as well as non-HDB areas which are not administered by Town Councils. The CCC decides on the priority of the various project proposals it receives and what items it should support and submits its requests to CIPC for funding.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 274</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From FY 1990 to 1st May 1993, a total of about $42 million or 65% of the $65 million available under the CIPC programme has been committed for various projects submitted by the Town Councils through the CCCs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of CIPC funds committed for Town Council projects varies from Town Council to Town Council, depending on the types of projects approved.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Town Council projects which have been allocated CIPC funds fall mainly under these categories:
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Infrastructure facilities such as street lightings, covered walkways and footpaths;
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Recreational facilities such as cycling tracks, playgrounds, outdoor tables; and
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) General amenities which include landscaping of roadsides and open spaces.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I think the question asked specifically for the amount given to each Town Council and for which projects were the funds given.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng:</b> Sir, as I have stated, about 65% of the funds available under the CIPC programme had been committed for various projects submitted by the Town Councils through the CCCs. If the Member wants the details for each Town Council, he can write to me or to my Ministry. We will try to give the Member whatever information that is available after consulting the respective Town Councils.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the question asks for the "funds allocated to projects with town council participation and the amount given to each town council".
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng:</b> The CIPC fund is given to the CCCs, not to the Town Councils, and I think this is fair. Town Councils receive direct grants from the Government, particularly for the residents
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 275</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> in the HDB areas. We know that in each constituency there are many residents who are not in the HDB areas. So this fund also caters for those residents who are not in the HDB areas and it is for the CCCs to decide on the priority for improvements in their own constituency.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Is it true that though the fund was allocated to the CCCs, the Town Council uses the fund for their project development? The question here asks specifically for the amount for each project in each Town Council.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Lee Yiok Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Lee Yiok Seng:</b> I have stated quite clearly that, under the CIPC programme, 65% of the amount goes to the projects submitted by the Town Councils. And this is the fund allocated to the CCCs. So for the individual Town Council, as I said, he can write to us. We will try our best to give him the information.

  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck</b> asked the Minister for Labour (a) if he will give more details of the Suzhou township project led by the Singapore Labour Foundation; (b) how much money has SLF committed to all its investments in China for the years 1994 to 1998; (c) where does the money come from; and (d) how will the investments benefit the labour movement in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Ong Teng Cheong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, since I have been personally involved in this project from the very outset, I therefore undertake to answer the question raised by the hon. Member.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Suzhou township project was widely reported in the press during my official visit to China some two weeks ago. It has generated some public interest, and I would like to take this opportunity to explain briefly the background and the role of the Singapore Labour Foundation in as far as this project is concerned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October last year, when I was accompanying the Senior Minister on his visit to China, a Xinhua news agency reporter suggested that Singapore could help build a Singapore-style township in China. I thought it was an interesting idea, and I asked him where the location for this township should be. He said he did not know.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, when we travelled from Wuxi to Shanghai, we stopped over at Suzhou. I noticed that Suzhou was strategically located at the heart of the Yangtze River Delta. It was close to Shanghai, about 90 km away. Hongqiao International Airport was also not too far away. That was when the idea of the Suzhou township project was mooted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December last year, the Mayor of Suzhou visited me in Singapore. He was keen to tap the Singapore's experience and expertise. So we discussed the idea -
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 277</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> he was excited - and he invited me to pick a site in Suzhou to build a Singapore-style industrial township.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, the concept is for Singapore to help plan, develop and manage the township, adopting the Singapore software, but adapted to fit into the Chinese environment.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Singapore consortium will be set up to participate in the development of the township. The project offers a unique opportunity for Singapore to export its expertise in township planning, development and management. If successful, it will create a familiar industrial and business environment for Singapore companies which are keen on venturing into China. This way, it will help encourage the development of an external economy for Singapore. It will not only open up a new niche for Singapore, but also a window into the huge China market for our local businesses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For reasons of expediency, I have used the Singapore Labour Foundation as a vehicle to spearhead the project. The Foundation's role is therefore that of a facilitator, that is, to help open the door.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you have read in the press, we have reached an in-principle agreement with the Suzhou Government to proceed with the township development project. The Foundation will now invite the private sector to form a consortium to carry on with the project.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the Suzhou project, the SLF is also exploring other economic ventures not only in China, but also in Malaysia and elsewhere.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as all these discussions are still preliminary, I am not in a position, at this point of time, to say how much money the Foundation will commit to its investments in China over the next five years.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foundation has always exercised prudence in its investments. To fund its overseas ventures, it will use only funds derived from its investment income. The bulk of the Foundation's accumulated
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 278</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> surplus comes from its domestic investments. These include investments in property and investment income derived from its subsidiary companies. Since 1990, the NTUC-related cooperatives also contribute part of their surpluses to the Foundation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all other projects undertaken by SLF, such as the Pasir Ris Resort, the Sentosa Beach Resort and the Orchid Country Club, the ultimate objective of SLF's investments is to help raise the social and economic status of our workers, and ensure that our workers will continue to enjoy a fair share of Singapore's progress.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, what is the return that the Deputy Prime Minister expects from this project? As the Deputy Prime Minister has said that the main objective of SLF is to provide social amenities and improve the status of workers in Singapore, how would these investments in a foreign land cater to the needs of Singaporean workers and thus serve the new objectives of SLF?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not able, at this stage, to give a figure of the return on the investments. As I said, it is very preliminary at this stage and we do not even know the figures of investments in these projects in China and overseas.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of how this will benefit workers, as Members know, this is not a zero sum game. The Minister for Trade and Industry had explained in his closing address at the Regionalisation Forum that regionalisation will be a major thrust in the next phase of our economic development to enable Singapore to overcome its resource limitations. When our businessmen invest overseas, it does not mean that they are shutting down their operations in Singapore and relocating their businesses wholesale to another country. Their overseas investments can complement their investments at home, and it will enable them to upgrade their Singapore operations, thereby creating higher value-added jobs and also better
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 279</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> paid jobs for our workers. This is what the Japanese and the Swiss have done. The Japanese and the Swiss MNCs invest in almost every part of the world. By expanding their businesses overseas, they ensure that their mature economies continue to grow, and their standard of living remains among the highest in the world.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do workers in Singapore benefit directly from these investments? As I have explained earlier, the ultimate objective of SLF investments is no different from its investments in Singapore, that is, to strengthen its financial resources so that it can do even more for workers in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chia Shi Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chia Shi Teck:</b> Sir, the Hon. DPM mentioned about transferring software to Suzhou. From what we have read, the decision has not really been taken. But we have already signed the letter of intent to develop Suzhou township. So what will happen if the Government decides to go to Shandong, Yantai and Weihai?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as of now, the position is this. We have signed an in-principle agreement with the Suzhou Municipality to help plan, develop and manage a township. There are two parts to this development. So far, we have put up a rough outline plan for the development of the township. We will form a consortium to help develop this township, that is, we will be opening the door, making the preparation for the hardware transfer, and the investment will go to Suzhou. But as far as the software transfer is concerned, ie, to administer and manage this township, we have not yet made a decision, as reported in the press. I will be going to Shandong in about a month's time to look at the situation in Shandong. This was recommended by the Prime Minister, because I have not been to Yantai and Weihai. After the trip to Shandong, we will then decide whether the software transfer will take place at Shandong or Suzhou. But the hardware
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 280</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> transfer to Suzhou will continue. This will be carried on by the private sector, ie, the consortium.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (Tampines GRC):</b> Sir, will this consortium be a SLF-led consortium? For the private sector that has been invited, will it be Government-linked companies only?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Ong Teng Cheong:</b> The consortium would include members or companies from both the Government as well as the private sector. Whether SLF will hold a significant share it has yet to be decided. I believe SLF will hold a very small share or no share at all, because, as I have said, our role is that of a facilitator. It is not the objective of SLF to go into business. We will exercise prudence in our investment. Details would be released later, as we go along. So I would urge Members to be a bit more patient.

These two sites will yield a total of 850 flats, which will be released for booking in the third quarter of 1993. The normal ancillary facilities, such as children's playgrounds, will be provided as part of these two public housing contracts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A site for commercial development adjacent to the Simei MRT Station was sold in May 1993 to a private developer. Under the terms of the lease, the developer is required to provide a wet market, in addition to other commercial

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the conditions of the sale, the developer is required to complete the development within four years from the date the site is handed over to him. The commercial development is thus expected to be completed by 1st July 1997. In view of the current temporary shortage of commercial facilities in Simei Estate, HDB will request the developer to try to complete his development as soon as possible.

  <br> million in 1981 to $762 million in 1992. On a conservative estimate, some 2.5 million pledges pawned at 57 pawnshops in 1992 alone were valued at $1.3 billion. The public auction of unredeemed pledges for the period January to December 1992 saw an average of 20,000 pledges with a gross value of about $6 million sold each month.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments before the House today are to ensure stricter control and supervision of the pawnbroking business through closer monitoring and regulation, greater enforcement of the law and stiffer penalties for breaches of the law. The Bill also enlarges the powers and jurisdiction of the Registrar of Pawnbrokers so that he can carry out his duties more effectively.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Members will know from press accounts that we have tightened and improved the auctioning procedures for unredeemed pledges since October 1991. This is to ensure that auctioning exercises were carried out in a fair and open manner. Changes in the auctioning procedures which were introduced administratively have been further improved and fine-tuned. New auctioning rules will be made to give effect to the new procedures when these amendments come into force.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of the new administrative measures in October 1991, a total amount of $1.3 million in surpluses has been realised from the auctions for payment to pawners. Prior to that, hardly any surplus (ie, the difference between the pawned value and the sale price of the unredeemed pledge which the pawner is entitled to) resulted from the sale of the pledges. And when any surplus was realised, the pawners were not informed as the present Act does not require the pawnbrokers to provide the information. Unless a demand is received from a pawner within four months of the auction, pawnbrokers are not under any obligation to refund the surplus.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, the amendments will safeguard the rights of pawners to any surplus and place the onus on the pawnbrokers to inform pawners of any surplus and to account to the Registrar for any deductions from the surplus before
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 285</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> refunding any surplus to the pawners. Even pawners who fail to claim their surplus will not be deprived of their rights as these amendments provide for their right to make a claim at any time during a period of six years from the payment of any unclaimed surplus to the Accountant-General after which the unclaimed monies will be transferred to the Consolidated Fund.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order for the Registrar to perform his duties more effectively, the Bill empowers him to order a pawnbroker to deliver pledges, books and accounts of his business on the expiration, cancellation or termination of his licence whenever he has reason to believe that any dishonesty on the part of the pawnbroker has taken place in the disposal of the pledges. Pawnbrokers will also have to provide insurance coverage against damage, theft or loss of pawned articles to ensure the protection of pawners. The deposit required to be lodged with the Accountant-General as security for the proper conduct of the pawnbroking business has also been increased from $5,000 to $20,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing penalties have generally been enhanced as a deterrent measure. In addition, three new offences have been created concerning the illegal handling of pledges by pawnbrokers. The Registrar will be given the power to compound minor offences prescribed as compoundable by the Minister. In short, Sir, this Bill is a consequence of the reforms and tightening-up which have been introduced with regard to the pawnbroking business.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I rise to support the Pawnbrokers (Amendment) Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has mentioned about the great increases in the number of pledges and also in the amount deposited with pawnbrokers. This goes to show that there are still many poor people in Singapore. For this reason, the pawnbroking business
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 286</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> seems to be on the rise. In fact, it is having a boom at the moment. Usually, these poor people ask for small loans and the pawnshop is the most convenient place to go. It is also a fact that poor people are in the greatest need for cash. Of course, I would not sympathise with those poor people who waste their money on gambling and pawn their assets away, but I do sympathise with the poor who have need for quick cash in cases of emergency. In this respect, the pawnbrokers do provide a social service to improvident people. Fortunately, the law has been tightened against pawnbrokers, in particular, in keeping down the interest rates on loans at 1 1/2% per month. Also, there are now further safeguards and we note that in clause 10 there are safeguards against pledges. Tampering or destroying a pledge is going to be an offence. I think most of the people who have dealings with pawnbrokers would welcome this clause. Of course, I also welcome the further tightening and enhancing of the punishment sections to keep pawnbrokers in line, and also in safeguarding the pledges of people who pawn their items with the pawnbrokers. Sometimes they have to do it. This is really no fault of theirs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to get some clarification from the Minister, in particular, on clause 3. It says here that the premises to be licensed must be suitable for use as a pawnbroker's shop. I am puzzled as to what type of premises can be suitable for use as a pawnbroker's shop. The Building Control Division, in fact, has strict control of commercial premises. Are there any premises that are particularly marked suitable for a pawnbroker's shop?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also welcome that there is insistence of adequate insurance taken up by pawnbrokers in case of damage or loss of articles. In this respect, I would like to ask the Minister what is exactly meant by "adequate insurance".
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that the deposit of pawnbrokers has been increased from $5,000 to $20,000. Is there a need for this amount to be increased?
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 287</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I look at the Pawnbrokers Act, I notice at Schedule B that some of the payments that are paid to pawnbrokers seem to be minuscule in the light of today's standards. To be fair to pawnbrokers, I would ask the Minister perhaps to look at these payments which the pawnbrokers are entitled. For example, inspection of sale book's entry per sale is only two cents; the charge on form of declaration where the loan is $2 or under, it is only one cent chargeable by the pawnbrokers; and for a loan of above $2, it is only two cents. Perhaps, the Minister could look at them and include them in the amendments.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Sir, I have two questions to ask the Minister. What is the rationale for requiring pawnbrokers to pay the surplus to the Accountant-General? Secondly, would the Minister consider donating this surplus, which is payable to the Accountant-General, to a charitable organisation in Singapore? I consider this payment of surplus to the Accountant-General as extra income for the Government.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chng Hee Kok:</b> Sir, I rise to support this Bill. Just a question for the Minister to consider, and this is the question of insurance against damage and theft of articles. When the articles are auctioned off, there is a surplus. The amount could be claimed within four months. Within these four months, there is really no insurance cover for the person who pawns his articles. Is there any way that this person can be protected? Under the present Bill, there is a gap of four months.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> May I ask the Minister how many registered pawnbrokers are there in Singapore today?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> I want to thank the Members who have spoken.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Mr Chiam concludes, from the figures that I have given, that there must be a great deal of poor people using these
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 288</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> pawnshops. In fact, this is not necessarily so. I had a discussion with the Registrar of Pawnbrokers and he has, in fact, said to me that patterns have changed. In his dealings with pawnbrokers, his assessment is that it is no longer the poor or the needy who are compelled to go to the pawnshops. In fact, more wealthy people and businessmen are resorting to their valuables to raise funds for various purposes to meet short term needs for working capital, as pawning an item is a quick method of obtaining finance. So I asked him for examples. He also pointed out that there are less formalities to be observed than going to the banks for loans because no further security is required. He has pointed out to me that this is demonstrated by the large number of branded goods and other valuable items that are appearing at the auctions. For example, the April 1993 auction saw a gold ingot pawned at $16,000, a gold diamond Rolex watch pawned at $14,000, two gold Rolex watches with gold bracelets pawned at $9,000 and $8,000 respectively, three gold bracelets pawned at $8,000. In one previous auction, there was a jewellery box which had been pawned at about $40,000. So patterns have shifted and it is not that huge crowds of poor people are going to these pawnbrokers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his question about the amendment to the premises, actually if he looks at the original provisions of the Moneylenders Act, this amendment is to improve the existing provision because the existing provision requires the Registrar to be satisfied that the premises to be licensed are structurally adapted for use as a pawnbroker's shop and in all other respects are suitable for that purpose. So the amendment is a better approach because, as he said, those aspects should be really covered by the Building Control Division.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for adequate insurance, this will be necessary, but the exact quantum of it must be left to the Registrar of Pawnbrokers to decide.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has mentioned the point about the payments which the pawnbrokers are
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 289</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> entitled to. I take his point that there should be a review whether these are minuscule or not.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His final question on the latest figure of pawnbrokers, I have to ask the Registrar of Pawnbrokers for the details and give it to him.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang asked why the surpluses which are unclaimed must go to the Accountant-General. This is a general principle of financial procedures in the Government. As to whether it should be donated to charity, because he considers this as extra income for the Government, what is wrong with the extra income for Government? It goes to the State, which is then used for all sorts of development purposes. I see nothing wrong with it. Unless the Finance Minister tells me that the Registrar of Pawnbrokers is doing something inherently wrong, I think we should keep to that provision.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chng Hee Kok raised the question of whether there will be insurance coverage during the interim period before it is sold. This is a question which I will ask the Registrar of Pawnbrokers to consider. I think it is a fair point that it should be covered by insurance at that time.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Can I clarify with the Minister in regard to my point about poor people going to the pawnshops for loans? I stand to be corrected. It seems to me that pawnbrokers are only allowed to loan up to a limit of $1,000.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> As I have said, the information given by the Registrar of Pawnbrokers is that items have been pawned for as much as $40,000. So obviously, that is not so.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.
  <br>

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Third Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Third time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Companies (Amendment) Bill 1993 was read a Second time on 14th September 1992 and referred to a Select Committee for consideration.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Select Committee received 14 written representations and heard oral evidence from 17 persons in respect of eight of the written representations.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank representors for contributing their views, many of which were helpful.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the Select Committee was presented to this House on 26th April 1993. The Bill, as set out in Appendix I of the Report, incorporates various amendments made by the Select Committee. The explanations for all the amendments are contained in Appendix V of the Report. Many of the amendments are of a drafting nature. They serve to improve the language, remove ambiguities and provide certainty in certain provisions of the Bill. These do not require further comment. Instead, I will cover the substantive amendments recommended by the Select Committee. These amendments may be classified broadly as those relating to the Central Depository System (CDS) and those which concern other aspects of the Companies Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members are aware, a major part of the Bill is devoted to the CDS, or the book-entry or scripless system for the transfer of investors' rights and entitlements of listed securities. These provisions have generated considerable public interest and discussion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book-entry settlement is a more efficient system than the paper-based settlement. It also reduces the attendant problems of failed deliveries, late settlement and share forgeries that can arise
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 291</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> with physical deliveries. Besides the substantial savings in backroom support service and the shorter time required to effect transfers, the transaction cost under the book-entry system will also be lower for investors. Appendix VI of the Select Committee Report sets out in detail the benefits and mechanics of scripless trading, as well as the safeguards that have been built into the system to enhance the protection accorded to investors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now proceed to deal with the main amendments to the CDS provisions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the scripless environment, a company may face the possibility of not having an exhaustive list of its members for the purpose of its general meeting. This is because an investor could have his name entered in the Depository Register right up to the time when a company holds its general meeting. A new subsection (3) has therefore been added to proposed section 130D to provide that a depositor shall not be regarded as a member of a company entitled to exercise rights as a member in relation to meetings, unless his name appears on the Depository Register 48 hours before the general meeting.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present practice for the distribution of dividends is that a company will pay the dividend to the Depository, which will in turn distribute it to the shareholders so entitled. The Select Committee agreed that a company should be relieved from liability to depositors to the extent of the amount of dividends it has paid to the Depository. The Committee has therefore decided to add a new subsection (4) to the proposed section 130D to discharge a company from liability in respect of dividend payable to a depositor, when such dividend has already been paid by the company to the Depository.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several representors commented that the Depository should certify the names of persons on the Depository Register to a company upon a written request being
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 292</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> made by the company, and not only under the circumstances specified in the proposed section 130E. That provision has been amended accordingly.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the concern expressed by several representors, section 130H has been amended to clarify that the Depository will be protected from liability only if it has acted in good faith and without negligence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several representors have raised the concern that damages may not always be an adequate remedy if a depositor's book-entry securities are wrongly or erroneously transferred out of his securities account. They have suggested that the provision in the proposed section 130J against rectification of the Depository Register be amended, so that remedies other than damages are allowed.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address the representors' concern but without creating the practical problems in unwinding transactions in a scripless system, the Committee has amended the proposed section 130J to allow other remedies such as the re-transfer of shares where no third-party rights are involved. Corresponding amendments have been made to proposed section 130L. The proposed section 130M makes an amendment of a similar effect to sections 21, 76A and 106E of the Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original proposed section 130N provides for legal and equitable mortgages of book-entry securities. The view has been expressed that it may not be feasible to create a legal mortgage of book-entry securities. This section has now been revised to provide for creation of security interest in book-entry securities by way of assignment, or by way of a charge.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now go on to the amendments relating to the non-CDS provisions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 18, as originally introduced in Parliament, the Court has the discretion to disqualify a person from being a director, or to participate in the management of a company if he is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 293</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> convicted in Singapore for any offence involving fraud, or in connection with the formation or management of a company. It has been suggested that the clause should be amended to cover overseas convictions involving fraud or dishonesty. This suggestion has been accepted and appropriate amendments have been made to clause 18.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members would recall, the proposed new sections 216A and 216B provide for statutory derivative actions by minority shareholders on behalf of their companies. Only one representor has questioned the need for such a provision. The representor was concerned that the new statutory right might be open to abuse by minority shareholders.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee recognised that the new sections would provide more effective avenue for minority shareholders to protect their interests and that of the company. Nevertheless, to meet some of the representor's concern, the statutory derivative action will only be available in respect of unlisted companies. The Committee is of the view that the proceedings and performance of public-listed companies are already monitored by the various regulatory authorities and disgruntled shareholders of such companies have an avenue in that they can sell their shares in the open market. To further deter frivolous applications, the Committee has also decided to give the Court the discretion to order the complainant to furnish security for costs.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 23 of the original Bill, which amends section 328 of the Act, accords certain preferential debts priority over floating charges, in the event that the assets of a company available for general creditors are insufficient to meet these debts. Floating charges, however, crystallise upon the liquidation of a company and would become fixed charges. Hence, upon winding up, there may be no more floating charges for the preferential debts to take precedence. Clause 23 has therefore been amended such that a floating charge, even if it
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 294</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> crystallises, would not affect the preferential debts. This clause has also been amended to provide that all costs, charges and expenses of winding up, including the remuneration of liquidators, shall have priority over floating charges. This is done so as not to disadvantage the liquidators.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

   <b>MONEYLENDERS (AMENDMENT) BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Law (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill amends the Moneylenders Act to increase the quantum of penalties for illegal moneylending and unwarranted harassment and intimidation of debtors, to create a new offence in that regard and to give greater powers to the Police under the Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members, I am sure, would have read numerous accounts in the press of illegal moneylenders or loansharks resorting to the use of threats and violence in extracting payment from debtors for loans given. These loans were often at exorbitant rates of interest. They prey on debtors who, having no access to the usual channels of raising finance, had no recourse except to look to those loansharks for their funds.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of cases of illegal moneylending reported to the Police has shown a marked increase over the last six years. In 1992 alone, a total of 700 cases were reported which is more than double the number of cases reported in 1987 and more than the total number of cases reported for 1987 and 1988. The figures for 1992 represent an alarming increase of more than 32% from the figures for 1991. The number of harassment cases involving the use of threats and force has also increased, sometimes even inflicting grievous hurt.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 295</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we must act swiftly and decisively in sending a strong message to all illegal moneylenders that such activities will not be tolerated. The Bill seeks to do this by combining substantial increases in the penalties meted out for such activities together with greater powers of investigation and enforcement on the part of the Police.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing legislation does not provide for adequate penalties to deter such illegal activities. The amendments will provide for an increase in the fines imposed on illegal moneylenders from the present maximum of $5,000 to fines of between $10,000 and $100,000 for the first-time individual offenders. In the case of repeat offenders, the fines have been increased to between $20,000 and $200,000 from the present maximum fine of $5,000. In addition, such offenders may also be jailed up to a maximum of 12 months.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For companies, the Bill increases the penalties to fines of between $20,000 and $200,000 from the present maximum of $10,000 regardless of whether the company offender was the first-time offender.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For illegal moneylenders who resort to harassment and intimidation in the course of extracting repayment from debtors, they will be liable to increased penalties of between $2,000 and $20,000 from a maximum fine of $2,000. In addition, such offenders will also be liable to be jailed up to a maximum of 12 months from the present maximum of three months. Companies which resort to such harassment practices will also face increased fines of between $4,000 and $40,000 compared to the present maximum fine of $5,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A significant provision in this Bill is the creation of a new offence to deal with debt collectors, hired by illegal moneylenders, to recover their loans. The present law does not make it an offence for such debt collectors who also resort to harassment
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 296</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> and intimidation in the course of their debt collection activities. Such debt collectors will now face identical penalties to those faced by illegal moneylenders in the Bill. Over and above these penalties, the Bill also introduces a special penalty where the illegal moneylender or debt collector causes hurt in order to recover a debt. For such aggravated offences, the courts can impose caning of up to six strokes in addition to the penalties I have just mentioned.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to facilitate and expedite investigation and prosecution of such offenders, the Bill makes such offences seizable and non-bailable. This will enable the Police and the courts to effectively enforce and give effect to the increased penalties and new offences introduced in this Bill. The Police, therefore, will have powers to arrest, without warrant, anyone suspected of having committed an offence under the Act and to examine any person acquainted with the facts of the case. Bail will also be disallowed in cases where the suspect may be involved in the commission of other offences or where accomplices are at large.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope Members will agree that these amendments are both timely and necessary in order to check the growth of the problems caused by loansharking. We cannot let such activities go unchecked as they would have severe social and law and order consequences on the members of our community.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Bedok GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill. Sir, I could not agree with the Minister more that we must act swiftly and decisively to send the correct message to these parasites of society.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, every MP in this House would have been approached by his residents on this problem of harassment by moneylenders. Often, innocent parties, like the wife and children, are also harassed and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 297</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> threatened. Worse still, in cases of mistaken identity, grievous hurt can be inflicted on the innocent. I thus welcome the proposed enhanced penalties and the extension of these penalties to debt collectors.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would just like to bring another point to the Minister's attention. I am sure the Minister is aware that there is another aggrieved party, that is, the owners or managers of common property, for example, the Town Councils. Often, threatening messages and graffiti are pasted or even sprayed in the void decks, lifts and lift lobbies. It causes a great deal of money to get all these rectified. Should not these vandals also be made to pay for defacing these common properties?
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Mohammed -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Mohammed (Jalan Besar GRC):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I join my colleague in commending the Minister for Home Affairs for taking the initiative to amend the Moneylenders Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a move that has been anxiously awaited and will go a long way towards alleviating the suffering of those who have become victims of loansharking activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from newspaper reports several months ago, as mentioned by the Minister, it appears that the perpetrators of illegal moneylending are having a field day and have inflicted injuries on some of the victims. So it is thus clear that loansharking and thuggery go hand in hand. What I would like to know from the Minister is whether the current situation is now under control and whether the measures taken by the Police have been effective in controlling this problem because we make no apology for taking or ensuring effective laws are legislated to protect hapless victims.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the proposed amendments now make offences under the Moneylenders Act seizable and non-bailable. I am confident that these new provisions will act as an effective deterrent to curb such criminal activities.

  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all, as MPs, know of the problem of loansharks who have harassed our constituents and we have seen them sitting around in the coffeeshops in our constituencies. They have caused a lot of social problems, not only mistaken identity, as has been mentioned by another speaker, but also the breaking up of families. Many divorces are, in fact, caused by harassment of the loansharks. The wife could not take it any more and she said, "I better get away from the husband."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, one of the root causes of moneylending is gambling. Gambling is prevalent in Singapore. What has happened is that many men, who want to get rich quick, indulge in gambling. And gambling seems to be very easily available. What has happened is that he is in debt because of his gambling activities, and he goes to loanshark A. He borrows money from loanshark A, who might charge him interest as high as 20% a month, and soon he will find that he is greatly indebted to loanshark A. He has got no other means of getting money. He has got to go to loanshark B to get money to pay loanshark A. And sometimes it even goes down the line to loanshark C, and he is owing so much money that he is really in great trouble. So it would appear to me that one of the causes of this moneylending problem and all the harassment that goes with it is, in fact, gambling which is prevalent in Singapore. If you really want to solve this moneylending problem, perhaps, we should tackle its root cause.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in answer to Dr Arthur Beng's question, it really boils down to how we draft the legislation. The approach we have taken is to craft the amendments to deal with the specific problems. We could have, of course, taken a broader approach to deal
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 299</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> with damage to common property, and so on, and that will widen the ambit of the legislation. But let me say that it does not follow that where damage is caused to other properties, particularly public property, there is no remedy at all. It would be an offence under the Penal Code or the Vandalism Act and appropriate actions can be taken. But we decided to craft the amendments to deal with the specific problems covered by the Moneylenders Act.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli asked what is the current assessment. Basically, it depends on Parliament and the Police to convey the correct signals to the trouble-makers involved. The passage of this Bill will give unequivocal signal that such acts of hooliganism, thuggishness and gangsterism will not be tolerated. And the Commissioner for Police, I am sure Members have read, has come out very clearly, speaking on behalf of the entire Police Force, that whether it is moneylending, granny-bashing, road bullies, the Police will not tolerate such acts of criminal intimidation. So I think the signal is clear. In fact, the Police have told me that even when the Bill was introduced in Parliament, the fact of its introduction already has a dampening effect on the problems which I have just outlined. So let us hope that the passage of this Bill and the subsequent enforcement will have a further effective deterrent value.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Mr Chiam's point, maybe he is right that gambling is one of the causes. But having spoken to the Director of CID, it is not the only cause. There is a wide variety of reasons why people may resort to illegal moneylenders. He said that men gamble and wives desert. There are also women who gamble and cause family savings to go away. I am not sure it is so simplistic that if we did away with gambling, if it can be done away with at all, we will not have illegal moneylenders. I think the problem will be with us for some time and it is incumbent upon us to craft legislative and enforcement measures to contain the problem.

   <b>COMPUTER MISUSE BILL</b>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By way of introduction, may I say, Sir, that, as we all know, computer technology today has a great impact on the economic life in our country. The technology is used in nearly all sectors of society - public sector, financial and banking community, service industries, manufacturing and trading sectors, and so on - in order to enhance productivity and business competitiveness.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While computers undoubtedly have much beneficial uses, they are also capable of being abused for criminal or selfish objectives. The widespread use of computer technology in Singapore and the growing reliance on it makes us more vulnerable to such abuses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of the Bill, Sir, is to deal with crimes committed with or involving the use of computers, for which existing legislation is inadequate.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me touch on the main features of the Bill. Presently, computer or computer-assisted crimes reported to the Police are dealt with under our general existing laws, eg, as cases of mischief, theft, cheating, criminal breach of trust under the Penal Code. But it is difficult to proceed under these general laws because of the special nature of computer technology. Furthermore, the existing penalties under the general laws do not always sufficiently deter computer criminals, eg, mischief under section 426 of the Penal Code only carries a maximum jail sentence of three months or a fine. The
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 301</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> Penal Code, enacted many years ago, is also inadequate in dealing with the misuse of computers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, therefore, incorporates those offences which are unique to computer technology. Let me say that the Bill is modelled largely after the United Kingdom Computer Misuse Act, 1990. It creates four new offences.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with the first offence. The first offence deals with unauthorised access. Under clause 3 of the Bill, anyone who knowingly causes a computer to perform any function for the purpose of securing access without authority to any computer program or data will be guilty of an offence. This provision against unauthorised access deals with what is commonly referred to as "hacking". Persons who knowingly "hack" into computer systems even without malicious intent can be prosecuted under this provision.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second offence deals with unauthorised modification. This is because computer technology allows the relatively easy modification of computer programs or data. Under clause 5, it will be an offence for any person to do any act which he knows will cause an unauthorised modification of the contents of any computer. This will cover introduction of viruses into a computer system. "Unauthorised modification" has been widely defined in clause 2 to include the addition of any program or data into the contents of a computer.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third offence deals with unauthorised use or interception of computer service. Under clause 6 of the Bill, it will be an offence for anyone to knowingly use or intercept without authority computer service, ie, computer time, data processing, storage or retrieval of data. Not only can computer service be expensive, but it can also contain sensitive and confidential information such as financial information and business particulars. Unauthorised use or interception of computer service is made illegal, for example, where such information is
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 302</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> retrieved or used without the knowledge or approval of the owner of the computer system. Any person using or causing to be used the computer or any other device for the purpose of unauthorised use or interception of computer service will also be committing an offence under this clause.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties for these three computer offences are identical. The offender would be liable to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both. If the offender causes any damage by the offences exceeding $10,000, the offender will be liable to a fine not exceeding $20,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The punishment for these three offences has been carefully considered. Where no damage is caused or the damage caused by the commission of these offences is minimal, the offence would attract a lesser penalty. In other cases where the damage caused to the computer system or data is substantial, that is, above $10,000, the offence will attract a heavier penalty. This two-tier approach, it is hoped, will deter would-be offenders from doing anything which could be potentially capable of causing damage to computer systems and data such as planting viruses, logic bombs and wiping out software and data. It is essential that computer systems, which play an essential and vital role in this age of modern society in Singapore, be protected. However, if there are extenuating and mitigating circumstances, the Court can still exercise its discretion to impose a lesser penalty. That may address the concerns that a person who unwittingly causes extensive damage may be subject to the higher penalty.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth new offence deals with computer-assisted-crime where a computer is used to commit further offences. Under clause 4 of the Bill, it will be an offence for anyone to cause a computer to perform any function for the purpose of securing access without authority to a computer program or data
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 303</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> with the intention of committing offences involving property, fraud, dishonesty or which causes bodily harm punishable upon conviction with imprisonment for a term of two years or more. As the potential offered by computer technology is exploited to facilitate or commit further offences, the penalty for this offence is even more severe than the other three offences. Upon conviction, the offender is liable to a fine not exceeding $50,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to both.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may turn to enforcement and proof. To ensure effective enforcement, all offences under the Bill will be made seizable. A police officer may arrest without warrant any person reasonably suspected of having committed one of these offences. There is no need for a specific provision under the Bill to empower the Police to confiscate the equipment of a suspect as these powers already exist in the Criminal Procedure Code.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 14 empowers a police officer (in addition to the powers under the Criminal Procedure Code) in connection with the investigation of offences, first, to have access to, inspect and check the operations of any computer and any associated apparatus or material; and, secondly, to require the user, or any person having the charge, of the computer to provide him with reasonable assistance in the investigation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the intangible nature of computer transactions, Members will understand that proof of computer offences will not be easy to establish. For this reason, clauses 11, 12 and 13 of the Bill contain special provisions for computer output to be admissible in Court for prosecution under the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarise, Sir, this Bill allows the authorities and the Court to deal effectively with that small minority of persons who perpetrate computer and computer-assisted crime. It will send a deterrent
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 304</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> signal to all those who intend to misuse or exploit computer technology with criminal intent. At the same time, it is my hope that the Bill will have a reassuring effect to the majority of persons and organisations for whom the computer has become indispensable in their lives and business activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is committed to the use of information technology to assist us in our economic development and to improve our quality of life. Today, the computer is an essential part of the office equipment and management of many a business both large and small. The smooth running and success of business may depend on the data that is captured in these computers. For example, a breakdown of the computers is a major disaster for financial and trading houses, many Government agencies and even small businesses.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, using a computer is like using the TV set or driving a car. Many of us know how to use the TV set or drive a car, but few of us understand the complicated circuitry of the TV set or the special features of a car engine. If something should go wrong, we depend on the technicians, mechanics or engineers to advise us. In the case of the computer industry, we depend on the data entry clerks, programmers, systems analysts, hardware and software support teams and the electronic engineers. Likewise, the person who uses the computer for very intricate procedures, from the managing director to the clerical assistant, thanks to technology which has made the computer so user-friendly, does not need to know the intricacies of the inside of the computer box.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes for successful computerisation? It begins with good advice from the professionals to select the correct hardware and software for the purpose (what the industry calls the "solution" to
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 305</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the needs of the customer) and the daily operation of relying on dependable staff to key in and update the correct data. As the industry saying goes: "garbage in, garbage out". Thus, all the persons involved, from the initial stage of design to data entry and users, play a critical role.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Computer Board (NCB) has played a very important role as a catalyst and master planner for the use of IT in Singapore. Its master plan - the IT 2000 Master Plan - will touch and improve the quality of life of every Singaporean. We should congratulate the NCB, the EDB and all its partners in this ambitious plan. However, as critical data will be stored, both for business and for individuals, it is timely that this Bill is introduced to provide protection in the following areas: (a) to have unauthorised access to a system; (b) to modify computer material without proper authorization; (c) to intercept computer service without authority, and (d) to abet these acts.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, any person who has access to the computer - and he does not have to be a systems analyst - actually has access to data which, if used as it was planned for, will be positive. But he can also tap the information for ill-intentions, eg, crime, personal embarrassment, or business sabotage. For example, the data entry clerk or programmer can sell the list of the names and addresses of a financial institution to a direct mailing company. This would result in voluminous junk mail for all of us. Worse still, a disgruntled employee or business competitor may be tempted to alter or erase programs or data, or make copies of the data. If this happens, for example, to a trading house or financial institution, just imagine the damage or havoc that can be caused. Thankfully, the industry can build in safeguards, for example, security levels into a system, but the integrity of the persons who have access to the computer terminal is the only and final safeguard to the system. I thus welcome the provisions of this Bill and congratulate the Minister on its timeliness and thoroughness. This will
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 306</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> provide all users the necessary infrastructural confidence to go IT, and protect the individual Singaporean whose very personal data will sometimes be stored in the system. More professionals, businesses and Government agencies will then turn to IT to make their operations more efficient.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, deterrence is a very important part of the safeguard. In the case of these crimes, each and everyone of them must be premeditated or may even be master-minded by a professional. I am satisfied with most of the punishments prescribed in Part II, and I accept the explanation of the Minister regarding the two-tier approach to punishment. However, I would like to seek the Minister's clarification on Part II, clauses 3(1) and 5(1). Clause 3(1) deals with "securing access without authority". This is the first step to any mischievous or criminal intentions. Clause 5(1) deals with "unauthorised modification of the contents" -the first step towards what one calls in layman's terms "sabotage of a system". These are serious offences, and potentially can be very damaging. Although the Bill allows for judicial discretion in allowing a jail sentence not exceeding two years (which recognises the potential seriousness of these offences), I believe that the fine prescribed (not exceeding $2,000) is inadequate. To be an effective deterrent to the first step of worse things to come, this fine should be $5,000 or even $10,000. I hope that the Minister will reconsider this and, with experience of this Bill, perhaps this could be revised at a later stage.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to close by asking the Minister if there are plans to form a self-regulatory body for the computer or IT industry, like we have for other professionals, eg, lawyers, accountants, doctors and engineers. As we invest and depend more on IT, and as IT will affect the life of every Singaporean, having such a body will help ensure high standards of practice and a high ethical code to enhance the status of IT professionals and protect the customer or individual. Thus, just as one can make a complaint to the Law Society
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 307</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> or Medical Council, one has recourse to complain to a similar body in the IT industry, for example, an IT Council. This IT Council can also set standards, for example, it can make audit trails a compulsory feature of computer systems. The National Computer Board could be the body to spearhead this. However, as with the Law Society or Medical Council, to be effective, they must be given statutory powers by this House to deal with complaints, set up disciplinary committees, and ultimately to de-register the unethical or recalcitrant.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge to the IT industry is indeed great. But I have great confidence that they will be able to meet this.

  <!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah GRC):</b> Sir, I support the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, there were a number of cases of computer misuse in the United Kingdom. They are being highlighted in the press, although, interestingly enough, all of them are not criminally motivated. Nevertheless, the damages caused were quite considerable. Take, for example, one case, as reported in the Straits Times dated 9th May 1993, where a school boy was acquitted for breaking into a computer around the world and caused havoc. The other case reported in the Sunday Times dated 23rd May 1993 was where two British computer hackers hacked into thousands of computers around the world causing an estimated o123,000 in chaos. Astonishingly, the school boy was acquitted, giving the reason that he was a "compulsive" hacker, while the other two offenders were subsequently jailed for six months - a very light sentence for such a serious offence. It is apparent that these hackers do not realise the seriousness of their actions nor does the court consider hacking a serious enough offence to deserve more severe punishment. This is a dangerous trend and we must arrest it immediately.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 308</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me demonstrate a scenario whereby these hackers were to be made used of by master criminals or crime syndicates. The result can be very disastrous and costly or, worse still, if these hackers were to be forced to break into our defence system by some unfriendly nations, then our whole nation's security would be at risk. Therefore, although these hackers may not have any criminal intent for their actions, nevertheless, they should be made aware of the seriousness of their actions and be punished in accordance with the magnitude of their crime to prevent them ever attempting to engage in these activities.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to comment on Part II of the Bill under "Offences". I notice that the punishment is being fixed according to the value of the damage done. However, in computer offences, sometimes the damage cannot be measured in pure monetary terms. Take, for example, if someone disrupts the nation's defence system or by simply introducing computer virus into the computer system, the actual value of damage might be difficult to ascertain. Or, in the case of these two British computer hackers, the damage to the computer hardware may only be over o120,000, but the hidden potential of damage can be much more than that.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine hacking into the computer system of the US Space Agency (NASA), the British Foreign Office or the European Cancer Research Organisation. The consequence can be quite mind-boggling. In cases like these, perhaps the punishment specified in the Bill under Part II may not be sufficient to reflect the seriousness of their action or the crime, and the limit set would constrain the court in imposing the appropriate sentence.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can enlighten us on this.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Ho Tat Kin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Ho Tat Kin (Toa Payoh GRC):</b> Sir, I support this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the strong Government's drive for computerisation, more and more organisations in Singapore are storing their
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 309</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> information in computer systems. According to the latest National Computer Board's survey, the percentage of firms, with more than 10 employees, which are computerised hit a new high of 84% in 1992, compared to 68% in 1989. The NCB expects the level of computerisation to reach 95% by the end of this decade when the Singapore IT 2000 Plan is fully implemented and Singapore becomes an "intelligent" island.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not only are more companies using computers, but more computers are also being used. There is now one personal computer or computer terminal for every 3.8 employees, compared to one for every five in 1989. With so widespread use of computers and so much information stored in computerised database, the information assets need to be protected from computer-related abuse. But current laws, as the Minister says, are still inadequate to specifically deal with computer-related crimes.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last few years, we saw a new twist to computer abuse - the computer virus. Businesses today market globally. There is international electronic mail which allows anyone to send and receive orders by electronic data interchange (or EDI) within minutes. With world business moving to instant global communications controlled by computers, computer viruses have become more than the letter bomb of the late eighties. They are in fact a global threat. Computer virus attacks are not limited to individual personal computers or personal computer networks. Larger networks are also vulnerable. Mainframe users in Europe and in the United States have reported a considerable increase in the frequency of virus attacks. Research carried out in the United States indicated that of the 35.5% of mainframe sites in 1992 that had reported disasters, 60% had been caused by virus. This compares with 44% in 1991 and 23% in 1990.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill before this House today will allow computer virus offenders to be prosecuted. The Bill also seeks to give legal redress and compensation to victims of virus attacks.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 310</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both developed nations and developing nations are tightening their Acts on computer abuse. The United States Department of Justice had recently circulated a proposal to expand the reach of the 1984 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. This will give Federal agents broad authority to investigate computer crimes, allowing them to intercede in any situation involving a computer linked to a network. Creating a computer worm or virus could become a felony act with no questions asked.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over in Britain, in spite of the presence of the Computer Misuse Act 1990, the UK Public Accounts Committee noted that security problems occurred in the main areas of fraud and virus and had called for tougher measures to ensure the security of Government information systems.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the US congressional testimony had also shown that Dutch teenage hackers were responsible for breaking into US military systems during the Gulf War. Yet the lack of legislation in the Netherlands means that they cannot be prosecuted for hacking. As a result, the Dutch Parliament is currently working on legislation to forbid unauthorised entry to computers.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, developing nations in Africa, notably Egypt, Ghana, Tanzania, are taking concrete steps to secure the computer systems by implementing similar computer crime legislations. The Bill is therefore appropriate and timely. I support this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, going into the Bill itself, I would like to seek some clarifications from the Minister. Under clause 3, subclause (2), there is no mention of the definition or the computation of "damage". People in the computer industry are asking: how will the damage be measured? Is it the cost of re-constructing data files destroyed? Or is it the market value of files that were destroyed?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, regarding clause 7(1), I would assume the Bill considers acts such as trading in passwords as preparatory acts. But there are many computer security
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 311</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> literatures which openly discussed methods of password breaking. Some even disclosed actual codes of breaking into computer systems. Will such literatures be considered undesirable once the Bill is passed? Will the sale of such technical literatures be controlled?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many people in the computer community are concerned with clause 15 of the Bill which allows any police officer to arrest without warrant any person reasonably suspected of committing an offence under the Act. Their concern is that the introduction of this Bill may lead to Police misuse of power. The concern here is whether police officers, any police officer, would have the knowledge or expertise to notice a computer crime being committed. Even in the United States, not many of the local police agencies are adequately prepared to investigate instances of computer crime, especially where they are of a trans-border nature. With the exception of the FBI and the US Secret Service, only a handful of other local US police agencies have the requisite training and resources to investigate instances of computer crime.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent report dealing with computer misuse, prepared for the UK Department of Trade and Industry, it was reported that the lack of awareness of the Computer Misuse Act and difficulties in identifying reliable expert advice are the major barriers for firms seeking to bring cases forward. The question I would like to ask is: how well prepared are our police officers in carrying out this aspect of their duty?
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer virus is a very technical subject which even computer users themselves are not quite clear. I would suggest the Police set up a Special Task Force to enforce this law.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, how will this Bill deal with offenders who are minors? Many hackers today are in their teens. They may lack the
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 312</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> maturity and experience to fully appreciate the consequences of their action or the reasons why people are concerned about protecting information. For many, it could be just testing their own skills to see how good they are in breaking into systems, more for the thrill rather than do damage.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Wang Kai Yuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Wang Kai Yuen (Bukit Timah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister has said in his introduction, computers and network systems, be they banking system, import/export system, EDI network, stock exchange, CDS system, have become an essential and important part of our industry and commerce. Any misuse or breach of security could cause major disruption to our life.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately in Singapore, such occurrences are rare but nonetheless they do exist. Often times, under our existing laws, companies would rather swallow their pride than prosecute the offenders, and keep silent about it. I am very glad to note that the Minister has introduced this Bill to make all these acts criminal offences prosecutable under the new law. Most of the computer professionals I consulted have supported this Bill. The consensus is that it addresses a real need and it is timely. However, like my colleague who has spoken, some of us feel that the punishment
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 313</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> prescribed is on the low side, basically $2,000 or two years' imprisonment or both if the damage caused does not exceed $10,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like my colleague who has spoken, I feel that the damages normally caused in computer crimes are difficult to identify and track, and the cases are difficult to prosecute. Once identified, the damages are also very difficult to rectify. Furthermore, individuals who intentionally break into a computer system, especially Government computer system, for malicious mischief are no different from vandals, albeit these are the white-collar kind. What is worse, of course, is that the damages would take a long time to rectify. So I believe that the punishment prescribed for such cases should be no lower than those prescribed for vandalism under the Vandalism Act (Chapter 341). For people convicted for vandalism, it prescribes a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years and shall also, subject to section 231 of the Criminal Procedure Code, be punished with caning of no less than three strokes and no more than eight strokes. I feel perhaps that the Minister can also, in his reply, indicate whether he supports my view and whether this view can be interpreted under the new Interpretation Act to be brought up in the case when they are prosecuted.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho has also asked how this Bill deals with a perpetrator who is a minor, because most popular literatures portray the computer hacker as a minor out for fun and adventure. I think the current law should also address this issue.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Dr Toh Keng Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Toh Keng Kiat (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of this Bill.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By its enactment, Singapore will join a growing number of countries which have similar laws which will bring into focus computer-related crimes. High technology offences have come about as a result of coupling the computer to the telephone through the use of the modem, resulting in rapid electronic transfer of data. As the Minister says, computer crimes in Singapore are still extremely low, but it is timely that we should have in place a law for us to deal with perpetrators of this type of criminal offences and to use it as a deterrent against would-be offences. Such an act will also bring Singapore within the league of nations, which have similar legislation, which are now engaged in establishing extradition as well as mutual assistance programmes. Computer abuse criminal activity is international and cross-territorial. A misdemeanour initiated in a far away country would have devastating results here and vice versa. And because of its cosmopolitan nature, the fight against these crimes also requires international cooperation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 314</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a speaker before me has already referred to reports of computer criminals who have escaped prosecution. The same British schoolboy he spoke about managed to hack the computer systems of the British Ministry of Defence and the US military establishments in Britain. Again in Straits Times of 14th May 1993, an Australian student was reported to have successfully hacked the NASA computers in the US causing a 24-hour stoppage. He not only decoded highly sensitive and secret computer files but passed on the technical know-how to other computer buffs. That is how the "technorat", or hacker, operates.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Beng has spoken of the increasing wave of computer crimes being part of an international network. But when it comes to hacking, the scenario is different. A study of the computer hacker's profile reveals an identical thread that runs through all of them. The typical hacker is a middle-class teenaged student, very often highly intelligent but introverted, and with an intense need to boost his self-esteem.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the bounds of the territory known as cyberspace, within which these hackers work, they communicate with each other, although they have never met, for several hours of the day. And when the breakthrough comes, it is the paragon of achievement for the hacker.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, our Computer Misuse Bill provides for custodial and pecuniary punishment of computer criminals and hackers but I doubt that when the audit trail of a computer misdeed, particularly one that deals with security matters, leads to such a teenaged hacker, we will be prepared to surrender him to a foreign country for prosecution, extradition and mutual assistance arrangements notwithstanding. Vice versa, I doubt that a foreign country will also readily give up one of its citizens for trial here for a similar offence. Computer skill of this quality is often tacitly condoned as invaluable in fifth column activity as well as industrial espionage. But things are changing, for in the Sunday Times of 23rd May 1993, we
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 315</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> read of a report of two British hackers being prosecuted for a computer crime for the first time under the British Computer Misuse Act of 1990.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several speakers have drawn our attention to deficiencies in this Bill. I agree with them. Clause 2(4) of the Bill states that the form in which any program or data is output is immaterial. There is also a provision that there should be an intent to commit further offences as indicated in clause 4(1). The British Computer Misuse Act 1990, with which we share many similar clauses, appears to be more defined in these areas. It makes it an offence to access computers "even though the facts are such that the commission of further offences is impossible." Again, the interpretation in our Bill on stealing of computer information is that the act of stealing itself becomes an offence. Sir, to steal means to take illegal possession of something which belongs to another person and, in the process, deprives the original owner of its use. Today, all of us are inundated with junk mail, the result of all kinds of mailing lists being compiled from computer databanks. No doubt, some of these are the result of illegal access to computer storage data but their mere compilation and use has not, in many instances, led to any loss for the original possessor of that information. Does this constitute stealing? The law needs to be more clear-cut on this.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also some ambiguity in clause 5(2) where a fine of $20,000 is imposed for damages to computers beyond $10,000. Without the damage being defined. The British Computer Misuse Act 1990 is again more definite in this area as it relies on the British Criminal Damage Act 1971 where a modification of a computer program is not regarded as doing damage to the computer or the computer storage medium unless its effect on that computer or the storage medium impairs its physical condition.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, computer crimes in Singapore, as I have said earlier, are fortunately few and
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 316</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> far between. I have asked the Minister for Law and Minister for Home Affairs in a previous sitting of the House and he has replied that there have only been four cases prosecuted from 1988 to 1992. All the offenders were prosecuted under the Penal Code and none under the Official Secrets Act. All cases have involved financial corporations with a total amount, in terms of money lost, of only $985,000.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the paucity here, the Government has wisely put in place legislation to deal with this advancing tide of high technology crime. With this Bill, we now join a long list of countries, Australia, Germany, France, Canada, United States, Switzerland, Netherlands, Iceland and the UK which all have computer crime legislation.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the Members who have spoken. Quite a number of Members have commented on the provisions with regard to penalties. It would appear that most of them are more hawkish than me in this regard. But I would like them and, in particular, Dr Wang Kai Yuen who, at one end of the spectrum, wants the penalties under the Vandalism Act, including mandatory caning, to be imposed, and that also, through the process of interpretation, the courts will listen to what I say here and then they will say, "Well, the punishment must be caning." Of course, that cannot be done. I would like them to note that when crafting penalties in the Bill, we have got to bear in mind that, firstly, a certain amount of jurisdiction and discretion must be given to our courts. Secondly, we must bear in mind the circumstances which will present themselves to the courts in various cases will differ vastly, eg, age of the accused, cited by Dr Ho Tat Kin, whether there are mitigating circumstances, the entire context in which the offence took place, the motives, the intentions, the damage caused, and so on and so forth. And because the circumstances can be so varied, it is not desirable to straitjacket
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 317</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> the Bill with a narrow or very heavy penalty and leave very little room for the courts to exercise jurisdiction, particularly in an area where we are charting a new territory in Singapore.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, in fact, very few computer crimes prosecuted so far, as Dr Toh has mentioned. I think it is safe to say that there may be more which will come over the years ahead. But we should not assume that the types of cases will be so clear-cut and so stereotype that we can have a fixed penalty of a narrow nature or of a very heavy nature which does not allow the courts to have some discretion.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, in any case, I wish to point out to them that if you look at the penalties, do not just focus on the $2,000 fine because it may be possible for an accused person to pay up the fine. But there is a discretion vested in the courts to also inflict the penalty of a jail sentence which, I think, for any accused person, is very important, or a combination of both fine and jail. And there is a two-tier approach which has been taken in several other countries, for example, Switzerland and Australia, depending on the damage. So the penalties are not that light if you look at them in the way I have suggested.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have commented quite correctly that computer crimes can result in invisible, intangible damage which cannot be quantified. That is true. But in so far as crafting offences is concerned, the courts will have to require proof and evidence to be adduced. And what is more easy and practical a measure is to have damage, which of course must mean physical damage. This is not to say that the victim of a computer crime who has suffered other kinds of damage, eg, loss of earning, loss of income, and so on, has no other remedy. He will still have remedies in civil law to bring about suit for damages in terms of earnings lost, income gone, and so on. So while I note the general sentiment for tougher penalties, there are these points which I would like them to note.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 318</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Arthur Beng also asked if there should not be a self-regulatory body for information technology. Actually, that is quite outside the scope of this Bill and I would not like to speak on behalf of the other Ministers who are in charge of the computer industry as a whole, like the Minister for Trade and Industry. I am sure he will take note of the comments. I would like to point out that it is not a single discipline kind of industry and, unlike doctors and lawyers, I do not think one needs to have a licence or professional registered qualification in order to write a computer program or to engage in a computer software business. But, nevertheless, I am sure my colleagues in the other Ministries will take note of the comments that he has made.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Ho Tat Kin asked if the sale of passwords, for example, will be considered as a preparatory act. I think it very much depends on the nature of the case. In some cases, it could very well be that the Police can make a case out that, in that particular set of circumstances, the sale of the passwords is an essential prior step to the commission of an offence, in which case, I have no doubt that the Police will treat it so and bring about a prosecution.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked about the capability of the Police to enforce this Act, bearing in mind the complexities of the problem and the need for expertise. Let me say that the legislation will actually be enforced by the Commercial Crime Division (CCD) of the CID Department, which is a rather specialised investigative body. The CCD has investigators who are computer-literate and several of them are graduates who have completed university courses in programming and have computer-based information or systems knowledge. Several of them have been trained locally and overseas and particularly for the purpose of conducting computer crime investigations. I take his point that computer technology is complex and fast changing. Therefore, I have encouraged the CCD to adopt an approach of working with external computer experts depending on the nature of the case. I want to assure
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 319</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> him that the CCD will have adequate qualified manpower resources to conduct computer crime investigations in the foreseeable future. Some foreign police forces, for example, the Scotland Yard in England, have created specialist units in their organisation to enforce such legislation. I am not sure whether it is necessary for us to do that at this stage because the volume of cases may not justify the establishment of such an unit. For the time being, I think the approach of having this specialised unit in the CCD is sufficient.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for minors, there are no special provisions here. Obviously, this will be one of the factors to be taken into account by the court in the imposition of the sentence which, incidentally, is another answer why you need to have a range of penalties as set out in the Bill. But I do not think that it is the intention of this Parliament that minors and teenagers should get away scot-free. As was pointed out, they can cause considerable damage and inconvenience as has happened in other countries. So they are obviously within the ambit of these provisions.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Toh Keng Kiat has made some specific points about the detailed drafting of the provisions. I do not think I can give chapter and verse here as to why on a particular provision we departed from the exact wording of the United Kingdom legislation. But in answer to him, let me say that when drafting this Bill it went through several stages. First, the Commercial Crime Division worked on it, then the Attorney-General's Chambers, and before final casting it was carefully studied by an expert committee known as the Law Reforms Sub-Committee of the Academy of Law, headed by the Dean of the Law Faculty. They not only looked at the United Kingdom legislation but also
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 320</b></font>
  <br>
  <br> other legislation. When they looked at the legislation, they also looked at critiques of the other legislation and whatever experiences have taken place in that overseas country in the enforcement and implementation of their law. So I may not be able to give a specific answer to his detailed query, but to say that careful consideration has been given. In other words, it has not been blind copying or adoption of the foreign provisions. We have to amalgamate and take what we consider were the best provisions. We will have to see, in the light of experience, how these provisions work. I am sure that as the years go by we may need to fine-tune or improve these provisions. We are really creating here a novel legislation. We have to learn from the experiences of other countries. We hope that what we have put to Parliament is adequate. But if it is not adequate, we shall not hesitate to refine and modify the legislation in the light of experience, as other countries have done.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole House.

  <!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Upgrading Programme involves a large number of flats. The Programme has to be implemented in stages and spaced out over a number of years. A number of factors are taken into account in selecting precincts for upgrading. In addition to the age of the flats, factors such as geographical spread, condition of the environment and whether blocks can be grouped to form a contiguous precinct, are also taken into account in selecting precincts for upgrading.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first 2 batches of precincts to be upgraded under the steady state phase have already been announced. MND is currently identifying the next few batches of precincts for upgrading. It is not possible to indicate at this stage when Blocks 22 to 26, Sin Ming Road will be scheduled for upgrading.

  <!-- Mr Tong Kok Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
  <b>Mr Tong Kok Yeo</b> asked the Minister for Community Development whether he will consider introducing legislation to amend the Co-operative Societies Act to provide for better control and accountability of the utilisation of funds.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: The Member has stated: "In asking this question, I wish to declare my interest as the Secretary of the UTES Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society Ltd."
  <br>
  <br>
  <!-- Mr Yeo Cheow Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <b>Mr Yeo Cheow Tong:</b>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Co-operative Societies Act was last amended in 1990. It has adequate provisions for the control of co-operative societies and the safeguarding of the interest of their members.
  <br>
  <br>
  <font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accounts of every co-operative society are required to be audited annually by an auditor authorised by the Registrar of Co-operative Societies. The auditor is required to report any irregularity disclosed by his audit. In addition the Act provides for the Registrar to inspect the books of co-operative societies whenever necessary. Where malpractices are detected, the Registrar is empowered, among other things, to suspend the society's activities, freeze its funds, remove its management committee and take appropriate action against its officials.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure accountability for utilisation of funds, the Act requires members of management committees to exercise due prudence and diligence in their decisions. Failure to do so renders members of the management committee jointly and severally liable for any loss sustained.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1980, the Registrar has had no occasion to take action involving mismanagement or misappropriation of the funds of co-operative societies.
  <br>
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need at present to amend the Act for better control and accountability of funds. However, my Ministry will continue to monitor the affairs of co-operative societies and review the legislation should the need arise.
