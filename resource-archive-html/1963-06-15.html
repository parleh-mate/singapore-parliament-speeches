<div align="center"><b>APPROPRIATION BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second and Third Readings read.



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I have the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

recommendation that this Bill be proceeded with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Main Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure for

the year 1963 have been considered and approved  by

the Assembly as Command Paper 14 of 1963. It is now

necessary  to  give  legislative  approval  to  the

expenditure  of the sums shown in these  Estimates,

and  the  Appropriation Bill tow before Members  is

intended so to provide. Under section 97 (1) of the

Singapore (Constitution) Order in Council, 1958, an

Appropriation  Bill containing,  under  appropriate

heads  of  expenditure, sums  of  money  which  are

required for the several services of the Government

shall be introduced to the Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Appropriation Bill sets out all the amounts

approved  by  the  Assembly  in  the  Estimates  of

Expenditure  and  arranged  under  the   heads   of

expenditure  shown on pares 35 and  36  of  Command

Paper  14 of 1963. Once the Appropriation Bill  has

been   approved,  I  will  be  empowered  to  issue

warrants  authorising expenditure up to the  amount

under  each  head in the Appropriation Bill  to  be

paid out of the Consolidated Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee (Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

during the course of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1314</b></font><br><br>



debate  on  the  Budget Estimates, some  surprising

facts  and  statements of principle have come  out.

Yesterday  the  Minister for Culture  claimed  that

once  the  People's Action Party was  elected,  its

policy  became  national policy and  therefore  the

Party  in  power could spend money as it liked  for

propaganda  purposes  using  government  machinery.

Sir,I  think  that concept of  democracy  is  not

really  parliamentary  democracy  but  totalitarian

democracy.  Let mc explain, Sir. They were  elected

on the basis of 54 per cent of the votes. They have

the  right, as the majority Party in control of the

Government,  to  pass  on  their  views   for   the

acceptance  and obedience of the people.  But  they

have  no right to say that they therefore claim  to

represent  100 per cent of the people. If  that  is

the  policy  accepted by the nation, in that  case,

there  would have to be a national coalition.  Then

only you could say that those are the views of  the

nation and then you could implement it on behalf of

the nation. But when it is only a majority Party in

control,  they can say they are doing it on  behalf

of  the  nation and on behalf of the  people  as  a

majority Party. But they cannot on that basis

over-ride  the rights of the Opposition, because if they

do,  then,  I  think, the concept has been  wrongly

described  as  parliamentary democracy.  It  should

really be described as a totalitarian democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it was for this reason that we said the

Government machinery for propaganda like television

and  radio should be used in such a way that  there

could  be a division. People could say, well,  this

is  being  done  by  the Party  in  power  for  the

Government.  That is all right. But when  they  are

doing  it  in the interests of the Party  preparing

for an election, the people are not deceived. There

has  been  confusion here. When I asked  the  Prime

Minister  whether he was going round as  the  Prime

Minister  or the Secretary-General of the  People's

Action  Party, he said that he considered it  right

to  use the opportunity to attack another political

Party.  Sir,I  think that principle  is  not  the

principle  that  could be applied to  parliamentary

democracy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1315</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that came out is this. We are not

defending the rights of the United People's  Party.

But  we  have  heard in this Chamber  the  possible

cancellation  of the symbol of the United  People's

Party ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. We are now on the

Appropriation Bill and Standing Order 88, paragraph

(2) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`the debate., shall be confined to the general

principles  of Government policy and administration

as indicated in the Bill.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, of course, means as indicated in the

contents  of the Bill, which, in fact, repeats  the

contents  of the Estimates. It must be  on  general

lines and not on particular lines.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Sir, I am talking in reference

to  the item in the Estimates involving expenditure

for elections, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the debate, Sir, the principle

was  interpreted  in  such a way  that  we  on  the

Opposition side feel that it would be wrong for the

Government  to get the vote, to get an election  on

the  basis  of fair play to be done in such  a  way

that  a  symbol that has been recognised all  these

months is in danger of being cancelled.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is a matter of detail

which has been and should have been debated and was

debated in the Estimates. It is a matter of detail.

Let us go on general principles.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> The other point is this. We are

voting  money for the Government to spend  for  the

remaining half of the year. We hope this  will  not

be  their  aim:  of increasing the surplus  in  the

Government Treasury at the end of the year. We hope

that  is  quite clear and that the Government  will

make sure that the money will be spent, because  if

at  the  end  of the year again they report  a  big

surplus,  then  we  think  there  has  been

under-expenditure at the expense of the people's  welfare

or  that too much money has been extracted from the

people  which would mean that there should be  more

relief  or  that there should have been more  money

spent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, Sir, in the Education Ministry, time

and again the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1316</b></font><br><br>



has said that he could not do this or do that

because there was no money in the Treasury and ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> I

never said that.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> --- there must be strict

economy;  a deficit was being faced. The result  is

that  the schools are understaffed, whereas if they

could   spend  more  money  there  would  be   more

employment.  Therefore, Sir, we trust that  knowing

there  are  big reserves, the Government would  use

the chance to engage more teachers and provide more

employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, money is an important weapon and the Party in

power  during  election time has an  advantage.  We

only  hope  that the money will be used fairly  for

the  people without unfairness to the other Parties

during and before an election.



<br><br>2.41 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the 1963 Budget is a part of the Four-Year Plan and

dove-tails  into  the P.A.P.'s  Four-Year  Economic

Plan  for the betterment of Singapore. But when  we

come  to the Appropriation Bill today, we are being

asked to vote for a further supply of $373 million.

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, there is little  doubt  in  the

minds  of the people that the P.A.P. Government  is

making full use of public funds for party purposes.

By  denying  it,  the Government has  made  matters

worse  by creating more doubts in the minds of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister believes that by propaganda alone his Government can deceive us. No, Sir. There must be something

to "propaganda" about, and  for

that,  the  Government  has  little  to  advertise.

Making  empty Press statements, hurling abuses  and

cynical  remarks  at Opposition Members  could  not

help the P.A.P. very much. Last-minute dressings by

any   government  could  not  help  to  save   that

government  from collapse. It is now  widely  known

that  elections  are coming as  prophesied  by  our

Party  organ, Bersatu, more than two weeks ago.  If

the Singapore Government can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1317</b></font><br><br>



have its way, elections may be held in July, anyhow

before 31st August, 1963. After that date elections

to  the  Federal States will come under the control

of  the Federation Elections Commission. Sir,

last-minute  dressings as what the P.A.P. Government  is

doing  now in its rural visits, its so-called rural

development programme, are nothing but  to  capture

the  votes in exactly the same way as the  Lim  Yew

Hock  Government  did during  its  last  months  of

office. The people cannot be deceived by all  these

electioneering  stunts.  The  people  now  do   not

believe  what the P.A.P. Government says. See  what

happens to the Four-Year Plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope you will pardon me if I

dwell  a little bit more in detail on the Four-Year

Plan. Because the Four-Year Plan is the most ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the hon. Member goes into

detail  into this Four-Year Development Plan,  then

he  will be in danger of going out of order because

we  are not dealing with the Development Estimates.

We  are  dealing  now  with the Appropriation  Bill

which  takes  in the Ordinary Estimates  for  1963.

There  is  nothing to prevent him, of course,  from

just touching on the Development Plan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, I will only

dwell on the Four-Year Plan as it affects the  1963

Budget. You see. Sir, the 1963 Budget is only  part

and  parcel  of the Four-Year Plan.  And  unless  I

gloss over it, I will not go into cents. I will  go

into  tens  of  millions of dollars of  development

projects. Unless I touch on the Development Plan, I

am  unable  to explain or to give my views  on  the

Appropriation Bill today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Four-Year Plan is the most important document

ever  prepared and submitted by the P.A.P. to  the

Assembly and to the people. The people knew it  was

a   bluff.  But  that  is  another  matter.  Having

promised  the  people, it is its  bounden  duty  to

carry out its election promise. The Four-Year  Plan

promises  us  a  radical  transformation   in   our

economy, a new life to the people, a ray of hope to

many of the unemployed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1318</b></font><br><br>



The  Government said that it is an attainable plan.

Then  why  was the Four-Year Plan not accomplished?

What went wrong? Where are the scapegoats?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I will just dwell on the few

important  projects of the Four-Year Plan.  When  I

pass  through it, I am basing it on things which  I

know,  as  I  could  not get any  information  from

elsewhere.  In other countries when the  Government

has  a  plan,  what  it does is to  submit  regular

progress  reports  to  the  people  on  details  of

targets under-fulfilled and over-fulfilled. That is

what  I  was doing when I was in the City  Council.

The P.A.P. Four-Year Plan gives us a new vision  of

a   new  Singapore,  albeit  it  was  a  false  and

deceptive vision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$871 million was to be used to achieve the target.

By  the  end of 1963 $650 million should have  been

spent. Mr Speaker, Sir, I will only comment on the

major  item  of  the plan. We can  knock  out  $270

million earmarked for 1964 because it will  not  be

spent,   for  two  reasons.  Firstly,  the   P.A.P.

Government, even if it wants to, cannot  last  till

1964.  One  obvious reason is that more chaps  will

follow   the   example   of  the   ex-Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Culture, and more  so

after  31st  August  when the P.A.P. has  no  more

control of the Special Branch and the C.I.D. Again,

once Malaysia is pushed through, the PAP, which  is

neither  Left nor Right but capable of placing  the

Communists  and  the British at the same  time - and,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,I was told an  iguana  has  two

tongues - will  be scratched out from  the  political

arena despite their great ambition of a free middle

school  education system which will be  used  as  a

propaganda  weapon 10 win support in the Federation

and   the  Borneo  territories  through  their  new

proposed powerful short-wave radio transmitters. Of

course, Sir, a P.A.P. Prime Minister of Malaysia is

only a conceited fancy - a dream. The P.A.P should be

happy  if  in the next elections they are  returned

with  just  a  few  seats to keep the  P.A.P. flag

flying.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second reason why the money earmarked

under  the  Four-Year Plan for 1964  would  not  be

spent is that the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1319</b></font><br><br>



P.A.P.  Government has, I believe, stopped all  new

construction projects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Four-Year Plan groups various development

projects  under  various headings.  First  of  all,

their scheme of land and agricultural developments.

Four  thousand  acres  of  swamp  land  are  to  be

reclaimed  costing $4 million. Sir,  as  far  as  I

know, this project has been a complete failure.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Completed already!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, only a small

Sungei Poyang project. $11.8 million is to be spent

on alleviating flood problem in four areas, namely,

Geylang, Sungei Ulu Pandan and the Singapore River,

Bukit  Timah and Bedok. As far as I know,  none  of

the  projects  has been started and  completed.  By

1963  the  Government promise to build $20  million

worth  of rural roads, bridges, markets, amenities,

electricity  and  water, drainage and  other  rural

development. I do not know how much has been spent,

but I think it is only a small fraction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then their scheme for industrial development. The

Economic Development Board has been set up to  take

the   place   of  the  Labour  Front's   Industrial

Promotion  Board, The difference  is  only  in  the

change  of  names. Time and energy  was  wasted  to

draft  and  pass the legislation of the new  Board.

When  the P.A.P. want to do something, they  always

want  a  new  name  so that others or  predecessors

cannot  share any credit. This inability  to  think

and act big has cost them a heavy price. The people

are  only interested in seeing new factories coming

up,  which means more jobs. The P.A.P. can  set  up 100  Economic

Development Boards with fat  salaries

for sycophants and time-servers, but what for? What

benefit  do the people get? The Government  intends

to  spend  nearly $140 million by the end of  1963.

which this Budget covers, on the various industrial

projects. But, Sir, if you go to Jurong - and this is

after  four years of P.A.P. bungling - where are  the

factories?  The P.A.P. used to condemn the.  Labour

Front Government for inefficiency, but I think  the

present P.A.P. Government is worse. Can the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1320</b></font><br><br>



boast  that  there are less people  unemployed  now

than in 1959?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, $100 million has been earmarked

by  1963,  by  the  end  of this  Budget,  for  the

expansion  of our water supply, power stations  and

gas  works.  $100  million!  The  P.A.P. grandiose

scheme  of  building five projects to  augment  our

water supply has been a complete flop. The Minister

for Finance wants to use me as a scapegoat. He puts

the  blame on me, I was Minister in charge of water

supply  for only three months, and I was told  that

the  Prime  Minister wants to take  over  the  City

Council.  He  thinks he can run it better.  He  has

four  years to himself. Why should he blame me?  He

has  four full years with a Deputy Secretary,  with

special duties, to assist him. And, Sir, this

Four-Year  Plan was presented to the people in 1961 when

I  was  no  more in the Government.,when the  Prime

Minister  had  more than one and a  half  years  of

experience  in  running the Water  Department,  and

when  he  knew that the Johore water agreement  had

not   yet  been  signed.  But  based  on  all  this

knowledge,  we  are promised in the Four-Year  Plan

the  Johore  River Scheme and four other  projects.

None has been completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, $55 million has been earmarked

by   the   end   of  1963  for  the  extension   of

electricity.  I  think  the amount  spent  is  very

little. There has also been little expansion in the

gas   works  where  nearly  $9  million  has   been

earmarked.  Under  the  main  heading  of  economic

development, under the $92 million ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order? Yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> These are all the details of

the  Development  Estimates,  and  I  say  this  is

completely out of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I have been watching the speech very

carefully. At the moment, the Member for  Hong  Lim

has  touched on the fringe of the Development Plan.

I have indicated that the debate must go on general

principles.  These items can only be  mentioned  in

passing.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1321</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, another $92

million  has been earmarked for the development  of

transport and communications. There will  be  major

improvements  in the Singapore River  costing  $7.7

million.  We are promised this. What has  happened?

Nothing. Nearly $21 million for roads ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He is not touching on the

principles  of the Ordinary Estimates,  but  he  is

going  into the details of the performance  of  the

Four-Year Plan and the Development Estimates. I say

that  if any Member wants to do that, if he intends

to  bring  up these extraneous matters,  he  should

give due notice to the House so that the Government

can   come  fully  prepared  to  answer   all   his

allegations which are completely baseless.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think I had better draw the

attention  of  the  Minister and  `Members  to  the

Standing Orders again:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The debate shall be confined to the general

principles     of     Government     policy     and

administration.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very difficult, I must admit, to draw a line

somewhere, and perhaps the Member for Hong  Lim  is

now  touching on the fringe of what he alleges  are

failures  in  the Government administration.  I  am

watching  him very carefully. I cannot  say  he  is

completely out of order yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I assure you

of  my best co-operation. I have read the, relevant

Standing  Orders and I am doing my best to  confine

myself to the Standing Orders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly $21 million for roads. How much has been

spent? It is only a small fraction. $13 million for

drains and bridges. Little has been done. The  rest

of   the   $92   million   on  wharf   development,

telecommunications,  post  office   and   telephone

facilities.  With  the P.A.P. not  boasting  about

their  achievements  in all those  fields,  we  can

safely assume that the answer is no.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1322</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, $11 million has been earmarked for district

hospitals  and other hospital facilities.  I  think

not much has been done. The Government promised ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think that possibly the

Minister for Finance is more correct than I thought

he  was. If the Member for Hong Lim carried  on  in

this strain, then we will have to go right back  to

the  debate on the Development Estimates which  has

been  held  and  on  the  Ordinary  Estimates.   An

allegation  that  $11 million has not  been  spent,

just  like that, has been mentioned, 1 think,  when

we   debated  the  Development  Estimates  and  the

Estimates for 1963. If I were to allow that in this

debate,  we  would have every Minister standing  up

and  possibly refuting the vague allegations  which

have been made. I think from now on we must confine

ourselves  to  the  general  principles   and   not

details.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, there are two

items in the Four-Year Plan which were successfully

completed. They are housing and community  centres.

On  housing, it was successful because I  gave  the

policy  on  21st February, 1959.  I  prepared  the

organisation  and  gave  the  plan.  On   community

centres   it   is   because  they   are   necessary

substitutes for P.A.P. branches and P.A.P. cultural

and educational ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not general policy.

Now  we  are going on to the community centres.  We

have  dealt with community centres ad nauseam  when

we  debated the 1963 Estimates. Let us have general

principles of what the plans were of the Government

in   so  far  us  the  welfare  of  the  people  is

concerned, and so on and so forth.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have seen

after  four  years  of  performance  by  the  P.A.P.

Government  that they do not have the  interest  of

the  people at heart Because of the way the  P.A.P.

Government  have been deceiving the  people,  their

twists  and  turns, we have no more confidence  in

them any more. The Four-Year Plan was, only another

electioneering device. History has proved  that  it

is nothing but a piece of cunning propaganda.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1323</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we come to the last limb of

the  P.A.P. Government, we want to ask, what  other

ruses  can the P.A.P. Government think of  to  keep

themselves in power? They want so many millions  of

dollars  from us; giving more money to the  Harbour

Board  workers at the last minute after  four  long

years of waiting with a view to ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That is not general policy.

That  is  a  matter of detail. And if there  was  a

grievance, the hon. Member for Hong Lim should have

brought it up when we dealt with the Estimates.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, no

development  project. Nothing the P.A.P. is  doing

now  can  save  it from destruction.  Even  getting

police  informers,  pimps  and  gangsters  to  make

statements  on political rivals and detaining  them

under  section  55, locking up political  opponents

under the P.P.S.O. ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Again the hon. Member is

touching  on  details. Those were grievances  which

were aired in the Committee of Supply. That is  the

place  to air grievances in detail, not in an  open

meeting when we are debating the Appropriation Bill

dealing with general principles.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think this

Budget has not been well prepared. On some items, I

think  what  the Government requires  is  a  bigger

vote. For instance, community centres, the Ministry

of  Culture,  entertainment expenses of  the  Prime

Minister.  We do not require so big votes  in  some

others  because the Government is unable  to  spend

them.  It  will also be another surplus. Therefore,

this Budget has not been very well prepared. It  is

too  late  now  for the P.A.P. to  do  anything.  A

further  meeting with the "Plen" might  help.  But,

Sir,  could the Plen trust them any more? That,  of

course, will be left to history.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam (Choa Chu Kang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, this year is a year of the  Confusing

Musical Orchestra performing for the last time.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1324</b></font><br><br>



This  Budget for 1963, I think, is the last one  of

the P.A.P. There will not any more be a 1964 Budget

prepared by the P.AP.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking this Appropriation Bill as a whole, we can

see  that  in respect of social services, the  vote

asked for Is decreasing, and that public assistance

given  by  the  Social Welfare Department  is  also

decreasing.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. That again is a grievance

which  should  have  been  aired  in  Committee  of

Supply.  If the vote was not sufficient, it  should

have been criticised on that ground. It is a detail

which must be debated in Supply. We are now on  the

Appropriation   Bill  which  deals   with   general

principles.   If  the  hon.  Member   thinks   that

generally the policy of the Government is wrong, in

relation  to the poor, then he can say so.  But  he

cannot  go  into  the  figures  and  say  that  the

Government  has not supplied sufficient  money  for

that purpose.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): All that I wish

to  say  is  that the Budget of the Government  for

this  year  is  more concerned with  the  political

future of the P.A.P. rather than the livelihood  of

the  poor  people. The whole Budget, therefore,  is

only prepared for the future of the P.A.P. and  not

for the future of the people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the economic policy of the Government has been a matter which the Government is always boasting

about.  The Government says  that  it  is

trying   to   create  more  and   more   employment

opportunities, carrying out development  plans  and

industrial  projects. But we say that although  the

Jurong  industrial  project is being  carried  out.

from the present performance of the Government, one

will  get the impression that the Government itself

is not quite confident about this project.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is going into

details.  The  general policy of  industrialisation

can  be  debated  but not in specific  detail,  The

Member  had  the  opportunity  at  the  appropriate

time - when we debated the Development Estimates  and

the Main Estimates.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1325</b></font><br><br>



That was the time to debate details. Now we are  on

general   principles  - the   general   policy    of

industrialisation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the

Minister  for  Finance talked about  his  financial

surpluses every day, but we see that the Government

is  not  investing  its  surpluses  in  the  Jurong

project.   Instead  it  is  making  use  of   these

surpluses for investment abroad. From this  we  can

see that the Government itself has no confidence in

the Jurong project.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1963, what do the people of Singapore get? I

can  say with certainty that what they should  have

paid  by way of taxes has been collected, but  what

they  should have enjoyed by way of privileges  has

been  decreasing from time to time. The  number  of

opportunities for employment is decreasing as  more

and  more pupils leave school year by year. But the

Government is unable to solve all these problems in

1963,  and  is  unable  to create  more  employment

opportunities in 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, if at all the Minister for Finance wants to bring the livelihood of the people of Singapore to

a  higher  level  of  security   and

stability, then he should have paid more  attention

in  this  Budget to the creation of more employment

opportunities  than to extending the propaganda  of

the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the reorganisation of the various Government departments was supposed to have taken place sometime

during the last  four  years,  but

during  the course of this period it has  not  been

done  with  any satisfaction. That is why  in  this

Budget before us, there are many, many points which

are confusing and ambiguous. In 1959 ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hope the hon. Member will

not  go further on that track, because if there was

confusion  in  the  Budget,  it  should  have  been

cleared,  or at least the Member should have  tried

to clear that confusion in the Committee of Supply.

We   are   now   in  open  meeting   debating   the

Appropriation  Bill, and I must have  a  debate  on

some general principles. This business of wandering

over  the whole of the administration will  not  do

with the Appropriation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1326</b></font><br><br>



Bill.  There  must be some specific policy  of  the

Government chosen and debated to the point.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

hope  the  Government  will keep  its  promise  and

fulfil  it in the course of this year, and also  to

carry out its merger proposals.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, no matter what the Government tries to do to cover up or to pretend, we can see from the Budget for

this year that the people will bury them at the right time.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Goh, in reply.



<br><br>3.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I do not propose to reply

to  the  last speaker because I think what he  says

reflects   the   great  dreams  of  an   untutored,

uncultured, ill-educated, and immature mind. But  I

think  the  Member for Tanglin and the  Member  for

Hong Lim deserve some reply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the beginning of the proceedings of the

financial  Estimates, I had great  hopes  when  the

Member  for Tanglin was going on from one phase  of

understanding  to a higher phase of  understanding.

He  acknowledged the Government is now on the right

track. He thought we had changed. But we thought we

were  on the right track all the time, that he  had

advanced  in political knowledge to get the  truth.

Now   I   am   afraid  he  has  somewhat  reverted.

Retrogression has set in in a matter of a few days.

Mr Speaker, Sir ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr A. P. Rajah (Farrer Park):</b> Too many late

nights.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> --- possibly as a result of undue

strain. His main point is this, if I got him  right

and  I  am trying to get him right: he objected  to

our  policy,  particularly to the monies  that  are

allocated  to the Ministry of Culture,  because  he

says  that it is wrong of the Minister for  Culture

to  claim  that what he is propagating through  the

mass  media is national policy. He still  maintains

that  the  propaganda that is carried  out  by  the

Minister for Culture is propaganda in the interests

of  the  Party.  He  does  not  accept  that  if  a

Government is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1327</b></font><br><br>



elected to a particular policy and during its  term

of office it tries to get the policy understood and

accepted  on  a larger scale of the electorate;  he

says  that is still not national policy. I  have  a

feeling that if I were to try to debate this  point

at  length, we should really be quibbling over  the

meaning  of  words - what  is  "national",  what   is

"Party",  what is "in the interests of the  Party",

and  so  on  and  so forth. But I thought  that  my

colleague,  the Minister for Culture, did  make  it

clear  that there are certain basic and fundamental

objectives  on  which we were elected:  (1)  merger

with  the  Federation of Malaya. I think  even  the

Member  for  Tanglin will accept that reunification

with the Federation of Malaya is a national policy,

in  the  sense that all Parties accept that - there

are  differences  of  opinion  on  the  details  of

merger - but  certainly that will be accepted.  Then,

Sir,  we stated that it is our objective to improve

the    living   conditions   of   our   population,

particularly  the  working  class  as  far  as  the

restricted  economic  situation  allows.  We  build

houses,  schools,  roads, and  other  services  for

them.  And I think it is quite legitimate that  the

achievements  of  the Government  in  this  respect - fulfilment  of  its election promises -   should  be

given  publicity. Whether we call it "national"  or

he calls it "Party", we can differ as to the tag we

put  on  it,  but  I  think he will  accept  it  as

legitimate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So apart from these two objectives, the third, of

course, is the great objective of nation

building  - getting   people  of  different  races, different

religions,  different cultures to see  eye  to  eye

with  one  another, to give and take  and  to  work

towards  an integrated Malayan or Malaysian culture

of  the  future;  I think that he would  accept  as

legitimate, and is not in the interests  of  either

the P.A.P. or the S.P.A. or the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I can see, these are the three important

classes  of propaganda emanating from the  Ministry

of  Culture.  Apart from these, I  think  there  is

hardly  any  other. I will show  you.  These  three

categories would have exhausted all the activities.

Therefore,   to   say  that  we  were   using   the

instruments  of  State  for the  interests  of  the

Party,  I  somehow feel that it is an  uncharitable

interpretation,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1328</b></font><br><br>



quite unworthy of the Member for Tanglin in his now

progressive frame of mind. I am sure he will  agree

with me. However, he says no, Sir, but obviously  I

have not exhausted ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> On a point of elucidation, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes, certainly.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> What I was trying to stress,

Sir,  was  not  the  objecting.  The  objecting  is

"national",  where we all Parties  agree  supplying

jobs  to  the people and so on. But the way  it  is

done and the "how" it is done - the use of community

centres and so on - is for party purposes, Sir.  That

I say is wrong.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, the community centres are

for the use of the people in the area. We give them

certain amenities.



<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Controlled by the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I hope the Minister will not

be  tempted to go into a debate in detail.  At  the

moment,  the Minister is quite correct. We  are  on

general  policy.  Let us not deviate  and  go  into

detail  in spite of the temptation afforded by  the

Member for Tanglin.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think we have flogged this

particular  horse  to  death in  the  Committee  of

Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Hong Lim raced on to a

detailed  recital of the performance of  the

Four-Year  Plan. Obviously, the object is not to  inform

the  House of the truth but to get as much  of  his

scripts  in the newspapers before he is  hauled  up

under  Standing Orders to disparage  and  denigrate

the performance of the Government. He says that  we

have little to show in our four years of office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, is he a man in his right senses, or is he a

man  not  in  his  right senses? Every  month  now,

between ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> On a point of order, Sir. Mr

Speaker.  Sir,I can assure you that  I  am  in  my

right  senses.  I  remember in  the  Commission  of

Inquiry he got his medical superintendent ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I take it that the hon. Member

is  rising  on a point of order because he  alleges

that the phrases



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1329</b></font><br><br>



used by the Minister for Finance are offensive.  If

that  is  so,  then I ask the Minister to  withdraw

those phrases alleging that the Member for Hong Lim

is out of his mind.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> It is not at all intended to be

offensive,  Mr Speaker, Sir, because I  am  really

puzzled  that any man in possession of his rational

faculties  can come to the same conclusion  of  the

Member for Hong Lim. Therefore ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. My duty here as Speaker is to

see  that  nothing offensive is said.  Offence  has

been  taken,  and  I ask the Minister  to  withdraw

those expressions which have caused offence. Let us

get on with the debate.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Then I must withdraw. The

Member  for Hong Lim on this occasion has  shown  a

delicacy of skin which is not ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. A withdrawal must not be

embellished and must not be conditional.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Now, Sir. 1,200 houses a month

is  no mean performance. Jurong is pressing on. But

the hon. Member says that he has not seen factories

there.  That  is an obvious untruth.  We  are  very

familiar  with untruths whenever we  have  to  deal

with  what the Member for Hong Lim says. The  power

station  is  carrying  on: the  loans  are  in  the

pocket:  the airport runway is being extended:  the

airport  terminal building will he completed  in  a

few  months'  time; one school is  being  completed

every  three  weeks;  T.V. is  now  an  established

service in Singapore, and a second channel will  be

set  up  soon - all  this to the great  consternation

indignation  and  demoralisation  of  the   Barisan

Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to say we have little to show is obviously a

point unworthy of consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the second untruth, he says, is that the

Economic Development Board is exactly the  same  as

the  Industrial Promotion Board, and that the  only

difference is that a new Ordinance has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1330</b></font><br><br>



been  passed by this Assembly, but that except  for

the  parts  of the Ordinance and the difference  in

name,  it  is exactly the same. Sir, in  my  Budget

statement, I went to great lengths to explain  that

this  is  now  a  new and powerful  agency  of  the

Government  to promote industrial growth,  that  it

has  now no less than six international experts  in

various  lines  as  well  as  more  than  30  local

experts.  The  results  of  their  endeavours   are

becoming  more and more apparent day by day.  As  I

have  said,  the  work of the Economic  Development

Board is showing results which are apparent day  by

day.  In  fact, now when a new factory or  a  major

industrial  venture is established,  it  no  longer

hits the headlines. For instance, in the Malay Mail

of two days ago, there was a small paragraph tucked

somewhere to say that an oil refinery was to be set

up  in  Jurong. On another page, there was  another

small item to say that a new pipe factory was to be

set  up  in  Jurong  and that the first  polyvineal

chloride pipe factory in Singapore was to be set up

this  year with a 30-ton output. Then there  was  a

reference to five more secondary technical  schools

to be set up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Opposition Members have maintained that there

has  been no improvement in the economic situation.

In  fact,  some  of  them  say  there  has  been  a

deterioration. For example, at page 10 of the Malay

Mail  dated  13th  June -  two days ago - we  have  the

views  of an international expert - one of the United

Nations  experts  - who was here in 1960 and who  has

come  back  here  again. I think the  views  of  an

international   expert   - completely  disinterested,

unbiased  in Singapore carry more weight  than  the

views of certain Members of the Opposition. He said

that   Singapore's  economic  position  had   shown

considerable improvement since his first  visit  to

the  State in 1960. And he said. "Today, I see that

employment  is  going  up."  Now  there  are  other

references in the newspaper, and if you will  allow

me  some time to get to the right page, I think  it

will he here. Well, I have not got the actual date.

I think it might be here. Anyway. I am not going to

waste  the  time of the House in going through  the

papers because the items are all tucked away, as  I

have said



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1331</b></font><br><br>



in  odd corners. But I remember distinctly that  on

the  day I delivered my Budget speech, there was  a

reference  to no less than six industrial  projects

that  are due to go up in Singapore this year.  One

was  the  oil  refinery,  there  were  three  major

factories   to  be  established  by  a   group   of

industrialists  from Formosa - a plywood  factory,  a

chemical   plant  and  a  plastics   plant;   three

factories  which  will  give  employment   to   900

persons.  There were also references to some  other

industrial ventures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these are the direct results of the

efforts of the Economic Development Board,  and  to

dismiss  their  activities as being of  no  account

either  shows  a  state  of mind  that  refuses  to

acknowledge  the  truth,  or  betrays  a   colossal

ignorance  of what is really going on in the  State

today of the enormous progress that we have made in

the last 18 months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br><!-- Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Inche Yaacob Bin Mohamed Al-Haj) (for the Prime Minister)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, I have been asked to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this Bill is to transfer the

power to issue licences for auctioneers, appraisers

and house agents from the Commissioner of Lands  to

the  Comptroller of Property Tax. At present,  such

licences are still being issued by the Commissioner

of Lands



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1332</b></font><br><br>



although the Valuation Section, formerly under  the

Land  Office,  was transferred to the Property  Tax

Division  of the Inland Revenue Department  of  the

Ministry  of Finance with effect from 1st  January,

1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In practice, licences are only issued on the

recommendation of the Government Valuer who  weighs

the   applicant's  experience  and   qualifications

before  tendering advice. Owing to the transfer  of

the  Valuers  to the Property Tax Division  of  the

Inland  Revenue Department, it is neither necessary

nor  proper  for  the  Commissioner  of  Lands   to

continue  to  issue these licences. Such  licences

should  henceforth be issued by the Comptroller  of

Property Tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will enable this to be done by amending

section  17 of the Auctioneers' Licences  Ordinance

so  that  the Comptroller of Property  Tax  may  be

appointed  Licensing Officer for  the  purposes  of

this Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Kia Gan (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Tan Kia Gan):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I beg  to  move  the

motion  standing in the name of the Prime Minister,

namely,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly in accordance with section 4 of

the Foreshores Ordinance (Chapter 246) approves the

reclamation  by the Government of the two  portions

of   the  foreshore  and  sea-bed  containing   the

respective areas of approximately 180 acres and  34

acres adjoining lots 96-107, 96-64. 68, 67-2,

114-2,  96-118,  93-1,  94-11, 131, 94-14,  193,  Crown lands  and  Crown Reserves and lots 97,  98-1,  99,

100,  101,  102, 103, 104, 105, 106 and  107  being

land at Jurong Industrial Area and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1333</b></font><br><br>



Pulau  Samulun,  more  particularly  delineated  by

green  lines  and marked (1) and (2)  on  the  plan

which is deposited at the Land Office, Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under section 4 of the Foreshores Ordinance,

no  reclamation can be made without the sanction of

the  Legislative  Assembly. This motion  seeks  the

necessary   sanction   to   enable   the   Economic

Development  Board to reclaim two portions  of  the

foreshore  and sea-bed to the south of  the  Jurong

Industrial  Area.  The areas to  be  reclaimed  are

clearly shown on the plan now lying in the Assembly

Library which the Prime Minister has deposited with

the  Clerk  of  the  Legislative Assembly.  Surplus

earth from the industrial area will be used to fill

the  foreshore and sea-bed. The reclaimed land will

be   utilised  for  both  harbour  and   industrial

development.   In   doing   this,   the    Economic

Development  Board  will  act  as  agent  for   the

Government,  and on completion of reclamation,  the

land  will be declared State land and held in trust

for the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly in accordance with sect on 4

of  the Foreshores Ordinance (Chapter 246) approves

the  reclamation  by  the  Government  of  the  two

portions  of  the foreshore and sea-bed  containing

the respective areas of approximately 180 acres and

34  acres  adjoining lots 96-107, 96-64, 68,  67-2,

114-2, 96-118, 93-1, 94-11, 131, 94-14, 193,  Crown

lands  and  Crown Reserves and lots 97,  98-1,  99,

100,  101,  102, 103, 104, 105, 106 and  107  being

land  at  Jurong Industrial Area and Pulau Samulun,

more  particularly delineated by  green  lines  and

marked  (1) and (2) on the plan which is  deposited

at the Land Office, Singapore.

<div align="center"><b>REPORT OF COMMISSION ON</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ASSEMBLY STAFF</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara's recommendation to proceed with the  motion

standing in my name*.







<hr size="2" noshade>

*  The motion reads as follows:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, noting the Report of the Commission on Assembly Staff as

contained in Paper Misc 1 of 1963, accepts the recommendations of the Commission

as contained in Part IX thereof and resolves in accordance with such recommendations.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1334</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House will be aware from the Report

which   has   been  submitted  that  a   Commission

consisting  of you, Mr Speaker, the  Minister  for

Finance, the Minister for Health, the Minister  for

National  Development,  and  the  Chairman  of  the

P.S.C., was appointed to study the terms of service

of  the Assembly Staff. This Commission has met and

has  made  certain recommendations as contained  in

this  Report. Generally, the Commission is  of  the

opinion that the terms of service of members of the

Assembly Staff should be related to those which are

equally  applicable  to their counterparts  in  the

Government  service. I am happy to say that  accord

has been reached on the salary scales of the Clerk,

the    Clerk-Assistant,   the   Interpreters,   the

Serjeantat-Arms,  and that other terms  of  service

have also been carefully looked into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr K. M. Byrne (Minister for Health and Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health and Law (Mr K. M. Byrne):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, we were, in addition  to

being  asked to consider the revision of the salary

scales  of  the  Assembly  Staff,  also  asked   to

consider a proposal that the four topmost posts  of

the  Assembly  service should be removed  from  the

civil  service, and he placed in a closed  Assembly

Service. The main reason for this proposal  is  the

desirability  of  placing such  posts  outside  the

control  of the Executive Government to  avoid  any

possibility  of  their  being  brought  under   the

political  control of the Executive  Government  in

order  to maintain the independence and dignity  of

the Assembly in accord with similar arrangements in

the  English  House of Commons. Sir,  in  the  U.K.

there  is  not  the  equivalent of  an  independent

Public   Service   Commission  which   is   outside

political  control and entrusted with the  duty  of

recruiting, promoting, transferring and  exercising

discipline generally over the civil service



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1335</b></font><br><br>



there.  There  the  Civil Service  Commission  only

recruits  to the civil service and has  no  control

over promotions, transfers or discipline. Promotion

to the top posts in the civil service in the United

Kingdom   depends  on  recommendations   from   the

Permanent   Head   of   the  Treasury,   but   such

recommendations first receive ministerial  approval

before they are implemented. As the kind of service

which  officers  appointed to serve  the  House  of

Commons  renders  is entirely different  from  that

rendered  by the rest of the civil service  in  the

United  Kingdom, and as promotions to  the  topmost

civil  service  posts there depend  on  ministerial

approval,  there  was  therefore  good  reason  for

placing  these  appointments in  a  closed  service

outside  the ordinary civil service; but conditions

here,  Sir, are not similar. In Singapore  we  have

the  Public  Service Commission  which  is  outside

political   control,  exercising   authority   over

recruitments, transfers, promotions and  discipline

in  the civil service. Under section 46 (2) of  the

Singapore  (Constitution)  Order  in  Council,  the

appointment  of the Clerk is made by the  Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara acting in his discretion but  after

consultation  with  the  Speaker  and  the   Public

Service   Commission;  and  the   recruitment   and

promotion of other staff of the Assembly  are  made

by the Public Service Commission. They are also not

eligible  for  promotion or transfer to  any  other

appointment  in  the  public  service  without  the

consent of the Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these provisions in themselves ensure that

there  is  no  possibility of any of  the  Assembly

staff  being  brought  under  the  control  of  the

Executive  Government. While we pay due  regard  to

the  dignity and authority of this Assembly, we are

at   the  same  time  realists,  and  are  able  to

recognise  that there is a great deal of difference

between  our Assembly and the United Kingdom  House

of  Commons, which has developed in the  course  of

time to be a world forum. It is true that the Clerk

of  the House of Commons enjoys the same salary  as

the  Permanent Secretary of a large United  Kingdom

Ministry, but it does not follow that because  this

is so, the Clerk of our Assembly who has control of

a staff of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1336</b></font><br><br>



only 41 and serves an Assembly of 51 Members should

receive  emoluments of a local Permanent  Secretary

who has control of a staff of many Divisions with a

number  of Deputy Heads and a total staff amounting

to a few thousands ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I do not know what the

Minister  is  doing, whether he is arguing  against

the  Report or for the Report. He was a  member  of

the  Commission  and all this argument  could  have

been  advanced before the Commission.  We  are  now

either  to  accept or to reject the recommendations

of  this Commission. As a member of the Commission,

he has not agreed to this closed service principle.

So  there it is. If any other Member disagrees with

that, then of course the Minister gets up and  says

how that other Member is wrong.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> With due respect, Mr Speaker, Sir,

this  is  the  point  that  was  discussed  in  the

Commission, and I am only pointing out the  reasons

why we have in a way departed from the practices of

the  United Kingdom in considering the revision  of

the  salary scales of these posts. I stand  by  the

recommendations  of this Commission,  Mr  Speaker,

Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> But those recommendations have so far

not been challenged. Once they are challenged, then

the  Minister gets up and justifies it. The  proper

parliamentary practice is that the Minister,  as  a

member  of  the  Commission, has put  forward  this

Report. The Assembly is asked to accept the Report,

and  unless  and  until that Report  is  challenged

there  is no reason at all why the Minister  should

justify that Report.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I thought I would

take this opportunity, in view of the difference in

the salary scales, to explain what were the matters

that  were uppermost in our minds at the time  when

we  were debating these recommendations. But  I  do

stand by the recommendations in the Report.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I also wish to make another point,

because if the Minister pursues that line, then, of

course,  the whole debate which took place  in  the

Commission  should  be aired.  I,  as  Speaker,  of

course, cannot take part in this debate,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1337</b></font><br><br>



and  on certain points I think we did differ  until

we  reached  accord, so that I  do  not  think  the

Minister  is following good parliamentary  practice

if  he  now  urges something which he has  in  fact

already accepted, unless and until, as I have said,

somebody challenges that decision.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I bow to your ruling.

All  that  I  had  proposed to do is  to  draw  the

attention  of  the  House  to  matters  that   were

uppermost in our minds at the time they were  under

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolved,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, noting the Report of the

Commission on Assembly Staff as contained in  Paper

Misc. 1 of 1963, accepts the recommendations of the

Commission  as  contained in Part  IX  thereof  and

resolves in accordance with such recommendations.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE SOCIETY OF</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>ACCOUNTANTS BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will recall that this Bill was first

introduced  in  the Third Session of this  Assembly

and   was  referred  to  Select  Committee   by   a

resolution of the Assembly on 27th June, 1962.  The

Select    Committee   considered    representations

received and recommended a number of amendments  to

the Bill. These amendments are all incorporated  in

the Bill now before the House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to take up the valuable time of

hon.  Members by explaining at length the principle

behind  this legislation. The details of  the  Bill

are  fully  explained in the Explanatory  Statement

attached to the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very briefly, it seeks to provide a statutory body

to   register  and  regulate  the  conduct  of  all

accountants in Singapore - those in practice as  well

as those



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1338</b></font><br><br>



in  employment. Registration is necessary in  order

to   protect   the   public  from   untrained   and

inexperienced,   persons.   A   controlling    body

representative  of  the accountancy  profession  is

required  to  maintain the standards of  accounting

skill and the integrity of the profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now refer to the recommendations of the

Select  Committee  which, are incorporated  in  the

Bill.  Much anxious thought was given to the matter

of  unqualified accountants who are now  in  public

practice. The Bill in' its original form would have

put au of them out of business. It is, however, not

the intention of the Bill to deprive any person  of

his  livelihood. So the Select Committee reached  a

reasonable  solution  in  the  initial   stage   of

legislation,  which  is to bring  such  unqualified

persons  into  the  ambit of  the  Bill.  The  most

suitable nomenclature to adopt for these persons is

"licensed  accountants". Some  people  are  unhappy

over  this  name  which has been taken  after  much

thought   and  without  any  intention   of   being

derogatory  to  anybody. It  is  thus  provided  in

clause  6  for these accountants who  were  in  the

public service on 27th April, 1962, to be once  and

for  all  registered  as, licensed  accountants  to

enable them to carry on any practice in which  they

were engaged before this legislation takes effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, provision is made for licensed

accountants    to    be    promoted    to    public

accountants - i.e. fully  qualified   accountants - if

they are examined by the Council of the Society and

found to be fit for registration as such.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original provisions of the Bill do not allow

the  rules of the First Council to be discussed  by

the   Assembly.  Since  these  are  of  fundamental

importance   and   affect  the  interest   of   the

profession,  it  appears desirable that  the  rules

made  by  the  First Council should not  come  into

force   until  they  are  presented,  debated   and

approved  by  the Assembly. It is now  provided  in

clause 12 that such rules made by the First Council

on  matters like qualifications for persons  to  be

admitted members, the manner of admission,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1339</b></font><br><br>



fees  payable and other matters should come to  the

Assembly for approval.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to remove any doubts in the minds of some

accountants  that they may have  to  go  through  a

lengthy and perhaps tiresome process of application

for registration as a public accountant, clause  24

(5)  provides  that  those who are  now  authorised

under the Companies Ordinance as auditors generally

will   automatically   be  registered   as   public

accountants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to support this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, owing to the curtailment of time on the

Budget debate, I had not much time to give a  close

study  to this Bill, but I have done so since  last

night  and  have found that there are  one  or  two

clauses  here  that  may require  amendment.  I  am

already  out  of  time  in  so  far  as  notice  is

concerned,  but  when the Bill is in  Committee,  I

shall  try to explain to the Minister where I think

an amendment is necessary, and if that is accepted,

I  will  seek the assent of this House for such  an

amendment to be moved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Dr Goh Keng Swee.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<br><br>3.52 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Will the Member for Cairnhill

indicate the clauses on which he wishes to speak?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Clauses 1 and 12; clause 17 for

information  and clarification and  clause  24  for

some explanation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> On clause 1, does the hon. Member

wish to move an amendment?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1340</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I would like to explain and see

whether   my   explanation  is  accepted   by   the

Government.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The procedural difficulty is this.

Once  I  call clause 1, that is the time amendments

should  be  proposed. Even if  the  amendments  are

withdrawn,  it does not matter. An amendment,  when

proposed, enables the House to debate the suggested

amendment. If I propose that the clause stand  part

of  the  Bill,  then it is too  late  to  make  any

amendment.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I see the difficulty. But I

would  perhaps ask you to appreciate my difficulty.

As  I  am  not  a  legal man,  I  might  have  some

difficulty in phrasing the amendment, but if I were

to  give  it in a rough form, perhaps it  could  be

done.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Clause 1 then - amendment to be

proposed?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> What I want to point out under

clause  1  and  try to show that  an  amendment  is

necessary is the appointed day. According to clause

1 the appointed day is to be fixed by the Minister.

This Bill is in several Parts - Part I up to Part  V.

If  the appointed day is to refer to all the Parts,

therefore, Part V will come into operation, and  no

person,   unless   he  is  registered   under   the

Ordinance, can practise as a public accountant. But

if  no  appointed day is given, it is fixed.  Until

the  legislation is completed, the Society and  the

Council cannot legally function.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I do submit that an amendment is necessary here

to  the  extent that certain Parts of the Ordinance

shall  come into force on such days as the Minister

may by notification in the Gazette appoint.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I want to point out is that Parts II to IV

can  come into operation immediately, but  Part  V

will  have to wait until the Society has functioned

for  some  time  and  until  all  the  registrable

accountants have been duly registered, otherwise no

accountant can operate in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1341</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The Member for Cairnhill then seeks

leave  to move an amendment perhaps at the  end  of

clause 1 to add:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Minister may appoint different days for the

coming into operation of different Parts or clauses

of this Ordinance.'?



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That is correct. May I

elucidate?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Is it the pleasure of hon. Members

that the amendment be moved?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No. There is an objection to the

amendment being moved to start off with.  There  is

an objection?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The amendment cannot be moved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 1 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Can I not ask for an explanation

on clause 1?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes, on the clause itself.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Can the Minister please explain,

in the light of clause 37 which says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`After the appointed day a person who is not

registered  as  a  public  accountant  under   this

Ordinance .shall not practise ...'.



<br><br>So  once the appointed day is fixed- and it has  to

be fixed for the law to come into operation for the

Society to exist and for the members of the Council

to be appointed by the Minister-all the accountants

will not be allowed to practise legally. It will be

an offence under clause 37 of this law.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I do not think there is

any  difficulty about this at all, because all  the

known   accountants,   that   is,   the   qualified

accountants, are listed in the Companies  Ordinance

and  action  has  been  taken through  the  various

departments to get the unqualified accountants.  In

so   far   as   the  unqualified  accountants   are

concerned,  of course, some time may elapse  before

they are brought within the ambit of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1342</b></font><br><br>



this law. But for the public accountants, there

should not be any difficulty at all.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> The point is this, Mr Speaker. Sir.

There must be an appointed day for bringing the

Ordinance into force:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`After the appointed day a person who is not

registered as a public accountant under this

Ordinance shall not practise as a public

accountant, auditor or tao consultant;'.



<br><br>You  have got to bring the Ordinance into force  as

from  an  appointed day, and after  that  appointed

day,   if  one  is  not  registered  as  a   public

accountant,   then  one  cannot  practise   as   an

accountant.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> That is quite true, but when is

the  appointed day? The appointed day will have  to

be  brought  in immediately for Part IV,  otherwise

the  Society cannot legally function. The  Minister

will  have  no  power  to appoint  members  to  the

Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I may make a very

simple point? All Ordinances are brought into force

on  the day they receive the assent of the Yang

di-Pertuan Negara, if there is no other appointed day.

Where   an  Ordinance  does  not  have  a  specific

provision providing for a day on which it is to  be

brought  into operation, the Ordinance  comes  into

force  from the day that it receives the assent  of

the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara. That is one thing - the

day  on  which the Ordinance is brought into force.

Now  registration  can take place  before  that  or

after that, but the registration is effective  only

after  the  day when the Ordinance is brought  into

force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 2 to 11 inclusive ordered to stand part of

the Bill.



<br><br>4.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 -



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I have to seek your

indulgence again. I would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1343</b></font><br><br>



not know how to move an amendment unless I know the

point of view that I want to present to this House

is accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 12, it means that under clause 9 when

this law comes into operation, the Minister has the

power to appoint members to the Council which shall

run  the  Society in accordance with the law.  Then

under  clause 8, there are certain powers given  to

the  Society for the framing of rules. Under clause

12, the Council shall only have certain powers, but

not  all  the powers. The Council under  clause  12

shall,  notwithstanding the provisions of clause  8

of  this  Bill, frame rules in respect  of  certain

paragraphs - (b), (d), (e), (h) and  (i).  But  there

are  other paragraphs which have been left out  but

which  are  necessary if the Society is  to  really

function.  Why  do we restrict the powers  of  this

Council  then  if we mean that the  Society  should

operate effectively from the very word "go"? In

sub-clause  (2) of clause 12, the rules made thereunder

must  seek  the approval of the Assembly.  This  is

contradictory to sub-clause (2) of clause 8.

first Council of the Society.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Under clause 24, no person

shall  be registered by the Council as a member  of

the  Society  if  he  is not of good  character  or

reputation.  I find it difficult to appreciate  how

character  and good reputation can be assessed.  If

he  is  not registered, he cannot practise. Whereas

under  clause 30, sub-clause (2) , where  a  man  is

already a member, if he is found to be of not  good

character  or reputation, he can be suspended.  But

then  he  has a right of appeal even to the  Court.

But  here  a  man, before he becomes a member,  can

just be knocked out on the ground that he is not of

good  character  or reputation,  and  there  is  no

redress.  Perhaps  the Minister  can  explain  that

there is some redress.



<br><br><!-- Mr Byrne -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Byrne:</b> It must be left to the good sense of

the  Council to see that admissions to the  Society

are made in a proper manner, it is usual to provide

that  people  who  have  previous  convictions  for

dishonesty  are  not admitted to  the  rolls  of  a

Society like this.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> I agree, Sir. What I want to

point  out is that in the case of a member  who  is

suspended  on the same ground, he has redress.  But

for  a  man  who  wants to be a member,  if  he  is

knocked out on that ground, he has no redress,  and

then  he  cannot  practise  in  spite  of  all  the

qualifications he has got. There must be  some  way

of getting some redress.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The reason why it is required

that  the  first  Constitution of  the  Society  be

that  under  clause 8 (1) (b), rules  may  be  made

of members. I would suggest that it may be possible

to  insert  that the Assembly should see  that  any

possible  safeguard  could be introduced  when  the

Council  itself breaks the rules.  So  far  as  the

general provisions of the Bill are concerned, it is

obviously  necessary  that before  accountants  are

registered,  they  should satisfy the  registration

body,  namely,  the Council, that  he  is  of  good

character and reputation.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> May I also inform hon. Members that

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections 3 (1) and 4 (1) of the Rubber Estates

Assessment Ordinance (Cap. 168) prescribes the levy

of  assessment on rubber estates of  100  acres  or

more, and on estates of less than 100 acres



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1346</b></font><br><br>



respectively.  The  proviso to  subsection  (1)  of

these  two  sections  of  the  principal  Ordinance

prescribes  the  payment to the Comptroller  of  an

additional  rate of $8.75 per quarter per  acre  in

respect of those rubber estates in which no  rubber

trees  are tapped or in which rubber trees are  not

tapped to the satisfaction of the Comptroller.  The

levy  of  a  tax as provided under the provisos  to

sections  3  (1)  and 4 (1) of  the  Ordinance  was

imposed  to discourage the alienation of  land  for

rubber,  and as a measure to deter an  owner  of  a

rubber  estate  from evading tax by  tapping  trees

once  or  twice a quarter in order to pay the  rate

for  the  rubber produced which would be small.  It

was  not  intended  that this  rate  should  be  in

addition  to  the  rates imposed  under  the  other

subsections (3) and (4) of the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of the Bill now before the House is to

amend   the   principal  Ordinance  so   that   the

additional rate of $8.75 per acre should be  levied

in  lieu  of,  and not in addition  to,  the  rates

prescribed  in  sections 3 (1) and  4  (1)  of  the

principal Ordinance. It was not the intention  that

this  rate should be additional to those prescribed

in sections 3 (1) and 4 (1) .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions of the Minister prescribed under

section  3 (3) of the principal Ordinance  are  now

conferred upon the Comptroller of income Tax.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also empowers the Minister, instead of

the  Comptroller  of Income Tax, to  prescribe  the

rate  of assessment levied under subsection (2)  of

section 4 in respect of rubber estates of less than

100 acres.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b>

Mr  Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in recent years, the Postal Services

Department  has experienced constant  embarrassment

in  the number of unpaid money orders which lie  in

its accounting records because of the inability  or

unwillingness  of  remitters  or  payees  to  claim

payment. Many of the undisposed money orders relate

to  disputes  between landlord and  tenant  in  the

payment of rent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 54 (2) of the Post Office Ordinance (Cap.

105) provides two conditions to be fulfilled before

an unpaid money order may be credited to revenue  :

-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) that neither the payee nor the remitter can

be found; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) that no claim is made within the period of

the one year from the date of issue.



<br><br>The  first condition that neither the payee nor the

remitter can be found prevents the Department  from

crediting the order to revenue as in most instances

both the payee and remitter can be found but cannot

be  persuaded or obliged to claim payment. It  has,

therefore,  been necessary to amend section  54  of

the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill provides that the amount payable on a

money  order  is  to be paid into the  Consolidated

Fund  where no claim is made within the  period  of

one year from the date of issue of the money order.

The    Postmaster-General   is,   however,    given

discretion  to pay the amount .of any  claim,  even

though  made after the period of one year  but  not

later  than  three years, if he is  satisfied  that

there  is reasonable cause for the delay in  making

the claim or if hardship would otherwise result.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parallel legislation was introduced in the

Federation of Malaya on 29th November last year.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1348</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while sympathising

with the Postmaster-General in his difficulties and

his  inability  to  dispose of  these  embarrassing

amounts,  there  seems to be a point  of  principle

involved   in   this,  which,  if  not   determined

properly,  might lead to adverse property  results.

Sir,  the position is this. If I owe Mr X $250,  I

take  a money order out and I send it to him. Under

the  present regulations, there is imposed  on  the

Post  Office  an  obligation  to  search  out   the

remitter.  It is only when the remitter  cannot  be

found  that  the one-year period begins to  operate

[Interruption]. Yes, if within one  year  from  the

date of issue no claim is made by such payee or the

remitter.  If  the  remitter  can  be  found,   the

obligation is to give it to the remitter, it cannot

go  into  the State coffers. So that the obligation

at  the  moment now is on the State, where a  money

order  is  not paid, to look in the first  instance

for  the  payee; and if the payee cannot be  found,

then  to  look  for the remitter. If he  cannot  be

found,  then it goes into the State coffers.  There

is  a  switch now. The State is now saying,  "I  am

going  to divest myself of this responsibility,  to

look either for the payee or the remitter." They do

not  want to take any responsibility in this matter

at all. They also say that if, within one year from

the  date of such order, nothing is done, then  the

Postmaster-General may in any case, where the claim

is  made  after one year but not later  than  three

years from the date of issue, pay the amount to the

payee  or  remitter.  If it is not  claimed  within

three years, under no circumstances will either the

payee or the remitter get the money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have recently had an amendment to the

Limitations Ordinance which said this:  that  where

previously you could only pursue a debt  for  three

years, now you can pursue it for six years.  So  if

I, a debtor, pay my creditor through a money order,

after  three years I lose my money, but my creditor

can still pursue me. That, I think, is not fair. It

is  not right at all. Because after all, the  State

has agreed to act as my agent to convey



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1349</b></font><br><br>



this   money  to  my  creditor,  and  they  get   a

commission  for  this. It is not  a  free  service.

Therefore,  I  think, to put the matter  completely

beyond  objection, the period of  three  years,  it

seems  to  me,  should be extended. Otherwise,  the

present obligation of the Government to search  out

either   the  payee  or  the  remitter  should   be

maintained.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister

brought   out   one  very  interesting   point   in

connection  with  the payment of rent.  Payment  of

rent  is made by money orders. The Postmaster knows

the  remitter, the Postmaster can trace the  payee.

But  then  the Postmaster cannot force  either  the

remitter  or the payee to go and claim  the  money.

That  is why in order to obviate that dilemma, this

amendment is being passed. I would rather  see,  if

an amendment is necessary, that where you can trace

the remitter or the payee, a time limit be given to

him.  If he does not take it, then it is forfeited.

Will  the Postmaster go and tell the remitter,  "If

you  do  not take out this money, you are going  to

lose  it"?  That is not written into the amendment.

Is  it  the intention that the Postmaster,  knowing

who  the  remitter or the payee  is,  will  give  a

notice,  saying,  "You either come  and  take  your

money within a year, or your money is forfeited."



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, I do not think it is the

intention  of the Postmaster-General to profit  out

of  this amendment to the Post Office Ordinance. It

is quite obviously a heavy burden on the

Postmaster-General that he should have accumulated in his safe

a very large number of unclaimed money orders. I am

quite  sure  that  the  Post Office  will,  through

administrative  action, seek to find  out  who  the

remitter is and who the payee is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the point raised by the Member for

Farrer Park about application of this Ordinance

vis-a-vis  the  Limitations  Ordinance,  I  have   been

informed by the Legal Department that by virtue  of

section 3 of the Limitations Ordinance, it is there

provided  that  where the period of  limitation  is

prescribed by any other written law, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1350</b></font><br><br>



provisions of the Limitations Ordinance  shall  not

apply  to  such  action. Therefore, the  period  of

limitation  prescribed by this  proposed  amendment

will  apply to the recovery of money payable  on  a

money order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, Sir, I would like to add that it is

desirable  we should have uniform legislation  with

regard to pan-Malaysian or pan-Malayan Departments.

I have already pointed out that such legislation is

already  in force in the Federation of Malaya,  and

after  31st August when our Post Office  will  come

under the control of the Central Government, I have

no  doubt  that the Post Office here will  have  to

follow similar legislation. So I think it may be as

well that this House approves this amendment to the

Post Office Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 2 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Sir, I think the Deputy Prime Minister

has  given  the House an assurance that through  an

administrative   process   though   not   a   legal

obligation, the Postmaster-General will, before  he

exercises his powers under this Ordinance,  see  to

it  that neither the payee nor the remitter can  be

found.  That is one aspect of the problem which  is

solved  by administrative action. But the  point  I

raised,  and which the Minister seems not  to  have

understood on the limitation period of three years,

is  this:  where  there is a debt owing,  then  the

creditor  can sue the debtor within six years  from

the time the debt becomes due. That is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1351</b></font><br><br>



the  present  limitation law, as I  understand  it.

Therefore,  if the debtor sends to the  creditor  a

money  order  through  the  Post  Office,  and  the

creditor  does  not receive it for some  reason  or

other -  he might have gone away - then this three-year

period  has  lapsed, then neither the creditor  nor

the  debtor can go against the Post Office, because

the  Post Office is protected by this section.  But

the  poor  old  debtor is not  protected  from  the

creditor, because the creditor has not received his

money.   The   debtor  has  sent  the  money,   the

Government  has acquired the money,  and  will  not

part  with it after three years, and the  poor  old

debtor can still be sued by the creditor.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh (Queenstown):</b> Serve him right!



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would say,

"Do not settle your bills through the Post Office."

I   think  it  is  very  unfair  indeed  that   the

Postmaster,  with all his responsibilities,  should

also  be  asked  to  mediate between  creditor  and

debtor. In fact, I would say this gives the lawyers

an increase in their business. May they prosper!

Speaker,  Sir, I have His Excellency the  Yang

di-Pertuan Negara's recommendation to move, "That  the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Financial Procedure Ordinance, 1959, No.

39 of 1959, has been in operation for the last four

years.  This Bill seeks to make certain  amendments

which  appear necessary in the light  of  the  last

four years' experience. Subsection (3) of section 7

of the principal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1352</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance  is  amended to enable the investment  of

monies  standing  to the credit of  the  State  and

stocks,  funds  and securities authorised  for  the

time being in the United Kingdom for the investment

of  trust funds. The provision of subsection (2) of

section  12  of the principal Ordinance  has  given

rise  to  an accounting difficulty, insofar  as  it

requires that the repayment of loans received under

the  local Treasury Bills Ordinance to be made from

the  Consolidated Revenue Account where  the  money

received  as loans are credited to the Consolidated

Loan  Account,  with the result  that  the  credits

remain  uncleared in the Consolidated Loan Account.

Clause  3  of  the Bill amends section  12  of  the

principal Ordinance so that such repayments can  be

charged to the Consolidated Loan Account.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another difficulty encountered in the operation of

the  principal Ordinance stems from the requirement

that  the refunds of taxes over-collected have been

treated  as  expenditure by providing  votes  under

different  departmental Heads of Expenditure.  This

tends  to  give a magnified picture of the  running

cost  of the department concerned. Clause 4 of  the

Bill amends the principal Ordinance so as to enable

such  refunds  to  be charged on  the  Consolidated

Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 19 of the principal Ordinance, which

concerns the procedures for surcharge, empowers the

Minister  to  surcharge a person in  the  event  of

deficiency  or  irregularity in the  management  of

Singapore Government Funds. Since certain Singapore

Departments  are responsible for the administration

of   funds   other  than  those  of  the  Singapore

Government, as in the case, for instance,  of

Pan-Malayan  Departments,  it  is  desirable  to  amend

section 19 of the Ordinance as proposed in clause 5

of the Bill.

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the

extension of time for the revision of the registers

of electors for the year 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House is aware, under the provisions of

subsection  (1)  of  section 15  of  the  Singapore

Legislative   Assembly  Elections  Ordinance,   the

Registration Officer shall in each year complete  a

revision of the registers of electors on or  before

the  15th  day of September or such later  date  in

that  year  as  the Minister may  appoint  for  the

purpose by notification published in the Gazette.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the revision of the 1962 registers of

electors was not completed last year as required by

the   Singapore   Legislative  Assembly   Elections

Ordinance for two main reasons. Firstly, to prevent

confusion among the electorate during the  year  of

the  national referendum and, secondly,  to  enable

the  electors  who  did not vote  at  the  national

referendum to get their names restored in the  1962

registers of electors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the national referendum for which the 1961

electoral registers were used had been held  during

the  period of publication of the 1962 List  B  and

the   submission  of  claims  and  objections   and

adjudications in connection with the 1962  revision

of the registers, there were bound to be doubts and

misunderstanding in the minds of a large proportion

of  electors  as to their entitlement  to  vote  or

their places of voting at the national referendum.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1354</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, if the 1962 revised registers were

certified  and published in 1962, those who  failed

to  vote  at  the national referendum on  September

1st,  1962,  would not be able to get  their  names

restored  in the 1962 registers of electors,  since

the  preparation and publication of lists  of

non-voters  could only be completed towards the end  of

January  1963.  They would have to wait  until  the

revision  of the 1963 registers to get their  names

restored to the registers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House is now aware, the various procedural

steps with regard to the public inspection of Lists

A  and  B, the submissions of claims and objections

and  the  adjudication of claims and objections  as

well  as the publication of the lists of non-voters

have already been completed. The certification  and

publication of the registers of electors  for  1962

will be made before 30th June.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajah:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, I feel unable to

support this Bill for reasons which I will now give

to the House. The reasons given by the Minister for

Home  Affairs that the 1962 registers were not able

to   be  completed  in  time  was  because  of  the

Referendum and the desire of the Government to  see

that  those who had not voted in the Referendum  to

have  their  names inserted in the 1962  registers.

Mr  Deputy Speaker, the Referendum was held on the

1st  September, 1962. Under section 15,  subsection

(1) , the obligation on the Registration Officer  is

as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Registration Officer shall in each year

following the year 1958 complete a revision of  the

registers on or before the 15th day of September or

such  later  date in that year as the Minister  may

appoint  for the purpose by notification  published

in the Gazette.'



<br><br>If the Government were sincere in its desire to see

that  those  who  had not voted in  the  Referendum

should  have their names registered, the  procedure

should  have  been such that the defaulting  voters

would be enabled to get their names on to the  1962

registers. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1355</b></font><br><br>



Minister could quite easily have extended the  date

after the 15th of September to some time before the

31st  December for certification. As far as  I  can

remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, nothing was done  for

the  compilation of the 1962 registers until  after

the lapse of the year 1962 and sometime in February

1963.  That  is the factual position.  Nothing  was

done.  Nothing  was done before December,  and  the

Minister  had  plenty  of  time  from  the  1st  of

September  to  the 31st December, 1962.  The  total

time  for the compilation of the electoral register

required under the Ordinance, I think, is about two

to    three   months.   Within   two   months   the

certification can take place, having regard to  the

time  limits  set  by the various sections  in  the

Legislative Assembly Elections Ordinance. I  rather

think,  at  least the most charitable  construction

that one can put on this matter, is that either the

Minister  forgot  about the 1962 registers  or  his

officials,  who  should have reminded  him  of  it,

forgot to remind him of it. That is about the  most

charitable  construction that I  can  put  on  this

matter,   because  it  is  certainly  a  lapse.   A

statutory  obligation imposed on  the  Registration

Officer  has  not  been complied  with.  He  is  in

dereliction  of  his duty and if  the  Registration

Officer does not give a satisfactory explanation to

the  Minister, I think he should be up  for  severe

disciplinary action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister now seeks to rectify the position by this Bill, and he has told the House, in the most categorical terms,

that the registers will be ready

before  the 30th June this year. That is, in  about

fifteen  days'  time. But Mr Deputy  Speaker,  you

will  notice  that the provisions of the  Bill  are

these:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1)

of section 15 of the Singapore Legislative Assembly

Elections  Ordinance the revision of the  registers

of electors for the year 1962 shall be completed on

or before the 30th day of June, 1963'.



<br><br>As promised by the Minister in this House. But here

again,   in   case   either  he  forgets   or   his

Registration Officer forgets, he wants to be on the

safe  side, he puts in a clause "or such later date

in the year as the Minister may appoint for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1356</b></font><br><br>



purpose  by notification published in the Gazette."

So  what the Minister is now asking the House to do

is  to  give him complete carte blanche so that  he

can  extend the date right up to the 31st December,

1963, and yet be within the provisions of the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is one difficulty

which  I  wish  to  bring to the attention  of  the

Minister  in  charge of this Bill and the  Minister

for  Law. Under this Ordinance, Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir, the whole of the registration process must  be

completed within the year of registration. What the

Minister  wants  to do now, what  the  Minister  is

asking  the  House to do rather, is to  extend  the

time  to the 30th June in order to enable the  1962

registers to be completed. I understand that  steps

have already been taken by the Registration Officer

sometime towards the end of February this  year  to

start the compilation of the 1962 registers. To  my

mind,  Mr  Deputy Speaker, Sir,  all  those  steps

which  he  has now taken are ultra vires, null  and

void,  of  no legal effect, so that all the  claims

and  objections which have been registered, all the

tentative  registers which he has put up  (Lists  A

and B) are illegal and have no effect. That is the

present  position. All that the Minister is  asking

the  House  to  do is to extend the  time  for  the

certification  of the registers. The  certification

of  the  registers on the steps now  taken,  to  my

mind, will be an illegality without the sanction of

the  law.  I do not see how, even if this  Assembly

passes  the Bill in the form in which it is framed,

any  certification resulting from the steps already

taken  by  the Registration Officer can make  these

registers  valid.  That is  my  view  which  I  put

forward to this House. If the Minister carried this

Bill  through, it could well be that somebody could

contest  the  validity  of  these  registers,   and

elections held on the 1962 registers might well  be

null and void and of no effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask the Minister whether he has taken the

advice of the State Advocate-General on the present

position  on  this specific proposition - that  steps

already  having been taken to compile the registers

(which  steps  are illegal at the moment)  and  the

Bill drafted in the way



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1357</b></font><br><br>



that it is without further provisions to cover  the

illegal  steps  already taken by  the  Registration

Officer, whether this Bill would, in law, enable  a

proper  valid  legal  register  for  1962   to   be

completed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point I wish to raise is this. The 1963

registers  must be compiled. I wonder  whether  the

Registration Officer is doing anything about  that.

If  he  is,  in fact, going to bring out  the  1963

registers  before the 15th of September,  1963,  he

should  be taking steps now which, in fact, he  has

not  done. Is the Minister then going to extend the

date  for the 1963 Registers to beyond the 15th  of

September? If the Minister is going to keep to  the

statutory  date provided in section  15,  then  the

first   steps  should  have  been  taken   by   the

Registration  Officer by now. But  they,  in  fact,

have not been taken.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, there

are  now  only  three matters which will  stop  the

people  of  Singapore from having a new  government

and  which  will  restore the  confidence  of  this

country.  They are, firstly, the Elections  Office,

secondly, the Police, and thirdly, the Ministry  of

Culture.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. The Member is

completely out of order in straying away  from  the

Bill.  We  are debating the Second Reading  of  the

Bill  introduced by the Minister for Home  Affairs,

i.e. the  Singapore Legislative Assembly Elections

(Temporary Provisions) Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I wish

to  explain this Bill in greater detail so that the

people can better understand this amending Bill.  I

believe  that if there has been no interference  by

the  P.A.P.  Government and the  civil  service  is

allowed  to  take its own course, today's  amending

Bill  is not necessary. We could have had the  1962

Registers  by  15th September, 1962.  Now,  as  the

Member  for  Farrer  Park has  said,  the  Election

Officer  would be busy not with the 1962 Registers,

but the 1963



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1358</b></font><br><br>



registers.  Mr  Deputy  Speaker,  Sir,  the   1963

Registers should have been almost ready by now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these are tricks of the P.A.P. Government to

have  a  snap election, giving us as short a notice

as possible. For instance, in clause 3, what is the

necessity of this date "30th day of June, 1963"? We

are  told that the register "shall be completed  on

or  before  the 30th day of June, 1963",  in  other

words, another two weeks. It is a "shall" assurance

given by the Government in this amending Bill,  but

there is an a1ternative "or". The "or" is "or  such

later  date in the year as the Minister may appoint

for  the purpose by notification published  in  the

Gazette". In other words, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

the  P.A.P. Government is still not sure;  when  it

changes  its  mind it can defer the 1962  Registers

to,  as  the Member for Farrer Park has  said,  the

31st  of  December, 1962, at 12 midnight.  This  is

another scheme by the P.A.P. Government to hoodwink

the  people  and  to  try to stage  a  comeback  by

dishonest means.



<br><br>4.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Ahmad Jabri Bin Mohammad Akib (Southern Islands)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker, this

amending  Bill, the Singapore Legislative  Assembly

Elections  (Temporary Provisions) Bill, has  raised

many queries. It coincides with the manner in which

the Government enforces the provisions of the Bill.

We  have  had many reasons given by the Government,

one  of  them  being that it cannot be  implemented

because of this and that. We are prepared to accept

the arguments advanced by the Government if it does

not   mean   losing  confidence  in   the   present

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very important Bill, as it means

upholding  a  democratic government.  Let  not  the

Government   exploit  its  tenure  of   office   by

indulging  in  unhealthy  practices.  As  has  been

pointed out by the Member for Farrer Park, the year

1962  has  passed and we are now in the  middle  of

1963,  and we are still faced with problems. It  is

the  duty  of 1hz Government to have the  registers

prepared,  or to take steps for the preparation  of

the electoral registers for 1963.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1359</b></font><br><br>



Over  six  months have passed and many events  have

taken  place  and constituents have  changed  their

places  of abode - and in the year 1964 we  shall  be

faced  with  another  general  election  under  our

Constitution.  If  the  preparation  of  the   1963

registers is linked up with the 1964 registers, and

if the 1963 electoral registers are not ready, then

it may be that when elections are due, a motion may

be   moved  for  the  purpose  of  using  the  1962

electoral  registers. Therefore, it is proper  that

this question of registers of electors, as has been

said  by  the Member for Tanglin, be put under  the

jurisdiction of an independent commission. I  think

it is a good move, so that there will be no grounds

for  suspicion. For instance, in the past we  heard

allegations  that  certain  political  Parties  had

caused  some  voters  to be  transferred  from  one

constituency  to  another. It was  done  with  such

secrecy  that it was impossible for this allegation

to be proved. But the time has now come for matters

relating  to elections to be put under the  control

of  an independent commission, as has been done  in

the   Federation   of  Malaya.   This   independent

commission  will he free from control, pressure  or

influence  of  the  Government. I  would  like  the

Minister in charge to declare his stand and further

clarify the points raised by Opposition Members.



<br><br>4.51 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this

is  another  case of Government trying to  rig  the

elections. They legally rigged the Referendum  Bill

the  last  time,  and  now they  hope  to  rig  tie

elections. I will explain to you, Sir. Why do  they

seek  the  passing  of this Bill?  The  Member  for

Farrer Park has already pointed out that the  whole

thing  is  illegal,  and I  am  sure  the  Minister

himself  knows that it is illegal. But  they  still

persist  in  it.  Why? You see, when  the  National

Referendum  was  held on 1st September,  1962,  the

registers  for that referendum were  based  on  the

registers for 1961.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you will remember, Sir, at that time a lot of

people  complained of their names being not in  the

electoral registers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1360</b></font><br><br>



Offhand, I can recall that those who had not  voted

in the Hong Lim by-election had not got their names

restored  in  the  1961 electoral  registers.  Then

there were those who did not vote in Anson and  had

their  names deleted from the 1961 registers.  Then

those who did not vote in the General Elections  in

1959  and  have not as yet got their names restored

to the registers, and those who had come of age and

having  reached  21  years  of  age,  were  already

citizens.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Will the Member take some time

on this subject?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> A little while more. These

people  had applied for their names to be  inserted

in the electoral registers, but their names had not

been  inserted in the electoral registers.  If  you

will remember, Sir, the Referendum was held on  the

1st  of September, whereas by the 15th of September

if  only  the Government had extended the date  for

another  two weeks, those who had come of  age  and

would have been certified by the 15th of September,

1962  would have become voters. I list all this  to

tell  you  that  the total number who  should  have

voted in the referendum but had not been given  the

vote,  exceeded many tens of thousands. Every  year

about  60,000 babies are born. Let us  go  back  20

years and assume that the figure is just half that,

30,000  say.  Therefore, in 1962  at  least  30,000

names  would  have been added to the  registers  if

only  the Government had allowed those names to  be

inserted in the 1962 electoral registers. Added  to

that,  you  have 1,000 voters in Hong Lim,  another

1,000 voters in Anson, plus more than 20,000 voters

who did not vote in 1959. The total number that did

not  have  a  chance  to  vote  in  the  referendum

therefore  exceeded  60,000.  It  might   even   be

100,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Referendum on the 1st of September, according

to   the  P.A.P.,  was  favourable  to  them   and,

therefore, they think that if they wanted  to  hold

an  election in future, they would prefer  to  have

the election based on those same registers. But now

they  are forced to include the 1962 lot of  people

who have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1361</b></font><br><br>



come  of  age,  that  is age 21, and  automatically

becoming voters by the 15th of February. 1962,  and

who  should  have been certified by 15th September,

1962,  as  electoral voters. The figure  is  fairly

high.  These  citizens are young  men.  The  P.A.P.

today  is very afraid of young men because all  the

young  people  of Singapore, especially  those  who

come  from  Chinese schools, are very much  against

the  P.A.P. Therefore, if a new batch of  would  be

voters of 1963 could be excluded from the electoral

registers,  then,  of  course,  it  would  be  more

advantageous to the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the very reason why we are asked to allow

the Government to fix a date as and when the P.A.P.

likes   for  the  certification  of  the  electoral

registers. They want to exclude the 1963 lot of new

citizens  and  voters  who constitute  a  very  big

number. This number together with the new voters of

1962  can  easily knock the P.A.P. out. The  P.A.P.

would prefer not to give this large number of young

men  their  opportunity to vote in the  forthcoming

elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we do not trust the P.A.P. at all. They

rigged the referendum and they hope to rig a future

election. That is why they have refused to agree to

the proposals from the Opposition - that there should

be   a   neutral  commission  to  look  after   the

elections. We oppose this new rigging of the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Thio Chan Bee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Thio Chan Bee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, yesterday I

stressed  the  need  for  an independent  Elections

Commission for Singapore. Today, Sir, this Bill has

confirmed  that need. If we had had an  independent

Elections  Commission, the electoral registers  for

1961 would have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1362</b></font><br><br>



been  ready in time, because nobody would have told

them  that  they must slow down for  this  or  that

event.  And if they had seen the need for a slowing

down, they would have approached the Government  to

have  some  Bill  here so that  it  could  be  done

legally.  Sir, all of a sudden the Party  in  power

decides  that it wants to speed up the  thing.  And

they  have  put  forward a  Bill  to  legalise  the

completion  of  the  Registers of  Electors  on  or

before  the  30th day of June. Not only that,  Sir,

they  give to themselves even wider powers. If they

see  fit,  they can extend the date to the  end  of

this  year, or such later date in the year  as  the

Minister  may appoint. They are asking  really  for

very   wide   powers.   An  independent   Elections

Commission would make sure that the conditions  for

an   election   should  be  fair  to  all   parties

concerned. But here, I am sorry to say,  the  Party

in  power  want to make sure that they win  and  to

make  sure also that they win with handicaps  given

to themselves. Sir, what is the significance of the

"30th  day  of  June"? We used to  think  that  the

former  Mayor of Singapore, the present Member  for

Hong Lim, was exaggerating when he said that he had

a  great deal to do with the training of men of the

P.A.P. top cadre. Now, Sir, we must give him credit

for  having  been  able  to see  that  the  Federal

elections, instead of, as had been expected before,

being  held after 31st August, 1963, may be  rushed

through very much earlier, after this magic date of

30th  June, 1963. This, of course, is to make  sure

that  all the other Parties are caught by surprise.

Why  the  long postponement of the by-election  for

Sembawang? Now why the sudden rush?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we say, Sir, the Party in power are so

keen  on  their  winning a victory  that  at  times

national interests become secondary. I am  sure  if

they  say  they  have no intention of  playing  any

trickery,  why  cannot they say they  agree  to  an

independent   officer  being  the   Supervisor   of

Elections  so  that there can be no suspicion  that

they are going to indulge in anything that would be

improper?   Sir,  we  feel  that   this   Bill   is

unnecessary,  that the registers for  1963  can  be

completed  according  to the present  Ordinance  by

15th September, 1963, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1363</b></font><br><br>



if  this  Bill is not necessary, then why  push  it

through at this time?



<br><br>5.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Chang Sam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Chang Sam</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the P.A.P. Government have been boasting that

they  are the champions of parliamentary democracy.

But  the  amendment moved by the Minister for  Home

Affairs  has disclosed their face, and has  exposed

them  as trying to destroy parliamentary democracy.

The  amendment, although it consists of three short

clauses,    nevertheless   has   greatly   affected

parliamentary  democracy,  and  its  content.   The

explanation of the Minister for Home Affairs cannot

cover  up  their intention of trying to play  party

politics  and  cannot cover up their wrong  doings.

According  to  the  Elections Ordinance,  the  1962

Registers of Electors should have been completed by

the 15th September. But the Government has wasted a

lot  of  time  without being able to  complete  the

revision and printing of the Registers of Electors.

Does  this mean that the vote in the 1961 Estimates

for the revision has been reduced, or is it because

the  staff of that Department has been reduced,  so

that  this job has not been completed? In the  1961

as  well  as the 1962 Budgets, we can see that  the

expenditure for the Elections Office for each  year

is  the  same. How is it that this Office  has  not

been able to complete its work of revising the 1962

Registers of Electors? The Minister a little  while

ago  has  said  that it is because of the  National

Referendum. On this Referendum the Government spent

about  $400,000. Therefore, this cannot be  a  good

reason  for  not having been able to  complete  the

revision  of the Registers. From the facts  we  can

see clearly that the inability to complete the work

is  not  due  to the inefficiency of the  Elections

Office  but  to  the  fact that  the  whole  P.A.P.

Government  intend to delay this work in  order  to

take  advantage of it to benefit themselves in  the

future elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the beginning of 1963 I visited the Elections Commissioner on three occasions regarding

the revision of registers of voters.  He

told  me  that  the work was about to complete  and

that on completion the Government would notify  the

public. At that time, I told him that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1364</b></font><br><br>



according   to   the  Elections   Ordinance   every

political  Party has a right to receive  a  set  of

copies  of  the  Registers of  Voters  for  the  51

constituencies.  On 18th March, on  behalf  of  the

Barisan Sosialis, I wrote a letter to the Elections

Commissioner requesting him to send us quickly  the

whole  set  of the 1962 registers of voters.  After

two  weeks, I received a very short reply from  him

saying  that  the present registers  had  not  been

completed  and that on completion of this  work  he

would be sending to the Barisan Sosialis a complete

set   of  the  registers  of  voters  for  the   51

constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we are very concerned about the

printing  of  the registers of voters, because  the

existence of parliamentary democracy depends on the

registers   of  voters.  It  is  the  backbone   of

parliamentary  democracy.  Without  them,   it   is

impossible  to elect the 51 Members of this  House.

In  other  words,  it  will mean  the  collapse  of

parliamentary democracy. Let us see what the P.A.P.

is  doing today. The Minister for Home Affairs  has

now  come  to this House to legalise their  illegal

act.  The  intention  of  the  Government  is  very

obvious. The Government is trying to exclude  those

who should be included in the Registers by the 15th

of   February,  1963.  By  this  amendment  of  the

Government,  we can see clearly that for  the  1964

general  elections the registers will not be  based

on  the  1963  registers but on the  registers  for

1962.  What  is  the difference? The difference  is

this:  in  1963, there will be at least 40,000  new

citizens  of Singapore who will have the  right  to

vote  in  1964 and to be included in the  registers

for 1964, but after this amending Bill is passed by

the  Government, these 40 000 odd citizens will  be

deprived  of  their  voting  rights.  Why  is   the

Government afraid of an increase in the  number  of

voters?  If  the  Government is really  sincere  in

protecting parliamentary democracy, it should allow

more  citizens to exercise their rights and  duties

to  cast  their  votes. But the Government  is  now

intentionally depriving them of their legal rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, these citizens of 1963 who should have the right to vote were born in 1941 or 1942. These are

young  men who have just  left  school.

According



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1365</b></font><br><br>



to  the  Labour Department Annual  Report  and

according to the census of population. We  can  see

clearly  that the youths who have left  school  are

all   unemployed.  In  1959  during   the   general

elections,  these youths pinned high hopes  on  the

P.A.P. to  solve their unemployment  problem.  But

from  this amending bill of the Government, we  can

see  that,  in  fact, the Government is  unable  to

solve their unemployment problem. That is why these

people are not contented with the P.A.P. I am  sure

that  in  the  1964 general elections these  people

will not vote for the P.A.P. Therefore, in order to

reduce  the  strength  of forces  against  it, the

Government  is  now seeking to pass  this  amending

Bill  in  order  to deprive these people  of  their

voting  rights. This is the first reason to explain

why  the Government is now trying to introduce this

amending Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Government's past actions

are  causing  the people much anxiety, worry,  and

doubt.  If the Government wants this House to  pass

this  Bill,  then, undoubtedly, it will be  telling

the   people   that  the  system  of  parliamentary

democracy  is, in fact, intended for  the  interest

and  purpose of the Party in power and not for  the

interest and welfare of the people. This will  only

give  the  impression to the  people  that  in  the

future  general  elections the Government  will  be

able  to  transfer a group of pro-P.A.P. people  to

certain  constituencies in order to  elect  certain

Members.   That   is  obviously  the   Government's

intention.   If  the  Government's   intention   to

introduce  this  Bill is not  based  on  these  two

motives,   then  I  believe  it  would   not   have

introduced this Bill into this House today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the staff in the Elections Office

are  very  efficient.  But the  Government  is  now

trying  to  put  the blame on them for  not  having

completed the registers earlier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government wants to push through this Bill

on  the strength of its majority, it will only show

the  people  of  Singapore that  it  is  destroying

parliamentary democracy.

<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are

against this Bill, and my colleagues have explained

the reasons why we are against it. They are not  on

political grounds but on legal grounds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister, in moving the Bill, drew

attention  to  section 15 (1)  of  the  Legislative

Assembly  Elections Ordinance. He did say that  the

date  of the revision could be extended beyond 15th

September if the Minister so appoints. But  he  was

rather  quiet, deliberately so; he did not tell  us

why  he did not so appoint when he considered  that

the revision of the electoral registers by the 15th

September  was  not  suitable or  was  not  in  the

interest  of the electorate. Perhaps he  overlooked

it, or perhaps his officers in the Elections Office

overlooked  it.  We do not like to be  uncharitable

and say that perhaps this is a deliberate political

manoeuvre,  but  the Government, of course,  cannot

avoid criticism even on that ground.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the Minister says that it was because of the

Referendum  on 1st September and of the  desire  of

the  Government  not to confuse the electorate  and

because  those  electors who did not  vote  at  the

referendum could have their names deleted, that the

revision did not take place in accordance with  the

law.  If  it  had been his intention not  to  bring

confusion into the minds of the electorate in  that

the  electors  who did not vote at  the  referendum

could  have their names deleted from the  revision,

surely  he could have appointed a date in 1962  for

the  revision.  The Referendum took  place  on  1st

September.  He  could  have chosen  31st  December,

1962,  as  the  date so appointed by  the  Minister

under the law. He was silent, and no doubt he  will

explain now why he was silent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is this opposition on political grounds

because  of the by-election that should have  taken

place  in  Sembawang.  The  late  Inche  Ahmad  bin

Ibrahim   died  in  August  1962,  and  while   the

referendum meetings were going on, this by-election

was  also  the topic of the day. So when the  Prime

Minister  was questioned as to when the by-election

in Sembawang would be held, he said,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1367</b></font><br><br>



"Oh,   after   the   revision  of   the   electoral

registers." Even that answer was given .a few  days

back  to  a question by the Member for Anson:  When

would  the  Government  hold  the  by-election   in

Sembawang? "Oh, after the revision of the electoral

registers." When they knew that there could not  be

any  legal  revision until this  amending  Bill  is

approved by the Assembly, surely the Prime Minister

could  have said - and if there had been no intention

to  play a political game in this thing, "Sorry, it

could have been held as early as March, but because

the  revision  of  the electoral registers  is  all

wrong  in accordance with the law, we cannot do  it

and that is why we have tabled an amending Bill. We

will  have the thing adjusted, and as soon as  that

is  adjusted, we can hold a by-election." But  now,

boldly   he  said,  "Until  the  revision  of   the

electoral registers" when he knew that the revision

of the electoral registers could not be legal until

this amending Bill is passed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even making the referendum as an excuse for

the delay in the revision of the 1962 registers  is

rather  weak.  If  the  Elections  Office  or   the

Registration Officer had taken due note of the  law

and had properly discharged his duty, he would have

set in operation as early as June 1962 the revision

of the 1962 registers in order to get them ready by

the 15th of September. At that time, no doubt there

was  a  lot  of  hot exchanges of  harsh  words  on

merger,  but because the Elections Office was  tied

to  ministerial control, that is why the  Elections

Office  too got confused. That is why I would  like

to  bring  up  again the fact that it is  desirable

that an independent Elections Commission should  be

set  up. I do not urge this on the ground that what

had  been  done before was wrong and that elections

had  been  rigged  and all sorts  of  other  unfair

criticism.  Elections have been done  in  the  best

manner.  No possibility of rigging, everything  was

clean  and  honest. But the fact that the Elections

Officer  or  the Office comes under the control  of

the Executive Government makes people wonder as  to

the   honesty   of   that  particular   department.

Therefore. I would urge upon the Government to give

serious consideration to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1368</b></font><br><br>



setting up an independent Elections Commission.  If

this  Elections  Office  had  been  an  independent

commission, it would have done its duty soberly and

without taking into its calculation the exchange of

political  warfare. It would have just  carried  on

its  work - June, all right. They would have  started

the   thing  going  without  worrying  whether  the

Barisan had been trying to shoot down the P.A.P. or

the  P.A.P. wanted another three months  to  shoot

down  the  Barisan. All that would not  have  taken

place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, a very important point brought up by my

colleague,  the  Member for Farrer Park,  is  this.

Under  the law, the 1963 revision will have  to  be

completed  by  the  15th of September,  or  at  the

latest by the 31st of December, if the Minister  so

appoints.  But  if  it  is  the  intention  of  the

Elections  Office - I  do not say  the  Government - to

have  the  1963 revision completed by the  15th  of

September,  that Office would have  to  begin  work

right  now. And if it has to begin work right  now,

what is the value of legalising this 1962 revision?

It will be just a waste of time, a waste of effort,

and will cause a lot of heartburn. Forget this one.

Leave it. In fact, if the criticism is levelled  at

the  Government that in this way they need not have

to  hold  the by-election in Sembawang, they  could

hold  it on the 1961 electoral registers. If  there

had been no revision in 1962, all right, let us use

the  1961  registers. If there had been accusations

levelled that the Government is doing this now,  in

order  to say, "Well, we want to have the Sembawang

by-election quickly; therefore, we must have it  by

the 30th June," go ahead, we can have a by-election

in  July.  "Without this, there  could  be  no

by-election."  I say they still can. You can  use  the

1961  electoral registers. Let us not  waste  time.

Let us not waste money. Let the Elections Office go

ahead  with  the  1963  revision  because  of   the

imminent general elections in 1964. There should be

no  further delay in the 1963 revision.  I  do  not

know.  I  hope  the  Government will  give  serious

thought to this very important issue. Do not  press

on with something that might turn out to be a legal

problem, as pointed out by the Member for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1369</b></font><br><br>



Farrer Park. Let us say we have the by-election  in

Sembawang  based on these 1962 electoral registers.

What is to prevent any candidate who lost in the

by-election to file a petition on the ground that  the

1962  electoral registers are illegal  and  not  in

accordance  with  the law? I would  urge  upon  the

Government to reconsider its stand on this issue.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Ong Pang Boon, in reply?



<br><br>6.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this is a

temporary  provisions Bill seeking  the  Assembly's

approval to extend the time for the revision of the

registers  of  electors  which  should  have   been

completed in 1962. This Bill was drafted and vetted

by  the State Advocate-General, and so far as I can

see,  the legal aspect of it would have been  taken

care of by the State Advocate-General's Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the 1962 registers could have

been  completed in 1962 but for the two  reasons  I

mentioned  earlier when I moved the Second  Reading

of  the  Bill.  Firstly, it is to avoid  confusion.

Because  it is not possible for the 1962  registers

to  be  completed  and certified in  time  for  the

national referendum, and so the 1961 registers will

have to be used. If we were to exhibit Lists A  and

B for public inspection round about the time of the

referendum,  it  would give rise  to  confusion  on

polling  day, because many of the persons  eligible

to  become voters in 1962 would feel that they were

entitled  to vote during the referendum,  and  they

would  go  to the polling stations, and that  would

create a lot of difficulties for the polling staff.

Therefore,  in order not to confuse the people,  we

decided that the inspection of these Lists A and  B

should be held after the referendum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second reason is that we want to give those

who did not vote in the Referendum a chance to have

their  names restored in the 1962 registers. If  we

proceeded with the certification of the 1962



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1370</b></font><br><br>



registers  after  the Referendum, then  those

non-voters would not have a chance to have their  names

restored   in  the  registers,  because  the   next

revision  would  be in 1963. It is  for  these  two

reasons that we decided that the best thing was  to

defer  the  revision of the registers  until  early

1963  when the list of non-voters could be compiled

and  exhibited  for public inspection,  allowing  a

reasonable period for the non-voters to  apply  for

restoration  of  their names in the registers.  The

lists of non-voters were completed only towards the

end  of January. So it was exhibited for inspection

together with List A and List B.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is provided in the Amendment Bill that the

registers  of electors for the year 1962  shall  be

completed on or before the 30th day of June or such

later   date  in  the  year.  But  I  have  already

indicated  to  the  House just now  that  the  1962

electoral  registers will be certified before  30th

June,  and  I  can  give  an  undertaking  to   the

Opposition  that the 1962 registers, in fact,  will

be certified before June 1962.



<br><br><!-- Tun Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Tun Lim Yew Hock:</b> June 1962?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I am sorry. June 1963. Just now

the  Member for Cairnhill said, why waste  all  the

time  and  effort  on the 1962  registers  when  we

should  proceed  with 1963? 1 wish  to  inform  the

Member  for  Cairnhill that  time  and  effort  has

already been wasted. They are all ready and waiting

for this Bill to be approved before certification.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the revision of the 1963 electoral

registers, I wish to inform the House that work has

already  been set in motion. In fact,  revision  of

the  1963  registers  is  being  carried  out  now,

because  normally  revision  of  registers  in  any

particular year would have to take place from about

the month of March onwards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, with Malaysia, except for the

first  election  to the Central Parliament,  future

elections to the Central Parliament will come under

the  Federal Elections Commission. As far as  State

election is concerned, it is provided in the  White

Paper  that  it will be a State Government  matter.

With our existing machinery of elections and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1371</b></font><br><br>



manner in which elections are carried out, there is

no possibility of any rigging of elections. So I do

not see that it is necessary to have an independent

commission for elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now the Member for Queenstown mentioned that

many  of the non-voters in the 1959 elections,  the

Hong Lim by-election and the Referendum - many of the

non-voters  in these elections - have not  had  their

names  restored in the registers. Now, if the

non-voters refused to take any step to have their names

restored in the electoral registers, what could the

Government  do? It is their right, and they  should

take  some  interest in looking after their  rights

and their own interest.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Choa Chu Kang just now argued that

the   Government  should  withdraw  this  Bill   as

otherwise   the  Government  would  be  guilty   of

destroying  democracy. I just fail to see  how  the

withdrawal  of  this Bill would destroy  democracy.

Does  it  mean that by excluding those  voters  who

would  be  eligible to have their names entered  in

the  1962 registers democracy will be preserved  or

strengthened?  If the Government were  to  withdraw

this  Bill,  it  would  mean  that  those  who  are

eligible  to have their names entered in  the  1962

electoral  registers  would be  deprived  of  their

right as voters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Queenstown has said that he has no

confidence  in  the  elections  conducted  by   the

Government,  and  that he believes  that  elections

were  rigged.  Mr Speaker, Sir, we have  no  doubt

that  the  Member for Queenstown and his colleagues

do  not believe in elections. If they had a chance,

should they be in a position to capture power,  not

only  would there be no elections, but there  would

be  no  parliamentary democracy. In place of  that,

what we would have is dictatorship of the minority.

Naturally  we  have  no doubt  that  they  have  no

confidence in any election.

<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill  he

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of the Bill is straightforward in

that  the  Bill seeks to introduce two new sections

to  enlarge the powers of the special investigators

under   the   existing  Prevention  of   Corruption

Ordinance, 1960. The first provision seeks to give

senior    special    investigators    or    special

investigators    in    the    Corrupt     Practices

Investigation   Bureau  powers  given   to   police

officers under sections 119 and 120 of the Criminal

Procedure Code (Chapter 132). Under these sections,

a police officer making a police investigation may,

by order in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1374</b></font><br><br>



writing,  require the attendance before himself  of

any  person  being within the State who,  from  the

information  given  or  otherwise,  appears  to  be

acquainted with the circumstances of the case under

investigation.  Where  any  such  person  fails  to

attend  as  required, the Magistrate  may  issue  a

warrant  to  secure  his  attendance.  The   police

officer may also examine orally any person supposed

to  be  acquainted with the facts and circumstances

of the case under investigation and shall reduce in

writing  any  statement  made  by  the  person   so

examined; and such person shall be bound  to  state

truly the facts and circumstances of the case  with

which  he was acquainted concerning the case,  save

only  that  he may decline to make, with regard  to

any  fact or circumstance, a statement which has  a

tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a

penalty or forfeiture.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, owing to the lack of sufficient

experienced  civilian senior special  investigators

or   special  investigators,  a  number  of  police

officers   have  been  seconded  to   the   Corrupt

Practices  investigation Bureau as  senior  special

investigators or special investigators, and in  the

course  of their duties with the Bureau, they  have

been  able to conduct investigations by making  use

of  the  powers under sections 119 and 120  of  the

Criminal  Procedure  Code  which  they  possess  as

police officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secondment of police officers to the Corrupt

Practices   Investigation   Bureau,   however,   is

intended  to  be  a  temporary measure,  since  the

intention  is  that eventually the Bureau  will  be

staffed  entirely by civilian officers. There  are,

at  the  moment, ten civilian special investigators

employed in the Bureau. These special investigators

undergo   the   same  training  as   cadet   police

inspectors  and  are  required  to  pass  the  same

prescribed  examinations, but because of  the  fact

that they are not police officers, they do not have

the   powers  of  their  police  colleagues   under

sections 119 and 120 of the Criminal Procedure Code

when  carrying  out investigation work.  In  order,

therefore, to enable them to carry out their duties

more effectively



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1375</b></font><br><br>



and  deal with offences more expeditiously,  it  is

considered  necessary that these  civilian  special

investigators  should be given  similar  powers  to

those possessed by police officers in the course of

investigations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the opportunity has been taken

to   remedy  a  weakness  in  section  20  of   the

Prevention  of Corruption Ordinance.  This  section

provides that whenever it appears to any magistrate

or to the Director of C.P.I.B. upon information and

after  such  inquiry as he thinks  necessary,  that

there  is reasonable cause to believe that  in  any

place there is any document containing evidence  of

the   commission   of   an  offence   relating   to

corruption,  the  magistrate or  the  Director  may

empower a police officer or an investigator of  the

Bureau  to enter such place by force, if necessary,

and  there to search for, seize and detain any such

document. It has been found by experience that, for

the purpose of investigations by the Bureau, it  is

necessary  for  this provision to  be  extended  to

cover also any article or property involved in  the

commission  of  an offence relating to  corruption,

under either the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance

or  sections 161 to 165 or sections 213 to  215  of

the  Penal Code, and the Bill accordingly  includes

an amendment to this effect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have the recommendation of His Excellency the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara to proceed with this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1957, the Commission of Inquiry into the Port

of   Singapore,  whose  report  was  presented   in

Sessional Paper No. S 10 of 1957, made a number  of

recommendations  among which  were  that  a  single

authority  should be set up to be  responsible  for

the  whole port area. Members are aware that at the

moment  the administration of Singapore harbour  is

divided between the Singapore Harbour Board and the

Master Attendant. It is recommended in this Report,

now  better known as the Millbourn Report, that the

Port  Authority  should take  over  the  functions,

staff and premises of the present Singapore Harbour

Board together with certain functions performed  by

the   Marine  Department  and  the  P.W.D.   Marine

Section.  The Commission also recommended  hat  the

docks  and ship repair organisation of the  present

Singapore  Harbour Board should be  separated  from

the   new  Authority  and  become  a  wholly  owned

subsidiary of the Port Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These recommendations have been considered

carefully and it is now proposed that some  of  the

recommendations be adopted for the establishment of

the Port Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duties of the Authority will be to provide and

maintain   adequate  and  efficient   services   in

Singapore  and to promote the use, improvement  and

development  of  the  port.  The  officers  of  the

Authority  will  be responsible for the  regulation

and  control of navigation within the limits of the

port and the provision of pilotage services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as is practicable, the Authority will be

required  to form a private limited company  to  be

known  as  the "Singapore Drydocks and  Engineering

Company, Limited", the shares of which will be held

by  the Authority and the company will take over as

a going concern all the dockyard undertakings which

I   have  earlier  referred  to.  It  will  be  the

responsibility  of  this  Drydock  and  Engineering

Company to develop and extend the business  of  the

dockyard.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1377</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adequate safeguards have been incorporated in the

Bill to protect the terms and conditions of service

of  all the present employees in the Harbour  Board

and  in  the Government who will be transferred  to

the service of the Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Authority will collect and retain port dues

and  pilotage  dues and will expand  these  on  the

maintenance  and  improvement of the  services  and

facilities of the port. No change has been made  to

either port dues or pilotage dues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement to the Bill gives full

details  of  the  operation and  machinery  of  the

Authority's workings. The circumstances under which

the  Authority  will accept full responsibility  as

bailee for cargo, and also that the Authority shall

not  be  liable for loss or damage to  any  sea  or

river  wall, dock or wharf or other property  as  a

result of any dredging which may be carried out  by

the Authority so Icing as such dredging is confined

to  limits  and levels prescribed by the  Authority

with the approval of the Minister, are all provided

for in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the points I have just mentioned, the

Bill is mainly a re-enactment of the provisions  of

the present Ports Ordinance and certain sections of

the Merchant Shipping Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Mammen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Mammen (Telok Blangah):</b> The Port of

Singapore Authority Ordinance, as the Deputy  Prime

Minister has indicated, was initiated in 1957  when

the   Commission  was  appointed  by  the  previous

Government  under  the  chairmanship  of  Sir  Eric

Millbourn.  The majority of the recommendations  in

that  Report, particularly those pertaining to  the

labour  situation in the Harbour  Board,  were  not

acceptable  by  the trade unions in  the  whole  of

Singapore,  and subsequently, in 1960, a Commission

of  Inquiry into the system of contract labour  was

appointed  under the chairmanship  of  Dr  Charles

Gamba.  That  Report  also  made  specific  remarks

regarding the Singapore Harbour



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1378</b></font><br><br>



Board  and  also  the  formation  of  the  Port  of

Singapore Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This formation of the Port of Singapore Authority

will  be  a great advantage in improving  the  port

facilities and also in making improvements  of  the

port's  workings. It also includes the roads  which

are  not under the present Singapore Harbour Board.

The  Singapore rivers are also included. That is  a

very  good  start. We will support it. But  certain

points - I believe this Bill will be going to  Select

Committee - will  have  to he looked  into.  In  this

Bill,  Government employees can be seconded to  the

Harbour  Board  or  the  Port  Authority.  In  that

particular clause, it does not define clearly  what

type  of  employees are going to be transferred  or

seconded  to  the service of the Port of  Singapore

Authority.  If  they are technical staff  or  staff

which  cannot get in the present Singapore  Harbour

Board,  it is worthwhile. But if the Port Authority

considers   that   certain   employees   from   the

Government service are to be seconded to  the  Port

of  Singapore  Authority, then what may  happen  is

this.  These  employees so seconded may  be  placed

above  the existing employees of the Harbour  Board

and  they  may  be  deprived of  their  chances  of

promotion  or  going up. If the Port  of  Singapore

Authority is going to be a statutory body,  and  if

Government employees can be seconded into the  Port

of  Singapore Authority, what we may want is  this.

We should try to bring the Harbour Board employees'

conditions  of  service  and  pay  in   line   with

Government employees, and then it will  be  in  the

departmental  way of transfer and  secondment.  The

Select Committee can look into this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part I want to mention here is in so

far   as   the  present  Harbour  Board   is   only

responsible for the areas controlled by the Harbour

Board,   and  the  "Port  of  Singapore  Authority"

extends  its  function  into  the  Roads.  On  that

particular aspect, we have made recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I quote, Mr Speaker, Sir, from Paper Cmd. 6

of  1960 - Report of the Commission of  Inquiry  into

the System of Contract Labour in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1379</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`As we all know, there are malpractices,

victimisation, abuse and also irregularities in the

employment of labour in the Roads. Everybody  knows

it.  With  a view to clearing that, this Commission

was   appointed  and  submissions  were  made  with

specific  references to that effect.  In  page  68,

paragraph  7  (b)  Drafting  Committee:   "if   the

Government  accepts  the  recommendations  of  this

Commission,   it  should  immediately   appoint   a

Drafting  Committee  of  its  own  representatives,

interested   parties  and  experts   to   draw   up

appropriate  legislation  on  the  lines   of   the

Commission's recommendations."'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recommendations are these, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the Report of the Commission of Inquiry

into  the  System of Contract Labour in  Singapore,

Paper  Cmd.  6  of  1960. The  recommendations  are

these,  Sir.  They  are  on  page  vii  -  Summary   of

Recommendations. This is specifically regarding the

Harbour Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`(1) Establishment of a Port of Singapore

Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) We recommend that there should be established

a single Port of Singapore Authority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) It should have two Labour Departments:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the Dock Labour Department; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the Stevedoring Labour Department (Roads).'



<br><br>When   the   Port   of   Singapore   Authority   is

established, the persons working in the Roads  will

come under the Port of Singapore Authority. If  the

Port  of Singapore Authority is going to be a  mere

clearing  agent for steamers, what  may  happen  is

that   the   same  system  will  prevail  there - the

contract   labour  system    -  and   there   will   be

exploitation of workers, avoiding payment under the

various Ordinances, irregularity of work and so on.

With  that intention, this recommendation has  been

specifically   made,  and,  as  the  Deputy   Prime

Minister  has said, certain parts of the  Millbourn

Report  have  been  included in it.  But  from  the

workers' point of view, the important aspect of  it

has not been included. That is one point, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the First Schedule on page 57 - "The

Emergency Powers of the General Manager of the  new

Port  of Singapore Authority." It seems to me  that

the  powers  given to this new General Manager  are

too high and they need to be looked into.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1380</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I go on to page 49, paragraph 119? This is

powers  of  arrest.  Any  Police  Officer  or   any

employee of the Authority authorised in writing  by

the General Manager generally, or in any particular

place  may arrest any person committing within  his

view,  or  who,  he  has  reason  to  believe,  has

committed   an   offence  punishable   under   this

Ordinance, and so on, if the Port Authority or  the

General  Manager were to give in writing a  warrant

of  arrest. Actually you cannot expect them to give

that power to an ordinary daily-rated employee or a

monthly-rated  employee. Naturally,  the  power  of

arrest  will  be  vested in officers.  We  have  an

efficient  Police  Force in the  Singapore  Harbour

Board which has looked after the Port very well and

they  are doing their duty very well. According  to

this,  we have the Police Force who have the powers

to  arrest  anybody.  Also the  Port  Authority  is

giving Authorisation Letters to its employees  that

may  include Police personnel of officer grade  and

also  civilian  employees who  have  the  power  to

arrest anybody. In other words, an employee - when

I say an employee, I mean a daily-rated employee or

a  monthly-rated  employee - will  have  to  be  very

careful  because, on one side, the Police have  the

powers to arrest, then also there are officers  who

are  authorised by the Port of Singapore Authority,

the Chairman or the General Manager, in writing.  I

think  that  is very unfair to the workers  in  the

Singapore Harbour Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1957, Sir Eric Millbourn recommended the

setting  up  of a Port of Singapore Authority,  and

subsequently Dr Gamba recommended also on the same

lines,  particularly  on the part  of  labour.  The

intention,  at that time and now is, by setting  up

this  Port Authority, one thing we must  do  is  to

improve the Port facilities so that more ships will

come  to  Singapore, and by improving  that,  there

will  be  more employment in the Port of  Singapore

Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir, if you want more efficient work, then by

merely - if  you  will go through the  provisions  of

Schedule No. 2, on page 58, paragraph 3 - "Powers  of

the Authority" ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1381</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`To provide services within the limits of the port

and the approaches to the port ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) in berthing, towing, mooring, moving,

slipping or docking any vessel;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) in loading or discharging any vessel;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) in sorting, weighing, measuring, ...'



<br><br>and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you will read the whole of this thing, there is

not a single clause which has been inserted here to

provide some sort of machinery for the employees of

the  Port  cI Singapore Authority to be dealt  with

for  matters which the Port of Singapore  Authority

may  think,  for hi order to improve the facilities

of  the Port, they have to do this, but it may  not

be  accepted  by  the workers as a whole.  In  that

case,  what the worst probably can happen is, under

the pretext of improvement to the Port of Singapore

Authority, and according to the new constitution or

new Ordinance, they can do many things which may be

detrimental to the interests of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the few points I want to bring to the

notice  of  this House, which, o course the  Select

Committee will look into when the Bill is  referred

to it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> The purpose of this Bill is to

bring  into existence the Singapore Port Authority.

It  is  not so much the purpose of this Bill to  go

into   details  of  the  terms  of  employment   of

employees  of  the  Singapore Port  Authority.  The

terms  of  employment  of any statutory  body  must

necessarily come under the Labour Ordinance.  I  do

not  believe  they should come under the  Ordinance

which governs the existence of the Authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those employees in Government service who probably

may  be  transferred to the Port Authority  perform

functions  quite distinct from those  employees  in

the  Harbour Board. There is no danger  that  there

will be an overlapping or repetition of services on

their  transfer.  The final terms of  transfer,  of

course, must be discussed with the unions, but I do

not think it will be correct to include them in the

Bill, which only



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1382</b></font><br><br>



seeks  to  define the limits within which the  Port

Authority will have jurisdiction, and will formally

bring  into  existence this Port  Authority.  I  am

quite sure that in Select Committee we will be able

to  consider all petitions or memoranda which  will

be submitted for consideration, and I am quite sure

that interested parties will have no hesitation  in

studying   this   Bill   and   giving   us    their

recommendations, and the Select Committee will  act

accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, all I would like to say here is that this

Bill  seeks to bring this Port Authority into being

and  does  not seek to interfere or spell  out  the

conditions  of  service of employees  in  the  Port

Authority.  As I have stated previously, conditions

of service between employers and employees are best

governed  by  the  Labour Ordinance.  It  would  be

invidious  indeed  if  we have different  statutory

bodies having in their respective enactments  terms

and  conditions of their employees. In fact, it  is

not  possible to do so because terms and conditions

vary  from  time to time according to the  economic

conditions of the country. I have only this to say,

Mr Speaker.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have previously mentioned that certain functions

relating to the control of shipping within the Port

will  be transferred from the Marine Department  to

the Port of Singapore Authority upon its formation,

and    therefore   consequential   amendments   are

necessary to the Merchant Shipping Ordinance. These

are  contained  in the Bill now before  the  House.

Full  details  are  contained  in  the  Explanatory

Statement of the Bill, and it will be seen that the

majority of these amendments are of a consequential

nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, I may add that the Bill also seeks

to   repeal  the  section  which  constitutes   the

Seamen's Lodging Houses Licensing Authority, and my

colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs,  will  be

presenting  the necessary consequential  amendments

to the Hotels Ordinance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b>

Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That  the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has already been explained by the Deputy Prime

Minister  in  moving  the  Second  Reading  of  the

Merchant  Shipping  (Amendment)  Bill,  1963,   the

purpose  of  this  Bill is tp make a  consequential

amendment to the Hotels Ordinance, 1954, which will

transfer  the  functions of  the  Seamen's  Lodging

Houses   Licensing  Authority  under  the  Merchant

Shipping  Ordinance to the Hotels  Licensing  Board

under the Hotels Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Merchant Shipping (Amendment) Bill has been

referred  to  Select  Committee,  I  intend  to  do

likewise with this Bill by referring it also  to  a

Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, at present there are five

seamen's  lodging houses licensed by  the  Seamen's

Lodging  Houses  Licensing  Authority,  and   these

lodging  houses  cater for transient  seamen,  i.e.

seamen  who have signed off ships in Singapore  and

who  are  waiting for repatriation to their country

of  origin  or  seamen who have come  from  outside

Singapore and are awaiting the arrival of the  ship

they are to join.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite apart from the fact that the existence of a

separate  authority to license only  five  premises

which were not warranted, it is felt that there  is

no  reason why premises to be used by seamen should

be  of  a  lower standard than that of  the  lowest

standard hotel at present licensed under the Hotels

Ordinance.  It  has  been  ascertained  that  there

should  be  no undue difficulty in connection  with

the five seamen lodging houses being brought up  to

the  minimum  standards required under  the  Hotels

Ordinance.  However,  if for any  reason  the  five

seamen  lodging houses should be unable to come  up

to these living standards, it would be possible for

seamen  to  be  given accommodation  at  the  Asian

Seamen's Club which provides good accommodation and

wholesome food at reasonable rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>7.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Sir,

I  have His Excellency the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

recommendation that the Bill be proceeded  with.  I

beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read a  Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, you will recall that the integration of the

City  Council  into the Central  Government  was  a

major  administrative  reform  undertaken  by   the

P.A.P. Government. The physical integration of  the

City   Council,   other  than  the  three   trading

departments,  has  been  in  progress   since   1st

January,   1961,   by  means   of   the   Financial

Integration  Ordinance.  By  means  of  the  Public

Utilities Ordinance, 1963, which was passed at  the

last  sitting,  the three trading departments  were

incorporated  into a Public Utilities  Board  which

was appointed with effect from 1st May this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These major administrative reforms are in

accordance  with the pledge of the Party  to  bring

about smoother and more efficient public service to

serve  the  people of the State.  In  the  process,

duplication  of  functions  which  previously   had

existed  has been removed, and it is expected  that

in  the  long  run economies would be effected  and

efficiency raised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill before the House is complementary to

the  Public Utilities Ordinance, already mentioned,

and  provides  for the transfer to  the  Government

with  retrospective effect from 1st January,  1961,

of  all assets as well as liabilities and employees

of the City



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1386</b></font><br><br>



Council  and  the  Rural  Board  other  than  those

transferred  to  the Public Utilities  Board.  This

transfer and integration is spelt out in Part I  of

the Bill. It also enacts in Parts II to VII and  IX

all  provisions of the Local Government  Ordinance,

1957, relating to streets, sewerage, public health,

etc. - matters  which hitherto have been  within  the

jurisdiction  of  the City Council  and  the  Rural

Board - and  vests  the various statutory  powers  in

Government officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VIII, which establishes District Offices and

gives  certain powers to District Officers, is  the

only  new  provision  in the  Bill.  The  principal

function  of  District Officers is  to  ensure  the

adequacy  of  various  services  provided  in   the

districts to receive representations, and generally

to  act  as liaison officers in the districts  with

respect    to    matters   coming   within    their

jurisdiction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enactment of this Bill will formally complete

the   Government's  policy  of  integrating   Local

Authorities  into  a central administration.  Since

the  Explanatory Statement gives the objectives and

reasons for the Bill, I shall confine my remarks to

the  personnel and finance aspects of the Bill  and

to  some  of those changes which have been made  to

the  Bill  since it lay on this Table.  The  Select

Committee  deliberating  upon  the  original   Bill

reported back with two amendments -  one to clause  2

and  the other one to clause 12 - as found in columns

543  and  544  in the Select Committee's  published

Report No. 10 of 20th September, 1962.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill provides that all employees of the City

Council  who  are  not transferred  to  the  Public

Utilities Board shall be transferred to the service

of  the  Government at the same rate of pay  or  as

near  as  may be the same conditions of service  as

those  on  which  they were employed  by  the  City

Council.  Upon  the coming into operation  of  this

Ordinance,   these  employees  will  become   civil

servants and will be legally governed by Government

regulations and by the Constitution. But it is  our

intention,  in  so far as salaries  are  concerned,

that   all   serving  officers  on  the   permanent

establishment of the City Council shall be allowed,

if they so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1387</b></font><br><br>



choose,  to  retain  their  existing  salaries  and

salary  scales on their transfer to the  Government

service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to other terms and conditions of

service,  it  is  hoped, in consultation  with  the

Staff  Unions concerned, to bring about  a  set  of

conditions of service that would be acceptable  and

which   would  be  patterned  on  the   terms   and

conditions  now  applicable  to  Government   civil

servants.  It  is  expected  that  in  the  process

certain  minor  adjustments  and  changes  may   be

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of representation from Staff Unions to

the  Select Committee, a Board of Inquiry has  been

set up by the Minister for Labour under section  70

of  the  Industrial Relations Ordinance  under  the

chairmanship  of Mr Eu Cheow Chye. This  Board  of

Inquiry  held  its first session on  1st  February,

1963, and to date has held 14 sessions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides that persons transferred

from  the  City Council who are already members  of

the  Municipal  Provident  Fund  will  continue  in

membership of that Fund. In addition, such  persons

who  are eligible for membership of the Fund at the

time  of  transfer to the Government  service  will

retain that eligibility if they so choose. Officers

of  the  City  Council who are not members  of  the

Municipal  Provident  Fund  nor  are  eligible  for

membership thereof will be governed by the Pensions

and  Central  Provident Fund  Ordinances  in  every

respect   as  they  are  applicable  to  Government

servants.  Persons appointed after the coming  into

force of this Bill will, of course, be governed  by

the  Pensions  Ordinance and the Central  Provident

Fund  Ordinance.  The management of  the  Municipal

Provident   Fund   will  be  transferred   to   the

Government   together  with  all  its  assets   and

liabilities, and the accounts thereof will be  kept

by   the   Accountant-General.   The   assets   and

liabilities connected with the public loans of  the

City  Council, including the sinking fund for these

loans,   are  to  be  transferred  to  the   Public

Utilities   Board   under  the   Public   Utilities

Ordinance,  but the Government will  contribute  to

the   Board   in  respect  of  those  portions   of

outstanding public loans which were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1388</b></font><br><br>



used  to  buy  assets  to  be  transferred  to  the

Government under this Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there have been both in Select Committee and

as  a  result  of subsequent deliberations  by  the

Government itself various changes and amendments to

the  original draft. I do not propose to deal  with

these  amendments here in extenso because it is  my

intention  that  this  Bill should  be  once  again

committed to Select Committee for consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will recollect, Mr Speaker, Sir, that when

the   original   Bill  was  committed   to   Select

Committee, one of the curious things that  happened

was  the almost complete absence of representations

from  the public to the Select Committee. I do hope

that on this second occasion members of the public,

persons,  organisations and associations, who  will

be  affected by the provisions of this  Bill,  will

make their views felt before the Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill will involve the Government in

extra  financial  expenditure  in  the  payment  of

salaries  and operational expenses in various  City

Council  departments integrated with those  of  the

Government. These expenses were formerly chargeable

to   the   Municipal  Consolidated  Fund  and   the

Municipal  Provident Fund. These amounts cannot  at

present  be fully ascertained but will be dependent

on  the  services  to be provided  and  improvement

works to be carried out by the Government under the

Ordinance.    However,   this    extra    financial

expenditure is, in reality, not so, for in previous

years  these  services had been borne by  the  City

Council and the Rural Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's hope that when the

administrative  machinery of integration  is  fully

implemented there should be, over a period, overall

savings  to  Government, in that  additional  costs

from  duplication of functions and  services  would

have been reduced, if not eliminated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> There is one point that arises out of

that  resolution; The Report of the previous Select

Committee on the Local Government Integration  Bill

and  four  other Bills may come in useful  for  the

incoming  Select Committee. If the Minister  thinks

that  that is so, then it is necessary for  him  to

move  a  motion  to refer this Report  to  the  new

Select  Committee.  The motion  can  be  moved  now

without notice. The motion would be,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Report of the Select Committee on the

Public  Utilities,  Local  Government  Integration,

Planning  (Amendment),  Pensions  (Amendment),  and

Housing and Development (Amendment) Bills presented

the   Select  Committee  on  the  Local  Government

<div align="center"><b>PLANNING (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>7.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I have His Excellency the

Yang  di-Pertuan Negara's recommendation  that  the

Bill  be  proceeded with, and I beg to move,  "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill seeks to amend the Planning Ordinance,

1959,  on  account of the integration of  the  City

Council with the Government and is solely concerned

with  staffing.  Members will recall  that  on  the

abolition  of  the Singapore Improvement  Trust  in

February 1960, about 89 employees of the Trust were

transferred  to  the  Planning  Department  in  the

Singapore  Government  and  the  remainder  to  the

Housing and Development Board. The employees of the

Trust   who   were  transferred  to  the   Planning

Department were members of the staff engaged in the

planning  functions of the Trust. Their  terms  and

conditions    of    service,    including     their

superannuation, were governed by the same rules  as

applied  to employees of the City Council.  It  has

been  the  intention that the staff of  the  Trust,

transferred  to  the Planning Department,  and  the

employees  of  the City Council  who  will  not  be

transferred  to the Government as a consequence  of

the  integration, should enjoy the same  terms  and

conditions of transfer and superannuation. In order

that these former employees of the Trust would also

enjoy  similar  superannuation  benefits  as  those

applicable to employees of the City Council who are

about  to  be  transferred to the Government  as  a

result of integration, it is necessary to amend the

Planning



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1391</b></font><br><br>



Ordinance to provide for identical provisions  with

those contained in the Local Government Integration

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extension of the benefits of the Government's

pension  scheme  to former Trust employees  in  the

Planning Department will involve the Government  in

some  small  expenditure.  In  a  few  cases  these

persons  will  find  that  the  benefits   of   the

Government's Pensions Scheme are greater than those

to  which  they  were entitled  in  their  previous

employment with the Trust. May I mention here, Sir,

that  these persons will find-as a result of  their

own  calculations  which may not be  mathematically

and objectively correct, but it is a fact that when

people do make decisions on these matters-that  the

attraction  of  larger  sums of  immediate  payment

weighs  more  heavily  upon  them  than  continuous

payment  of smaller prospective sums over a  longer

period.  So  when  I say that they  will  find  the

benefits   greater  than  the  Government  Pensions

Scheme  I  am not at all stating that that  is  the

actuarial  position  but  the  position  as   these

persons  themselves assess. It is, therefore,  most

probable that in these few cases they would  choose

the  benefits  of the Government's Pension  Scheme.

The  exact  cost cannot be ascertained until  their

final retirement, but in all probability there will

only  be  a few cases, and it is unlikely that  the

additional cost will be very large.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Committal to Select Committee?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> No. Committee stage.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Committee stage now? I was under the

impression that this has some connection  with  the

Local  Government Integration Bill. I do  not  know

whether  the Minister wishes to take this  Bill  to

Committee  now or refer it to the Select  Committee

which has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1392</b></font><br><br>



appointed  in connection with the Local  Government

Integration  Bill. There is no note  on  the  Order

Paper  that  the intention was to take this  matter

through  Committee stage, but, of course, there  is

nothing  to prevent the Minister from changing  his

mind.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, my inclination is not to

refer  this Bill and other related Bills to  Select

Committee,  because  you will  recollect  that  the

Planning (Amendment) Bill, the Pensions (Amendment)

Bill  and  the Housing and Development  (Amendment)

Bill  relate solely to certain staffing and pension

matters.   These   points  had   been   fully   and

satisfactorily  dealt with in the  previous  Select

Committee whose recommendations have been  accepted

and  embodied in this Bill. Therefore, I  think  no

advantage would be gained by referring these  three

Bills  to Select Committee. It is of some advantage

for   the   Government   to   get   on   with   the

implementation of the provisions of  this  amending

Bill.  And, as I have said, these matters had  been

referred  to Select Committee and the representors,

i.e.  The unions who made representations  in  that

Select  Committee,  had  received  satisfaction.  I

therefore move that -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The other reason why I mention this

matter is that there is no indication on the  Order

Paper  that  these  three Bills  are  to  be  taken

through Committee Stage and Third Reading. But,  as

I  have  said,  there  is nothing  to  prevent  the

Minister from changing his mind.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I merely

want  to  point out a difficulty suffered  by  some

officers in case the Minister has not realised  it.

I  know  this is nothing new that the Minister  has

invented. This comes from the old Ordinance. But it

does say here in paragraph (d) (ii):



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`except upon the condition that he shall first pay

to the Government the total amount paid by the

Government and any of the authorities mentioned in

Part II of the said schedule to any of the said

the Planning (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> I have the wrong Bill!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>7.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Pensions Ordinance,

1956,   to  provide  for  the  pensions  and  other

retirement benefits of persons transferred  to  the

service  of  the Government from the City  Council,

the  Singapore Improvement Trust and the  Tan  Tock

Seng's Hospital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The superannuation schemes to which they belonged

prior  to  the transfer generally allowed  them  to

continue  membership  in their respective  schemes.

They  could  also  count on  their  service  before

transfer as service



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1394</b></font><br><br>



reckonable   for   pension   on   their    eventual

retirement.  As matters stand, such a person  would

be  eligible on his retirement to benefits  on  his

own  superannuation  scheme as well  as  retirement

benefits under the Government Pensions Scheme. This

is   clearly   contrary   to   the   principle   of

superannuation.  It  is, therefore,  necessary  for

provision   to   be   made  to   enable   employees

transferred  from the City Council, the  Trust  and

the  Tan  Tock Seng's Hospital to choose to receive

benefits    either   from   their   own    previous

superannuation   schemes   or   those   under   the

Government pensions scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the aspect of death benefits. The

Government pensions scheme requires payment  of  at

least  one  year's salary in the form  of  a  death

gratuity  to  dependants of a deceased officer.  On

their  transfer  to the service of the  Government,

employees  of the City Council, the Trust  and  the

Tan   Tock   Seng's   Hospital  become   Government

officers, and their dependants would be entitled to

a  death gratuity of one year's salary should  they

die  in  harness. The existing provisions  for  the

payment  of  a  death gratuity  do  not  take  into

consideration death benefits to which a transferred

person may be eligible under his own superannuation

scheme.  If this situation is allowed to  continue,

then  transferred persons would be better off  than

Government  servants  who only  have  the  pensions

scheme  to  rely on for benefits. For this  reason,

provision Ms been made in the Bill for the  quantum

of  death  gratuity  payable under  the  Government

pensions  scheme  to be reduced to  the  extent  of

contributions paid to the superannuation scheme  to

which a transferred person belonged by his previous

employ in Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Dr Goh Keng Swee].

<br><br>7.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> There are four clauses - clauses 1 to 4. Which clause does the Member for Mountbatten

wish to speak on? Clause 2?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng</b> indicated assent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 2 stand part of

the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have

said,  this is merely to point out an anomaly which

will exist. This clause requires an officer to  pay

Government's share of whatever Government has  paid

into the Central Provident Fund before he gets  his

gratuity and pension. What I want to point  out  is

this.  Especially in the case of women, this  would

affect  them  more,  because  women  retire  at  an

earlier  age.  Now, Miss A and Miss B are  working.

Miss B has been in Government service for 20 years.

Miss  A  has been in the City Council or a  similar

organisation for 20 years and has been paying to  a

certain  fund,  the  C.P.F. or  whatever  retiring

benefits fund it is. This would also apply to women

in  regard  to  the transition into the  equal  pay

scheme. That is why I felt that this phrase here is

so  broad that it is necessary to bring it  up.  In

that  case, the one who has done 20 years'  service

where  she has paid towards another fund,  but  not

the  pensionable one and has become pensionable  in

the last 10 years of the service, when she retires,

she  will  have to pay back Government's  share  of

that  fund,  let us say, for argument's  sake,  the

C.P.F.  If  she has contributed $20,000, Government

has  contributed $20,000 and when she  retires  she

has  to  make good Government's $20,000 before  she

can  become  pensionable, before she  can  get  her

gratuity  and  her pension. The $40,000  is  frozen

until  she is 55. She can draw it. Not only is  her

own $20,000 which has been paid frozen until she is

55,  but Out of her gratuity that she gets, she has

to pay Government's share of $20,000 and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1396</b></font><br><br>



freeze that money if she retires at 45. She has the

double sum of money frozen till she is 55. That  is

why  I felt that since this clause of having to pay

back  the Government's share before one can  become

pensionable or draw a gratuity will affect not only

this  but  also  other schemes  where  there  is  a

transition  from  a temporary or  from  a  gratuity

scheme  to a pensionable scheme, I thought I  would

draw  Government's attention to  the  anomaly  that

will   be   discriminating  against  those   people

entering the pensionable scheme at a later stage of

their service.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> I think the Member for

Mountbatten  was  really raising a point  connected

with  equal pay for women. So far as these  persons

are  concerned,  they have their  choice.  If  they

think    opting   into   Government    scheme    is

disadvantageous, they stay on the previous scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have got the point, which is this. Let

us  say, we take Miss A. Because she is married  or

for other reasons, she has been contributing to the

Central Provident Fund, say for 10 years. Then  the

benevolent   P.A.P.   Government   comes   in   and

introduces  equal  pay.  So  she  goes  on  to  the

permanent establishment and qualifies for  pension.

Then  the  Member  for Mountbatten  says  when  she

retires, the Government's contribution for these 10

years  has got to be refunded to the Government.  I

mean that is fair enough because we are giving her,

in  this instance, credit for 10 years' service  in

the  Government. If she does not want to refund  to

the  Government,  she can, but  she  will  lose  10

years'  service. On a simple calculation, the  gain

to  the officer will be so tremendous that I cannot

imagine anyone not agreeing to this proposal to opt

fully   into   the   Government  Pensions   Scheme.

Apparently the Member for Mountbatten thinks that I

misunderstood her. If so, I am willing to give  her

a hearing.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> No, Mr Speaker, it does not

apply  to  equal  pay alone. In this  too,  as  the

Minister  has said, the officer has the option.  He

can  choose. But it is Hobson's choice.  They  want

the pension because it is a better



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1397</b></font><br><br>



scheme.  I  am not talking about paying back.  Yes,

they do not want Government's share and their share

and  the pension. Nobody would expect that. But the

fact that if she has to pay back Government's share

into  the C.P.F. -  she does not draw it. She has  to

wait  till  10 years or whatever it is,  until  she

reaches the age of 55, before she can draw it.  And

if she retires at 45, she has to wait for ten years

to  get her previous contribution plus Government's

contribution, which she has to refund.  Instead  of

getting  her  own money back when she retires,  she

has  to add on to what she has already paid another

sum  equivalent  to what she has  already  paid  on

retirement.  So  instead of getting  money  on  her

retirement she pays out money on her retirement!



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, I am advised by my

colleague,  the Minister for Health and  Law,  that

where a woman officer retires at the age of 45, the

Central  Provident Fund will be willing to pay  the

accumulated contribution. That is what I have  been

advised.



<br><br><!-- Mrs Seow Peck Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Seow Peck Leng:</b> Sir, if this is a new

regulation,  I  do not know. But I can  assure  the

Minister that when I retired I was faced with  that

difficulty. So I felt that no women in  future  who

retire should be faced with the same difficulty.  I

was  lucky enough that after two years or after  so

many  years,  I applied to say that  there  was  no

likelihood of my going hack to work, and  they  did

give me special concession. But in ordinary cases a

woman will have to wait till 55 years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Housing and

Development  Ordinance, 1959, so as to bring  about

uniformity of provisions relating to superannuation

of  staff  between that Ordinance  and  the  Public

Utilities Ordinance. The latter contains provisions

for  the  appointment  of trustees  in  respect  of

moneys  payable on the death of an employee of  the

Board out of any superannuation scheme to which  he

belonged.  There is also provision  in  the  Public

Utilities   Ordinance  for  the   safeguarding   of

benefits  under  the Municipal  Provident  Fund  of

employees  of the Singapore Improvement  Trust  who

have   been   transferred  to   the   Housing   and

Development Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving the Second Reading of the Planning

(Amendment)  Bill, I have explained  the  necessity

for parallel provisions in legislation relating  to

superannuation and terms and conditions of  service

of employees of the Trust who have been transferred

to  the  Housing  and  Development  Board  and  the

Planning  Department,  and  of  the  City   Council

employees   who   will   be  transferred   to   the

Government. That explanation holds good here. If  I

may  reiterate, it is that Trust employees were  on

terms   and   conditions  of   service,   including

superannuation,  identical  with  those   of   City

Council   employees.  It  will  not  be  equitable,

therefore,  to provide varying terms and conditions

of  service and superannuation on their transfer to

the  Housing and Development Board and the Planning

Department.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>MOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE</b></div>



<br><br>7.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, this motion*

was  supposed  to  have been debated  in  April - two

months ago.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will the Member move the motion?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House expresses no confidence in the

People's  Action  Party  Government  for  its

pro-colonial policies.*



<hr size="2" noshade>

*The same motion also stood in the name of Mr Low Por Tuck.

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that this motion was supposed to have been

debated  two  months  ago. But because  the  P.A.P.

feared  exposure and defeat, unjustifiable  excuses

were put forth to guillotine the debate. The debate

on the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech was cut down

to  one and a half days, and my two motions on  the

February  arrests and on the inhuman  and  barbaric

treatment   of  detainees,  matters   of   national

importance, Sir, were not given an opportunity  for

a full and frank debate. After an all-night debate,

hardly  anything of my six-hour speech appeared  in

the  newspapers  the following  morning.  This,  of

course,  is  what  the P.A.P. had  wanted  and  had

planned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this delay, like the guillotine motions of

the  past, is a clear case of abuse of power of the

Government, cutting short our Assembly  debates  on

matters  of national importance in order  to  allow

the Prime Minister to go and play golf. This is the

parliamentary  democracy  that  we  have.   Fascist

dictatorship in fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, heavy sacrifices in blood and toil in the

past  have brought to the people but limited  gains

in  our  struggle for our freedom. But  even  these

limited gains are now in danger of being taken away

from us by the P.A.P. which today is playing a most

reactionary  role  -  all for the  benefit  of  the

P.A.P.'s  colonial masters in Britain.  The  P.A.P.

Ministers today regard British troops as troops  of

their own. They forget that British troops are here

not  to  protect  the  people of  this  region  but

British  vested  interests. And the Special  Branch

similarly looks after



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1400</b></font><br><br>



only imperial vested interests. Yet the P.A.P. now

relies more and more on the Special Branch to  rule

the  country. Agents provocateurs are  employed  to

create  incidents so as to allow the Government  an

opportunity to crush political opponents. There  is

a  complete denial of the very fundamental freedoms

of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night I mentioned to you that when our legal

adviser,  Mr T. T. Rajah, and I were  arrested  by

the  P.A.P., we were denied the basic rights of all

individuals    who    are   placed    in    similar

circumstances. Even the vilest criminal accused  of

the  most horrible crime, when arrested, is allowed

the  basic  right to contact his lawyer and  inform

his  family or next-of-kin. But this right  is  not

for  us  in the Barisan Sosialis today. The  P.A.P.

treats  us  worse than the worst of  criminals.  On

that particular occasion we were denied the use  of

the  telephone to inform our legal adviser and  our

families until well past midnight.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. It is just for clarification.

The motion is,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House expresses no confidence in the

People's  Action  Party  Government  for  its

pro-colonial policies.



<br><br>I  take  it  that  the  Member for  Queens-town  is

alleging  that bad treatment of prisoners  detained

is pro-colonial policy?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No, Sir. But as an introduction

I wish to inform the House that this is the type of

democracy  and  freedom of the individual  that  we

have  in Singapore today. This is the direct result

of   the   pro-colonial  policy   of   the   P.A.P.

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democracy is dead and it has been killed by the

pro-colonial P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Yet

you can talk here!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Prime Minister has said

that  the  one-man-one vote system is a tragedy  in

the  context of Singapore. To us, Sir, the

one-man-one-vote  system  is our only hope against  Fascist

dictatorship. At least with this system  the  voice

of   the   people   can  still   find,   expression

periodically against



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1401</b></font><br><br>



Fascist dictatorship. But, of course, to the  Prime

Minister it is a tragedy. Why? Because he cannot do

away  with it and immediately become a dictator  in

Singapore. Sir, in order to gain mass support,  the

Prime  Minister  has postured as a  Leftist  and  a

democrat, and therefore as an anti-colonialist. But

he  has been unmasked and he now openly adopts  all

the colonialist and imperialist tactics in order to

impose a Fascist dictatorship on the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the last Confidence motion in this House in

July  1962,  much  has happened in Singapore  which

clearly  shows  that  under the  P.A.P.  Government

there  is  a  rapid  strangulation  and  death   of

democracy  in  Singapore.  You  will  remember  the

passing  of the National Referendum Bill which  was

designed  to  deny  the people of  Singapore  their

democratic  right  of dissent.  The  injustice  and

dishonesty of the undemocratic Bill so aroused  the

antagonism of the people in Singapore that protests

against the Bill came from political Parties, trade

unions,  journalists,  universities,  cultural  and

other    civic   organisations,   and   progressive

individuals.  Then  came  the  unprecedented  scare

propaganda  campaign  of the P.A.P.  Government  in

which  the  people of Singapore were  compelled  by

threats and intimidation of loss of citizenship and

other  civic  rights, into voting  for  the  P.A.P.

White  Paper  merger proposals in  the  referendum.

This   has   given  the  British  and  the   P.A.P.

Governments  a chance to deceive the outside  world

with the untruth that there is majority support for

Malaysia in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came rapid developments in the Borneo

territories  with vehement opposition to  the

neo-colonialist  Malaysia  erupting  into  the   Brunei

uprising and guerilla warfare today in the  jungles

of  Brunei,  Sarawak, and even Sabah. In Singapore,

in  spite of attempts to crush the Barisan Sosialis

and  to  intimidate those who support  the  Barisan

Sosialis,  opposition to Malaysia still grows  with

more  and  more people rallying round  the  Barisan

Sosialis in opposition to the imperialist Malaysia,

a   Malaysia  that  is  designed  to  prolong   and

perpetuate colonial domination over all  of  us  in

South-East Asia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1402</b></font><br><br>



And  because  of the fear and growing strength  and

influence  of socialist and progressive  forces  in

the  region,  the  colonialists, their  agents  and

their stooges, have extended repressive actions  to

arrests  and detention without charge or  trial  of

anti-colonial  stalwarts  in  the  Federation,   in

Sarawak and recently in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the whole of Singapore, Malaya, South-East

Asia,  and  the  world  have condemned  the  cruel,

barbaric and inhuman treatment of detainees by  the

imperialist stooges in the P.A.P. There can  be  no

shadow of doubt as to the true nature of the P.A.P.

Government today. Their Ministers no longer pretend

to   be  anti-colonial.  They  openly  support  and

promote  pro-colonial schemes and plots to  enslave

the people.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr Mammen) in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>7.59 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They take pride and even responsibility in asking

for  more troops to suppress the people. They  plan

not  to help the masses but to serve their colonial

masters. They think for their colonial masters  and

they  make excuses for their colonial masters. They

take  pride in being stooges and puppets  of  their

imperial  masters, and they hope  thus  to  salvage

their own personal political future.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. Ministers have clean forgotten their

election pledges to the people. They spout only

pro-colonial and pro-imperialist mouthings these  days,

and    the    policies   of    the    P.A.P. are

indistinguishable from the policies of  the  S.P.A.

That  is  why the S.P.A. today supports the  P.A.P.

The Member for Cairnhill and his colleagues prop up

the  Prime  Minister  and his  other  Ministers  in

office  today because the Prime Minister follows  a

pro-colonial policy, lithe Barisan Sosialis were in

the  position  of  the P.A.P. today,  that  is  the

Government, the S.P.A. would have no hesitation,  I

am  sure,  in  bringing  the Government  down.  The

P.A.P. does  not depend on the working  class  for

support  but on the compradores and representatives

of big



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1403</b></font><br><br>



businesses,  both  foreign  and  local,  and  other

reactionary elements for support.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. today solicits support from the very

same  reactionary elements that the Prime  Minister

used  to despise and ridicule only not so very long

ago.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture of the Prime Minister hugging the

Member  for  Farrer Park in the Straits  Times  two

months  ago  tells us graphically where the  P.A.P.

stands today ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> That is a technical offence.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- not with the anti-colonial

Left, but with the pro-colonial Right.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministers have changed their once-upon-a-time anti-colonial P.A.P. - that is, the genuine P.A.P. of old - into a

fervently pro-colonial  front  and puppet organisation of Whitehall.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We understand that we want to finish our debate

early  tonight, and I do not intend  to  weary  you

with  a whole series of examples of broken promises

and  pro-colonial  policies of the  P.A.P.  I  have

already touched very lightly on some. More  can  be

found on every page of the Hansard and in the Press

since our break with the P.A.P., and for some  time

even  before that. For example, it is quite obvious

that the promotion of television and the programmes

in  Radio  Singapore serve only party and sectional

interests  and the interests of foreign capitalists

and the colonial powers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent Budget debate of the last few days

tells  us  exactly  where the  P.A.P. stands.  The

P.A.P. has  also  done  nothing  to  prevent   the

attempts  of  Western  films  and  literature  from

promoting propaganda for the colonialists and  from

undermining   the  development  of   the   national

aspirations  of  the vast majority of  the  people.

Neither has the P.A.P. done anything to prevent the

undermining of the morals of our youth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You went to a striptease dance.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Similarly, in the matter of

education, the whole trend of the P.A.P. policy  is

not to give equal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1404</b></font><br><br>



treatment  to  the four streams of education.  Very

little  has  been  done for the national  language;

very  little has been done for the Tamil  language.

The number of students attending Chinese schools is

dwindling  and  the  Nanyang  University   question

remains unsettled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aims of the P.A.P. policy, in fact, are to

anglicise the whole population of Singapore and  so

to   strengthen  the  colonial  influence  in   the

country, paving the way to a cultural subversion by

Western films, newspapers and so-called literature.

I  will not go into great details, Sir, but I  wish

briefly  to summarise some of the main pro-colonial

policies of the P.A.P. as follows:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, the merger negotiations. It helps to divide

and   rule  the  people.  It  helps  only   British

interests. The financial negotiations have revealed

enough that Singapore has been sold lock, stock and

barrel  to  the  Federation. All  this,  Sir,  only

profits  ultimately the colonial power  that  rules

the whole area from behind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two, their active support and promotion of the

British-sponsored Malaysia Plan. This is  the  most

obvious  example, Sir. The whole world  knows  that

Malaysia  is a neo-colonialist plan. The  President

of  the  Philippines, the President of Indonesia  -

the closest neighbours of Malaya and Singapore - have

condemned  Malaysia  as  neo-colonialism.  Yet  the

P.A.P. Government glorifies Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three, their suppression of the fundamental rights

and freedoms of speech and publication, association

and  assembly.  The P.A.P. abuses State  power  for

private  and sectional interests. I do not need  to

give  many  examples. Just one or two - the  S.A.T.U.

conference was banned; a convention was also banned

last year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four, their frequent and unjustifiable attempts to

divide the people by deliberate rousing of communal

sentiments and fears on national issues. One of the

most  blatant  examples  is  the  Prime  Minister's

constant  harping  on  the communal  arithmetic  of

Malaysia.   Recently,  he  talked  of  a  Singapore

electing   only  a  Chinese  leader  to  head   the

Singapore  Government and the  Federation  electing

only a Malay to head the Federation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1405</b></font><br><br>



Government.  Yet, not so very long ago  the  P.A.P.

had  been telling the people that Malay Assemblymen

were   elected  in  predominantly  Chinese   areas.

Another example, Sir, is the way the Prime Minister

threatened the Chinese in British North Borneo into

supporting Malaysia following the Brunei uprising.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 5. Their use of the police and troops against

the  workers and the deliberate division of workers

and   non-implementation  of   their   promise   of

unification of the trade union movement. They  talk

of  industrial peace with justice. But, of  course,

whenever they talk of justice, they talk of justice

only  to  the  employers and the imperial  masters.

They  never  talk  of justice to the  workers.  The

Finance  Minister  has said that  Hong  Kong  is  a

successful  industrial State  because  the  workers

there  have no unions. From this, you can see  what

the Minister for Finance has in mind concerning the

reunification of the trade union movement  and  the

unions of the workers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 6. The P.A.P. support of the Internal Security

Council  in the arbitrary arrests and detention  of

anti-colonial stalwarts. Everybody knows  that  the

I.S.C. is an imperialist organ, an instrument  for

the  imperial  power  to  suppress  the  hopes  and

aspirations of the people in the region. Yet we see

the P.A.P. Government fully supporting the Internal

Security  Council  in  arresting  people  who   are

fighting for the interests of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 7. Their denial and revocation of citizenship

rights  and  the  threatened  banishment  of

anti-colonial stalwarts. We have a sorry spectacle of  a

Government that was elected by the people now going

completely against the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those of us who have obtained our citizenship

after such difficulties are now in great danger  of

losing that citizenship. The funny thing about  the

so-called national Government of Singapore is  that

even  Malay nationals, born in the Federation,  are

having their citizenship taken away from them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 8. Their suppression of national education and

the promotion of Western



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1406</b></font><br><br>



education. I do not need to enlarge on this because

we have had a good debate on it only last night and

it  is  quite  clear  that  the  P.A.P.  Government

intends  to  anglicise  the educational  policy  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 9. The P.A.P. is not pursuing a policy of

helping  local  businessmen and  industrialists  to

develop    a   national   industry.   The    P.A.P.

concentrates on promoting the interests of external

imperialist  businessmen  like  those  from  Japan,

Australia and other imperialist countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 10. They are doing nothing to prevent the

Naval  Base from being used for the suppression  of

the nationalist and popular liberation movement  in

Brunei and Kalimantan Utara. It is recognised  that

the   Brunei  uprising  is  a  national  liberation

uprising, and yet the P.A.P. Government wants  this

liberation  movement  to  be  suppressed  and  does

nothing  whatsoever  to prevent  the  British  from

using  the Naval Base in Singapore as a lumping-off

ground   in  its  suppression  of  the  nationalist

uprising.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 11. The P.A.P.'s active co-operation with the

Special Branch and the Internal Security Council to

suppress  the  legitimate hopes and aspirations  of

the  people.  This  is especially blame-worthy  and

deplorable when the P.A.P. uses and employs foreign

nationals  to  suppress the  people  of  Singapore.

People  like Thomson, Blades, Ahmad Khan,  Corridon

are  not citizens of Singapore. They serve only the

interests  of  people outside  Singapore.  Yet  the

P.A.P. today  uses these people  to  suppress  the

hones and aspirations of the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. 12. Their use of Commissions of Inquiries to

frighten  and  intimidate  people  opposed  to  the

P.A.P. for selfish cods. I do not think I need  go

further ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You have your own myth.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You will probably realise that

the  PAP, is very fond of Commissions of Inquiries

in  order to serve the interests of the P.A.P. and

their masters.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1407</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Serve the interest of truth.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> No. 13. Active co-operation

with  the colonial Press and the giving of  special

commendations  and even medals to  pro-colonialists

and pro-imperialists.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You will not get a medal, I am

sure.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> These are some of the main

items of the pro-colonial policies of the P.A.P.  I

shall leave other material to be touched on by some

of my colleagues.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let the P.A.P. remember this. The P.A.P.

celebrated   National  Day  two  weeks   ago,   but

Singapore  is  still  a  colony.  National  Day  in

Singapore  serves  to remind the  people  of  toast

sacrifices in blood and toil in order that they may

have   today  limited  self-government.  But   more

important,  National  Day reminds  us  of  the  yet

uncompleted  tasks ahead. The tasks  ahead  in  the

anti-colonial struggle. This struggle must lead  us

to  complete independence and to the restoration of

all  our  basic and fundamental democratic  rights.

Only  then will the people have the opportunity  to

go one step further in the struggle towards freedom

in  order that they may solve the basic problems of

poverty, disease, ignorance and want, and towards a

society with no exploitation of man by man.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. was elected to office in 1959 on an

anti-colonial policy. The object then was  to  lead

the people to genuine independence and freedom. But

for selfish interests, the P A.P. Ministers now try

to retard the progress of the people in their march

towards  freedom. In so doing, the P.A.P. Ministers

ally   themselves   with   the   imperialist    and

colonialists  and  pursue pro-colonial  policies  I

have just outlined.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, therefore, move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this House expresses no confidence in the

People's  Action  Party  Government  for  its

pro-colonial polices.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1408</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>8.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Por Tuck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Por Tuck (Havelock):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise to second the motion standing in  the

name of the Member for Queenstown and myself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much has been said about the pro-colonial policies

of  the  P.A.P. Government. I would like to stress

only one or two points. The P.A.P. came to power on

an  anti-colonial platform, but the  P.A.P.'s

pro-colonial  policies  during  their  short  four-year

reign  have exposed their deceit of the people  and

have  openly  shown their tolerance, adulation  and

support  of  colonial polices. On the  other  hand,

their  support for all anti-colonial struggles  has

been next to nil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of making use of the country's surpluses

to   solve  our  problem  of  unemployment  and  to

industrialise  our country, the P  A.P.  Government

has  followed  in  the footsteps  of  the  previous

colonial   Government  by  investing  millions   of

dollars  abroad, especially in the  United  Kingdom

During  the  general elections in 1959, the  P.A.P.

promised  the people of Singapore that  they  would

recall  all local capital invested abroad  for  the

industrialisation of the country.  But  since  they

came  to  power,  more  and  more  money  has  been

invested  abroad, nearly twice the amount in  three

years,  and these large sums of money which  should

have  been  used for the benefit of the  people  of

Singapore are being used to provide employment  for

the benefit of other people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. have never come out in the open to give

wholehearted  and  sincere support  for  any

anti-colonial  struggle.  Most  Afro-Asian  leaders  and

political Parties condemn the apartheld policies of

the  Verwoerd Government in South Africa.  To  show

their disapproval of this apartheid policy, many of

them, including the Federation of Malaya, imposed a

boycott  on South African products. But the  P.A.P.

Government  which profess to be anti-colonial  have

not  done  anything of the sort. Their  silence  on

this issue could only mean support and tolerance of

the  racial  and colonial policies of the  Verwoerd

Government.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1409</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the struggle of the Indonesian people to

liberate  West Irian, the P.A.P. as a ruling  Party

failed  to  show any vigorous support. It  was  the

Barisan  Sosialis who organised the people to  show

their support for their brothers and neighbours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Brunei revolution broke out, the P.A.P.

openly  condemned  it,  just  as  the  British  had

condemned it and sent troops to suppress it. But in

the   eyes   of   the  Afro-Asian  countries,   the

revolution  was  a  national  revolution  aimed  at

ending   British  colonialism.  The  P.A.P. stand

condemned  in the eyes of the Afro-Asian countries.

This  could not be better illustrated than by  what

had happened to their delegation at the Third

Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference at Moshi recently  when

the P A.P. delegates had the door of the Conference

slammed in their faces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a semi-colonial country with no control in

foreign  affairs, even then the P.A.P. as  a  local

political Party can come out and show their support

for  anti-colonialism. But the P.A.P. dare  not  do

so,  for they arc entirely dependent on the British

Government for their survival. They depend  on  the

British  for aid, especially military aid,  in  the

form   of  troops,  to  wipe  out  their  political

opponents.  This is best illustrated  by  the  fact

that  the Prime Minister has, during a world  tour,

stopped at London to ask the British Government  to

finance another battalion in the Singapore Military

Force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known that the Malaysia Plan is not

originated from the Tunku.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>8.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has only been made use of by the British to

bring  out  this  Plan. It is  a  British-sponsored

plan,  a plan by which the British hope to withdraw

from political control of the territories of Borneo

and Singapore, leaving them in the "safe" hands  of

their stooges, thus maintaining their economic  and

military  interests  in this region.  This  is  the

usual  design  in  the grand tradition  of  British

colonialism.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1410</b></font><br><br>



The British only let the Tunku announce the plan to

allay  suspicion. The Prime Minister of  Singapore,

in  fact, who knew of this plan before, instead  of

opposing  it  as  a  true anti-colonialist  should,

welcomed  it  as  a  means of saving  himself  from

political  bankruptcy.  He  thought  that   through

Malaysia   he   could  deceive  the  people   about

achieving  merger with the Federation, an objective

advocacy by every political Party in Singapore. He,

therefore,  came out in full support of  the  plan.

The  P.A.P. who  call themselves anti-colonialists

now   become  purveyors  of  non-colonialism.   The

British  now have, therefore, in Singapore and  the

Federation,  two stooges to carry out  their  grand

plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I sit down, I would like to stress another

point  which  is  quite important in  parliamentary

practice, as the P.A.P. have always pretended to he

the  protector of the parliamentary system.  I  was

told  that if in the House of Parliament or in  the

Assembly,  whenever  there  is  a  motion   of   no

confidence, the Government, if they have  guts,  if

they  are  serious, and if they have confidence  in

themselves,  should push aside all matters  on  the

Order Paper and debate the motion of no confidence.

But  instead  the  P.A.P.  Government  decided   to

postpone  this motion which we have tabled  at  the

last  sitting and forced us to have it  debated  at

today's  sitting.  Even then  our  motion  was  not

debated  first but was left till the  end  of  this

sitting.  If the P.A.P. Government and  the  P.A.P.

Front  benches  are  really the protectors  of  the

parliamentary  system, and if they  have  guts  and

confidence in themselves, they should have  debated

our motion first instead of now.



<br><br>8.33 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think there is

a  saying that those whom the gods wish to  destroy

they first make mad. The Barisan Sosialis have been

repeating themselves so often that we on this  side

are   often  constrained  to  repeat  our   counter

arguments. Perhaps it would be best to start off by

asking what they mean by anti-colonialism. That  is

the  essence  of the motion, that we are  following

pro-colonial policies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1411</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand anti-colonialism, its purpose is

to  get  rid  of  foreign  rule,  foreign  control,

political  or  otherwise. The method  by  which  we

intended to get rid of colonialism was laid out  in

the  fixed  political objectives of the Party,  the

policy statement by the Central Executive Committee

of  the People's Action Party in 1960, contained in

the book, The Battle for Merger, a statement issued

before  the  election and signed  by  every  P.A.P.

Assemblyman.  It  indicated  how  to  get  rid   of

colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we made it quite clear that fighting to get

rid  of  colonialism did not mean fighting  for  an

independent Singapore. It was made quite clear that

we   said  that  an  independent  Singapore,   once

established, cannot lead to merger by  consent.  If

merger  ever  came, it would be by the conquest  of

one  by  the  other. For an independent  Singapore,

once established, even for an interim period, would

create a situation whereby vested interests with  a

Chinese  appeal  would become  permanent.  If  once

independence were achieved in this island city,  75

per  cent  of  whose  population  is  Chinese,  the

logical  consequence would be  that  those  Chinese

chauvinist  sentiments which are at  present  being

muted and slowly dissolved because of the objective

of  independence through merger, would  openly  and

aggressively  come  to  the  fore.  Therefore,  the

objective was independence through merger, and that

was  the basis of our anti-colonial struggle signed

by everyone of the Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was 1959, four years ago. I think exactly 77

days  from  today, we will be getting  merger.  The

gentlemen over there will get into trouble on  31st

August.  But  we  have  fulfilled  our  mandate  of

securing independence through merger. Can they  say

that  we have not kept faith with our anti-colonial

policy,  the major platform of our election promise

signed by all the Barisan Sosialis Assemblymen?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a pro-colonialist? A pro-colonialist is

one  who  wants  to  sell the  country  to  outside

forces, who has to rely on outside forces. I  would

like  to convince you, within this short period  of

time - I do not want to take up too



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1412</b></font><br><br>



much  time - that it is the Barisan Sosialis and  the

Communists   who   are  today  following   a

pro-colonialist  policy. You will remember,  Sir,  that

when  the  question  of merger was  sprung  on  the

Communists, what did they do? It was revealed  here

that  the  first person they ran to was the  United

Kingdom Commissioner in order to make a deal.

Pro-colonialists? Anti-colonialists running to the U.K.

Commission to have tea. They were led up the garden

path into taking a dangerous and disastrous course,

which they did. Anti-colonialists never tried to do

a  deal with the U.K. Commissioner. What was  their

deal?  We  said  independence  through  merger.  By

getting  merger we, in Singapore, will become  part

of  a  national Government which will have  control

over  foreign affairs and defence. We have internal

self-government; now we want control  over  foreign

affairs  and  defence. What was the deal  that  the

Communists  in the Barisan Sosialis put forward  to

the  British? They said, "Please give  us  internal

self-government  in  return  for  which  you,   the

British,  can keep control of defence  and  foreign

affairs." Who are the pro-colonialists? Who are the

anti-colonialists?  I can tell  you,  Sir,  it  was

sometime  in  August last year, I think,  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis sent a delegation to  the  United

Nations  to  try to interest the Russians  and  the

Poles  to  take up their cause. The Prime  Minister

was  there. When their representation was made, the

Russians and the Poles thought the Barisan Sosialis

were  Communists.  They took a  firm  anti-colonial

stand.  The Prime Minister said. "Yes, but  do  you

know  the  Barisan's  stand is against  merger,  as

proposed  by  us,  and  that they  will  allow  the

British  to  keen defence and the  Naval  Base  and

foreign    affairs?"   The   Russians    were    so

flabbergasted. They thought the Prime Minister  was

putting  on  a  fable. So they asked Mr  Woodhull,

"Surely,  Mr  Woodhull,  that  is  not  so?"   Mr

Woodhull said, "Well, I have no authority  to  make

any  statement on that point." "But is it  so?"  He

said.  "Yes,  at the moment." He had  already  said

that  under  their arrangements the  British  bases

would be retained. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1413</b></font><br><br>



British  could  have control over their  bases  and

over foreign affairs and defence. Pro-colonialists?

Who   are  the  pro-colonialists?  After  that  the

Russians and the Polish delegates decided  to  call

the whole thing off. They were so embarrassed. Here

were  Communists  coming  before  other  Communists

taking what appeared to be an active anti-colonial

line,  but  which in fact turned out to be  a

pro-colonial line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, Sir, we have fulfilled our

mandate. The political objective, which, as I  have

said,   was  signed  by  them  also,  is   to   get

independence through merger. In 77 more  days  that

mandate will be carried out to the hilt. And  these

gentlemen first went to the U.K. Commission to do a

deal!  They even embarrassed the Russians  and  the

Poles!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, in the issue of the Plebeian Express No.

6, ten cents, published by the Barisan Sosialis - I

believe the Petir is a bit more expensive. But this

is  ten  cents; and what is it? Here  they  try  to

prove - "Malaysia on 31st August???"  Three  question

marks.  They  try to convince here, and  demoralise

and  rather frighten their followers that  Malaysia

will  not  come about. Why? Because they  have  the

people  behind them? No. They give the reasons  why

Malaysia will not come about. Perhaps, Sir,  it  is

better to quote. "First, a lot of difficulties  for

the Tunku." The Tunku is not a foreigner. He is one

of  us. He is a Malayan, a Malaysian. But they  are

not  referring to the Tunku, "First, that  guerilla

warfare  is  spreading in the Borneo  territories."

Who  is  spreading guerilla warfare'? Mr  Azahari.

Where is Mr Azahari?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> In Indonesia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> In Indonesia. Mr Azahari is

carrying  on propaganda to say "Save Malaysia  from

the  Chinese." How to save it? Break  up  Malaysia!

Those are the allies of the Barisan Sosialis, their

friends, the men who are going to save and  destroy

Malaysia.  Mr  Azahari, who is in  Indonesia,  now

says, "We must oppose Malaysia to save it from  the

Chinese." Kalimantan Utara Radio



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1414</b></font><br><br>



broadcasts  it  every day. Pro-colonialists?

Anti-colonialists?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, what is the other alternative? What are

the  other  reasons why they believe that  Malaysia

will  not  come about? They say, "It is because  of

the  sham  referendum." 70 per cent of  the  people

voted  for  it. Is it a sham? They know  that  they

cannot rely on the people of Singapore te break  up

Malaysia.  So,  therefore, they  have  to  rely  on

Brunei. Azahari? That also fizzled out. Today  they

say,  perhaps  it is not Azahari - this gentleman  is

now  a  little bit as desperate as the  Member  for

Queenstown - but  because there  are  other  reasons.

What  is  the  greatest of the other  reasons?  The

greatest  is that a strong and vehement  opposition

has   come   from  Malaya's  immediate   neighbour,

Indonesia,   and   Malaya's   ASA   partner,    the

Philippines.  Great anti-colonialists, nationalists

now  saying, "We cannot get the people of Singapore

to  oppose Malaysia. But this is all right, friends

and  comrades.  Indonesia and the Philippines  will

help  break up Malaysia." 70 per cent of the people

voted  for Malaysia, but the Barisan Sosialis,  the

great   anti-colonialists,  say,  "Do  not   worry;

Indonesia and the Philippines will help us to break

up Malaya." Anti-colonialists? Pro-colonialists?  I

say.  Sir, that a pro-colonialist is one who  sells

his  country to foreigners and outside forces.  Who

are the pro-colonialists?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Barisan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Further, they say "Malaysia will

not  come  about???" Three question marks. "Because

it   will   mean   the   intensification   of   the

confrontation policy with a greater flare-up in the

fighting  in  the Borneo territories." That  simply

means  that foreign forces are going to invade  the

Borneo  territories and we will  be  saved  by  the

Barisan  Sosialis, the great anti-colonialists.  We

will be saved not by the people of Malaysia, but by

people from outside. Again I ask you, Sir, who  are

the   anti-colonial's  and   who   are   the

pro-colonialists? People who sell out the country,  who

depend on foreign forces, who tell the British that

they are prepared to give them their foreign bases,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1415</b></font><br><br>



ask them to keep their defence and foreign affairs.

They are the colonialists ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Fifth columnists.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I would suggest that Members

on  the  Government side do not interject. I  think

Members  of  the Opposition side have  not  so  far

interjected.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, that is bad enough. At least

they can say that it is in the spirit of Afro-Asia.

But  the  Member for Queenstown has new  allies  to

help  break up Malaysia. Not in Afro-Asia.  Because

he  goes  on to say, "Britain too ---", page 4.  This

was  all written before recent events. This was 7th

June,   1963.   "Britain   too   recognises   these

difficulties    and    the   Under-Secretary    for

Commonwealth  Relations, Sir  Saville  Garner,  was

concerned  about  the attitude of  Indonesia,  and,

therefore, tells the British that if they go  ahead

with this, they are going to get into trouble."  In

other  words, they now hope that even  the  British

will come to their aid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you will remember, Sir, that a few months ago

the   Member  for  Queenstown,  having   lost   the

referendum,  when 70 per cent of the  people  voted

for  merger and Malaysia, said, "Better get rid  of

Bung. Let me go and enlist new friends." So he said

he  was  going to visit Afro-Asia. But he  went  to

London - the  heart of colonialism - to enlist  support

from  amongst M.P.s. And we know three M.P.s turned

up.  These three M.P.s came at his request, though,

as  you know, Sir, when they came, the first  thing

they   said  was,  "We  are  coming  here  at   the

invitation of the Prime Minister." But, in fact,  I

did  suggest  to the Finance Minister that  if  the

Member  for Queenstown kept on insisting  that  the

three M.P.s came at his request, he should send all

the  bills  to him. But, I think, since  the  M.P.s

said  that they were coming here at the request  of

the Prime Minister ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Who is paying the bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The interesting thing is that even

if   the  three  M.P.s  had  come  at  the  express

invitation of the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1416</b></font><br><br>



for  Queenstown, his treatment of the three  M.P.s.

his  three  guests, was even more  deplorable.  You

will  remember  - in the newspapers, he  invited  the

three  M.P.s  to go to the Happy World rally.  They

always  go to the Happy World because they  are  so

depressed  that that is the only place  where  they

think they can feel a certain amount of elation  at

what  is  going to happen. They invited  the  three

M.P.s  and  insisted that they should  speak.  They

refused  to  speak,  and then they  went  off.  The

Member  for Queenstown then got up and made a  long

speech  in  which he denounced the three M.P.s  Who

had  invited their guests, Sir? They invited  them.

The M.P s did not want to go to their meeting. They

said,  "We  have  not  come here  to  address  mass

meetings,  having addressed bigger meetings."  They

made their case and they went away. So he denounced

them.  He said, "The three M.P.s were Labour M.P.s.

The  Labour  Party  is a Party of  monopoly  vested

interests." Then three paragraphs later there is  a

new  trend in the argument. He said, "On the  other

hand,  the Barisan Sosialis had a big reception  at

the Airport, one of the biggest receptions." So  it

all  boils  down  to  this.  The  Barisan  Sosialis

organised  a big reception at the Airport  to  meet

three Labour M.P.s who were the representatives  of

monopoly  capitalism.  How silly  can  the  Barisan

Sosialis  get,  that they should now  confess  that

here  is  an  anti-colonial  Party  inviting  three

Labour M.P.s from the heart of colonialism to  help

break  up  Malaysia, and, at the  same  time,  they

organised   a   reception  for  what  amounted   to

representatives of monopoly capitalism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why. Sir, I earlier prefaced my remarks by

saying  some  epithet about the  Barisan  Sosialis,

that  those  whom  the gods wish to  destroy,  they

first  make  mad. And this is madness, Sir.  First,

anti-colonialists  who  rely  on  foreign   forces,

ending  up  with British monopoly vested interests;

representatives  of  monopoly vested  interests  to

help  them  out of their predicament. Anyway,  Sir,

now they have come to this point. You will remember

these great pro-colonialists. There is no doubt



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1417</b></font><br><br>



about  it.  We  are the real anti-colonialists.  We

said  we would get you independence through  merger

in  77  days - in 77 days that will come about. These

people  originally  said that  they  supported  the

concept  of Malaysia - on the record, the concept  of

Malaysia. But now, in the Barisan Sosialis Plebeian

Express  on  the  15th May, they  say,  "We  oppose

Malaysia irrespective of whether it is the plan  or

the concept." Here, they repeatedly kept on saying,

"Oh,  we accept the concept of Malaysia. We  oppose

the plan."



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Read it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, it is in the Plebeian

Express.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Read it, read it!



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> "No to Malaysia. We oppose

Malaysia irrespective of whether it is the plan or

the concept. We oppose Malaysia and we do not want

Malaysia."



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Read on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> "It may be asked, do we object to

smaller territories?" Now, I do not want to repeat

your propaganda here.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> "That the Borneo territories will

have self-determination." But you say now that  you

oppose the Malaysia concept just as you signed  the

pledge ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Everybody is getting excited

now.   I  have  said  nothing  about  the  Malaysia

concept. The Minister should now address the Chair,

and  perhaps if he holds his glasses in  his  right

hand,  he  will  not be pointing  so  much  at  the

Opposition side.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I would not risk

my glasses by holding them in my right hand, having

regard  to the microphone here. I will just try  to

control my hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have come, I think, to what is really the last

chapter in the history



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1418</b></font><br><br>



of  the  Barisan Sosialis. You will have noticed  a

rather significant news item which appeared  a  few

days  ago. There was a united front of the Workers'

Party,  the  Barisan Sosialis, the U.D.P.  But  you

will  have read that the Workers' Party has  pulled

out.   Why?  Because  they  know  that  by  tagging

themselves on to the united front, they  are  going

to  get into real trouble. So, like rats which know

how  to desert a sinking ship, they have pulled out

first.  They have even better reasons for believing

that  these are condemned men who have  got  a  few

more  days - 77 days; tomorrow it wi11  be  76  days.

Sir,  they  have  now  placed all  their  hopes  on

foreign   socialists - Indonesia,  the   Philippines,

British     M.P.s.     even    British     colonial

administrators - to  help  them  out.   They   cannot

mobilise the people to help them out, but  we  have

had  news from Manila. They have been putting their

faith, their last hope, on confrontation But now we

know  that  whatever happens, both the  Philippines

President  and  the  President  of  Indonesia  have

considered that Malaysia is not neo-colonial.  Sir,

if   you   will  read  the  communique    - not   the

speculative part which gave buoyant hope, increased

their  optimism  the  day  before  yesterday   (but

yesterday   I   noticed   they   looke4    slightly

depressed) - in today's paper, what does it say?  The

communique, the relevant part ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Straits Times?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Straits Times of 12th June,

1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The Ministers in the context of their close and

brotherly association, succeeded in reaching common

understanding  and  complete agreement  on  how  to

resolve problems of common concern arising  out  of

the   proposal   to  establish  a   Federation   of

Malaysia.'



<br><br>Nobody   reaches  common  agreement  to   establish

something  which  he  believes to  be  neo-colonial

because whatever he might say President Soekarno is

no neo-colonialist.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Provided?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> There is nothing; provided what?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'In the same brotherly spirit the three Ministers discussed

the Phillippines claim to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1419</b></font><br><br>



North  Borneo and arrived at a common understanding...'.



<br><br>At  a  common  understanding,  not  what  you  were

expecting, Sir. Sorry, Sir, not you, the Communists

expected:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`and agreement and how this problem should be

resolved justly and expeditiously.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is quite clear, Sir, now they are hanging

on  to  half  straws. Yesterday, or the day  before

yesterday, they were clinging on to a straw.  Today

it is half a straw. But I think in a couple of days

they  will have to swim on their own and since they

do  not know how to swim, you know what the outcome

will  be.  But  this is inevitable when  tenderfoot

Communists, wolf cubs, girl guides of the Communist

movement try to launch out on their own. Sir,  they

issued  a  statement the day after this  communique

came  out. We only read the speculative part. As  a

newspaperman,  I know every newspaperman  wants  to

give  a  sensational  twist  to  a  rather  prosaic

communique. Of course, the speculations  - they  were

talking about a referendum even in Singapore,  Sir,

and  they  were getting a bit elated,  and  on  the

basis   of  that  they  went  and  issued  a  silly

statement  supporting the accord which was  reached

in  Manila. I think the statement was issued on the

following  day,  13th June. But if  they  had  only

restrained themselves and not launched out on their

own, they would have got the right line first. They

praised  the Manila Agreement. I have a translation

here. It appeared in the Chinese Press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We are thankful to the Foreign Ministers (that

is,  Tun  Razak too, Sir) conference in Manila  for

paving the way for a summit meeting of the heads of

Indonesia,  the Philippines and Malaya.  This  will

undoubtedly  reduce tension and  help  bring  about

stability and peace in South East Asia ...'.

<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Aidit - the man for whom they

have  great  respect and who can decide their  fate

the  Indonesian Communists complained yesterday (he

was  not praising, thankful or welcoming) that  the

lacked the spirit

of  anti-imperialism. It is a warning to them  that

this  is  not in the spirit of welcoming something.

It is not in the sprit of anti-imperialism, because

it  did  not contain enough of the anti-imperialist

and the Bandoeng principles'



<br><br>Sir,  I  think  this  was the  last  issue  of  the

Plebeian  which came out on the 7th of June  and  I

have  no  doubt  that the next issue  will  contain

another  somersault  in  denouncing  the  talks  at

Manila.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> It does not matter, because I say

there  are  only  77  more  days.  This  issue  was

probably concocted before June the 14th.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I have no doubt that just as they

supported the Malaysia concept - in fact, the  Member

for  Thomson  went even further; you will  remember

that  he  supported  the Malaysia  concept  but  he

wanted Indonesia to be the heartland - but, as I have

already said, they do not even support the Malaysia

concept but all that they want is Indonesia as  the

heartland. So now Indonesia has deserted them. They

have  no  friends. The Workers' Party has  deserted

them;  some  of their ghost-writers have  left  the

scene.  So there are 14 gentlemen who do  not  know

how  to swim, and there are 77 days more before we,

as  we  have  promised,  finish  our  anti-colonial

battle.  As we have said, the nature of  the

anti-colonial  battle  is  to get  independence  through

merger, and  I am quite sure that the ten  million

people of Malaysia will rejoice in exactly 77 days.

Malaysia  will come. We still have the  neon  light

service for all: a flash with the words "As sure as

the sun rises."

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Chan Sun Wing - just a few words.



<br><br>9.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing (Upper Serangoon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker. Sir, I will leave it to our  Chairman

to rebut the balderdash uttered by the Minister for

Culture.  I  will  now  only speak  on  some  other

aspects.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out to the Party in power

that  they have deviated from their original

anti-colonialist  stand,  because in  one  of  the  past

P.A.P.'s  declarations, they said that the  economy

of  Malaya existed only for British interests. They

also  said  at  the same time that under  the  then

economic  system  the thought of getting  political

power  through constitutional reform was  something

of  a  deception, that the various reforms  carried

out  in  Malaya  after the war by the  colonialists

were  all  meant  to consolidate the  interests  of

British  colonialists  and  that  before  achieving

political  freedom it was impossible to change  the

then economic system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, according to the past P.A.P.'s

declaration,  it  was  necessary  to   change   the

economic  structure first. You  will  remember  the

other  day  in this House, I criticised the  P.A.P.

policy.  When  I insisted on changing the  economic

structure at the time when I was in the P.A.P., the

Minister  for  Finance  accused  me  of   being   a

Communist. From this, you can clearly see that  the

P.A.P. have  deviated  from their  original

anti-colonial stand to their present pro-colonial stand.

Further in February 1959, the then Chairman of  the

P.A.P.,  in a Hong Lim mass rally, said that  there

were three forces existing. The first force was the

banking compradore class, the second force was  the

British and American imperialists, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1422</b></font><br><br>



the  third  force was the Ministers such  as  Inche

Johari of the Federation. Now, this was uttered  by

the   P.A.P. before  they  came  to  power.   They

described  the  then  situation  as  one   of   the

existence  of  three  forces. At  present,  we  are

witnessing the P.A.P. competing with the M.C.A. of

Malaya  for the role of compradores. They no longer

criticise the British and the Americans because the

U.K., the U.S.A. and all Western countries are  now

praising the P.A.P.'s new approach as wise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Prime Minister has, on a few

occasions,  attacked  a  certain  Minister  of  the

Federation,  yet he has been playing  golf  in  the

Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I sit down, I would also like to point out

that we Barisan Assemblymen left the P A.P. in 1961

mainly  because  we saw through the P.A.P.'s  stand

which   was   pro-colonialist.  In  January   1962,

sometime  before the referendum was held, not  only

we  in the Barisan Sosialis knew that the P.A.P was

pro-colonialist but that the political Parties from

the   five   territories  which  held  a  socialist

conference  in Kuala Lumpur knew it  too.  At  that

conference  the  P.A.P. was  expelled   from   the

socialist camp. After the national referendum ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I did have great hopes that at

last   parliamentary  practice  was  going  to   be

practised  in this Assembly, and I was informed  of

the  speakers  who  were going  to  speak  on  this

matter.  Now,  the  Member for Upper  Serangoon  is

raising new issues which will probably have  to  be

replied to by the Government side. As I have  said,

I  had  great  hopes that at last we are  knuckling

down  to  really  good  parliamentary  practice.  I

wonder  whether  the  Member  for  Upper  Serangoon

realises  that  what  he  has  said  about  certain

parties   not  practising  parliamentary  democracy

might very well apply to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chan Sun Wing continued speaking in Mandarin.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I did not get that. Will the Member

please repeat what he has said?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1423</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Just now, I said

that  I do not agree with the last sentence of your

ruling.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. If the Member does not agree

with  my  ruling, then I think he  had  better  sit

down. That is my ruling.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I am

not  challenging your ruling, because the last part

of your sentence said that I had not been complying

with democratic parliamentary practice.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The opinion of the Speaker is

that   the  Member  for  Upper  Serangoon  is   not

complying   .with   parliamentary   practice.   The

information that was given to the Speaker was  that

there  were  going  to  be two  speakers  from  the

Barisan  side and one from the Government. That  is

the   information.  If  that  cannot  be  honoured,

parliamentary practice cannot be honoured.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): This is because

my  Party  has not informed me of this  undertaking

and,  in  the meantime, I have already informed  my

Party that my speech will be very short. So if  Mr

Speaker  did  not  stop me I  think  I  might  have

already finished my speech.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member is being very

disrespectful, and if he continues in that strain I

will  ask him to stop. He must apologise for  being

disrespectful.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Well, due to some

misunderstanding, I am quite prepared to  apologise

if you think it is necessary.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Speaker does think it is

necessary,  and  if the Member for Upper  Serangoon

does  not apologise without any frills, I will  ask

him  to  stop speaking or I will take action  under

Standing Orders.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): From what I have

said, one can see that since we have understood the

deviation of the P.A.P. from the original stand ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I still have not got apologies

without any frills. I want that apology without any

frills.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1424</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Sun Wing -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Sun Wing</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, my

apologies. Mr Speaker, just now I have pointed out

that  understanding  the change  of  stand  of  the

P.A.P. from  one of anti-colonial to one  of

pro-colonial  and the change of being a true  Party  to

that   of   a   colonial  puppet,  and  after   the

referendum,  their position is precarious.  We  can

see  now that the moving of this motion by us  will

not  bring down the Party in power, but I  believe,

in  spite  of  this,  this  motion  should  receive

support from the other Opposition Parties. At least

we can understand their attitude on this motion.



<br><br>9.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr Lee Khoon Choy)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  the  the Member for Upper Serangoon  says

that  the  P.A.P. Government has not  honoured  the

manifesto  of the P.A.P. I believe he is trying  to

make use of this opportunity to deceive the people.

The  declaration in the manifesto was made in 1954.

I  would like him to refer to the manifesto of 1958

before  the  general election. It is  entitled  Our

Role and Policy after Self-Government. I would like

to quote just a small paragraph:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`The basic aim of the party was brought up four

years  ago  in 1954 on 1st July when a  declaration

was  made  on the policies and aims of  the  P.A.P.

During  these  four  years  there  hive  been  some

changes  in  the  history, of Malaya.  Three  years

after 1954 the Federation of Malaya in 1957 on 31st

August  became  an  independent nation,  while  the

people  in Singapore were still separated from  the

people  of  Malaya  and such  separation  was  even

advocated.  In fact, Singapore not even  part  of

the  Federation  of  Malaya, and  Singapore  itself

could  not  possibly become independent.  It  could

only achieve self-government in the following year,

and  so  to review our position and to explain  our

policies  and aims the time has come for us  to  do

all these things!'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like him to refer to this paragraph again.

Sir,  before he stood for the election, he endorsed

our  aims  and policies. What he read was outdated.

He  was repeating something which was outdated. Now

we have already changed.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Parliamentary Secretary

has developed the habit of the Minister for Culture

of pointing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1425</b></font><br><br>



across the Chamber. He must not do that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I do not wish

to  take too much time on this. All I want to do is

to remind the Member and those people who have sold

out  the  P.A.P. and who are now  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis  of their knowledge of our new  policy  as

expounded. So they should not mention anything that

was  made  previous to this new change  of  policy.

Policy  must  change according to  the  context  of

society  and history. If they are really  gentlemen

and honourable, then they must admit that they were

elected  on  a P.A.P. ticket and so, by  right,  if

they  want  to reserve their seats in  this  House,

they   should  go  out  from  this  House  to   the

electorate ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I think that is completely

irrelevant.  That  is inciting a  debate  from  the

opposite  side. Perhaps he could wind up  now.  Mr

Parliamentary Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I was just

pointing out to the Member for Upper Serangoon that

he  was trying to make use of our past manifesto to

deceive the people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Dr Lee, in reply.



<br><br>9.21 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I agree with

what the Minister for Culture has said, "Those whom

the gods would destroy, they first make mad."



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> At least, he admits now.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Because it is quite obvious to

all of us that the Minister for Finance ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> The Minister for Culture.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister for - yes, the

Minister for Finance too, I think -



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1426</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister for Culture plus

his ex-Parliamentary Secretary are getting mad ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> Who is mad?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- standing up in this Assembly

and  pointing their fingers across the  Floor.  Are

they not mad?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> You have a funny look in your eye.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have already indicated to

the   Member  for  Queenstown  that  if   he   asks

questions,  he  will probably get an answer  across

the   Floor.  Perhaps  if  he  tries  not  to   ask

rhetorical  questions, we could  get  on  with  the

debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Khoon Choy:</b> He wants to go to Yio Chu

Kang.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Because he is asking: what is

anti-colonial? And then, according to him, it is to

get  rid of foreign rule. Yes, we agree that it  is

to  get  rid  of  foreign rule. But it  is  foreign

domination in many aspects. They keep on  repeating

the  slogan  of independence through  merger.  They

also say independence through Malaysia. But one  of

the  most pro-Malaysia politicians in Sarawak today

has   come  out  and  said  that  this  slogan   of

independence through Malaysia is a myth. Sir, we in

this House have debated ad nauseam and explained to

all the Ministers how the so-called merger will not

give  the  people  of Singapore  independence.  The

Member for Upper Serangoon has already informed the

House  that  the  P.A.P. has such a bad  reputation

amongst  genuine  anti-colonialists  that  it   was

driven  out  of the socialist conference  in  Kua1a

Lumpur in January 1961 and was debarred from  entry

to the conference at Moshi, Tanganyika, in spite of

all  the sponsoring by friendly governments  hoping

to   smuggle   the  P.A.P. candidates   into   the

conference.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the Member for Havelock, has also

mentioned  the fact that the P A.P. Prime  Minister

went to England to ask for money for troops. Troops

for what? Are these troops to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1427</b></font><br><br>



fight the British? To borrow money from the British

to fight the British? Do they recognise that we are

still  a colony? Are the Ministers opposite trying

to  tell  us that the British are willing  to  lend

money  to  the P.A.P. in order to kick the  British

out  of  Singapore? This is a new and funny way  of

fighting  against colonialism. Today our troops  in

Singapore  are  not trained to fight  the  external

enemy.  They  cannot fight against Indonesia;  they

cannot  fight  against  the Philippines;  and  they

cannot  fight against anybody outside.  The  troops

are  only  good  for suppressing the people  inside

Singapore  in their struggle for freedom and  their

democratic rights. That is all that the  troops  in

Singapore  are  good for. Is this what  the  troops

meant  to do? These troops definitely are not meant

to  fight against the colonial masters. Our troops,

in  fact,  are only trained to surround  blocks  of

buildings and to prevent people from getting in and

out. The troops are also ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Are you trying to get in or

trying to get out?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- used to suppress strikers and

to  act as blacklegs in the breaking of strikes. At

one  time  when  the daily-rated  workers  went  on

strike,  our troops were used as blacklegs and  the

whole exercise to get dust bins emptied and streets

cleaned,  was  more  in the manner  of  a  military

operation. That is how our troops are being used in

Singapore today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance talks very much about bases. I have here the text of a speech by the Prime Minister,

Mr Lee Kuan Yew, on National  Day ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> On a point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Point of clarification.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Point of clarification. Will the

Member give way?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> resumed his seat.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Member for

Queenstown had better



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1428</b></font><br><br>



look  after himself. He keeps on confusing me with

the Minister for Finance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Off beam!



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think what the Minister means is

that the Member for Queenstown is referring to  the

Minister  for Culture as the Minister for  Finance.

This  is the second time he has done that. Once  he

nearly got into trouble, I think.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> He has already got into

trouble.

<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is the Minister for Culture.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> But I am now referring to the

Prime  Minister. [Laughter] Maybe he thinks  he  is

going to change himself into the Prime Minister.  I

am  not  sure  whether  the  Minister  for  Finance

intends to take his place, because I ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member for Queenstown did

say  the Minister for Finance, and he was going  to

refer  to  that pamphlet. Do I understand now  that

that pamphlet refers to the Prime Minister and  not

the   Minster  for  Finance  or  the  Minister  for

Culture? Dr Lee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The Minister for Education.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> You are off your rocker.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Every country that has

self-respect will never like to have foreign bases on its

soil,  and  any politician worth his salt  and  who

calls  himself  a nationalist, will always  do  his

best  to get rid of bases from the country. Yet,  I

see here, Sir ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of clarification,

Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Lee Siew Choh remained standing.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No, the Member is not giving way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- the Prime Minister glorifying

the bases ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1429</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What about Mr Woodhull?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Without Singapore and her bases, Malaysia cannot

be  defended. Whatever mutual defence  pacts  there

may   be,   if  tomorrow  we  were  to  obiliterate

Singapore  from the map of Malaysia then  the  sine

vs, with  which Malaysia can be defended would  be

destroyed.'



<br><br>Defended. Defended for whom?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> The people of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Today the bases are here to

defend British interests. The Prime Minster, piqued

at  not getting his way in the financial talks,  is

trying to frighten the Federation by reminding them

that  Singapore  is,  in  fact,  an  asset  to  the

Federation.  But  in his trying  to  emphasise  the

importance of Singapore, he only talks of Singapore

as  a base -  a base for the defence of whom and  for

whose  interests? Surely, he must know  that  today

the  centre of the British Far East Unified Command

is  in  Singapore. The base is the  centre  of  the

British Far East Unified Command. In fact, Malaysia

is  only  the  political aspect  of  this  military

command which embraces all the five territories  in

Malaysia.  The base in Singapore is to act  as  the

springboard for the protection of British interests

in  the  Far  East, and stretching as  far  as  the

Indian  Ocean  and into the Arabian Sea.  That  was

what was announced in the British White Paper,  and

all  the  big-wigs of the British Military  Command

have repeatedly said the same thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Far East Unified Command Chief said

that  Malaysia would be defended 500 per cent  with

British forces. Do you mean to say that the British

are  going to defend Malaysia for people  like  the

Minister  for  Finance? In  fact,  all  the  P.A.P.

Ministers  have been pleading for British retention

of   the   base, in  his  visits  to   the   rural

constituencies,  the  Prime Minister  stressed  the

fact that the base is important to Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> 40,000 jobs!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He calls Singapore the stopper

of South-East Asia and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1430</b></font><br><br>



the base is to be used as the stop of the stopper.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> To stop you from talking

rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> You can, therefore, see, Sir,

that when the Ministers of the P.A.P. talk of their

being  nationalists, they are in fact  playing  the

role  of  colonial  stooges.  They  tight  for  the

British  base  to  be in Singapore.  They  want  to

preserve the base in Singapore so that it may serve

the  interests  of the P.A.P. to a certain  extent,

but  more  important, the interests  of  a  foreign

power.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our stand on the question of the base has been

repeatedly stressed in our statements.  We  want  a

free,  independent, democratic  Malaya - that  is  to

say,  Singapore together with the Federation   - free

of  foreign troops and free of foreign control.  In

other  words,  the base must go if  we  are  to  be

really  independent.  But, of  course,  the  P.A.P.

likes  the  base to be there because it will  serve

the P.A.P. to a great extent.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> 40,000 jobs!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> They keep on talking about 74

days to merger and the fulfilment of a promise. But

was there any mention of Malaysia?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Merger, yes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There was no mention of it at

all   in   1959.  Why  do  they  keep  harping   on

independence through Malaysia then?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> What is your point?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The point is you are bringing

new  things  into  your  policy  which  were  never

mentioned before. Now the P.A.P. Government is even

thinking   of   using  money   reserved   for   the

development of Singapore for the expansion  of  the

armed forces to protect the so-called Pan-Malaysian

Services, Azahari's fight in Brunei is well  known.

His  stand has been supported by all the Afro-Asian

countries in Moshi ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Mushi?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1431</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Another hon. Member:</b> Moshi, Moshi.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> All of us know that Azahari is

an anti-colonialist in his own way in Brunei.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Very funny way!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Any person who fights against

imperialism gets our support. Our stand  is  clear.

Whether  the anti-colonial struggle be  in  Brunei,

Africa or Latin Amerce, it will get our support.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Timbuctoo too.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> At one time, the P.A.P. gave

the  impression  of  supporting  the  anti-colonial

struggle in Algeria. But when we did the same thing

in  support of Brunei, they used that as an  excuse

to  arrest and detain the leaders and organisers of

our  Party. We are very clad, Sir, that the Minster

for   Culture  agrees  with  our  analysis  in  the

Plebeian, and we are very glad that ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> On a point of clarification, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> If the Member will give way.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> There is no need for any

clarification from him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> You cannot understand him.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Because it is all here ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> I never agreed to it. I just read

it out.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> He quoted extensively from our

Plebeian.  Our  Plebeian came out well  before  the

Manila   Conference  ended,  and  we  had   already

predicted   the  difficulties  of  the   Federation

Government  and  the  British  in  their  wish   to

implement  Malaysia. We know that the British  and

the Federation would like to push through Malaysia,

but in view of the difficulties that they will have

to face, I think they will be forced to think twice

before going ahead without regard to the views of

Indonesia and the Philippines.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1432</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> All are agreed now.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> We have said here very clearly

that  the  Federation and the  British  would  most

certainly  like  to push through  their  plans  for

Malaysia,  but because of the realisation  that  if

they  persist with their plans, they would have  to

incur  great  losses, therefore, they now  have  to

think of cutting their losses. That is why we  said

that  there are great possibilities of Britain  and

the Federation postponing Malaysia.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> 77 days more!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I remember when the news came

out  about  a referendum in Singapore  and  in  the

Borneo  territories, we on this side of  the  House

could see long faces on the opposite Benches.  They

were worried and did not know what to do. Only with

the  help of Malaysia can they hope to retain their

position.   But   with   Malaysia   possibly    not

forthcoming as scheduled the Ministers opposite are

getting worried.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Are you serious?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> Anyway, we are very glad that

they  realise  that Malaysia is  not  going  to  be

smooth  and plain sailing. In spite of their hopes,

it looks as if Malaysia is going to strike rock.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Where?



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> If I may quote, Sir, from our

latest  Chinese Barisan. May I read this in Chinese

so that it can be translated for you, Sir?



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think it will be more convenient,

for interpretation purposes, for the hon. Member to

interpret straightaway.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Skip it.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> I will translate it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'It does not matter how eager the British and the

Federation  hope to implement their Malaysia  plan.

but  because of ;strong opposition from the  people

fn  the  five territories, from Afro-Asia and  from

world  opinion,  and added to this  the  opposition

from the Philippines and Indonesia . . . .'



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1433</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng):</b> Cuba.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`, it looks as if the Federation Government and

Britain will have to give way.'



<br><br>And  this is to inform the Ministers opposite:  let

them not be too happy. I think, from today onwards,

they will have to start thinking of other ways  and

means of saving their personal fortunes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Sir, on a point of order. You

will remember ---



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The point of order being?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> A breach of privilege, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the allegation?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The Member has said that we

are  trying to save our personal fortunes. Sir.  We

have no personal fortunes.



<br><br><!-- Sir George Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot see how that is

either  a  point of order or a breach of privilege.

The  Member for Queenstown is just saying  that  he

does  not  know how the Members are to  save  their

personal  fortunes. He has not said how  they  have

amassed  fortunes or, in fact, if they have amassed

fortunes.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister also complained

that  we have changed cur stand towards the concept

and  plan  of  Malaysia. Our stand is very  simple,

Sir.  The present plan and the present concept both

embrace the Borneo territories, Singapore, and  the

Federation. As far as we are concerned, the  Borneo

territories  should  have self-determination.  They

have  asked  for independence, and they should  get

independence. Moreover, already there is Kalimantan

Utara.  On our side, we ask for reunification  with

the  Federation. That is all. To keep talking about

the  concept will allow certain people who are

pro-Malaysia to distort the anti-Malaysia stand of  the

people  by  quoting non-opposition to the  Malaysia

concept  as  non-opposition to  the  Malaysia  plan

itself.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1434</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very clear example is seen in Mr Narasimhan's

statement  recently.  He went  to  Borneo  and  the

Federation. Because some of the Parties  have  said

they  are  not  opposed  to  the  concept,  so  Met

Narasimhan  told  the  world  that  there  was   no

opposition to Malaysia when, in fact, all  of  them

are  opposed to Malaysia. Therefore, to prevent all

these  distortions and confusion, it is much easier

that  we  say we oppose the Malaysia plan  and  the

Malaysia  concept. It will save a lot of  confusion

and everybody can understand exactly what our stand

is.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Stop talking and save confusion.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> The Minister mentioned

something  about our having a party  and  reception

for   the   M.P.s   who  represent   the   monopoly

capitalists. We did not have a party to welcome the

Labour M.P.s who represent monopoly capitalists. We

had  that  party to show the M.P.s  that  there  is

strong  opposition  to Malaysia  in  Singapore.  In

spite  of  the  Straits Times' distortion  and  the

attempt  to give the impression that I had  scolded

the M.P.s behind their backs, I had, in fact, given

my  speech  to the M.P.s long before I  started  to

speak.  Sir, there was no talking behind the  backs

of  the M.P.s. I do not know why the Straits  Times

put on that "twist". Possibly it was because we are

against  Malaysia  and therefore  are  against  the

interests represented by the Straits Times. If  the

Straits Times were honest enough, they should ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Pack up.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- correct their presentation

and  tell the people of Singapore that I never  did

say anything behind the backs of the M.P.s.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not wish to go very much further ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Thank God.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> --- in reply, because, in actual

fact,  the  Minster never touched  on  any  of  the

points  which  I raised. The Members opposite  keep

talking   about   their  1958  Fourth   Anniversary

Souvenir.   But   I  remember,  Sir,   we   started

complaining  about the implementation of  the

pro-colonial policy of the P.A.P.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1435</b></font><br><br>



as  early  as September, or even August  1959.  The

P.A.P. had  a  meeting in a  special  bungalow  in

Changi  and  we Assemblymen and other  cadres  were

asked  to attend. As early as 1959, we had  already

pointed  out to the leaders that they were pursuing

a  policy  which  was entirely different  from  the

pledges  given to the people before the  elections.

Since  that time, there had been frequent  meetings

and   every  time  the  cadres  complained  to  the

Ministers.  But later on, because of  what  is  now

called the Ong Eng Guan incident, these differences

were  put  aside  until the time  when  the  P.A.P.

openly   supported   the  Malaysia   plan   without

consultation  of party cadres. So to  say  that  we

supported the P.A.P. from the beginning is entirely

wrong.  Our quarrel with the Ministers and  leaders

of the P.A.P. started as early as 1959.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the P.A.P. always talks about the Communists

because   they  want  to  use  the  Communists   as

scapegoats. They want to crush the Barisan Sosialis

by  smearing  us as Communists. They want  frighten

away  supporters of the Barisan Sosialis. And  when

they  make mistakes and commit blunders, they  hope

to  blame  the  Communists for  such  mistakes  and

blunders. Everything undemocratic that they  do  is

blamed on the Communists. I think the Minister  for

Finance  did  on  one occasion say that  he  needed

undemocratic measures to protect P.A.P. democracy.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Rubbish!



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Siew Choh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Siew Choh:</b> And because of that, therefore,

we  had  clause  29  of  the Referendum  Bill.  And

because  of  that also, I and many of  us  suffered

loss  of  individual freedom in the police  station

lock-up. Sir, democracy is dead in Singapore today.

I  would  advise the P.A.P. to correct  its  policy

even  in  the short time left to them. The  correct

policy  is  to  pursue  the anti-colonial  struggle

correctly and try to raise the living standards  of

the people. Colonialism exploits the people in many

forms. Even if political domination has been  taken

away,   the   country   can  still   be   dominated

economically  and  militarily,  and  economic   and

military domination constitutes neo-colonialism.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1436</b></font><br><br>



That  is what Malaysia is, and if the P.A.P. wants

to  get away from this pro-colonial policy, I would

ask  it to immediately stop supporting Malaysia and

to go back to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That this House expresses no

confidence  in the People's Action Party Government

for its pro-colonial policies."
