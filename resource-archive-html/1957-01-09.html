from His Excellency the Governor dated 10th, 13th

and 18th December, 1956, respectively informing me

that His Excellency has, in accordance with the

provisions of Section 62 (2) of the Singapore

<div align="center"><b>GOVERNOR-GENERAL FOR SINGAPORE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Appointment from Federation of Malaya)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Chief Minister

the reasons for his proposal that the Governor-General for Singapore may be appointed from the

Federation of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock): The policy

of the Labour Front Coalition is to work towards a

united Malaya and the proposal for a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>



Malayan Governor-General is in keeping with that

policy.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Would it not be wise, Sir, to

have one Governor-General for both the territories?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1190</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for

Labour and Welfare if he will make a statement on

the present day situation on unemployment in

Singapore; and what was the number of unemployed

persons in Singapore as at 31st December, 1956.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> In answer to a question in this

House in February 1956, I explained that accurate

numbers of unemployed persons in Singapore are not

available. A study of the various factors which

affect employment in Singapore does not suggest

that there has been any appreciable change in the

unemployment situation during the last 12 months.

On the 31st of December, 1956, there were 7,842

persons actively seeking employment assistance

through the Government Employment Exchange.



<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, is the

Minister aware that only a small number of

unemployed persons are registered with the

Government Labour Exchange, that there are about

100,000 unemployed persons in Singapore, and that

there were hundreds of unemployed people registered

with Government Labour Exchange for five years ago

and are still out of employment?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I must, of course, point out

to hon. Members that supplementary questions are

supplementary questions. They should not be read.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Sir, I find difficulty in

understanding the supplementary question. If I

understand it correctly, it is whether I am aware

that there are more than 100,000 persons who are

unemployed. Sir, with the resources at our service,

may I tell him that there are not 100,000 persons

unemployed?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Much more.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Yew Hock:</b> Much less.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>BANISHMENT ORDINANCE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Amending Legislation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr D. S. Marshall</b> asked the Chief

Secretary whether he will take steps to introduce a

Bill in this session to provide for radical

amendments to the Banishment Ordinance.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr W. A. C. Goode:</b> Sir, this question is at

present under consideration by the Government.



<br><br><!-- Mr Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Marshall:</b> Sir, am I right in understanding

that " under consideration" is a civil service term

which means: "we have no intention of doing anything

about it but we do not have the courage to say so?"



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is completely out of order.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1191</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>COMMERCIAL ADVERTISEMENT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>OF BRITISH COMPANIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Distribution by Information Services)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether he is aware that commercial advertisement

of British companies has been distributed by the

Information Services and to state on whose authority

such distribution was made.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, think the hon. Member is probably

referring to magazines and industrials reviews

which are published by large corporations and

federations of industries in the United Kingdom.

These publications do not offer goods for sale but

they convey information about technological

developments, industrial organisations, trade

unions, staff activities and other matters of

general interest. They are well produced and

abundantly illustrated with excellent photographs

from many parts of the world and are very

informative. They are distributed to public reading

rooms, community centres and schools where, I am

advised, they are very much appreciated. The

distribution is the responsibility of the Director

of Information Services under my general authority.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is the Hon. the Chief Secretary

aware of the purpose of these large industrial

concerns in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1192</b></font><br><br>



putting forward these beautifully illustrated

magazines containing a lot of useful information

for their prospective buyers?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Yes, Sir, I am perfectly aware of the

purpose.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, is it not the duty of the

United Kingdom Trade Commissioner to perform this

duty instead of this Government?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Sir, I am not in a position to answer

for the duties of the United Kingdom Trade

Commissioner.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Do the Information Services give

the same information to other Commonwealth

countries?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Yes, Sir, if they wish it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Is it proposed to give the same

facilities to beautifully illustrated brochures of

the German, the Japanese, the Russian, the Chinese

enterprises?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> They are not members of the

Commonwealth, Sir.

<div align="center"><b>(Total cost to Singapore)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr D. S. Marshall</b> asked the Financial

Secretary what is the total cost to Singapore of

the Royal Malayan Navy since its inception and up

to the latest period for which figures are

available, in respect of:

<div align="center"><b>HOUSING AUTHORITY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government,  Lands and Housing if he  will  make  a

statement on the progress in the establishment of a

Housing   Authority   to  replace   the   Singapore

Improvement Trust.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  establishment of a new Housing Authority

presents  many complex and intricate problems.  The

question  was first considered by the Committee  on

Local   Government   whose   recommendations   were

accepted  by Government with certain modifications.

Since  then,  Sir, the Government  has  given  much

thought  to  the problem and has now  decided  what

policy  should  be  adopted  with  regard  to   the

constitution and functions of the new organisation.

From  1st  January  this year  Mr  J.  M.  Fraser,

Chairman  and Manager of the Singapore  Improvement

Trust, has been released from his managerial duties

and has been with the Ministry of Local Government,

Lands  and Housing on secondment for special duties

in  connection with the establishment  of  the  new

Housing Authority, including the preparation of the

necessary legislation pertaining thereto  and  also

with the preparation of comprehensive town planning

legislation.  He  will also plan and  organise  the

change-over from the Improvement Trust to  the  new

Authority.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, can the Minister

tell  us  how  long we will have to  wait  for  the

Committee  to  finalise  its  report  so  that  the

establishment  of this Housing Authority  could  be

implemented?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I cannot give

a definite date, but I can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>

assure the Member for Queenstown that it will  only

be a matter of months.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>REDUCTION OF S.I.T. RENTALS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government,  Lands  and  Housing  when  can  S.I.T.

tenants  expect a reduction of rentals as  promised

by the Minister early last year.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  hon.  Member  presumably  refers  to   a

statement  which  I  made  in  this  House  on  8th

February,  1956,  when  I  said  that  the  savings

resulting  from the reduction of the interest  rate

on  S.I.T. loans  to two per cent  might  well  go

towards  the  reduction of rentals of the  cheapest

houses. It will be seen, Sir, from the White  Paper

tabled this morning that the Government has closely

examined the question of housing subsidies and  has

decided  not  to  proceed  with  the  proposal   to

subsidise housing by reducing the rate of  interest

on  loans. The new method of subsidy proposed  will

make  it  possible  in due course  to  undertake  a

comprehensive  survey of all Trust rentals  with  a

view  to  equalisation of rents. It is a  long-term

policy of Government, Sir, that ultimately the same

rent   should  be  paid  for  the  same   type   of

accommodation in all public housing estates. As  an

interim  measure,  certain  immediate  reliefs  are

proposed  to which reference is made in  the  White

Paper  and  it  is hoped, Sir, that these  will  be

effective from the 1st of February this year. I can

also  say  here,  Sir,  that  the  measures  to  be

proposed  involve Government to  the  extent  of  a

little over half a million dollars for 1957.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1194</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>S.I.T. HOUSES ON WAR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>DEPARTMENT LANDS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government, Lands and Housing whether he  is  aware

that  the Singapore Improvement Trust has built  on

War  Department lands houses now occupied  by  Army

personnel, and to state on whose authority, out  of

what funds, and the terms on which such houses were

built.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1195</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  a  thousand houses and ten shops were erected

on  War  Department lands at Clementi Road  by  the

Singapore  Improvement Trust which  was  acting  as

agent  for the Singapore Government. A loan  of  $3

million was approved by the Legislative Council  in

1954.  It  was agreed that these houses  should  be

occupied  by  families of local military  personnel

but that the houses will be vacated and handed over

for  housing  the  public as  soon  as  alternative

accommodation for these families has been built  by

the  Army and that all houses would be handed  over

within  a period of seven years from the time  they

were  completed. The War Department is paying  rent

equivalent to the loan charges on the property and,

in addition, maintenance charges amounting to 2 per

cent of the cost of the buildings per annum.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the

Minister  tell us if at this stage the  scheme  has

been  completed; and, if not, the number  of  units

that  have been completed and the number  of  units

that  the  S.I.T. intends to  build  for  the  War

Department to complete the scheme.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I shall

require notice of that question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> In that case, Sir, can the

Minister tell us is it Government's policy then  to

build houses and, if not, is there a chance for the

Government  to  stop  the  implementation  of  that

scheme from now onwards?



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> That is a different question.

<div align="center"><b>TELOK AYER DIVISION (Flooding)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> asked the Minister for Local

Government, Lands and Housing what steps,  so  far,

have  been taken to alleviate flooding in the Telok

Ayer  Division  (Circular Road, Boat  Quay,  Market

Street,  Robinson Road) since his question on  this

subject in July 1955.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, in reply to a similar



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1196</b></font><br><br>



question in July 1955, the hon. Member was informed

that schemes to alleviate flooding in the areas  in

question  have been included in the City  Council's

five-year  programme. This is still the case.  Sir,

but the City Council consider that a reappraisal of

the  original scheme is necessary in the  light  of

the  recommendations  by both the  Singapore  River

Working Committee and the Chief Drainage Engineer.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, how long will it take to

implement this scheme in this area?



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Mr Speaker, in my reply just

now,  I  did indicate to the Member for Telok  Ayer

that  this is purely a matter for the City  Council

and  I  am  therefore unable to give  any  specific

date.

<div align="center"><b>AMA KENG RESETTLEMENT</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr Goh Tong Liang</b> asked the Minister for

Local Government, Lands and Housing-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) why have the agricultural roads in Ama Keng Resettlement not been made up yet;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) when will he issue titles to the settlers in Ama Keng Resettlement.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker, the

reply  to  question  (a) is  that  the  Engineering

Section  of  the Resettlement Claims  of  the  Land

Office has been fully occupied in building roads in

newly  opened-up resettlement areas. These have  to

be   given   priority  as  the  lack  of   prepared

resettlement  sites was everywhere holding  up  the

Government's building programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reply to question (b) , Sir, is that titles

will be issued as soon as title survey of the area,

which is now in hand, is completed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seah Peng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr Seah Peng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for

Local Government, Lands and Housing-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the exact number of low-cost housing units

built in the Colony in 1956;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) how many low-cost buildings are to be

constructed in Singapore during 1957.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 1,261 housing units and eight shops were

completed  during 1956, while a further 2,521  were

under  construction at the end of the  year.  These

figures are lower than originally expected owing to

complications  of land clearance and  resettlement,

since  Government's  intention  has  been  to  make

proper  provision  for  persons  affected  by   new

building projects. However, Sir, the Land Clearance

and    Resettlement   Department   has   now   been

established and Government has set aside $4 million

to provide for proper resettlement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr Goh Tong Liang</b> asked the Minister for

Education-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) what does he propose to do with the nearly

9,000  children who will not  get  places  in

the English-language schools in 1957;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) how many children of school-age of both sexes

are there who cannot get places in the Chinese-language schools in 1957.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1198</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, (a) the

first question is somewhat misleading. It can  only

be  satisfactorily  answered if I  explain  briefly

what  our  aim is and how far we have succeeded  in

achieving  it.  The  first object  we  set  out  to

achieve was to provide enough schools and to  train

enough  teachers  to give every  child  a  six-year

primary education. As the primary age group is  now

increasing at the rate of some 20,000 a year,  this

meant  that 20,000 extra places a year  had  to  be

provided  even  to  maintain the existing  position

with  the  age  of admission to Government  schools

seven  plus.  In fact, more than 20,000  additional

places  are being provided each year, most of  them

in  new  Government schools, so that  it  has  been

possible to lower the age of admission to about six

years  eight  months. Parents of children  born  in

1949,  that  is,  seven years old on  1st  January,

1957, and 1950 six-year olds were asked to register

in  August last year. Of 11,715 seven-year olds who

were  registered, every single one has been offered

a  place. Of 15,685 six-year olds, 6,610 have  been

offered  places. The others will be given  priority

of   admission,  according  to  age  and  place  of

residence,  to schools which will be  opened  later

this  year. Those who are not so admitted  will  be

guaranteed places in 1958. The position  this  year

has  been complicated by late registrations and  by

the  need to use some of the new Government primary

school  buildings  to house Chinese  middle  school

pupils.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) it is impossible to give a definite answer to

this  question. Obviously it is easier for children

to  find  places in some localities  than  others.

There  are  too few schools in some of the  crowded

city areas and too few sites available for building

new ones. On the other hand, it is not possible  to

build schools easily accessible to all children  in

rural areas. In general, however, the large numbers

of  children aged six and even five years  old  who

are admitted to Chinese schools show that there  is

no  real  shortage  of places. Fully-aided  schools

will, however, be required to follow the Government

practice  of giving priority of admission to  older

children.

been published and laid at the Assembly sitting  on

the 5th of September last. Details are given in the

exchanges on the island, including Tanjong  Katong,

Bukit Timah, Paya Lebar, Pasir Panjang and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the installation of public call

boxes,  my Ministry has supplied the Board  with  a

list  of some 80 sites in the rural areas, and  the

Board  have stated that nearly 80 per cent of these

requirements  will be met in the first  quarter  of

1957, which is very creditable indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supply of electricity generally is a function

of  the local authorities, the City Council and the

<div align="center"><b>REOPENING OF CONSTITUTIONAL TALKS IN LONDON</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Chief Minister)</b></div>



<br><br>10.25 a.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief Minister (Mr Lim Yew Hock): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise to make a statement  on  my

London  visit  last month to arrange  for  the  re-opening  of constitutional talks with the  Colonial

Office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand, Sir, the local Press has been giving

wide  coverage to my informal talks, and  for  this

the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1202</b></font><br><br>



would  like  to express its thanks. Some  of  these

reports,  however,  were of a  speculative  nature.

Every time I was seen or interviewed by members  of

the  Press, I had a smile for them and I  had  been

able  to  laugh  my  way through  many  an  awkward

question.  This  might  have  accounted   for   the

optimistic  tone  of the reports  which  have  been

coming  through  from London. I am not  striking  a

pessimistic note at all, but I do wish to strike  a

note  of  caution, that, unless all the ingredients

are  there, the cake of Merdeka cannot be well  and

truly  baked.  I am, however, quite satisfied  with

the  trend  of the informal talks and can  honestly

say that the prospects are good and that success is

within  reach; but we can only achieve this  if  we

lay  our  plans  well and if we all make  strenuous

efforts  to see to it that nothing happens  in  the

meantime  to jeopardise our chances. Let  us  march

towards  Merdeka in the full realisation that  this

means  increasing  responsibilities  demanding  the

best that is in us in the fulfilment of the destiny

of  our people towards a better and a fuller  life.

This is a national issue and in this national issue

let us not allow side issues to mar its success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Sir, let me turn to the agreed agenda

which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To take note of the items in the

Constitutional Proposal by the United  Kingdom

Government  as  set  out  in  Appendix  8   of

Command  Paper  9777  (Annexure  L. to   the

Legislative Assembly Sessional Paper No.  Cmd.

31  of  1956), which have already been  agreed

to in principle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Internal Security.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. External Relations and External Defence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Designation of Her Majesty's Representative

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Date of coming into force of the new

Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Position of civilian employees in the Armed

Forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Any other business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 1 means that what the Marshall delegation has

gained during the last talks would remain, and this

includes  citizenship status for the many thousands

of   non-locally-born  persons.  I  have  heard  it

expressed in some quarters that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1203</b></font><br><br>



I  was  willing to accept less than what  has  been

offered to the Marshall delegation, and I hope this

information will put an end to their loose talk.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 2, Sir, is an important one - a very important

one.  It  refers  to the extent to  which  the  new

constitution  would  permit  interference  in   our

internal   security  problem.  Hon.  Members   will

recollect that the Marshall delegation asked for  a

Malayan  to  be  the Chairman of  the  Defence  and

Security  Council proposed by the Colonial  Office,

but   this  was  turned  down.  Failure  to   reach

agreement  on this question was the main  cause  of

the  breakdown of the last talks. Since I took over

office  as  Chief Minister last June, I  have  been

giving this matter considerable thought and I  have

also  had informal discussions with my friend Tunku

Abdul Rahman. The proposal which I submitted to the

Colonial  Office under this heading  calls  for  an

Internal  Security Council to be composed of  equal

representation by the Singapore Government and  Her

Majesty's  Government  and  a  Minister  from   the

Federation of Malaya, under the chairmanship of the

representative  of Her Majesty's Government.  Under

the  proposed set-up, it will be seen that the vote

of  the Federation member is the deciding factor in

the Internal Security Council. My proposal is based

on  the  fact  that the Federation is more  closely

linked with us vis-a-vis internal security than the

United  Kingdom. In this connection, the people  of

Singapore remember with gratitude the assistance of

the  Federation during our October riots. As to  be

expected,  Sir,  the  Colonial  Office   had   some

misgivings about this proposal. The opportunity was

taken  of  the  presence in London of  Tunku  Abdul

Rahman,  and there was a joint informal  discussion

of the three parties - the Federation Chief Minister,

the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Colonies,  and

myself.  I am again indebted to Tunku Abdul  Rahman

for his fine and continued co-operation as a result

of  which  the  Colonial Office now considers  that

there is a basis for agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 3 on External Relations and External Defence

is to be further discussed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1204</b></font><br><br>



in the light of my proposal under item 2.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 4 refers to the designation of Her Majesty's

representative as apart from the representative  of

Her  Majesty's  Government.  I  pressed  on  for  a

Malayan Governor-General, and from the trend of the

informal   talks,  I  take  heart  that   the   new

constitution may yet see a Malayan as  the  Queen's

representative in a new State of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 5, Sir, refers to the date of coming into

force of the new constitution, and hon. Members are

already aware of the intention of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 6, Sir, brings in for discussion the position

of  the many thousands of civilian employees in the

Armed Services. This is a matter on which I will be

holding   discussions   with   the   trade    union

organisations that represent them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the question that crops up in

the  mind  of  everyone,  inside  and  outside  the

Assembly,   is,  "Will  the  delegation   for   the

resumption  of  talks with the Colonial  Office  in

March be an All-Party one or a Government one?" The

answer to this question, Sir, is obvious. To ensure

success,  I must first of all ensure that there  is

unity in the delegation. I mean to ensure that  the

performance of the last delegation is not repeated.

I  want to bring a united force to London, a  force

that  can  be relied upon to bring the  cake  home.

Another failure will be too much for the people  of

Singapore  to  bear. Another failure  will  mean  a

grave  blow  to the democratic forces in  Singapore

and  will  make  the ground fertile for  subversive

forces  to  operate. I propose to call as  soon  as

possible a conference of all Parties represented in

the  Assembly, after which I will be  in  a  better

position  to  make up my mind as to the composition

of the delegation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, during my meetings with the

Secretary  of  State and with his officials,  there

was an air of cordiality and goodwill, and this has

helped  much  to bring about a better understanding

of   the  position.  I  hope  the  same  spirit  of

cordiality  and goodwill will prevail in  March.  I

would  like,  Sir,  to  take  this  opportunity  to

express my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1205</b></font><br><br>



thanks to Her Majesty's Government for their

hospitality during my stay in London.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir. I had several discussions with Malayan

students  in London, and I was impressed  by  their

awareness of the trend of events in Malaya  and  by

their   enthusiasm  and  political  acumen.   This,

indeed, augurs well for the future.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall (Cairnhill):</b> If it please you,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I am sure that both sides of the

House  and  the country are happy and  relieved  to

learn of the bright prospects for merdeka; but will

the  Chief  Minister inform us of the exact  date-I

think it has never been made known to the House-for

the conference to be held, and reassure us that the

holding  of fresh elections in August 1957  is  not

only  a possibility but will, in fact, if the talks

are successful, take place?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> The talks will reopen on the

11th  of  March, which I understand is the Ides  of

March.  As  far as the elections go, the Government

is  committed, to holding elections in August  this

year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Since the Chief

Minister  has  cited  the  cordial  and  hospitable

manner in which he was treated as an indication  of

bright  prospects, may we ask him if  he  is  aware

that  when  his predecessor went to London  he  was

treated  with  even greater cordiality  before  the

final blowup?

<br><br>10.42 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I should like, first of all, to express my

regret  to  the  Assembly  that  it  has  not  been

possible  to give hon. Members anything  more  than

short  notice of the contents of the Bill. I  hope,

however, Sir, that the arrangements which have been

made  to give them as much notice as possible  have

afforded them sufficient time in which to study the

proposed legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill is unusual in the sense that it

relates  particularly to the position on  the  City

Council  of  the five Members of this Assembly  who

are referred to in the Bill by name. It relates  to

those  Members  particularly, Sir,  because  within

recent  weeks  doubts about their qualification  to

act  as  City Councillors have arisen. These doubts

have been considered and, as a result of the advice

which   has   been  given  on  the  question,   the

Government takes the view that it is most desirable

that  the  position of the hon. Members in question

on  the City Council should be put beyond doubt  at

the  earliest  opportunity.  This  Bill.  Sir,  has

accordingly  been  introduced  to  put  the  matter

beyond doubt so far as the past is concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the doubts about the position on the City

Council  of the hon. Members in question arise  out

of  that provision of the Municipal Ordinance which

provides  that the seat of a City Councillor  shall

become  vacant if he becomes a holder of an  office

of emolument under the Crown. Hon. Members will,  I

think,  be aware that three of the five Members  in

question   have  been  appointed  to  be  Assistant

Ministers while on the City Council and there seems

to be little doubt that when they were so appointed

they  became holders of offices of emolument  under

the   Crown.  So  far  as  the  remaining  two  are

concerned,   Sir,  it  is  considered  that   their

position on the City Council is doubtful.  In  this

connection,  Sir, the provisions of  the  Singapore

Colony  Order in Council are relevant because  they

expressly  provide that, for the purposes  of  that

Order - I would emphasise those words "for the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1209</b></font><br><br>



purposes  of that Order" - a person is not considered

to  hold  office of emolument under  the  Crown  by

reason  only that he is in receipt of a  salary  or

other  emoluments in respect of his tenure, amongst

others,  of the office of Member of the Legislative

Assembly. The resulting implication, of course,  is

that  for other purposes "Member of the Legislative

Assembly"  may come within the category of  persons

who hold office of emolument under the Crown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must now, I think, refer briefly to the

consequences  which follow, or  which  may  follow,

where  a  person  has acted as  a  City  Councillor

whilst   disqualified,   because   it   is    those

consequences which make this Bill in  the  view  of

the  Government necessary. These consequences, Sir,

are  two-fold. The first consequence, Sir, is  that

proceedings may be instituted against such a person

in  the  High  Court, and if they are  successfully

instituted,  the  Court has  power,  amongst  other

things, to order him to pay a penalty of up to $500

a day in respect of each occasion on which he acted

whilst  disqualified. The second consequence,  Sir,

is  that  the  proceedings of the City  Council  in

which a disqualified representative has taken  part

may  be  open to challenge. Accordingly,  Sir,  the

purpose of this Bill, and I think it is clear  from

its   title,  is  to  remove  the  possibility   of

proceedings of the kind which I have just described

being  taken in the High Court, and also to  remove

the  possibility of the validity of the proceedings

of  the City Council on which the hon. Members have

taken part being challenged.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, Sir, that before concluding I should also

refer  to  the provisions of clause 4 of  the  Bill

which  it  has  been thought wise to include.  This

clause,  Sir, completes the matter by covering  the

position  of  City  Councillors who  are  Municipal

Commissioners  and  who were also  Members  of  the

former Legislative Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, Sir, that Members on the opposite side of

the   House  will  agree  with  the  view  of   the

Government that, in the circumstances which I  have

outlined, it is very desirable that the position so

far as the past is concerned should be put



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1210</b></font><br><br>



beyond doubt, and accordingly give their support to

this motion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the future is concerned, the

Government's proposals are contained  in  the  Bill

which  comes next in the Order Paper, and it is,  I

think,  unnecessary for me to say anything more  on

that aspect of the matter at this stage. Sir, I beg

to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.48 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  have  now  got used to Government giving  short

notice  for  important motions or  Bills.  We  have

already  passed  that stage, and whether  the  Bill

which  is now before the House was given to us  two

weeks  ago or even two days ago or even right  now,

Sir,  it makes no difference. We are now quite used

to   the   Government  tactic.  When  the   present

Government took over office sometime in 1955, there

was  talk  of  a City Council re-election.  It  was

stressed  that that institution should  be  changed

and  they wanted to change it very quickly. We were

foolish enough to rise to that bait, thinking  that

that  would  be so, but after a long  time  we  are

still waiting for the Government to take action  to

hold early election to the City Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were also then informed that the life of the

City  Council  would be short, and  that  therefore

there   was   no  necessity  of  asking   Assistant

Ministers then to resign from the City Council.  We

were  informed  that the life of the  City  Council

would  only last for a few months. It is not a  few

months;  it is now two years! We are still  waiting

for the elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any democratic country I think all laws must

operate   equally  for  individuals  as   well   as

institutions. We must be fair to everybody. Here is

a  case where somebody has blundered, somebody  has

shown grave inefficiency. We may say that they have

overlooked  this, but this is a very important  and

serious  matter. We make the laws here, and  we  go

against   them.   I  think  the  Attorney-General's

Department is responsible for this, and perhaps the

Ministry of Local Government, Lands and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1211</b></font><br><br>



Housing too. If an individual should go against the

law, I do not think the Court will say, "Well,  you

have  overlooked that, but we will let you off very

lightly." I do not think if an individual who  made

such  an  error, and came to this Assembly  to  say

that  he  overlooked  it, the Assembly  would  say,

"Well, you will be excused." No, Sir, it must  say,

"The  law  must  work  impartially.  You  must   be

punished for your mistake, whether you have made it

knowingly or unknowingly." But, of course,  we  are

now talking about a set of people whom we would say

are privileged. They sit in this Assembly. They are

the  members of the ruling Party, and this Assembly

is  therefore asked to pass legislation in order to

protect them! I think anybody who is sick must take

his  medicine, if he wants to get well. If  anybody

makes  a mistake knowingly or unknowingly, he  must

pay the penalty. If it is $500 a day, let it be so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are other aspects to consider. In

all  probability they have taken part in  making  a

lot of decisions, and if they are punished now, the

whole   machinery  of  local  government  will   be

jeopardised,  all because of Government's  mistake,

and the people will suffer. But there is one decent

thing  that the Assistant Ministers could  do,  and

that  is  to  resign  straightaway  from  the  City

Council and stop making further mistakes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have pointed out to Government that a person

cannot be expected to do two jobs at the same  time

and do them well. The Assistant Ministers are being

paid  handsomely for doing the job of an  Assistant

Minister in addition to being a City Councillor. So

one job must suffer. We have informed them that  if

they are of the opinion that their work in the City

Council is not all-absorbing, then that institution

becomes  an  unimportant one. If they  think  that,

being Assistant Ministers, they need not devote all

their  time  to that office, then they are  wasting

public  money  because they are being overpaid  for

their jobs. In fact, Sir, I consider this to  be  a

very  bad blunder on the part of the Government  to

make such an error.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1212</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>10.55 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, every now and

then,  since this Government took office, a  sordid

scandal  comes  to light, and of all the  scandals,

this  is  the most sordid of them all!  It  is  one

brought to light in circumstances of which I  think

the Member for Serangoon may not be fully aware.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember reading in the papers - and I think no

one  has  contradicted  the  reports  yet-that  the

President of the City Council, Mr Rea, stated that

if  these  men  whose  acts we  are  now  asked  to

validate  had not wanted to question the  propriety

of  the City Council giving a cinema licence to one

Mr Loke Wan Tho, a spirited gentleman whom we will

all  remember as the television applicant, then  he

would not have questioned their right to sit in the

City  Council. But since these unwise men, who have

their hands in two pockets - one in the City Council,

and the other in the Assembly (I am told it is $200

and  $500  respectively) - did  question  the  cinema

licence he would question their right to be  there.

So  we  have the unholy spectacle of the  Attorney-General coming before this Assembly to put the  law

right for them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if there is one humorous note in this Bill,

it  is  this attempt to blur the lines between  the

Assistant  Ministers  and the ordinary  Members  of

this   Assembly.  In  his  explanatory  note,   the

Attorney-General said it would appear that a person

who  is an Assistant Minister is the holder  of  an

office  of emolument under the Crown. I am sure  he

has sound legal authority for that. But he goes  on

to  say  that  a  person who is  a  Member  of  the

Legislative Assembly may also be the holder of such

an  office.  What office? Presumably an  office  of

emolument  under the Crown. I would be grateful  if

we  could know his authority for that statement.  I

have  never considered myself as the holder  of  an

office  of emolument under the Crown. I have  never

thought that I am in the same category as the  Hon.

the  Chief  Minister and his colleagues,  including

the  permanent civil servants who sit with us.  But

now we are told that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1213</b></font><br><br>



such  melodious  names as Anthony Rebairo  Lazarous

and  Lee  Choon  Eng  are in the  same  category  as

Jumabhoy Mohamed Jumabhoy and Mak Pak Shee!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want to go into the niceties of all

this.  This  Bill will go through, if  for  nothing

else  because,  as  the Member  for  Serangoon  has

pointed out, if they had to pay the penalty of $500

a   day  or  thereabouts,  they  would  all  become

bankrupt and would be disqualified from sitting  in

this  Assembly--  except perhaps the  Minister  for

Commerce and Industry who sports a Humber Hawk! But

let them take note of this: the people of Singapore

are  not  so politically illiterate as not to  know

when a person is holding office and profiting. They

are  not so stupid as not to be able to distinguish

between  those  who have assumed public  office  to

serve the people, and those who have assumed public

office  to  serve themselves while they  serve  the

people.  We  will  say no more at this  stage.  The

Government can do what it likes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are against this Bill on principle. On

principle  we say it is a scandal that an Assistant

Minister of a Government should sit on all kinds of

petty tribunals-on City Council committees that are

responsible  for  giving  bus  routes  and  hawking

licences  and  all  the other  machinery  of  local

government  which,  so I am  told,  the  people  of

Singapore    constantly   find   frustrating    and

oppressive.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if

we  pass  this Bill today I will be led to  believe

the  Chinese idioms that "money can move mountains"

and  also that "money can engage the devil to  work

for you". I think the issue behind this Bill is  on

account of money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there has been one such issue in the City

Council   which   has  caused  a   nominated   City

Councillor  to resign and has been the  subject  of

many  heated  debates. The decision arrived  at  on

that  issue  has  been set aside,  reinstated,  set

aside  again and reinstated again. We  now  have  a

similar issue facing the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1214</b></font><br><br>



supreme  law-making  body  today,  the  Legislative

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think all people are aware of and share the

opinion with me when I endorsed one famous sentence

delivered by the Minister for Commerce and Industry

at  a  previous Assembly sitting when he  described

the  present  City Council as "a stagnant  pool  of

dirty  water". Sir, the introduction of  this  Bill

makes  me  more convinced that the dirty  water  is

actually  more  dirty. I wish the Government  would

show  more faith in the intelligence of the  people

and withdraw this most deplorable Bill.



<br><br>11.03 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker. Sir,

personal  quarrels over a small theatre in  Katong,

which  in no way concern the welfare of the  people

of  Singapore  as a whole, lead to the introduction

into  this  House of the City Councillors Indemnity

and Validating Bill. After wasting so much time and

making  so much noise in the City Council  Chamber,

the    City   Councillors   concerned   have    the

impertinence to introduce in-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I take it that "the City

Councillors  concerned" mean the  hon.  Members  of

this Assembly. The word "impertinence" used of them

is out of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Sir, they have the effrontery to

introduce into this House this Bill and request our

approval  of  it. Personally I think  the  valuable

time which has been spent debating this Bill can be

better  utilised  for  far more  important  matters

relating  to  the interests of the  people  of  the

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am at a loss to understand why the status

of the hon. Members concerned in this House as City

Councillors  was not raised before. Everyone  knows

that  a person cannot serve two masters. We have  a

case   here   where  a  person  can   serve   three

masters - one,  as  a  paid  servant  of  the  Crown;

second,  as  a Member of the Legislative  Assembly;

and, third, as a City Councillor. What a mess?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1215</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>11.06 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

of  all  the  Bills brought before this House,  the

most  difficult to justify is this Bill which seeks

to  validate the actions which have been  taken  by

Members  of  the  City Council or  the  Legislative

Assembly, and more so when these actions have  been

going  on for such a long time. I am not objecting,

Sir,  to  this course of relieving all  these  City

Councillors   and   Assistant  Ministers   of   the

consequences of their acts in the past.  But  I  do

say,  Sir, that we in this Assembly should not  now

be  asked to clean up this stagnant pool which  has

been  described as "very dirty" by the  Member  for

Changi, and that we should not be asked to act as a

purification plant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in view of the remarks already made on this

side of the House, I would be grateful if the mover

of the next item on the Order Paper would inform me

whether  the  Assistant  Minister  for  Labour  and

Welfare would still persist in sitting on the  City

Council.



<br><br>11.08 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it seems that the

Member  for Serangoon, who left the House a  little

while  ago, appears to be getting better and better

in   putting  across  ideas  in  a  form  which  is

incorrect. I am afraid of incurring your  wrath  in

using the right word for it, Sir, but perhaps it is

due  to  his  proximity to the Member  for  Tanjong

Pagar  who, incidentally, called him "my colleague"

just now. That was a surprise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The delay in elections to the City Council, Sir,

is  not  the  fault of this Government.  The  Local

Government  Bill  is  a  very  important  piece  of

legislation and requires careful consideration.  We

do  not  want to put up a Bill in a haphazard  form

which  might require a lot of amendments and  might

be  found to be unworkable later on. Those  Members

on  the  opposite side of the House, Sir,  who  are

Members  of  the  Select  Committee  on  the  Local

Government  Bill,  know the difficulties  that  the

Select Committee face in deciding on matters in the

Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1216</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the City Councillors Indemnity and Validating

Bill  which  is  before this  House  today  is  not

exclusively for the Members on the Government side.

There  are  two Members of the Opposition involved.

Sir,  it  is not a monopoly of the three Government

Members who are involved, including myself! It  has

not  been  admitted, Sir, that the five Members  of

this  Assembly  who are also City Councillors  have

indeed  committed a penal offence.  It  is  only  a

doubt that has been raised and this Bill intends to

settle the matter beyond doubt, so that the work of

the City Council may be carried on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as has been stated by the Member for Tiong

Bahru and by other Members of the Opposition,  this

matter first came to light at a meeting of the City

Council  on the 21st December when a motion  before

it  had to be withdrawn because the position of the

Councillor moving that motion was, according to the

President of the City Council, in doubt. Therefore,

if  this Bill is not proceeded with throughout  all

its  stages  today, it would mean that  that  doubt

would  still remain and the City Council would  not

be able to carry on its work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do sport a Humber Hawk but it looks a

miserable creature beside the Studebaker  owned  by

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar! In fact,  only  this

morning  I had occasion to mention to him that  he

owns a capitalist car and he said, "Why not?"!



<br><br>11.11 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the  Member for  Serangoon  in  his

speech made some remarks about the delay in holding

elections to the City Council and he said that this

was  inefficiency and that it was due either to the

Attorney-General's Department or  my  Ministry.  If

the   Member  for  Serangoon  will  recollect   the

Governor's  Address delivered at the first  sitting

of  the  previous session of this Assembly, it  was

stated  therein that the then Government was  going

to  introduce  legislation immediately  to  have  a

fully  elected Island and City Council. Only  after

taking office, Sir, did we have the opportunity  of

going through a ready-made Bill for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1217</b></font><br><br>



elections to the City Council prepared by the  then

Progressive Party and only then did we realise that

it  was impossible to carry out the recommendations

of  the Rendel Constitution which were embodied  in

that Bill. We therefore thought it wiser to appoint

a  Committee on Local Government and to  await  its

Report.  When  the Report came out,  we  eventually

decided  to  adopt  the  recommendations   of   the

Committee on Local Government. So, soon after that,

we  drew up legislation and, as you are well aware,

Sir,  this  legislation  is  now  before  a  Select

Committee of the Assembly. Therefore, Sir, I  think

it  is  unwise  on  the  part  of  the  Member  for

Serangoon  to  accuse either the Attorney-General's

Department  or my Ministry of any delay in  holding

elections to the City Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> A rash promise!



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid:</b> Quite so, Sir, it was somewhat

rash  but then one must also remember that in April

1955  we  all  were very young in  politics  and  I

should  say  the Members on the Opposition  Benches

were also in the same category.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One other point which was raised by the Member

for  Serangoon - that it is impossible for a  man  to

serve  two  masters: in the ease  of  an  Assistant

Minister, he has to serve not only his Ministry but

also the City Council. Sir, the same situation also

arises in the case of the Member for Serangoon. Not

only is he an Assemblyman, but he is also a school-teacher, and I wonder who suffer most, the  school-boys or this Assembly!



<br><br>11.14 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr W. A. C. Goode (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr W. A. C. Goode):</b> Sir, the

conduct  of  the President of the City Council  has

been called in question. I should like to endeavour

to  explain as well as I can his position  in  this

matter. I understand it was this. Sir, the validity

of   the  seats  in  the  City  Council  of   those

Councillors  who are either Assistant Ministers  or

Members  of  this  Assembly had been  brought  into

question.  The  question  had  not  been  resolved.

Before  the  last  ordinary  meeting  of  the  City

Council, notices had been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1218</b></font><br><br>



given  of,  I think it was, two motions which  were

sponsored   by   members  whose   eligibility   for

membership was in doubt. The President had  reasons

to  believe  that if those motions were  moved,  he

would  be  asked, as President of the City Council,

to  give a ruling whether the motions were in order

because they had been moved by persons who were not

entitled to be Members of the City Council.  Having

obtained such legal advice as he could, he was then

in a position of having, in conscience, to reply to

that  question,  that the advice he  had  was  that

those   Members  were  not  properly  Members   and

therefore the motions were out of order. Now, if he

had  to  do that, it would immediately have brought

into  doubt the rest of the proceedings of the City

Council  in  which  these Councillors  were  taking

part.  He knew that the Government and the Minister

were achieving a solution of this doubt and that if

legislation  was  required,  it  would  be  brought

forward, as it has been today. In order, therefore,

not  to frustrate the business of the City Council,

he  took,  the course of suggesting that these  two

motions  which  would  raise the  doubt  should  be

postponed until a later meeting of the Council when

the doubt would not arise.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> On a point of information, Mr

Speaker.  Sir.  Surely whether  or  not  these  two

Members moved the motion, the doubt existed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Yes, certainly, Sir, the doubt existed

but it was not necessary for a ruling to be made.



<br><br>11.16 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> As an interested

party,  Mr Speaker, Sir, I felt that I should  not

take  part  in the debate on this Bill, but  it  is

very  surprising that the Chief Secretary  in  this

Assembly  could protect the action of the President

of  the  City Council in such a manner. I do  agree

that  the President had been in doubt, and  if  so,

all  decisions made by me in the Council would  not

have  been valid. Why then did he say that  if  the

motion  was withdrawn, the question of my  seat  in

the Council would not have arisen?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1219</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Shame! Down with him!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> If I were not allowed to second

or  move  a motion, how could I then be allowed  at

that meeting to take a decision or take part in all

the deliberations? I cannot understand this. It  is

really  not surprising that, as a colonial officer,

he  is  trying to protect another colonial officer.

But before a vote is taken, Sir, I would like it to

be  recorded  that  I  am not taking  part  in  any

discussion or voting. What I am doing now  is  just

to  reply to the Chief Secretary. I am actually not

taking  part in the debate on this Bill. I felt  it

to  be my duty to reply to him and not let him just

protect  another colonial officer. But whatever  it

is, Sir, I still maintain that I am not drawing any

emolument from the Crown. [Interruption.]



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Hon. Members have probably

misunderstood   the   relevant   section   in   the

Legislative   Assembly  (Powers   and   Privileges)

Ordinance. That section merely states that an  hon.

this  nature  unless he first declares  his  direct

pecuniary   interest.   Therefore   discussion   is

completely  in  order  if  the  hon.  Member  first

declares his interest, if there is in fact a direct

pecuniary  interest,  which  is  doubtful  in  this

particular case.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, whether there

is a direct pecuniary interest or not, I will leave

it  to  you  to  decide and I will  abide  by  your

ruling; but even then, if I am allowed to take part

in discussions, I will -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I merely informed the hon.

Member  that  he  is perfectly  in  order  when  he

speaks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is this in reply, Mr Attorney-General?



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> In reply, Mr Speaker, Sir, I

should  like  to deal with one or two points  which

were made by various Members of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Sir, I should like to say that I was

gratified to hear from the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1220</b></font><br><br>



Member  for Paya Lebar that he does not  object  to

the  principle of the Bill, because, as I think  he

in  effect  says,  he  fully understands  that  its

purpose  is  to put right the past, to  remove  the

possibility  of  proceedings  being  taken  against

these  Members, and also to validate their acts  in

order  that there should be no possibility  in  the

future of any proceedings of the City Council being

challenged on the grounds that some persons  taking

part have been disqualified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rest, Sir, I think there has probably been

some  tendency to overlook the purpose of this Bill

and  to  discuss other matters which are  not  immediately  relevant,  although they  may  arise,  the

immediate  purpose being, of course,  only  to  put

right  what  has  occurred in the  past.  I  would,

however, like to add this, Mr Speaker, Sir, in  reply  to  the Member for Serangoon. I think  on  two

occasions  certainly  it was  suggested  that  this

legislation  was  designed to  prevent  proceedings

being  taken  against  persons  because  they   had

committed some sort of crime. I would like to  make

it  clear now that there is no question of that  at

all.  The provisions of section 8A of the Municipal

Ordinance merely provide, in circumstances where it

is  thought  that a person sat as a City Councillor

whilst he was disqualified, for proceedings in  the

High  Court for a declaration, that his  office  is

vacant, and empowers the High Court to require  him

to  pay a forfeiture on account of his conduct.  So

there  is no question now of saying, by this  Bill,

that  what was a crime shall not be regarded  as  a

crime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tanjong Pagar stressed, I think,

one   particular  point.  He  said  that   in   the

explanatory note the lines between the position  of

an   Assistant  Minister  and  a  Member   of   the

Legislative Assembly have become blurred.  I  think

he  is  probably right when he says that so far  as

the  explanatory note is concerned, but I  think  I

did  make  it  clear when I was moving  the  Second

Reading - and  I think at that stage the hon.  Member

was not present - that there was a distinction so far

as we are concerned on this side of the House, that

whereas the position of an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1221</b></font><br><br>



Assistant  Minister appears to be  clear,  that  of

Members of the Assembly appears to be doubtful, and

I  gave  the  reasons when I was moving the  Second

Reading. I am sorry if the hon. Member was not here

at the time. I did try to explain the matter and  I

think  it  would be tiresome to the House  if  they

were to listen to me doing it again.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not propose to follow at all the remarks made

by the Member for Queenstown, but I think the Chief

Secretary did cover the ground on those points  and

I accordingly beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> Sir, I have to move, "That the

Bill be now read a Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think hon. Members will have appreciated

from  the  debate on the Bill which has  just  been

passed by this Assembly that the future position on

the City Council of persons who are Members of this

Assembly,  whether they be Assistant  Ministers  or

not,  will  be  uncertain unless some amendment  is

made   to  the  Municipal  Ordinance  which   makes

provision   for   the   qualifications   of    City

Councillors.   This  Bill,  Sir,   is   accordingly

designed to remove that uncertainty and it does  so

by amendments to the law which, in the first place,

provide in effect that a person holding the  office

of  Assistant  Minister or Member of  the  Assembly

shall   not   be  disqualified  from  election   or

appointment  as  a  City Councillor;  and,  in  the

second  place,  that the seat of a City  Councillor

will not become vacant in the event of his becoming

an Assistant Minister or Member of the Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1223</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a further amendment, Sir, proposed by

this  Bill  to  which I think I  should  refer.  It

should be made abundantly clear that the provisions

of  the  Municipal Ordinance under which the holder

of  an  office  of  emolument under  the  Crown  is

disqualified  from  acting  as  a  City  Councillor

relate only to cases where the office is under  the

Crown  in the Colony and not where it is an  office

under the Crown in respect of the Government of the

United Kingdom.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, since under the Municipal Ordinance

persons  are  disqualified  from  acting  as   City

Councillors  if  they hold an office  of  emolument

under the City Council, it has been thought prudent

to  include  a  provision  on  the  lines  of  that

proposed  by clause 4 which, in effect,  says  that

the  receipt of an allowance from acting as a  City

Councillor is not a disqualification. I think, Sir,

that  hon.  Members will already  have  received  a

notice  of an amendment which I propose to move  to

that   clause  at  the  Committee  stage  and  that

amendment, Sir, is designed to substitute  for  the

proposed  new  section 8B one  which  is  more  comprehensive in its effect. I think, Sir, I shall not

say  anything  more on that now, and I  accordingly

beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.30 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I had hoped

that   the  mover  of  this  Bill  would  give   an

indication  whether  or not the Assistant  Minister

for  Labour and Welfare would resign from the  City

Council,  but  by his not making any  statement,  I

presume the intention is that he will stay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think this amendment should be treated

under   two   parts - one,  the  position   of   City

Councillors,  and  the  second,  the  position   of

Assistant Ministers. Where the City Councillors are

concerned, they only draw an allowance  of  $200  a

month. This allowance is meant to compensate a City

Councillor  for  his  transport  and  the  clerical

services  which  he would have to  employ  for  the

performance  of  his duties on  the  City  Council.

Where  the Assistant Minister is concerned,  it  is

entirely a different proposition. One can say  that

an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1224</b></font><br><br>



allowance  is  not  an emolument under  the  Crown,

because  all of us in this Assembly draw allowances

and  I  should hate o be treated also as  a  person

holding  an  office of emolument under  the  Crown,

thereby  having  to assume the mantle  of  Caesar's

wife.  There may be arguments whether an  allowance

is  or  is  not an emolument under the  Crown,  but

there is no shadow of doubt that where a person  is

an  Assistant Minister and is drawing  a  very  fat

salary from the Government, he must be regarded  as

being  in  the service of the Crown. I  cannot  see

legally  how  he  can  avoid being  treated  as  an

officer under the Crown.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another objection to the Assistant

Minister  for Labour and Welfare being on the  City

Council. Not only is he fully paid for his job, but

at the present moment he is doing

practically all the work of the Minister for Labour

and   Welfare,  because  we  know  that  the  Chief

Minister  is holding two jobs - his own job as  Chief

Minister  and his other job as Minister for  Labour

and Welfare. Since the Chief Minister's time is  so

much  taken  up  with  the work  of  the  Assembly,

guiding the Government and in negotiations with the

Colonial  Office for merdeka, how can the Assistant

Minister for Labour and Welfare justify taking away

his  time  from  doing the work  not  only  of  the

Minister  for Labour and Welfare but also  his  own

work as Assistant Minister? If he can do both jobs,

it  means that the office of Assistant Minister for

Labour and Welfare is not necessary. If he wants to

draw the pay of an Assistant Minister, then we feel

that  he  must  resign from his seat  on  the  City

Council. Therefore, Sir, we object to this Bill  on

the  ground  that an Assistant Minister should  not

sit on the City Council.



<br><br>11.35 a.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the debate

this  morning  seems to have cast  a  doubt  as  to

whether  a  Member of the Legislative  Assembly  is

also   a  Government  servant.  In  fact,  I  think

Government has never regarded it in that light.  In

so   far  as  amenities  are  concerned,  I   think

Assemblymen are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1225</b></font><br><br>



treated  as  private citizens. There are  no  such

things as a pension, free medical service and  all

the  other  privileges  that  come  from  being  a

government servant. Furthermore we have been  told

that  the $500 which an Assemblyman gets is not  a

salary but just an allowance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am connected with many sports organisations and

these  pay a transport allowance to their coaches,

but the coaches are not treated as people in their

employ and paid salaries. They still retain  their

amateur status. I would really hate to be regarded

as  a  government servant and subject to the wrong

side of General Orders and not benefiting from the

fact  of  being  a  government servant.  There  is

absolutely  no  doubt, Sir, that Members  of  this

Assembly, if they are not receiving salaries, such

as Assistant Ministers or Ministers, should not be

regarded as government servants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of the Assistant Minister being

provided  for in this Bill and being  exempted,  I

think  it is very unfair to create this situation,

then rectify it and then make sure that the Labour

Front has an extra vote in the City Council. I put

it  to  you, Sir, that they have power to  appoint

anybody they like in the City Council, and even if

this  Labour  Fronter  chose  to  leave  the  City

Council  and thereby vacate his seat,  they  could

still  appoint another Labour Fronter to take  his

place.  They  have done it before.  There  is  one

nominated City Councillor by the name of Miss  Wee

Kiat  Neo.  I  think she is the Assistant  General

Secretary of the Labour Front. .1 think this is  a

direct  appointment of a Party  member  and  is  a

Party bias -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Can the hon. Member indicate

how those statements relate to this Bill?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Sir, I am urging that the

Assistant  Minister in this case  can  resign  and

there  will be no loss to the number of  votes  in

the City Council.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is then, of

course, implying an improper motive. That  is  out

of order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> I am obliged to you, Sir, for

drawing my attention



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1226</b></font><br><br>



to  this and, of course, I think the attention  of

the public is similarly drawn. All in all, Sir,  I

feel   that  I  do  not  like  to  see  the  words

"Assistant Minister" included in clause 2.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield</b> rose -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply, Mr Attorney-General?



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> Yes, Sir. In reply, Sir, I think

I  shall be very brief and I shall deal only  with

two  points which have been raised. The  first,  I

think,  was  made  by the Member  for  Paya  Lebar

when - I  think  I am right in saying - he  said  that

there could be no doubt that an Assistant Minister

is  the holder of an office of emolument under the

Crown  and is therefore disqualified. All I  would

say  in  answer to that is, because that point  is

appreciated, that the amendments to the  Municipal

Ordinance are now proposed by this Bill  in  order

to provide that he will not be disqualified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the observations made by the Member

for  Serangoon, I did try to explain in moving the

Bill  which  preceded this one in the Order  Paper

that  so  far  as the position of Members  of  the

Legislative Assembly is concerned, the point is  a

technical  one. I have referred to the  provisions

in  the  Colony Order in Council and I have stated

that  it  is  doubtful, and it is because  of  the

doubts   which   some   of  us   responsible   for

considering  questions of this kind  entertain  on

the  matter  that  the  provisions  of  this  Bill

provide, in effect, that there shall no longer  be

any doubt.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck:</b> On a point of information, Sir.

I  take  it that, from this remark, the  Hon. the

Attorney-General agrees with me that the Assistant

Minister is disqualified.



<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> What I have said is that, because

of  the view which I have expressed in moving  the

Second  Reading  of the other Bill that  Assistant

Ministers are disqualified under the existing law,

legislation has now been introduced.

<br><br><!-- Mr Butterfield -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Butterfield:</b> Sir, I move an amendment to

clause 4 of which notice has been given,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave out all the words after "new

section 8B" in line 3 and to insert-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"8B. For the removal of doubts it is

hereby declared that a person shall be deemed

not to have held or to hold an office of

emolument under the Municipality or the City

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Council by reason only that he has been or is in

receipt of an allowance in respect of his

service as a Commissioner or City Councillor as

the case may be."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the purpose of this amendment is to give

this removal of doubt clause a wider effect. The

effect of clause 4



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1228</b></font><br><br>



in  its  present form is restricted in the  sense

that  it only puts beyond doubt the  position  of

the  City Councillors on the City Council. The  new

clause,  Sir,  is  designed to put  that  position

beyond doubt not only on the City Council but also

where they are members of other bodies as well and

the  holding of an office of emolument  under  the

City  Council is a disqualification for membership

of  those bodies. An example of that, Sir,  arises

in the case of nominated trustees of the Singapore

Improvement Trust.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation is only concerned with minor

amendments to the Singapore Improvement Ordinance

(Chapter 259 of the Revised Edition). As will  be

seen from the explanatory note,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1231</b></font><br><br>



section  5 of the Ordinance is concerned with  the

constitution  of  the  Board.  It  is   considered

desirable  that  Ministers  serving  on  statutory

bodies  should be replaced by permanent officials,

and  clause 3 accordingly provides that the Deputy

Secretary  to  the  Ministry of Local  Government,

Lands  and  Housing  shall replace  the  Financial

Secretary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to clause 3, in view of the fact that

the  Singapore Improvement Trust now controls over

14,000  tenancies, which are increasing in  number

annually, it has become necessary to delegate  the

authority  to  sign  notices to other  appropriate

officers of the Trust, and to discontinue the  use

of   facsimile  signatures  which,  for   security

reasons, have never been used in practice.

minor amendments to this Bill. Sir, I beg to move.

<div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE INDUSTRIAL PROMOTION BOARD BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have the

recommendation  of His Excellency the  Governor  to

proceed on this Bill. I move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will recall my statement to this House

on  the  7th  of  November in connection  with  the

question of encouragement of industries. I promised

then  that I will bring up as soon as possible  the

necessary  legislation to this House to set  up  an

Industrial  Promotion Board. The need to  establish

such  a  Board  was felt by the International  Bank

Mission and formed one of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1234</b></font><br><br>



their  recommendations  in  their  Report  on   the

economic development of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst we want to encourage new capital to come in

and  set up new industries, we must not forget that

we  can  accelerate in this sphere of expansion  if

existing  industries could be helped to expand  and

if  existing  small factories could be assisted  in

modernising,  so  that  they can  manufacture  more

competitively,  thereby,  enabling  them  to  widen

their  market  and consequently to  increase  their

production.  In  fact,  if  we  can  produce   more

competitively,  we may be able to  overcome,  to  a

certain    extent,   the   tariff   obstacles    in

neighbouring countries. In Singapore, Sir, we  have

many  small  factories and some of these  factories

could  so  expand if they had the necessary  funds.

This Board will become the instrument through which

Government  could  give  the  necessary   financial

assistance to such deserving enterprises.  It  does

not  follow,  however,  that  the  Board  will   be

restricted  to  assist  only industries  which  are

existing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would invite the attention of hon. Members to

clause  4 of the Bill which gives the Board  powers

to  promote and manage new undertakings in case  of

need.  It  is proposed, Sir, that the Board  should

start off with a revolving fund of $1 million.  All

applications  for loans will be considered  by  the

Board on their merits and the Board will decide  on

the terms and conditions attached to every loan  it

advances.  The Board will be a body corporate  with

perpetual   succession  and  a  common  seal.   Its

membership    will   comprise   a    Chairman,    a

representative  of  the  Financial   Secretary,   a

representative  of  my  Ministry  and   two   other

Members, all of whom will be appointed by  me  with

the  prior approval of the Governor in Council. The

Chairman and the two Members already mentioned will

be   appointed   from  persons   having   practical

experience of matters relating to banking, finance,

industry  and trade administration. The Board  will

be  responsible for its own day-to-day transactions

but  may  be given broad directives by the Governor

in  Council on matters appearing to them to concern

the public interests.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1235</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure, Sir, that this Bill will be welcomed

by hon. Members. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>2.34 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  objects  of the Board,  as  defined  in

clause 4 of the Bill, appear to be wholly laudable

and  cover a very wide field and the powers of the

Board, as defined in clause 5, are themselves very

wide  and  high-sounding but I take  it  that  the

Singapore Industrial Promotion Board, when  it  is

established,  will, in fact, be,  as  it  were,  a

pilot   plant  for  a  larger  industrial   credit

corporation such as the Federation Government  has

in  mind to establish. The Explanatory Note states

that the Industrial Promotion Board will have -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...at its disposal a revolving fund to enable

loans to be made to local industrialists who  lack

the capital to acquire the equipment necessary for

expanding   their   production   on    the    most

advantageous economic basis."



<br><br>Apparently,  this sum is to be $1  million  which,

presumably,  will  be voted  by  the  Assembly  as

indicated  in clause 6. Now, $1 million  does  not

strike me as being a very large sum to dispose  of

and  I  shall  be  obliged  if  the  Minister  for

Commerce and industry will indicate what is  meant

by  "a revolving fund?" I myself have a fair  idea

in  banking  circles what is meant by  "revolving"

but  this  type  of loan would be granted  by  the

Board, almost certainly, on a long-term basis  and

I  shall  like to know, when the full  amount  has

been  absorbed, whether a further $1 million  will

be  voted for the disposal of the Board or  is  it

the  intention that as advances are repaid  which,

presumably,  will  take  a  very  long  time,  the

amounts  that  have been repaid will  then  become

available as part of the revolving loan. I  should

like some clarification on that point, Sir.



<br><br>2.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Koon Teck -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Koon Teck (Paya Lebar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we welcome this Bill. If we are to criticise it at

all,  it  will be only to say that perhaps  it  is

long  overdue and the amount allocated for  it  is

not sufficient to meet the needs.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1236</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past year, I have been greatly

disturbed  by  the  difficulties  met   by   small

industries  throughout the  country,  and  due  to

factories  having  to close down,  more  and  more

people are being thrown out of employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do hope that as soon as the $1 million which we

are  asked to vote today is absorbed in  loans  to

finance  and  promote industries, Government  will

come forward to request further replenishments  of

this amount.



<br><br>2.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

we  support  this Bill. This is a good  Bill.  The

principles  are that it will help local industries

and  small factories to improve their products and

modernise  their  plants.  However,  having   been

informed that the amount of money that is going to

be allotted to help industries here is $1 million,

I  ask:  how much help will these small industries

be  getting?  I had a talk with the office-bearers

of  the  bee-hoon  manufacturing industry  who,  I

think, closed down their factories some time  last

year  and they have, since then, been seeking  the

assistance of the Government. The talk revealed to

me  that they will require somewhere in the region

of  $300,000 to help them buy machinery, modernise

their  plant  and produce goods that will  compete

fairly  with imports from other countries. Now  if

we  have  $1 million and if we are going  to  help

this  class of manufacturers to the full, we  will

then  be expending about one-third of that  money.

Probably, the  next  category  of  industrialists

coming along for assistance will be those of  soap

factories  and that might absorb another one-third

of  that  $1 million. Again, recently, we had  the

biscuit  factories closing down with some of  them

moving  into the Federation and that might  absorb

another one-third. Therefore, we will have all the

three-thirds absorbed and if one will not revolve,

it will come to a standstill. I think that if help

is  going to come from Government, we must try  to

help  these people even more. I do not think  that

assistance in the matter of loaning them money  is

all the answer. If you are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1237</b></font><br><br>



going  to manufacture goods for local consumption,

the population of Singapore is only over a million

and  no  matter how much food you can  produce  to

feed the people, it will only be on a small scale.

The  aim  that  we  must  have  is  that  we  must

manufacture goods not only for our own consumption

but  also  for  export. Now, if we  are  going  to

manufacture  goods for export, then I  think  that

the  most  important thing is to find markets  for

the  outlet of our goods. I have said this  before

and  I am repeating it again. Singapore is a small

island  with the Federation of Malaya as its  main

hinterland. Taxation by the Federation  of  Malaya

is  hitting us hard. Industries are not  going  to

expand  in Singapore but they are going  to  shift

over  to the Federation. One of the industrialists

of the soap factories recently said that they will

save  roughly $150,000 in tax a year. If  this  be

the  case,  no matter how much help  we  can  give

them,   we  will  find  expansion  of  industries,

whether  light or heavy, not in Singapore  but  in

South Johore, probably around Johore Bahru. If  we

have  been considering ourselves as being part  of

Malaya,  it will be the duty of the Government  to

come to a better understanding with the Federation

and if we must be taxed, at least it could be made

more  preferential  than the  Empire  rates  as  a

gesture  of  good neighbourliness  and  our  close

connection  with  the  Federation.  However,   the

Federation Government is not the only market which

Singapore  has  been having all  these  years.  In

fact,  we  trade a great deal more with  countries

like Indonesia, Siam and Burma. It is not possible

to   ask   businessmen  to  help   themselves   in

negotiating with the various Governments  on  ways

and means of improving trade. Here is a case where

Government  can  try its very  best  to  see  that

conditions  for our traders will be  improved.  No

doubt,  the  answer  will be, "These  are  foreign

countries;  they are independent states;  they  do

not  depend on us for anything; and whatever  they

do,  they are responsible to themselves, and  they

look  after  their own interests." But  I  suggest

that no matter what, Government must find



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1238</b></font><br><br>



a  way whereby trade between these territories can

be  made  more  favourable for Singapore  and,  of

course,  even if we find a market, we  must  still

remember  that  we will be faced  with  very  keen

competition  from such manufacturing countries  as

Hongkong and Japan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of the Singapore Industrial Promotion

Board  should  be to help industries  to  such  an

extent  that they can produce goods at a cost,  if

not  comparable with that of goods  imported  from

other countries, at least at the same price as what we

pay  for  them. I think that if these methods  are

adopted and sincerely carried out, then there is a

hope that this Board will be able to do much more.



<br><br>2.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Cher Kheng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cher Kheng (Changi):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

everyone of us has read through clause 4  of  this

Bill; it reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Board may in order to facilitate the

industrial and economic development of the  Colony

promote  and  assist in the financing, management,

or establishment of -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) new undertakings;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) schemes for the better organisation and

modernisation  of  and  the  more   efficient

carrying out of any undertaking; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the conduct of research into the industrial

potentialities of the Colony."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the project is so nice and imaginative and

it  looks so practical and enchanting. I, for one,

will  take off my hat if the Minister for Commerce

and  Industry can carry out these objectives  but,

unfortunately, Sir, the fact which faces us  today

is that many factories have closed down since last

year  and  many more still will follow because  of

the  imposition of import duties by the Federation

of  Malaya. So now the Government introduces  this

Bill  but, to me, it looks like a mockery  to  our

local industrialists. They will simply laugh at us

and  say, "What are these crazy Assemblymen  doing

this  for? We are faced with the danger of closing

down our industries and yet they talk of doing  so

many  nice things and thinking up wonderful  plans

in   connection  with  this  Singapore  Industrial

Promotion  Board." Therefore, I wish to  put  this

suggestion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1239</b></font><br><br>



to  the  Government that, if they sincerely believe

that  this Bill is essential and important  to  the

people  of Singapore, they should try to have  very

close  co-ordination with the Federation of Malaya.

I  understand that they have a similar organisation

there  and  so  the  Singapore Government  and  the

Federation   of  Malaya  can  have  a   pan-Malayan

Industrial Promotion Board, otherwise we can  plead

with   the  Federation  Government  not  to  impose

unreasonable import duties on certain articles  for

certain industries which they promised us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I see no reason to support this Bill and

waste our time discussing it.



<br><br>2.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a pilot

scheme,  we  do not oppose this Bill. We  face  the

problem of an entrepot economy if we view Singapore

by  itself.  In fact, in the long run, if  we  take

Singapore just by itself, there is really no  point

in  having this Industrial Promotion Board.  But  I

notice in the Explanatory Note given at the end  of

the Bill, it reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Report of the International Bank Mission on

the Economic Development of Malaya recommended that

consideration  should be given to the establishment

of a

pan-Malayan institute of industrial research and  a

pan-Malayan industrial credit institution."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think for many years to come, even

taking  Malaya as a whole, that it is  possible  to

have  complete  State ownership of capital  and  of

industrial  potentials. Hence,  in  our  desire  in

common  with  all other Asian countries  to  expand

industrially  and rapidly, we have to  attempt  all

kinds  of  not quite orthodox socialist schemes  to

try  to  do  in  ten or twenty years what  European

nations have taken about a hundred years to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are however two dangers in this scheme. As

I  see  it, there are two difficulties: first,  the

Board   should   act  as  an  industrial   research

institute.   Now,   is  this  industrial   research

institute  going  to  carry out  research  only  on

Singapore potentials or on a pan-Malayan basis?  If

it  is  to  carry  out research only  on  Singapore

potentialities,  then I suggest that  we  send  the

Industrial  Promotion Board to Hongkong where  they

carry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1240</b></font><br><br>



on,  I  am  told, a very lucrative, if  perhaps  an

ephemeral  entrepot trade, and that is the  end  of

the  matter.  If  we are to carry out  research  of

lasting  value,  then it must be on  a  pan-Malayan

basis  and  there  must be co-ordination  with  the

Federation. I think that the latter view of  a  one

Malaya   has  become  accepted  in  the   political

thinking  of  all political Parties  in  Singapore,

though   once   upon  a  time,   we   had   curious

"organisations"  like the Progressive  Party  which

believed that Singapore should go it alone.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second difficulty - this is an even graver

one - is  that as an industrial credit institute,  it

becomes  a sort of a jackpot into which friends  of

influential  politicians could dip  their  fingers.

Some  countries in South-East Asia have tried  this

technique.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if a proposition is a sound one, whether to

start  a new industry or to expand an existing  one

or  to  modernise it, there will always  be  sound,

hardheaded, if somewhat ruthless businessmen,  like

Mr Sutherland, who will advance that money-



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Not so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What is not so: that he is

ruthless or that he is a sound business-man?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> Sound.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> He has decided obviously to

pack up from South-East Asia and advisedly so

<br><br><!-- Mr Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sutherland:</b> On the contrary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> - because people like him, I

think,  will find it very difficult to get on  with

the  national industrial plants that may spring  up

as  a  result of such Industrial Promotion  Boards.

But, as a matter of logical argument, I do not  see

how  we can explain this. If it is a sound business

proposition, a bank will advance it. If it is not a

sound  business proposition and the  whole  capital

may  be  lost, then the Industrial Promotion  Board

should  not  advance. Where then is this  in-between

class that, where although a bank will not advance,

yet it will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1241</b></font><br><br>



right,  it  will  be good for the economy  of  the

country  and it will be a fair risk for the  Board

to advance money? I hope to be enlightened on this

particular category of enterprises by the Minister

for  Commerce and Industry. I would like  to  know

what   would   be  the  sort  of  directives   his

Government   has   in  mind  for  the   Industrial

Promotion Board. But we must warn him that  if  we

try to do foolishly what other neighbouring South-East  Asian  countries  have  done,  all  we  will

succeed  in  doing is to create a corrupt,  effete

and decadent group of quasi-political opportunists

who will start all kinds of scatterbrained schemes

to  enrich themselves and those in power with whom

they  conspire. That must never be the  object  of

this Bill.



<br><br>2.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

there   is   no  harm  whatsoever  to  have   this

Industrial Promotion Board. Singapore, as  I  have

said  before, has not got anything of its own  raw

material resources to supply its own industries to

manufacture  anything cheaper. On the other  hand,

as  the  first necessity to produce or manufacture

anything,  you must have low costs  of  labour  or

handling  charges which you have not in Singapore.

Then you have to compete with other countries from

all over the world. We are just starting to learn.

Many  countries  have experimented  and  succeeded

with  their  industries. What I would  suggest  is

this.  We have at present no hinterland which  can

take our products without imposing any duty. Where

are  we  then to sell except to Singapore  and  to

outside  countries? In Singapore itself,  we  have

plenty   of   competition  from  foreign   imports

produced  on a scientific basis and mass-produced.

I   can   visualise  one  thing  good  that   this

Industrial Promotion Board can do to this City and

that  is  to  promote  small-scale  industries  or

cottage-industries.

You  can  employ our idle population  who  sit  at

home, possibly the ladies who do not want to  come

out  and work in factories or the children  during

their  leisure  hours. This lesson can  be  learnt

very easily-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1242</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr A. J. Braga):</b> Child

labour.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Not child labour at all. Those

children  who  have  spare  time  can  help  their

mothers  or  sisters or old parents  in  producing

something to help themselves. In this case, we can

easily  seek  the help of the E.C.A.F.E. experts.

Various  advanced countries today like  India  and

Ceylon  have  established very  good  centres  for

their  cottage and small-scale industries. I think

that  if we are to proceed on those lines, we will

be   truly  helping  our  own  population  but  to

institute  a research for big-scale industries,  I

think it is quite outdated unless you have a  vast

hinterland  and if at all you have to  do  it,  it

should be on a pan-Malayan basis.



<br><br>3.00 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy</b> rose-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> In reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> In reply, Sir. Mr Speaker, I

would  like to assure this House that this scheme,

at  the  moment, is a pilot scheme  and  the  part

where  it is considered a pilot scheme appears  in

the  footnote at the end of the Bill where it says

that $1,000,000 will be provided for the Board and

I  did  mention also that to start the Board  off,

the  Government propose to provide $1,000,000. The

legislation  need  not  be  considered  as   pilot

legislation because as and when the Board requires

more  funds and as and when this Assembly provides

the Board with such more funds, the scheme can  be

expanded. It is my intention, when I find that  $1

million  is  not sufficient, to come  up  to  this

House  and  ask  for more funds.  I  am  glad  the

reaction of Members of the Opposition is that they

consider  that $1 million is not enough  and  that

makes it easier for me to approach this House  for

more  funds when needed but I would like to  draw

hon. Members' attention to clause 6 which states:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the Minister may make advances to the

Board  from such moneys as are voted for  the

purpose by the Legislative Assembly."



<br><br>Therefore, the Board is not tied up with  just  a

million dollars which I am proposing to provide in

the first instance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1243</b></font><br><br>



and  I  understand that the resolution to  provide

this  $1  million will be coming up  in  the  next

sitting  and  will  be  moved  by  the  Hon. the

Financial Secretary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> What is a revolving fund?



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> A revolving fund is a

technical  term. It means a fund  from  which  you

lend  out  money and as the money comes  back  you

lend  that  money out again to somebody  else.  It

keeps  on  revolving  and,  as  suggested  by  Mr

Sutherland, it is possible you might find that the

money  does not revolve sufficiently fast  enough.

If  that happens, I will come up to this House for

more money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Down the rat-hole.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I think that the same point

was  raised by the Member for Serangoon  (Mr  Lim

Choon Mong) and the Member for Paya Lebar (Mr Lim

Koon  Teck): whether more money would be provided,

and I give this assurance that I will not hesitate

to come up to this House for more money.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> If it is justified.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I want to compliment the

Member for Serangoon on his ability at mathematics

in  working  out  that  the  $1  million  will  be

exhausted in three instalments of $300,000  but  I

must  sound  a  note of caution  that  this  Board

should not - I repeat not - be regarded as a Board  to

give  out money to all those who come and ask  for

it,  just for the mere asking. You will notice  in

the  Bill that a rough system is provided  on  how

the Board will grant the loans. Clause 4 (2) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"...the Board shall have due regard to the

economic  and commercial merits of any undertaking

it  promotes,  assists, finances  or  manages  and

shall  also take into consideration in considering

such  economic and commercial merits, the economic

merits of any other undertaking in which it has an

interest  and  the  economic requirements  of  the

Colony as a whole."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, for the Board to advance a loan, the major

considerations   are:  What   are   the   economic

requirements of the Colony;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1244</b></font><br><br>



whether  the  applicant fits in with the  economic

requirements of the Colony as a whole; if he does,

whether  he  has a proper business proposition  or

not? Also the Board can appoint one of its members

to  sit on the managerial board of the undertaking

it  finances to keep an eye on its activities. Now

I  think that also deals with the question  raised

by  the  Member  for Tanjong Pagar (Mr  Lee  Kuan

Yew).  He  mentioned  that the  Board  will  be  a

jackpot   into   which  friends   of   influential

politicians  could  dip their fingers,  etc.  Sir,

that was one of my worries too because I have seen

that  happening in other countries and I have been

very  careful here to see that the powers  of  the

Minister  are minimised and that more  powers  are

given  to the Governor in Council, so that if  you

have  a  Minister who may probably try to use  his

influence, you will find that the matter  will  go

to  all  the  other Ministers in  the  Council  of

Ministers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> They share it equally.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Well then, you can say that

the  whole of Singapore is corrupted, if it  comes

to that.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> We must not assume that the

P.A.P. will-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I hope not. The Minister has

no say about whom the money should be given to. It

is  the Board that will decide and the Minister is

entirely  out  of the picture as far  as  that  is

concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we come to the defeatist speech of the Member

for  Changi (Mr Lim Cher Kheng) and other Members

who  have  referred to this question of Federation

duties.  That question, Sir, has been referred  to

in  this  House many, many times in the  last  two

months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> It is very important.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> I admit that it is

important. I have spoken on that question  myself,

Sir,  in this House and even this morning,  I  did

mention  it  when  questioned by  the  Member  for

Queenstown (Mr Lee Choon Eng). Sir, I have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1245</b></font><br><br>



said  before  that the adverse effect  of  these

duties  is  causing me grave  worries.  We  have

taken  the  matter  up at the  highest  possible

level  with the Federation Government  and  they

have promised consideration but beyond that, you

cannot  force  their hand. It is absurd  to  say

that you can force another Government to do what

you  want them to do but what you can do  is  to

make   an   approach,  make  them  realise   our

difficulties and, as good neighbours, hope  that

they will co-operate with us. They have promised

to  consider  the  matter. The  Hon. the  Chief

Minister  and  the Minister for Finance  of  the

Federation are not here at the moment; they  are

both  in London, and I hope again to pursue  the

matter  further  when both  of  them  return.  I

admit,  Sir,  that  some of our  industries  are

badly  affected  and some of them  may  have  to

close  down. Probably, some of them are thinking

of going across to the Federation but I say that

if  any  industry  wants to  go  across  to  the

Federation,  it  is having a shortsighted  view.

We, Sir, in Singapore offer port facilities that

are  the  best  in the East. We  have  a  highly

developed banking and insurance system. We  have

highly developed business skills here and though

an  industry,  in Singapore, may  find  that  it

comes  up  against  tariff barriers  across  the

Causeway, it can more effectively deal with  the

export  market outside Malaya. That  is  what  I

said in my introductory speech to this Bill:  if

we can bring down the cost of our production and

if  we  can produce more competitively, then  we

have a chance to survive and overcome the tariff

obstacles.  It  is  no use  taking  a  defeatist

attitude  and saying that just because  of  this

tariff  policy of the Federation, we should  sit

back  and  do  nothing  about  it.  That  is   a

defeatist attitude, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon mentioned about

trading with Indonesia. Sir, he is not aware  of

what my Ministry has been doing in the past. Two

months  ago - I believe, in September - certain  new

regulations  came  up  regarding  barter  trade,

restriction on shipping, and so on, and we  took

the  matter  up strongly through the  Indonesian

Consulate here. Within a week, I am glad to say,

we managed to put matters right and to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1246</b></font><br><br>



revert  the position back to its level where  it

was  before the new regulations had come  in.  I

have  not publicised these things because  I  do

not consider it will be any good publicising all

these things. We are dealing with foreign Governments  and  we must be very circumspect  in  our

references to them. We want to maintain friendly

relations  with them and, as has been  mentioned

by  the Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy),

we have nothing of our own as we are an entrep�t

trading   community.  In  order  to   get   more

employment for our people, we are now trying  to

develop  our industries but we have to  be  very

careful how we talk about other Governments  and

we  have  to  see  that we maintain  a  friendly

attitude  towards them, so that  we  can  go  on

trading with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to say, Sir, that this Bill is not a

mockery  as  what  the Member for  Changi  said.

Probably,   you  can  call  this  Bill   "timely

succour".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was mention of "curious organisations"

like  the Progressive Party. Well, Sir, we  have

to thank this curious organisation a lot for the

difficulties  we experience with the  Federation

now! If the Labour Front had been in power,  you

would not have had this, probably.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, the clause that provides for the Board to

carry out research is clause 4 (1) (c). That  is

a  provision made in this Bill just in  case  we

find  it  necessary that the Board should  carry

out  research into the industrial potentialities

of  the  Colony.  It is to give the  Board  more

power.  It does not necessarily follow that  the

power  will  be  used. It is possible  that  the

research  may  be  carried  out  by  a  separate

organisation entirely but in case we  find  that

we  are limited in scope and we want to do it on

a small scale, it is possible that the Board can

do  it  then.  That is why we have  given  this

power to the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report of the International Bank Mission on

the  Economic Development of Malaya  recommended

the establishment of a pan-Malayan institute  of

industrial research and a pan-Malayan industrial

credit institution. Sir, my colleagues and I  on

this  side  of  the House will be the  first  to

admit that the ideal approach to the economy  of

the Malay



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1247</b></font><br><br>



Peninsula  as  a whole would be on  a  pan-Malayan

basis but we have found that we have not been able

to  get agreement on a pan-Malayan basis from  the

Federation Government and therefore we have to  do

it  now  on  our own. But this does not close  the

door  to  a  future  merger of two  such  separate

institutes in Singapore and in the Federation  if,

at  a  later  date, we find that we come  to  some

political  agreement. The answer to all this  pan-Malayan approach is that it is a political  answer

and not an economic answer. Economics are dictated

by political ideologies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was reference made, Sir, to cottage

industries. Personally, I am not convinced that we

can  have much cottage industries here because  we

do  not  produce anything much that would go  into

these industries, but that is something to which I

have  never closed my eyes and which we will  have

to  investigate. If we do come across any sort  of

possibility of establishing cottage industries, we

will not hesitate to give it our full attention. I

can give that assurance to this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

annulling the regulation".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object is this: that as it stands, clause 14

(3)  is  not adequate. It is possible that we  may

not  have a sitting of the Assembly within  three

months  of the coming into force of any regulation

and therefore the Members of the Assembly will not

have  a  chance  of being able to  exercise  their

<div align="center"><b>(CHAPTER 166)</b></div>



<br><br>3.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly, pursuant to subsection (1) of

section  106 of the Income Tax Ordinance  (Chapter

166), resolves that the Government of the State of

Brunei be added to the First Schedule to the  said

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Government of Brunei has invested sums

in  certain Singapore Municipal stocks and has now

requested that the interest on its holdings should

be  exempt from Singapore income tax. The  general

position  of Governments under the Crown  is  that

the  income of one such Government arising in  the

territory of another is exempt from tax imposed by

the   second  Government  unless  the  income   is

expressly charged to tax in the taxation  code  of

the second Government. For example, in the absence

of  any  specific imposition in the United Kingdom

law,  funds  of  this Government invested  in  the

United Kingdom are free from United Kingdom income

tax.  There is some doubt in the minds of the  law

officers whether this immunity from tax which does

not   appear   to  rest  on  statute  extends   to

territories  under Her Majesty's  protection;  for

example,  the  protected state of Brunei.  In  the

circumstances,   it  is  usual  to   exempt   such

protected territories specifically from tax.  This

can be done by including the territory in question

in   the  First  Schedule  of  the  Ordinance   by

resolution  of the Assembly under section  106  of

the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I need not stress, Sir, the material advantages of

exempting investments of the Brunei Government  in

the Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1250</b></font><br><br>

beg to move.

have  His  Excellency the Governor's authority  to

move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of

$540,291 shall be supplied to the Government under

the  heads  of  expenditure and for  the  services

specified  in the Schedule contained in  Sessional

Paper No. Cmd. 2 of 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a short list of applications for

supplementary  votes. It consists of  items  which

either  could not have been foreseen at  the  time

when  the  annual Estimates were prepared  or  had

not,  at  that time, reached the stage of finality

which would have permitted their inclusion in  the

annual Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons necessitating the applications are

given  fully  in the Cmd. Paper and my  colleagues

and  I shall be happy to answer any question which

hon.  Members  may wish to raise. Sir,  I  beg  to

move.

<br><br>3.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the reason

why I have not tabled any amendments is because it

would have required the Governor's consent and  it

is doubtful if the Governor would allow Members of

the  Opposition to interfere with  the  terms  and

conditions  of  service of certain  officers,  but

that   does   not  debar  us  from   making   some

observations  on  "Subhead 1,  new  item - Permanent

Secretary (Establishment), Grade C ($1,950) . .  .

$23,400".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the local Press recently, there has been

some debate as to what sum of money should be paid

to   local  men  who  take  over  these  Permanent

Secretaryships. Those of us who look forward to  a

spirited  service  from  our  civil  service   are

delighted  to see that their leaders  are  men  of

calibre,  men  who understand that, with  merdeka,

comes the opportunity for greater service and  not

greater  loot.  I am sure though  that  not  every

member  of the civil service who is either  hoping

now or, at some future date, to become a Permanent

Secretary  and  enjoy  the  sum  of  $1,950   plus

Variable  Allowance, Travelling  Allowance,  etc.,

may  be  in agreement with the proposal  of  their

Association's President and Secretary that  $1,770

would  be  quite adequate and that, in  fact,  the

trend  should be downwards, not upwards.  Sir,  we

are   inheriting  a  false  standard,  a  standard

created by our white mandarinate who came overseas

because  they  could not do as well "at  home"  in

England.  As  we  take  over  these  positions  of

control,  we  must understand that the  difficulty

facing  us  is not the difficulty of getting  more

loot because whilst we are in control, we can fill

our pockets. The difficulty is one of remaining in

the saddle and of preventing the whole system from

collapsing. There is what in Marxist terminology



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1252</b></font><br><br>



would  be  called  a  revolutionary  situation  in

Malaya.   There  is  a  state  of  unrest.   Men's

attitudes  and  minds  are  undergoing  a  violent

change. Before the war, we might have found  peons

quite  happy and contented; the officer whose  car

door he opens every morning as he faithfully waits

in  the  rain for him earns in one month  what  he

earns  in  20  months. Even today, a peon  in  the

Government  service gets somewhere around  $120  a

month,  compared  to the Permanent  Secretary  who

gets  somewhere around $2,400 a month. Anyone  who

is familiar with peons, not when they are in their

livened uniform, now minus red stripes despite the

desire of the Hon. the Chief Secretary to put them

in  livery,  know that they are not happy  at  the

thought that they earn 1/20th of what is earned by

the  men whom they have to answer to when the bell

rings. What he earns in one month, the peon  earns

in  20  months.  Hence, this desire  for  a  rapid

transformation  in society. I was  glad  to  note

that  one  of  the  serving officers  in  a  Press

statement  said  that  the  trend  is  towards  an

egalitarian society.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are some Members of this Assembly who,

when they got elected, thought that the purpose of

their  coming into this Assembly was to put  up  a

badge on their cars and inform the world that they

were above everybody else and that they should  be

given  the right of way. Some have even suggested

that Ministers should have little pennants just as

the   Governor  has  the  Union  Jack,  the  Chief

Secretary   has   the  flag  of   Singapore,   the

Commissioner  of Police has a little blue  pennant

and  the  Vice-Chancellor  of  the  University  of

Malaya  has an enormous blue flag with a tiger  on

it. Nowhere in the world have we a Vice-Chancellor

flying  a  pennant.  It  is  like  those  Japanese

occupation   days   when  every  colonel,   major,

brigadier flew either a blue, red or yellow  flag.

If  we  try  to maintain positions of  privileges,

then the whole system will collapse.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two ways in which we move towards an

egalitarian society: one: we ease ourselves gently

as  those  who have given and those who  have  not

taken and evolve a new society; two: where the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1253</b></font><br><br>



whole   social   order  crumbles   and   a   tight

revolutionary dictatorship takes over and  creates

by  force, if necessary, the new order of  things.

There  are some societies in this world that  have

avoided  such a violent and a painful  revolutionary  process.  One is Sweden. Let me  just  inform

hon.  Members  in this House what  an  egalitarian

society  means in a democratic Socialist  country.

The Director of the Swedish Railways gets

3,000-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I was just wondering how a

lecture on the egalitarian society has anything to

do with Head 8.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, it is very important in

this   respect,  that  although  Members  of   the

Opposition cannot move an amendment to reduce  the

salaries  of  the permanent officials  who,  as  I

pointed  out, are earning in one month what  their

peons take 20 months to earn, yet, I would like to

bring the attention of the Government to the  fact

that  unless they lower these scales and boost  up

the  scales  of  the under-paid groups,  there  is

going to be a revolution and a violent one.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> The only point I would like to make

is that there is nothing to prevent an hon. Member

from  giving notice of a motion to reduce any item

in any Head of expenditure. Of course, he might be

faced   with   having  to  obtain  the  Governor's

recommendation or consent, but I do not think that

he  is entitled to assume that he will not get the

recommendation or consent of the Governor.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Sir, I have, on one previous

occasion, sought the Governor's consent to discuss

conditions  of service of some class  of  officers

which I have now forgotten. It was connected  with

the emoluments of the civil service. It was flatly

turned down and those were in the days when we had

a Chief Minister who was very keen on exposing the

white civil service and all their misdeeds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if I may just wind up my argument: I was

pointing  out  that the Director  of  the  Swedish

Railways  earns 3,200 krone as against 1,800  krone

for his



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1254</b></font><br><br>



engine-drivers.  In other words, the  Director  of

Malayan  Railways should get under twice what  his

engine-driver gets. I do not know what  the  exact

figures  are  but I am quite sure that  it  is  in

multiples of ten that the Director compares to the

engine-driver.  I think that if the  Labour  Front

Members  had met - as the Chief Minister met - a  very

distinguished Israeli, Mr Moshe Sharett,  Foreign

Minister  and  Acting Prime Minister,  they  would

have  discovered that the highest paid man in  the

Israeli  Government cannot be paid more  than  six

times  the lowest paid man. On that basis,  I  ask

the  Government  to review the adoption  of  false

European  standards, superimposing them  over  our

local mandarinate.



<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir,

I  support most of the sentiments expressed by the

leader of the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> He is a Socialist.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I also take

off  my hat to the local men who are going to take

over  the  Permanent Secretaryships  for  offering

that  their salaries be reduced. Now this  is  the

way  in  which  you  can  make  progress  in  this

country.  The  money saved will thus  go  to  meet

other expenditure with the result that there  will

be  less  taxation and the masses will benefit  by

it.  I  have always said that the Ministers should

follow that example and copy the salary scales  of

the  Indian  Civil Service, Ceylon and Burma.  You

have  got to bring down your expenditure and  then

only  you can spend more money for the welfare  of

the country.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the comments made

have  covered  a  very  wide  field  running  from

University flags to Swedish railway drivers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Engine drivers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Engine drivers. It shows how little

we in Singapore have to do with the railways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer, I gather, has joined

the People's Action Party and taken off his hat -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1255</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Not in the least, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> Perhaps, he has not joined the Party

and still has his hat on.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> That is to the local men.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goode -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goode:</b> He referred - I do not doubt, from

knowledge-to events in neighbouring countries  and

that  is a very relevant point to the issue  which

has  been  raised. I understand, Sir, that  in  at

least  one neighbouring country, when they reached

independence,   they   did   introduce   a    very

considerable cut in the salaries which, no  doubt,

they  had inherited from their particular type  of

"mandarinate" - I think that is the  word - and  I  am

advised,  Sir, that the result of that, no  doubt,

patriotic  gesture at that time, was very  adverse

to  the interest of the country. I mention that by

way  of  starting to comment on the  remarks  made

because  I  would like Members of the Assembly  to

regard this proposal to reduce the salaries of the

civil   service  as  one  that  has   considerable

complications and one that should be treated  with

caution and with due consideration. Do not  please

get led away into a quick decision by two or three

"men  of  calibre" who have given  tongue  in  the

Press  but  have not yet thought fit to  make  any

representations  to the Government.  There  are  a

number  of points which have got to be taken  into

account  in  dealing with what may, at first  sight,

seem  a very attractive suggestion, that there  is

the  local  man  to  take over from  the  overseas

officer  and that it is patriotic and  right  that

the  rates of pay should be reduced. First of all,

of  course,  there is already a reduction  between

what the local man gets and what the overseas  man

gets.  The overseas man still draws that wonderful

and  much  discussed  extra pay - expatriation  pay.

Now,  local  officers do not  get  that  and  that

should  be  remembered when  you  are  considering

relative  salaries.  But  there  are  other   very

important   questions  which  you  have   got   to

consider. First of all, you must relate  what  you

are going to pay the top men in your civil service

to the structure of the service as a whole. Two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1256</b></font><br><br>



years ago, we revised the superscale structure  of

the civil service and when we were doing that,  it

was  my very keen desire personally to reduce  the

number of superscale grades. I thought we had  far

too many and I made a great effort at that time to

try  and reduce the number of grades down to about

three. Well, I found I could not do it. So we have

now  got five grades running from the top  of  the

timescale  to these posts of Permanent  Secretary.

Now,  if  you  are going to reduce your  Permanent

Secretaries down to $1,770 a month, then obviously

you  have  got to do one of two things:  you  have

either  got to reduce the number of grades or  you

have  got  to  downgrade every  grade  below  them

including the top of your timescale. Now,  it  may

be that that would be a good thing to do and it is

possible that the top of the ordinary timescale is

too  high. If you start reducing the top  of  your

timescale, then you may have to consider  reducing

the  bottom of your timescale and you are involved

in a very complex business of revising your salary

scales throughout the whole Government service.  I

do not think that you can change one series of top

posts    without   getting   involved   in   those

complexities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another very important point is that you must

bear  in mind the comparable rates of remuneration

which  can  be obtained by local people  in  doing

similar    type    of   work   in   non-Government

establishments. You must relate the remuneration a

man  can  get in the Government service  with  the

remuneration  he  can probably  get  in  your  big

industrial  business concern. If  you  do  not  do

that,  then you only get a second-rate  man  going

into  your public service and, of course, you must

consider  very carefully the rewards that  can  be

obtained in the professions. Now we have  a  legal

service in the public service and we must  have  a

good legal service. In order to recruit your legal

service, you have got to compete with the  rewards

that  are  won  by people at the Bar  and  if  the

rewards   cannot  possibly  be  commensurate   and

reasonably  related, then you  will  not  get  the

right type of man to be your legal adviser and you

will not get



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1257</b></font><br><br>



the  right  type of men eventually  to  fill  your

posts of Attorney-General and on the Bench.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think I need say any more but I would

just  stress that while, at first sight, it  seems

attractive,  we  should  not  jump  to   a   hasty

conclusion,  that  because  a  certain  number  of

individuals have made a gesture - no doubt,  a  very

fine gesture - of having their salaries reduced,  we

should  at  once accept the offer. It  is  a  more

complicated business than that and if the view  is

held that the salary scales throughout the service

that  are inherited are too high, then the  simple

remedy  is to reduce the variable allowance  which

is provided for that express purpose and leave the

main  structure  unaltered,  unless  you  wish  to

become   involved   in  a  very  complicated   and

prolonged business.



<br><br>3.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, it is rather

interesting  to hear the Member for Tanjong  Pagar

cite as examples what happens in Sweden and Israel

as  a  pattern  upon  which  we  should  base  the

salaries  of our Government service. I would  like

to  ask  the hon. Member in how many multiples  of

ten  does  he  earn  a year as compared  with  his

lowest  paid clerk or even his highest paid clerk?

Is it a question of do as I say but not as I do?



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the Hon. the Chief

Secretary just explained to us that we should  not

be   carried  away.  May  I  enquire  whether  the

lowering  of  salary scales is under consideration

by the Government?



<br><br>3.45 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Yew Hock (Chief Minister and Minister for Labour and Welfare) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Minister:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, the Hon.

the  Chief  Secretary has already  said  that  the

Government has not received any official  approach

from  the  officers  concerned and  therefore  the

Government is not in a position to consider it but

there  is  one  other  point  which  we  must  not

overlook. In the drawing up of a salary scale  for

civil  servants  in Singapore, all the  Committees

that  have  sat on the question of a salary  scale

tried to evolve a salary



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1258</b></font><br><br>



scale  on  the basis of the rate for the  job.  In

their view, the rate for a Permanent Secretary  is

$1,950 a month. Surely, it does not mean now  that

just  because an Asian is going to take  over  the

job,  he  cannot qualify for the job and that  his

rate should be lowered?



<br><br>3.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, it is a sad

thing  to see the head of what professes to  be  a

Socialist Government talk about whether a  man  is

worth  the  rate  for a job and say  that  if  you

reduce  the  salaries of the  officers,  it  is  a

slight  on them. It would reflect on their  merits

since  it  would be said that they are  not  worth

what  their European counterparts are worth.  Does

he  not  understand that there are  values,  human

incentives,  which money cannot buy? That  when  a

man  says, "I will give up this because I  believe

that  it  is going to do good," that man is  worth

much more than the man attracted and retained with

expatriation pay?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sir - just an aside to the Hon. the Minister

for  Health - I  think  he  was  conscience-stricken

because  he  was  on  the  House  Committee   that

recommended the badges for cars. Let me inform him

that far from not doing what I preach, I sincerely

believe  in  everything  that  we  say  about   an

egalitarian society. It might interest him to know

that  if he goes back to the legal profession,  he

will find that there is a trade union of employees

of  lawyers' firms whose leaders include employees

of my firm.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> Answer the question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I am afraid that there is very

little  which  I can add to what has already  been

said in this matter. I would say this: none of the

officers  who  are  making this gesture  have  yet

performed  the  duties of the  post  of  Permanent

Secretary. If they fulfil the duties and bear  the

responsibilities of the post in full, as I am sure

they  will, I can say, in all sincerity, that they

will  earn every cent of the salary now fixed  for

the post.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> And a C.M.G. too?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That the sum of $10,000 for Head 26 stand part of the Schedule."



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, can we be

informed  as  to  what  good the  Royal  Singapore

Flying  Club is doing for the people of Singapore?

Is  it  a  Club  engaged in entertaining  its  own

members or in flying?



<br><br>3.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Sir, since the Member cannot inform

himself,  I  will be glad to inform him. A  flying

club is a club which helps people to fly and it is

very  valuable  in Singapore that we  should  have

many  people  who  are interested  in  flying  and

competent  to fly. It forms a reservoir of  flying

talent and an encouragement to the young men to go

into  civil aviation careers. We are hoping  that,

in  the  next  few  years, we  shall  get  a  very

significant expansion of civil aviation  here  and

it  will  be a sad story if we have to import  the

expatriates,  who  so  irritate  the  Member   for

Tanjong  Pagar  and the Member for Serangoon  too,

instead  of using our own local boys. It  is  with

the   idea  that  the  Flying  Club  can  make   a

significant contribution to the ab initio training

in  certain  cases and perhaps, more valuably,  to

the general air-mindedness of Singapore, that this

contribution is proposed. You will not get a  high

standard  in a few people unless you have  a  wide

interest  amongst many people. Not every badminton

player  in  Singapore hopes to play in the  Thomas

Cup  matches  but you get a high standard  in  the

Thomas Cup matches because there is a general



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1260</b></font><br><br>



interest  throughout  a very  large  part  of  the

population  and the same thing applies broadly  to

any  of  the skills, arts and techniques of modern

life - that  you  need to have  a  large  number  of

people interested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know how much detail the hon. Member

would  like me to go into. I can go into  a  great

deal if he would like me to-



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Choon Mong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> What about the Malayan Air

Training Centre?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> The M.A.T.C. is one organisation

providing a certain amount of training; also,  the

Malayan  Auxiliary Air Force. There  is  also  the

present  Royal Singapore Flying Club and  I  think

all these three are necessary and, to some extent,

inter-related,  particularly the  Royal  Singapore

Flying  Club which has given a certain  amount  of

assistance  to  the M.A.T.C. The Flying  Club  has

also issued 99 licences to European members and 38

to Asian members but in August last, there were 16

European  student  pilots and  12  Asians  in  the

Flying Club. In other words, you can see that  the

Asian  proportion  is steadily moving  upwards  in

relation to the European proportion. This delights

the  Member for Tanjong Pagar: he is hoping to put

me  off  and embarrass me by my seeing  his  broad

grins.  Why  he should regard it as humorous  that

Asians should learn to fly - and there should be as

many  Asians  flying, I hope, soon, as  there  are

expatriates at present - I cannot imagine.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Why did you not support Malayan

Airways?



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> It is not clear what connection

Malayan  Airways  has  with  the  Royal  Singapore

Flying  Club  except, of course,  that  they  did,

through the Flying Club, get the training for some

of  their  pilots. Does he prefer that the  pilots

should not get the training?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have already said enough to indicate

the  value of the Flying Club but I can come  back

to it again if further questions are asked.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> I do not know if the Minister

for  Communications and Works had ever visited the

Flying Club.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1261</b></font><br><br>



I  myself never had that privilege but I do know  a

number  of  friends who regularly visit  the  Club.

They  spend  their  time more on drinking  than  on

flying. Incidentally, it is one of the few bars  in

town  that open up to the very early hours  of  the

morning.  To  grant a subsidy of $10,000  in  order

that we should teach British pilots how to fly  and

go   and   attack   the  Egyptians  is   absolutely

outrageous.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I grinned broadly because I wondered, whilst

the  Minister was talking, whether he  believed  in

all  this piffle that is being put over, that  this

$10,000 subsidy-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. It took some time for that

word   to   sink  in  but  I  think   "piffle"   is

unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> If I have to withdraw "piffle",

then I will say all the poppycock that is being put

over.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I am afraid that "poppycock"

is also unparliamentary.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Kuan Yew:</b> Well, Sir, to use quite a

neutral word "waffle".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are urged to give $10,000 to a select

group  of  men whose social habits take  them  into

expensive  pursuits and whose eventual  benefit  to

the  community  is more than speculative.  We  were

enthralled with the vision of this $10,000 creating

mass  enthusiasm for flying: everybody  paying  $10

for  a joy-ride to be taken up into the air. We are

told  that one day we might have an air force. When

I  last  debated Malayan Airways in this  House,  I

mentioned to the Minister the fact that not one  of

the  pilots had been trained in Malaya, that  there

was  no  local  man as captain of any aeroplane  in

Malayan  Airways and that all the local pilots  had

been  trained overseas. He did not lend his support

for  what I was then urging, namely, that he should

impose conditions in the new franchise to see that,

within  a  definite space of time, local  men  will

take over the flight operations of all aircraft  of

Malayan Airways. Then, he talked about factors



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1262</b></font><br><br>



of  confidence:  that if you change  these  pilots,

there  may  be  air  crashes  and  loss  of  public

confidence  in air travel. Well, let  me  tell  him

this.  We  on  this  side  of  the  House  are  not

impressed by his waffle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, Sir, we want to know on what basis was

this $10,000 computed? We first attack the grant on

principle.  When we have acquainted ourselves  with

the  basis of that figure we may attack the  figure

itself.



<br><br><!-- Mr D. S. Marshall -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr D. S. Marshall (Cairnhill):</b> If it please you,

Sir,  I am a member of this Club at which the  hon.

Member has seen fit to fling a waffle. I have  been

a  member for some 16 or 17 years, Sir, and  joined

it to learn flying, shortly after the Munich talks,

when  I hoped to be able to be of some use to  this

country. I must say that though I tried very  hard,

I  failed, but I cannot remember ever having  spent

the  early hours of the morning at the bar  of  the

Club,  Sir, It may well be that my learned Friend's

nocturnal  habits give him a greater experience  in

this respect but whether they do have a bar or not,

it  does  not  mitigate from the utility  of  their

activity  to the community. The fact that they  are

giving training to those who are prepared to  avail

themselves  of  this opportunity  is  something  of

which   we  must  take  cognizance.  It   will   be

prohibitive unless they have a subsidy. If it is of

value to the country -



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. Moment of interruption.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the

Committee and took the Chair of the Assembly.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, some progress has been made on this

particular  item  and  I  ask  leave  to   continue

tomorrow.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Tomorrow it will be.
