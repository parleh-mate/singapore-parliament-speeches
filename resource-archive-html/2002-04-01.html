<div align="center"><h4>PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>Debate on the Address</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(First Allotted Day)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the following Address in reply to the Speech of the

President be agreed to:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore,

express  our thanks to the President for the Speech which  he

delivered on behalf of the Government at the Opening  of  the

First Session of this Parliament.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we Singaporeans have, in the short

space  of the last three to four years, received many wake-up

calls  in our relatively cosy rooms.  In his Address  at  the

Opening  of  the  First  Session  of  this  Parliament,   the

President   has  elaborated  on  the  challenges  confronting

Singapore.  I would like to relate these challenges to what I

see  as the three wake-up calls at the individual Singaporean

level.   I  shall  begin with the one  that  is  ringing  the

loudest and most incessantly.



<br><br><i>Wake-up Call Number 1</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we thought were unshakeable areas of competitive

advantage that Singapore has are now vulnerable, and this  is

largely due to a confluence of several factors:  firstly, the

global  slowdown led by the US economy; secondly, challenging

regional  economic  and political conditions;  and,  thirdly,

increasing competition.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a regional hub, Singapore will face intensifying

risks of losing key parts of the critical mass.  I would like

now  to discuss this against a backdrop of shifts in economic

growth concentration and investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, economists are projecting that economic growth in

our  immediate region of around 3-4% for each of the next two

years will be overshadowed by the North Asian region, led  by

a potential 7-8% growth in the huge China market.  If we were

to  consider  this concentration on an even wider perspective

and  think  GNP  rather than GDP, then China's reach  extends

even further.  China has taken a strategic decision to invest

abroad  for a variety of reasons, including plans  to  secure

new  supplies  of natural resources.  According  to  the  Far

Eastern  Economic  Review, Chinese state-owned  offshore  oil

company,  CNOOC  (China National Off-Shore Oil  Corporation),

plonked  US$585  million  for some  Indonesian  oil  and  gas

assets.   In Australia itself, Chinese investment,  primarily

in iron ore and aluminium businesses, stood at US$1.2 billion

at last count.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, long-range planes, when available, or huge

shipping  alliances, may not need to call  at  Singapore,  if

there  is  no  business  reason  to  do  so.   Therefore,  an

excellent Changi Airport or a successful PSA alone  will  not

get  us  very  far.  Likewise, our stronghold on  derivatives

trading in the region will constantly be challenged unless we

give reasons to traders to always use us, and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to move on to the twin effects of

technology and globalisation on competition itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, globalisation itself is already increasing

competition,  and  technology is  accelerating  the  pace  of

globalisation.  So businesses are now growing slowly,  if  at

all, and only if they adapt.  Businesses cannot sit still and

let  uncomfortable trends destroy them.  Not to  react  would

only mean they die out.  Businesses really have no choice but

to react ruthlessly, and this would come in many forms, eg,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>



downsizing  in  response to a dip in demand, very  much  like

what we have seen in the travel business in the aftermath  of

September 11 (911); secondly, relocating lower-end production

out  of Singapore; thirdly, bringing in talent from elsewhere

to  keep  the business going; fourthly, merging for  critical

mass,  such  as that we have seen in the banks;  or  fifthly,

even getting out of certain businesses altogether.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these factors have an impact at the individual

level.  Whilst retrenchment at the personal level is painful,

it  would  be  better to accept such restructuring  as  harsh

realities  than  to hope that something can be  done  by  the

Government   to  these  seemingly  unsympathetic   banks   or

ungrateful large companies.  Even if our jobs were intact, we

would  have to accept that we would probably have to do more,

learn  new  skills  and  adjust to  new  working  conditions,

perhaps all at the same time.  For those of us who have  been

retrenched, new employment would be difficult to come by  and

would most likely mean taking a lower pay and position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the individual level, self-esteem will go down

and  this  is  where the moral support of the family  or  the

community  can  be  extremely helpful.  There  are  anecdotal

signs that more marriages come under stress when one partner,

especially the breadwinner, loses his job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what are some of the hopes we can hold on to and

those that we should inject a sense of reality?  Sir, we  can

certainly  cling onto the assurance that the Government  will

continue  to  devote plenty of resources to developing  human

capital  to  the  whole  spectrum of pre-school  to  tertiary

education, for skills upgrading, re-skilling and job-matching

whilst  ensuring  at  the same time  that  we  anchor  enough

economic  activity in and from Singapore into the  global  or

regional  market.  As long as we are proactive and receptive,

we  will be able to receive help on adapting to changing  job

and market demands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, we would also have to manage our wage

expectations.  For the past decade, our wage growth has



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>



averaged more than 7% in nominal terms and about 5%  in  real

terms.  This will no longer be a sure thing, which means that

we  can no longer use this assumption to make investments  or

consume the way we could have in the past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, there will also be a change in the

employer-employee  relationship.  We now  have  less  control

over our working lives and loyalties to companies will weaken

as  we  realise that companies can no longer be paternalistic

and avoid laying off workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a nutshell, this wake-up call is all about

change,  and having to cope with a more rapid pace of change,

much  of  which is uncomfortable.  Most of the jobs that  are

lost  are gone forever so we should not hold out for a US-led

recovery and for a return of the same old jobs.  Instead,  we

have  to  continually make ourselves relevant  and  think  in

terms  of  our  skills, ie, what we can  do  and  contribute,

rather than the jobs we would like.



<br><br><i>Wake-up Call Number 2</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We Singaporeans have to work towards preserving our

racial  and religious harmony, that harmony will not continue

as  a matter of course, and that external events and stresses

can  attack  our harmony.  Until the infamous  911  terrorist

attacks  in  the US, the war in Afghanistan, the fighting  in

the  West Bank and some other events, we did not realise that

we  need  to  pay attention to our own racial  and  religious

harmony.  Now, Sir, we realise that these external events can

surface or resurface old issues stemming from differences.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wake-up call can cut both ways. If we allow it,

external stresses can undo whatever precious harmony we  have

built  up,  or  we  can  become even more  conscious  of  the

differences   between  races  and  religions  and   seek   to

proactively integrate and understand even more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have come a long way in fostering inter-racial

and  inter-religious ties.  As a small country, we  can  ill-afford



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>



to let external events and external influences exert pressure

on us.  In a nutshell, we must jealously guard our racial and

religious harmony.



<br><br><i>Wake-up Call Number 3</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wake-up call, which probably takes on a more subtle

and dull tone, is that we Singaporeans have to take ownership

of  our  future and strengthen our sense of belonging to  the

country and to one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is a need to bond even closer to increase our

survival as a small nation with no natural resources.   There

is  also  a  need to give the Government full moral authority

and support so as to bring about the much-needed wide-ranging

and transformational changes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sense of ownership to Singapore and one another is

all  the  more important because of our aging population  and

the  need  to help fellow Singaporeans cope with the digital,

information and wealth divide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the key really is, how do we react to these three

wake-up calls?  Do we break out in cold sweat or have we been

tossing and turning and dreading the wake-up call, or  do  we

arise and take these changes in our stride?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we break out in cold sweat, we should check why we

have  fears and concerns and how we can address them.  If  we

have  just  lost  a job that we have had for the  past  15-20

years,  then we can try examining what skills and  experience

we  have  accumulated and seek to apply these skills to  jobs

outside  of the natural industry.  If we now shudder  at  how

insecure   our  surroundings  have  become,  no   thanks   to

terrorism,  then  we  should discuss  with  our  friends  and

community how we can look out for each other.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if we have been tossing and turning, and

dreading  the  calls, then we should no longer wait  for  the

seemingly  inevitable events to happen.  Instead,  we  should

actively  look for alternatives and explore opportunities  to

learn new skills for other jobs.  We should also not allow



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>



isolated  incidents of inter-racial discord  to  fester.   We

should  actively reach out to friends and fellow Singaporeans

to gain a better understanding and build common ground.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above all, if we have been alerted to these challenges,

we  can  then take all these in our stride - assess  what  we

have  to  do  and  how we can respond to yet another  set  of

challenges or changing circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to conclude by observing that we have

a  lot  going  for us.  We have huge savings as a  nation,  a

sound  financial  and  physical  infrastructure,  substantial

goodwill from the Singapore branding - in terms of integrity,

transparency   and  an  excellent  workforce   -   and   most

importantly, political and economic stability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can therefore embrace the changes to policy and

strategies  that  the Government will have  to  painstakingly

undertake  and  be  receptive  to  the  need  for  a  change,

especially at the personal level.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that Singaporeans are a pragmatic and

sensible lot and the resounding mandate of 75% at the last GE

reflects, firstly, a common destiny and appreciation for  the

need  for  survival in challenging times and,  secondly,  the

trust the Singaporeans have in the PAP Government to take  us

through  the necessary transformations, and to help  us  cope

with change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I  rise  to speak in support of the Motion  of  Thanks,

moved  by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, to the President for his  Address

in  this  House  a week ago.  Before that,  may  I  offer  my

congratulations to you and the newly elected Deputy Speakers.

I  am sure that the high standards of decorum and dignity  in

Parliamentary  debate  set by your distinguished  predecessor

will be continued.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, observers might have remarked before that

proceedings in this House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>



were  conducted in a tame, even somnambulistic manner.  There

might  have been some video evidence of this after  we  moved

into  this  House, where no corner of this  Chamber  is  left

uncovered  by  a  TV  camera or from the sharp  eyes  of  the

reporters above us.  I say this now as a victim of  the  all-seeing electronic eyes, so that our new colleagues would not,

well, be caught napping.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure that we will be entirely rid of soporific

speeches in this Tenth Parliament, but let us hope that  with

the  measures announced to "liven" up debates in this  House,

such  speeches would be in shorter supply.  Lest I be accused

of  inducing  sleep,  may I say at once that  I  believe  the

measures announced recently would go some way to help  foster

more lively debates, but the effectiveness of them remains to

be  seen.   How  willing will Ministers  and  others  in  the

Government  accept the challenge to re-examine  policies  and

legislation, how often will they accept suggestions to set up

Select  Committees  to  examine the language  and  impact  of

proposed  legislation,  how willing are  they  to  engage  in

debate, and even concede to a winning argument - we will have

to  wait  and  see.  Indeed, Sir, I think there is  one  more

thing  worth  emphasising - and that is, there  should  be  a

signal  from  political leaders that our civil servants,  the

ones dealing with the everyday running of the country, should

also listen and may I say, more frequently, listen with their

hearts rather than applying policies and rules blindly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if the truth be told, in fact, the man-in-the-street sees the Government in its most elemental form through

the  actions of civil servants and other public officials  he

deals  with, and not through the comparatively rare occasions

when  he actually listens to a speech by a Minister or  other

political  leader.  If the public were to have confidence  in

the  Government, it would be through how responsive the civil

servants  or public officials are to their problems,  whether

it   be  their  summonses  for  traffic  offences,  or  their

utilities  bills  or their HDB problems or  their  children's

schooling problems.  Too often, we have seen replies that are

hardly helpful and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>



the  response  is  very frequently in  terms  of  a  negative

decision,  without any reason being given.   The  citizen  is

left  in the dark to contemplate his next move, which  is  to

see  the  MP,  who is also in the dark, as he is seldom  told

more  than what is told to the citizen.  This gives  rise  to

further  appeals  and  further  letters  of  rejection   from

officers  who  follow  policies laid down  without  question.

Sometimes,  I  wonder  whether  any  GLC  has  a  controlling

interest in the paper industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there would be a quantum leap in confidence

building  if we can have public officials who take the  extra

step  to  view  such  appeals as appeals from  an  individual

rather than from a class.  We want civil servants in this new

era who do not take comfort in the uniformity of replies.  We

want  public  officials who can think.  We  also  want  civil

servants who can feel - civil servants whose hearts  are  not

left  at  home when they go to work every day.  To  borrow  a

phrase from American Express, never leave home without it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me illustrate with an example from HDB. (I should

state at the outset that I admire HDB's comprehensive replies

to  residents on every conceivable problem that might  arise.

I  am  only using this illustration because many Members must

have  faced this problem.)  I refer to the treatment of cases

where the owner in the recession that we are facing now wants

to  change  down from his original choice of flat because  he

can  no longer afford it as he had lost his job and means  of

support.  The stock answer is that if you have not stayed  in

the  flat  for five years, you cannot sell, whether  you  can

afford to pay for it or not.  If there is a genuine case,  if

someone  has been retrenched and is making a painful decision

to change down, why do we prolong his agony?  Sir, the way to

foster meaningful relationships between Government and people

is  to  allow  the official to take the extra  step,  without

adverse  consequences  to  himself or  herself,  to  question

policies  and  to  see whether a reasonable solution  can  be

reached,  whether an exception to a policy can be  justified.

Otherwise, we will have a civil service that is recognised as

being  super  efficient, but which remains out of  sync  with

those whom they serve.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the President's Address contains much to think

about  and  to debate on.  Its key message seems to  be  that

Singapore  must  "remake"  itself  to  face  tougher   global

competition  and  global terrorism.  Economic  restructuring,

social  cohesion and political renewal - these are the themes

that  will  matter  in  the  remaking  of  Singapore.   Quite

frankly,  the themes are the same as those in the  making  of

Singapore  since independence.  What is different is  in  the

ways and means in which we seek to "remake" Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot agree more that entrepreneurship and risk-taking must be encouraged, and that our young people must

have  a  more inquiring and adventurous spirit.  But I cannot

agree,  as stated in the President's Address that "developing

arts,  sports and a stronger civic society" would be part  of

the  process  to  bring this about, as  if  developing  arts,

sports  and  a stronger civic society is a means to  bringing

about   entreprenuership.   I  should   have   thought   that

developing arts, sports and a stronger civic society are ends

in themselves, not as a means to foster entrepreneurship.   I

am  not  sure  that  the  founder  of  Creative  Technologies

indulgently  sees himself as an artist, poet or writer.   And

the  Sound Blaster card, we are sure, does not write music  - it merely reproduces it, or more accurately, blasts it out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, literature, poetry, arts, music - these are the

things  that define the culture of a nation, the  soul  of  a

nation.   They should be encouraged so that Singaporeans  can

see themselves in prose, in poetry, in art or in music.  They

add  to the uniqueness of being Singaporean. As for sportsmen

and  women  who  excel  and do Singapore  proud  in  schools,

constituency,  national or international  competitions,  they

are  to  be  valued  for  their  sporting  achievements,  and

hopefully   not   for   their   entrepreneurship   potential.

Singaporeans  draw  together to salute  such  achievers.   If

anything, they help promote national pride and solidarity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must adopt the development of the arts and sports as

primary aims, and not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>



as  secondary aims to promote entrepreneurship.   I  want  to

emphasise this in case an argument is made that certain types

of art or music have no economic or entrepreneurial value and

therefore  should  not be encouraged or supported.   We  must

avoid  this  type of thinking.  I am sure that  some  Members

will  return  to this theme in the next few days  or  in  the

Budget debates to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Address rightly refers to the widening income

gap between those who are able and willing to embrace the new

technologies  and those who are not.  We are  already  in  an

economic  recession - and many Singaporeans  have  faced  the

traumatic experience of being out of a job.  With a family to

feed,  and  no job on the horizon, it takes a lot  out  of  a

person.   Many Members of this House would have had  to  deal

with  many jobless persons - you can see the despair and  the

frustration. They have lost their dignity - and they  do  not

want pity.  They accept but are not satisfied with an interim

grant  to  them to tide things over.  They just want  a  job.

Being jobless affects not just one's income, but one's belief

in  oneself  -  and  above all, the family's  belief  in  his

ability to provide for their basic needs and happiness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Address signals the Government's

determination  to  tackle  this problem.   Job  creation  and

retraining of our workforce remain top priorities for the new

Government.   But, one particularly difficult  problem  which

hitherto  still remains unresolved is how do we  provide  for

the  increasing  group  of jobless  workers  who  are  either

unwilling or unable to retrain or find jobs.  The problem  is

particularly  acute for those around 50 years old.  Who  will

provide  for  them?  Very often, for those about  50  or  so,

companies  do  not  want  them  even  after  they  have  been

retrained.   I believe that this problem needs to be  tackled

immediately.  Do we need regulation or legislation to make it

unlawful  for  employers who refuse to hire on the  basis  of

age,  if  the  applicant  otherwise  has  all  the  necessary

qualifications?  I know that we do not want to put  too  many

barriers for employers - but on occasions, some are justified

so that we can forestall a serious social problem.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as we move from the economic to the political, one

of  the  most  positive  statements in  the  Address  is  the

intention  of  the  Government to "widen  the  out-of-bounds"

markers for political engagement and debate, not just in this

House,  but generally in Singapore.  We must once again  wait

and  see  how  these  OB markers will be  defined.   What  is

interesting too is how this intention is read by the  younger

generation.   I asked my daughter who recently  finished  her

Junior  College  studies how she and her friends  would  view

this increase in freedom.  Her answer in a way surprised  me.

She  said  that some feel (I suppose including herself)  that

the  intention is not quite genuine.  Somehow they feel  that

the  Government  will  still control  the  exercise  of  such

freedoms and will only pretend to listen.  We must take steps

to  remove such doubts and cynicism among the young people in

Singapore  -  indeed, among all Singaporeans,  otherwise  the

problem will remain unresolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that care must be taken in this move

towards   greater  opportunity  for  the  people  to  express

themselves.  We do not want a situation where the expressions

of  individual  opinions turn into a claim  for  rights,  and

where legal action is always contemplated.  I know many young

people,  especially those familiar with the law, look towards

well-developed countries such as the US or the UK and  bemoan

the  fact that we do not have an administrative law structure

that   allows  individuals  to  challenge  public   servants'

decisions on a myriad of matters.  But in this, my opinion is

that  we should be careful about putting such decisions  onto

the  legal  plane for it takes away the discretion  from  the

people  who can resolve the matters without going through  an

elaborate  legal process.  The truth is, so long as  we  have

wise  leadership, willing to listen and to take into  account

individual  circumstances in the special case, we  should  be

able to "remake" Singapore, not in anybody else's image,  but

one that is uniquely our own.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be confidence in all Singaporeans that they

will be listened to.  But all Singaporeans must also exercise

their  freedoms  reasonably and  responsibly.   It  must  not

degenerate into a series

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>

of   demands  based  on  self-interest.   We  must  have  and

cultivate a politically sophisticated population - willing to

see  and understand the wider picture even if it impinges  on

their  own interests.  Then, and only then, can the Singapore

heart-beat be heard to beat as one.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion of thanks.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Jalan Besar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  support the motion standing in the name of Mrs  Lim  Hwee

Hua.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significant events of last year and especially

September  11,  2001 showed us that times have  changed,  and

changing ever so dramatically.  Globalisation which was  just

a   concept   not  too  long  ago  has  become   a   reality.

Transformations are taking place on the global scale that  we

need  to  change our perspective in the way we  do  business,

work and live.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In globalisation, local happenings are shaped by events

occurring  many  miles away.  The terrorist  attacks  of  the

World  Trade  Centre  Twin Towers in New  York  have  brought

threats  to  our door-step in Singapore.  It is a frightening

revelation  that  even  terrorism  has  taken  on  a   global

perspective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation offers us both challenges and

opportunities.   For a small country with  a  small  domestic

market,  globalisation  provides  us  with  opportunities  of

larger markets.  It also means stiffer competition from  more

countries competing against us, especially for foreign direct

investments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen what happened during the 1997 Asian

Financial  Crisis and the staggering impact on  the  regional

financial  markets.  Thomas Friedman in his book,  The  Lexus

and  the  Olive Tree:  Understanding Globalisation, used  the

term  "the global herd" to describe the millions of investors

world-wide, who can be stampeded into running from an economy

by the slightest signal of danger.  It is very important that

we keep the reputation of our financial institutions



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>



intact  and  maintaining a system that is  open,  honest  and

transparent.   When we adopt very high ethical  standards  in

the public, private and people sectors, we will win the trust

and confidence of investors in the long run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been much talk about PSA Corporation's loss of

Maersk  Sealand to the Port of Tanjung Pelepas in  Johor  and

the competition hotting up between Singapore and Malaysia  in

port  services  and  the risk of other major  shipping  lines

exiting   from  Singapore.   Malaysia's  attempt  to  compete

against  Singapore in port services is not new.  It was  Port

Klang,  then Pasir Gudang and now Tanjung Pelepas.   Malaysia

has  also  developed  the Multi-Super  Corridor,  the  Sepang

International   Airport  and  Senai  International   Airport.

Singapore  cannot prevent external competition  whether  from

Malaysia  or elsewhere.  The way for Singapore to respond  is

to  do  so  calmly by examining ourselves, our strengths  and

weaknesses  and  take all necessary measures  to  tackle  the

competition and come out tops in the long run.  I think it is

too early and premature to conclude, as some pundits seem  to

suggest,  that  PSA  Corporation has already  failed  in  its

ability  to  compete.  What is needed is for  the  Government

Ministries  to  take  an  integrated  and  multi-disciplinary

attitude in providing PSA Corporation with all the assistance

it  needs to compete.  PSA Corporation will have to  stay  on

course  and  remain  focussed,  taking  a  systems  and  team

approach  in  meeting the competition head on.  By  providing

highly  cost  competitive  and  value  added  services,   PSA

Corporation's management and workers, working together,  hold

the key to winning the competition and doing Singapore proud.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in meeting Singapore's increasing demand for land,

we should make no apologies to anyone in our extra efforts to

reclaim  more land within our territory for future  use.   We

owe  it  to our citizens to cater to their housing and  other

land  needs.  We also need to secure our land for the present

and future generation of Singaporeans.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian politicians are an irksome and incredulous

lot.   They  should know that Singaporeans are  a  discerning

group who has wised up to their antics in the issues they try

to  stir  up.  These no longer cut any ice with Singaporeans.

Instead,  they  have  helped to rally and  bond  Singaporeans

closer  together.   In the workplace, we  have  this  saying,

"Idle  minds are the devil's workshop."  Singaporeans can  no

longer  be  idle.   To  stay ahead, we cannot  afford  to  be

distracted  by unproductive, frivolous and meaningless  talks

and  utterances.  In everything we do we are  accountable  to

the  stakeholders.  We have to be prudent and frugal  in  our

financial  stewardship.  In times of crisis, we are  prepared

and  ready  to  weather the ups and downs of economic  cycles

better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are living in times of a highly volatile economic

environment.   With  the  process of  employment  destruction

taking  place in the Singapore labour market, this has  given

rise  to  greater  insecurity and job uncertainty.   For  the

first  time  after  many years of strong economic  growth,  a

large  number of managers, executives and professionals  have

been  thrown out of work.  Who would imagine that  even  well

qualified and experienced senior staff could lose their  jobs

through  retrenchments?  The sign is clear that with economic

restructuring, no one is spared from the effects.  All levels

of  staff have just to be prepared to make the next move  and

move  on.   There is no longer the stigma when someone  loses

his  job  because  of  mergers and acquisitions  and  company

restructuring.  However, I believe employers can adopt a more

open  and  humane  approach  when  releasing  surplus  staff.

Employers  should  give  affected staff  as  much  notice  as

possible  to help them to come to terms and prepare  for  the

next  job  move.   Time could be given to put  surplus  staff

through relevant training and skills upgrading programmes  to

equip  them  for new jobs.  In this way, those  who  are  not

immediately  affected can take comfort that when  their  turn

comes  and their services no longer required, they can  leave

the organisation graciously and with their dignity intact.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid the larger scale retrenchments in the

future, I wish to propose that the tripartite bodies  of  the

Singapore  National Employers' Federation, the NTUC  and  the

Ministry of Manpower work out schemes of arrangement to  make

it  easier for employers to periodically place out staff that

the  company  does not need.  By having regular out-placement

exercises  in small numbers, the companies may be saved  from

the trauma and distress of retrenching large numbers of staff

at  one  go,  and worse still, do so during hard  times  when

there  is  a  dearth  of alternative jobs in  the  employment

market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's home grown entrepreneurs usually come from

the  small and medium enterprises (SMEs).  They are the  ones

with  the  most prospects and potential to grow further,  and

appropriate help should be extended to them.  I  am  glad  to

read  that SPRING Singapore, the new name for PSB, is  giving

all  the support they can to the SMEs.  These SMEs also  need

to  professionalise their management.  I hope that many young

aspiring   professionals  and  executives   will   join   the

management  ranks of the SMEs to help them develop  and  grow

further.  I do not believe that only the very large companies

can  benefit from the global markets.  Our SMEs can also find

their  rightful  places in niche markets.  The  SMEs  usually

attract  less public attention and with their lower  profiles

can  strike  profitable ventures for themselves  in  overseas

markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also not forget the traders and merchants who

are  doing  roaring  overseas businesses.   The  High  Street

Centre  merchants  have been concerned for some  years  about

their long-term future.  Incidentally, High Street Centre  is

in  my  constituency.  These merchants have established their

business contacts and network with customers from the  Middle

East  and the Indian sub-continent for many years.  I am glad

that only recently the URA has finally decided to retain  the

High Street Centre which is across Parliament House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the Wholesale Centre at Victoria

Street, again in my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>



constituency.    This  group  of  dry  goods  merchants   was

relocated  from the former Ellenborough Market  at  Tew  Chew

Street to make way for the construction of the North-East MRT

Line.   This  enterprising group of wholesalers  has  trading

businesses  with  many  overseas  countries  including  Latin

America.   Over  the  years,  in  our  efforts  to  redevelop

Singapore's  urban landscape, we may have unwittingly  caused

the demise of some important segments of our old economy.  We

should not close down businesses just because they belong  to

the  old economy.  Some of these businesses can be viable and

highly profitable.  It would be a shame that we lose them for

good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the coming decade, we have reached the stage of

development  and  the capacity to generate  4-5%  growth  per

year.   Singaporeans have to moderate their expectations  and

plan  their  own  future  with this prospect  in  mind.   The

challenge  before  us  is  to seek  and  understand  what  is

happening in the world around us and to adapt and respond  to

the  changing times.  With inspiring and visionary leadership

and a people with a positive attitude supporting and cheering

each other along in the steep climb, I have no doubt that  we

will still make it again in the next decade and beyond.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Thank you, Mr

Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to join in the debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the President's Speech. I think that

what the President said in his speech are no exaggeration and

are true.  However, a journalist in The Sunday Times reported

that  the  Government  is reverting to  its  rule  of  crisis

tactics  again.   I  do  not think  that  the  Government  is

exaggerating or trying to create a crisis situation  when  it

says  that,  "In  2001  the  US economy  slowed,  the  global

electronics  industry  slumped, and we experienced  our  most

severe  recession since independence.  .The  next  few  years

will  present  us  with  the most severe  challenges  in  our

nation's history."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have been a Member of Parliament for 18 years,

and during that period



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>



Singapore experienced three recessions: one in 1984/85,  then

again in 1998/99, and now in 2001/2002.  The present round of

recession is probably the worst of the three.  All HDB  shops

in  my  constituency,  without exception,  complain  of  poor

business.   And at my weekly meet-the-people-session,  I  get

regularly  one or two applications for jobs per  week  either

from my own constituency's residents or from persons of other

constituencies.  Whereas in the past recessions,  I  did  not

get  any applications for jobs at all.  I have no doubt  that

the  recession this time is the worst of the three recessions

I have come across as an MP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the challenges to be faced by our nation in the

next  few  years, I think they are also very real.  The  most

obvious challenge shall come from China.  They have a massive

population of one billion people.  The workers there are just

as  intelligent, hardworking and disciplined as our Singapore

workers  and  they  have made a success of  whatever  foreign

investments  that  have been ploughed into their  country  so

far.   If one visits America, one cannot escape the fact that

nearly  all clothing, toys, jackets, shoes, towels  and  many

other  retail items are made in China.  Those goods that  are

made  in  China and sold in America are of very high quality.

I  am  certain that this is not the end of the road but  only

the  beginning.  There shall be more investments brought into

China from America and other developed western countries  and

it shall certainly affect Singapore and the region.  It shall

not  be  easy  for Singapore and the region  to  get  foreign

investments  from  now  on because of  the  competition  from

China.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign investments shall not only go to China in

massive  scale  but also go to other copy-cat countries,  for

example,  Dubai.  I have been informed by a banker  in  Dubai

that  that  country has fashioned its economy after  that  of

Singapore.  Dubai even starts its own airline, the  Emirates,

like that of SIA of Singapore.  From what I see, the Emirates

Airline is now operating very successfully.  It certainly can

give SIA a run for its money.  Its fare structure, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>



believe,  is even more competitive than that of  SIA.   In  a

recent  stopover  at  Dubai, I noted that  that  enclave  has

become very prosperous.  Dubai has also a high percentage  of

foreign workers, showing that its industries are booming.  As

for  Singapore's  attempt to branch into  higher  value-added

industries, like the IT business and industries in  the  life

sciences, and attempts to attract foreign talent, we are also

beset  with  challenges from Japan, Korea,  Taiwan  and  Hong

Kong.   It  appears that there are no easy solutions  to  our

problems.   It looks like indeed we have to truly settle  for

lower growth rates, growth rates at single rather than double

digits  of  the  past, unless, of course,  we  make  material

changes to our present situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has set up the Economic Review Committee

to  try to find solutions to maintain our high growth and  to

sustain our prosperity.  But what can this Committee do?   It

cannot  really do much.  There is no quick-fix to the present

world economic recession.  It is a case of over-production in

the  world economy.  It is a cyclical phenomenon.  The  world

shall just have to sit this one out.  As for Singapore,  what

can  we  do?   I suppose the Committee shall recommend  cost-cutting  measures and be more competitive.  The last time  in

1998,  it  was  our  workers  who  bore  the  brunt  of   the

Government's  cost-cutting measures.  I sincerely  hope  that

that remedy is not used again.  It must be recalled that  the

workers'  10% employer's component of CPF cut has  still  not

been  fully restored.  It would be most unfair to our workers

if  their  CPF is cut again when the damage done to them  the

last  time  has  still not been made good.  I hope  that  the

labour  MPs in this House shall fight for the workers' rights

not  to have another CPF and pay cuts.  My view is that  this

time  round, the Government should suffer some of  the  cost-cutting   measures,  if  any,  and  not  the  workers.    The

Government  could forgo some of its taxes, levies,  fees  and

charges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now with a change of economic situation in the world,

the  Government  intends to change its political  and  social

paradigms.  It now falls on Singaporeans



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>



to  be more inquiring and to adopt an adventurous spirit.  It

wants  Singaporeans to be leaders in business,  to  be  great

entrepreneurs,  to  take more risks.  I would  say  that  the

Government is probably 20 years too late.  Twenty years  have

been  wasted  mainly  in  trying to contain  the  Opposition,

instead  of  spending that time to open up  our  society  and

allow more freedom, allow more people who are not sympathetic

to  the  PAP to speak up.  I would say that if that had  been

done,  the  spirit  of leadership and entrepreneurship  would

have  been  built up in our people.  Instead, the  Government

took  those  20 years to teach Confucianism in  our  schools,

heralded the virtues of Confucius.  What that means was  that

Government  wants  the people to be more subservient,  to  be

more  obedient and not to criticise Government  policies  too

much.   What happened in those 20 years was that the  private

sector was subdued and could not be vibrant and dynamic,  and

only  the  Government side took the initiative.   That  means

more  Government-linked companies are formed and there  would

be  only in-breeding in our business environment.  No wonder,

most  of  our  industrial activities are connected  with  the

manufacture of electronic goods.  Once that sector  collapses

in the world market, Singapore gets into a bad recession.  We

have not diversified enough in our industries as there are no

entrepreneurs to take the lead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other initiative taken by the Government is to have

greater  social  cohesion.  The Government  feels  that  with

greater economic changes, there shall be more dislocation and

adjustments by our people.  With greater social cohesion, the

people  can  cope better with the faster pace of  change.   I

would agree with what the President said on those points.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotion of entrepreneurship of our people and the

inculcation  of greater social cohesion are all  one  of  the

same  issue.   They are social and political  in  nature.   I

would  say that the success of the Government's intention  to

open  up  our  society to encourage entrepreneurship  and  to

build  greater social cohesion shall depend mostly on how  it

treats the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>



Opposition.   If  the  Government  continues  to  treat   the

Opposition very shabbily, as it is doing now, then the people

know that the Government is not sincere and shall not respond

positively.  At the moment, the Opposition is treated like  a

step-child.   The  Government, as far as I  know,  has  never

officially said that it recognises the Opposition as  one  of

our  national  institutions, and that the  Opposition  has  a

rightful  place  in Parliament.  Instead, it  says  that  the

Opposition  shall  drive  our  foreign  investors  away  from

Singapore; the Opposition shall only be disruptive, which are

all  not true.  The Opposition has an important role to  play

in  Singapore's nation-building process, especially  at  this

time of globalisation where competition shall be fierce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Government wants to succeed in its new programme

of  encouraging  entrepreneurship and promote  closer  social

cohesion,   then  it  must  change  its  treatment   of   the

Opposition.   It must treat the Opposition more  civilly  and

show some respect for the Opposition, for after all they  are

elected by the people and not appointed by the Government and

they  are paid by taxpayers' money and not by the PAP.  As  a

concrete  proof of the Government's sincerity in  wanting  to

build  social  cohesion, it must first restore the  walled-up

areas  of the void decks for Opposition MPs to have a  proper

place  to meet their constituents.  The Opposition MPs cannot

be  treated like roadside fortune-tellers.  There  cannot  be

social  cohesion where the two Opposition representatives  of

the  people  are not shown the proper respect  they  deserve.

Social  cohesion can only be promoted in Singapore where  the

Government  treats the whole population equally  and  fairly.

The  Government must stop its discriminatory attitude towards

those  who  voted against the Government candidates  in  each

election.   The  Government must stop  its  policy  of  using

Government programmes to punish those who refuse to vote  for

it  by saying that should the people not vote its candidates,

then those constituencies will get their flats upgraded last,

or   that   the   MRT  line  shall  not  run  through   their

constituency,  or  that the MRT station, having  being  built

there,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>



shall  not be opened.  How can the Government hope  to  build

social  cohesion  if it practises discrimination?   I  really

hope  that  the  Government is really sincere in  wanting  to

build  social cohesion in Singapore and immediately stop  its

discrimination towards the Opposition MPs, Opposition members

and  Opposition supporters, for they too are Singaporeans and

have an important role to play in nation building.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ong Seh Hong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I support the motion standing in the name of the Member

for  Marine  Parade  GRC,  Mrs Lim Hwee  Hua,  to  thank  the

President  for  his  Address at  the  Opening  of  the  Tenth

Parliament..   The  President's Address outlines  the  severe

tests  and  challenges  that Singapore  is   facing  and  the

Government's  determination to counter such  challenges.   In

her  speech, Mrs Lim mentioned that the Presidential  Address

has  sounded three "wake-up calls", reminding us that we must

work   together   with  the  Government  to  overcome   these

difficulties.   Can  Singapore sustain  its  success  stories

after  our  pioneers  have stepped  down?  The  key  to  this

question lies with the quality of our nationals.  There is  a

saying  in Hokkien, "A generation of centipedes, a generation

of  earthworms."  Will the nationals of Singapore become less

and  less  capable,  turning  from  a  generation  of  strong

centipedes  to  that  of  some weak earthworms,  or  will  it

transform itself into a generation of robust, flying dragons?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that in this area, education plays a very, very

important  role.  Education  is  the  key  to  the  long-term

survival  of  our people.  But promotion of education  should

not  be  confined  to  the Ministry of Education  alone.   It

should be the concern of everybody. Everybody must take  part

in  the  learning process. In the Addendum to the President's

Address, the Minister for Education reiterated that  we  must

implement policies which can bring out the best potential  of

our  students, so that they will not only be able  to  master

the skills and knowledge, but also possess the right attitude

and values.  Here, I am not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>



trying  to  advertise for the film "I Not Stupid".  But  this

film  has given rise to a lot of discussions and talks  among

our people. It emphasise the importance of education. It also

shows that our people are deeply concerned with our education

system,  especially  the streaming system.   Are  there  many

defects and faults in our streaming system?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our human resources are limited, Mr Speaker, Sir. If we

want  to  bring out the potential of every citizen,  we  must

also   teach   the  students  according  to  their   ability.

Streaming is only a way, a means.  But why after more than 20

years  of  implementation, there is such a reaction from  our

people?   I  would  look at this question in  three  aspects:

Firstly, the expectation of the parents and the perception of

the  society in general. Something is apparently wrong  here.

Secondly, the attitude of the schools towards those  students

who  are  being streamed into EM3 or ITE.  And, thirdly,  the

age  at which students are streamed.  These three points  are

inter-related.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our society, general importance is attached to the

position  in school.  As a result, parents' expectations  for

their  children are very high.  Because of this,  for  better

results,  a  lot  of parents put a lot of pressure  on  their

children  so  that the children are made to  feel  averse  to

learning.   This becomes a vicious cycle.  In  addition,  the

society  and parents also have a wrong perception on the  EM3

and  the  ITE or technical education stream.  "I Not  Stupid"

described ITE as "It's The End".  This is a typical example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the society regards those weak in

learning  and  slow  in  learning as born  losers.   This  is

against the intention of the streaming system.  Streaming  is

intended to help this group of students who are slow learners

and  to allow them to cope better in a more comfortable pace,

so  that they can eventually develop their potential  to  the

fullest,  in due course.  It is therefore necessary  that  we

correct  this  wrong  attitude and wrong  perception  of  the

parents and the society in general.  Under the new system



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>



of  technical education, these students will be able to learn

new skills, whereas under the old system, these slow starters

would be eliminated and sieved out of the school system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after many years of changes and

innovation,  our technical education system is now  upgraded.

Students  who  join the ITE get to learn a  lot  of  new  and

advanced  technology and skills. As far as I  know,  ITE  has

established  direct  links  with  some  well-known  technical

schools  overseas.  For example, Yishun ITE in which I  serve

as a memebr of the Advisory Committee, has joined up with the

Albuquerque  College  of  the United  States  of  America  to

jointly   develop  technical  courses  on  wafer  technology.

Students  of  Yishun ITE  have the opportunity to  learn  the

most  advanced  technology, and even go over  to  the  United

States  for training.    Graduates of the ITE nowadays  enjoy

good  job  prospects.  Last year, because of recession,  many

university graduates could not  find a job.  But 86%  of  the

graduates  of  ITE secured their first jobs upon  graduation.

So, ITE is not "It's The End" after all!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must correct the attitude of certain schools towards

the  EM3  and  ITE students.  Many parents and students  have

given  feedback  that  in some schools,  these  students  are

regarded as "problem students" and are discriminated against.

Some  have  even regarded the EM3 students as  some  kind  of

liability,  likely to affect the ranking of  the  school.  We

should  implement  the idea of teaching  according  to  their

ability.   We  must give these students more  help  and  good

teachers.  And as parents and members of the society, we must

give  them  encouragement  and help  them  to  restore  their

confidence and self-respect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, basically, I am supportive of the

streaming policy.  But in implementing the streaming  system,

we must correct certain misconceptions and the wrong attitude

of some people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is on the question of age at which

streaming should be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>



implemented.  Normally, the students are streamed  between  9

and  10  years.   At  this stage of their development,  their

intellect  has not been fully developed yet.  Sir,  according

to the Piaget Theory of Cognitive Development, there are four

stages  of   development in the children's life.  First,  the

sensory-motor  phase  from ages 0 to 2.  Secondly,  the  pre-operational  phase from ages 2 to 7.  Thirdly,  the  concrete

operational  phase  from  ages 7 to 11.  Lastly,  the  formal

operational  phase from age 12 onwards.  It is only  at  this

last  stage  that  the children will be capable  of  abstract

thinking.   From this  theory, it may seem not to be  correct

to  stream students at the age of 10.  I think this should be

reviewed,  although it has been practised for  more  than  20

years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, apart from the inculcation of skills

and  knowledge, we must also stress on the character-building

aspect  of  education, the inculcation of  values  and  moral

standards.   We must be able to cultivate students  with  the

right  character  in  order  to survive and  prosper  in  the

changing  world.  If our students do not have a comprehensive

build-up  of  their  strong character with  adaptability  and

responsibility to the society, family, loyalty and the  sense

of  belonging  to the nation, then we will  not  be  able  to

attain the objective of our nation building.  The family  and

the  schools are the best places for building and  developing

the  character  of  our  students.   We  must  systematically

inculcate in the minds of our children the right values.   We

must  make  sure  that  our children are  knowledgeable.   In

addition, they must be benevolent and courageous.  We  cannot

think without learning.  As Confucius said, "Learning without

thinking   is  futile,  and  thinking  without  learning   is

dangerous."   So here, I would like to refute what  Mr  Chiam

See Tong had said about the teaching of Confucius. He alleged

that  Confucianism made us subservient and  obedient  to  the

Government.   I  think  he  has misunderstood  the  Confucius

teaching.    Confucius  stresses the importance  between  the

individual  in  the  society and the  family.   It  does  not

suggest  that  the  people  should just  be  subservient  and

obedient to the Government, with no questions asked.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, our students must also have the sense

of  benevolence in the modern society. It should  take  on  a

wider  meaning to imply that we must have the spirit of  care

and  concern to society, to our friends and our family.   And

finally,  our  students must also be brave,   have  a  strong

character and a strong will power.  It is only with this kind

of  spiritual  strength that our students  will  be  able  to

survive and become undaunted in the ever changing world.   So

once  the  character of the students has been  built  up  and

developed, we must ensure that this virtue will be  reflected

in  our social bonding and also in our sense of belonging  to

the nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a multi-racial society like Singapore, we must teach

our children, from the very early ages, to understand and

appreciate the importance of racial and religious harmony in

our society. We must give them the religious knowledge and

understanding so that they will understand the different

features of the various religions and the different ways of

life.  And this will not be confined to just one single

education system or religion.  It is only with this kind of

understanding and through the organised activities involving

students of different ethnic groups, will our students learn

to interact with one another, and to have tolerance for one

another's religious and cultural practice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young people generally are indifferent to political

affairs.  I feel that in our National Education Programme  in

the schools, we should enhance the political awareness of our

students,  and  arouse their interest in current  affairs  so

that  they can be involved in the social and political  well-being.  They should be encouraged to participate in community

work, and  to show their care and concern for the society and

community.   To  enhance  the  political  awareness  of   the

students,  we will be able to strengthen their identification

with the nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to raise the question of mother-tongue education, especially

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>

the Chinese language in our schools.  The standard of Chinese

language  is  an issue.  After the opening up of  China,  our

society  claims  to have a lot of bilingual people  and  they

feel  that they can hitch a ride on the fast train to  China.

If  we want to maintain this advantage, then we should ensure

that the standard of Chinese language among our students must

attain a certain standard of proficiency, so that we will  be

able  to  take  advantage  of the development  of  China  and

communicate  with the Chinese people.  Then we can  find  our

place there.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as it is said, "It takes 10 years to

grow  a  tree  and  100  years to  develop  a  person."   So,

education  is not a simple task.  Over the past few  decades,

our  education  system has been implemented with  vision  and

practical means.  I believe that so long as we continue  with

this spirit and attitude, we will be able to ensure that  the

quality  of our people will become better so that the  future

generations  will be better than our current generation,  and

our success story can be sustained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this spirit, Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Cynthia Phua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

speak  in support of the Motion by Mrs Lim Hwee Hua to  thank

the President for his Address to Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President has outlined the changed

world    scenarios   after   the   September   11   incident.

Singaporeans  are faced with tougher challenges  ahead.   The

foundation at home must continue to be built on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being one of the new Members of Parliament, we have been

repeatedly  advised to keep our speeches  short  and  to  the

point.  I will take heed and plunge into the concerns that  I

have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year-end and beginning of this year, I was faced

with   cases  which  deeply  concern  me.   Among  my   close

associates, there are two cases of teenaged children



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>



leaving school prematurely at secondary 3 and 4.  I have also

seen  two  other cases at my meet-the-people session  of  two

children being asked to leave school by their principals  due

to   disciplinary  problems  and  asking  for  help  to  find

alternative   neighbourhood  schools.   Taking  this   simple

statistic   sampling  by  the  count  of   one   person   and

extrapolating  to  the 84 + 1 MPs, I am  concerned  with  the

statistics  as I am certain there are many more  such  cases.

In  one  of  the  reports that I have read from  the  Nanyang

Technological  University  on  factors  affecting  adolescent

delinquency in Singapore, age and family income are found  to

be significant in influencing the delinquency of adolescents.

The  report indicated that delinquency tends to peak  at  age

15,  ie,  mid-adolescence.  Coincidentally, this matches  the

cases that I have experienced on the early school-leavers  at

secondary  3  and 4.  The other significant factor  from  the

report  suggests dual-income family or parents  who  have  to

spend more time on their jobs, resulting in the reduction  of

time  for  their children.   Three out of the  four  cases  I

highlighted  earlier are dual-income families.  It  therefore

gives  me  great concern, as looking at the present  economic

situation,  most parents need to work extra hours  and  extra

hard for fear of losing their jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must be wondering, since I have been talking of

early school-leavers, how many are we talking about:  I  read

the  report by the Ministry of Education from the MOE website

and got the yearly secondary school-leaver figure of 3.5%  in

1999.   Checking  again the website, I could  only  find  the

cohort  of  the  "A" level students.  However,  knowing  that

about  29%  of  the  "O"  levels go to the  "A"-level  helps,

extrapolate it, the figure should be about 40,000.  Then  the

question  is: 3.5% of each level of the secondary schools  or

3.5% of the four levels?  This is not clear in the Minister's

report.  So the numbers come to the range of 1,400 to  5,600.

And  you may ask why I did not ask the Ministry directly.   I

did.   I was told that they must be fair to all MPs.   And  I

also  had the opportunity to speak to DPM Lee and he told  me

that is fair treatment.  Mr Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>



Sir, I would like to highlight to our Opposition Members that

we do not get special treatment in this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To gain another approach to quantify this number of

school-leavers,  I  found through the MHA  website  that  the

number of juvenile delinquents hovers around 2,000 each year.

Part  of  this number of delinquents might be from the  early

school-leavers.   As these children have more  free  time  in

their  hands,  their  working  parents  might  find  it  more

difficult  to  handle them.  Some parents who  actually  lose

control  of them, most of these teenagers could not  work  as

they  are underaged.  They will simply loiter around and  mix

with  older  youths who may be of bad company.   Furthermore,

these children are very vulnerable at this tender age, as can

be seen in the Anthony Ler murder case.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to my point, the number of early secondary school

leavers  is still large each year.  There is an old  Biblical

saying that I find very true: "You shall reap what you  sow".

Therefore, if we do not take the right steps now to safeguard

our  youths  and  help  those who are  at  risk  due  to  the

complexities of families today, then I am sad to say we  will

risk reaping a bad harvest, with more complex societal issues

to manage, in the years to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what are the possible actions? I would like to

appeal for an integrated multi-agency approach in identifying

the  potential early school leavers.  I wish to  call  for  a

tripartite  relationship with the teachers, the  parents  and

the  students.  In view of the fact that both the parents are

working, I would say the contact time of the children will be

much longer with their teachers instead of their parents.   I

am  not  pushing  the  responsibility of  upbringing  to  the

teachers,  but ask for collaboration with the teachers.   The

teachers who are being trained to deal with children would be

able  to  identify the high-risk children from  as  early  as

secondary 1 and quickly refer them to appropriate counselling

for closer attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Closer attention" - what do we mean by that? I would

like to urge the Ministry



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>



of   Education,  jointly  with  the  Ministry  of   Community

Development  and Sports, to consider having  a  student  care

service at the secondary level, and I applaud the Ministry of

Community Development and Sports for having done well in  the

provision  of child-care and student-care services  for  pre-nursery  to  primary  school children.  When  these  children

reach  secondary school, most of them are left alone  in  the

afternoon.   As the school hours are not fixed,  in  view  of

curriculum  activities  and  the  ad-hoc  remedial   classes,

parents  have  no  way of knowing the hours except  from  the

children  themselves.   Employ retired teachers  or  suitable

professionals in supervising these children in the  afternoon

and  parents  can be asked to pay for the service.   Subsidy,

like  the  case of child-care services, can be given  to  the

lower-income  family.   Some of these  supervisors  could  be

trained  as  counsellors  and we could  identify  and  create

second  careers in this area too, especially for  middle  and

late   professionals  and  managers.   We  have   been   very

successful  in  getting  mid-career professionals  to  become

teachers.   Now  we can try training these  middle  and  late

career  professionals to be counsellors as  well  as  student

caregivers.  With their extended background experience in the

workforce and their experience in bringing up their children,

they  could  also be a source of role models  for  them.   It

could  be even better if we could attract male professionals.

Why?   Because the report revealed that paternal care is very

important in the behavioral development of adolescents.   The

male  figure is still seen as the disciplinary figure in  the

Asian culture.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, I would like to applaud the Inter-Ministry Committee on Youth Crime on its efforts in bringing

down  the youth crime rate by identifying youth crime  trends

and  high-risk youths early.  This was reported  recently  by

Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee, Senior Minister of State for

Law  and  Home  Affairs, and Chairman of  the  Inter-Ministry

Committee on Youth Crime.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to congratulate the five Mayors on

their appointment earlier

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>

this year.  Most of them have been serving as Chairmen of the

CDCs  before and, now, as Mayors.  The CDCs were  created  in

1997.   The  concept of CDCs has been explained  as  a  local

community approach to the building of community bonds and the

delivery  of  local social services.  Here, I would  like  to

urge  the  CDC  to realign its resources in the  delivery  of

local  social services.  Two aspects of social services which

I  wish  to  highlight are:  (1) job-matching and retraining;

(2)  the use of the established network of the Family Service

Centres  (FSCs).  Most of the CDCs are organising  job  fairs

frequently and have job-matching service.  Most of  the  jobs

offered are from those available at the MOM Job Bank.  I also

found  that  some  CDCs did a little bit more  by  forming  a

Corporate   Relations   Committee   to   identify   potential

employers,  and  some were innovative of revamping  from  JAP

(Job  Application and Placement) to JELL (Jobs, Employability

and  Lifelong Learning).  The result of job-matching is still

poor.   Yes, the reasons are many.  But many blame it on  the

attitude and mindset of the people.  So when they come to the

MPS  with  many unpaid bills, who and how do we  solve  these

difficulties?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge the CDCs and MOM to comprehensively

take  a  fresh look at the job-matching service.   Go  beyond

just  job  matching  and instead introduce  intervention  job

matching.  And what do I mean by that?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to urge MOM and the CDCs to work with the

potential   employers,  understand  their  requirements   and

identify  the  suitable set of skills  that  is  required  to

perform  this work.  Identify the target groups of employees,

re-engineer the skill sets, if necessary, to suit the  target

groups of employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say that McDonald's has done a very good job in

this  area.   They  know  that  it  is  difficult  for  older

employees  at  the  service  counter  to  remember  all   the

different items to collect and pack when they serve a  drink,

such  as  coffee  and tea.  But they prepare the  sugar,  the

stirrer and the creamer into a bag.  So instead

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>

of  remembering three items, they just remember to  take  out

the pack.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of retraining, there could be better

matching  of  training  needs  and  training  demands.    For

example,  MOM or CDC could advise on the type of  job  skills

needed after discussing with the potential employers and then

encourage  the  unemployed  to  go  for  retraining  in   the

specified skill sets.  Once the opportunity for employment is

there, people would be more willing to spend the time and  go

for  the specific training.  Here, the joint agency could  do

more   to   assist  the  potential  employers   actively   on

identifying the necessary retraining funding.  If the success

rate  for finding a job can be improved and publicised,  this

will  encourage  people to go for the right  type  of  skills

retraining.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second aspect of Family Service Centres, I would

also like to urge the CDCs to concentrate on the delivery  of

social  services  to  the  families at  the  local  community

through  the established networks of FSCs, especially  during

this economic downturn.  The importance of families cannot be

underestimated.  Families are the foundation of our  society.

And  why  do I choose FSCs?  It is because the family service

areas are already set up at the focal points providing social

service  to promote and strengthen the well-being of families

in the local community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FSCs have three unique features. FSCs focus on the

family as a primary unit of intervention and services.   FSCs

provide  a spectrum of services that address the wide variety

of  family  needs either directly or indirectly.   FSCs  have

established   linkages   in  other  social   and   grassroots

organisations situated in a local community.  The  FSCs  lack

the  publicity  and recognition as compared to the  important

roles  FSCs  play.   The FSCs are well-positioned  to  foster

greater  inter-agency collaboration to build a closer network

of  service for the family.  There are about 35 FSCs  in  the

various housing estates compared to our five CDCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FSCs could be the branch offices of the CDCs for

family-focused services.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>



Presently, for the family and social service cases,  the  CDC

undertakes the investigation role and refers their  cases  to

the  FSC, if necessary, and this takes up a long time  before

we  could get any answers.  I would suggest that the role  be

reversed.   As  FSCs  are now nearer to  the  families,  they

should undertake the investigation role and the result  would

be much faster.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDC at the district level is still remote for the family

to access its services.  The time taken for the investigation

and help to the families in need would be shorter through the

network of FSCs.  In the Addendum to the President's Address,

Assoc.  Prof.  Yaacob Ibrahim, Acting Minister for  Community

Development and Sports, had mentioned that the Ministry would

work  with CDCs to improve the training of social workers  at

the district level in order to increase the responsiveness of

social agencies within the community.  I urge the Minister to

include  the  FSCs in his review.  In summary, I  appeal  for

support to be given to, first, working parents - about 49% of

the  working force are women.  Second, in order to reduce the

number  of  early secondary school leavers, to work  actively

with  the employers to either identify the skill set for  the

job  and to persuade the unemployed to undergo retraining for

the   identified  skill  set  or  to  re-engineer  their  job

specifications for the ready pool of unemployed.  Third,  the

CDC  should  tap the already established FSCs to  handle  the

primary investigation of the family assistance cases  at  the

local community and support the working parents and promote a

closely-knit family.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Motion of Thanks.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in his Address, President Nathan  highlighted

the   challenges  which  Singapore  faces.   I  believe  most

Singaporeans  are aware of this fact, but it takes  time  for

them  to  understand  the  long-term  implications  of  these

challenges.   Only when they have personally experienced  the

effects of these changes will they appreciate the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>



seriousness  of  the  implications  brought  about   by   the

emergence  of  China and the unpredictable situation  of  our

region.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the moment, the main concern of most people is on

the  bread  and butter issue.  When you have entered  middle-age,   say,   40   and  above,  retrenchment  means   instant

unemployment  as  it will be difficult to find  another  job.

This affects not only the lowly-educated people, but even the

degree-holders and executives, as we see many companies which

are making huge profits are also retrenching.  The executives

find  it difficult getting alternative jobs because they  are

often deemed to be over-qualified.  We can only urge them  to

lower their expectation and to go for re-skilling.  But  even

with re-skilling, there is no guarantee that they will find a

job.  So, what should we do?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone expects the Government to come up with a

solution  and there are indeed various programmes  instituted

by  the Government  to help older workers seek re-employment,

including  incentives for employers to engage older  workers.

These  strategies have helped some affected workers get  jobs

but  it is very tough to convince all affected workers to  go

for  re-skilling.  In NTUC, we have worked very hard with our

affiliated  trade unions to urge our workers to  go  for  re-skilling  and to equip themselves in order to be in a  better

position to seek re-employment.  Just now, Mr Chiam See  Tong

mentioned  that NTUC and the labour MPs should fight  against

lowering of wages and CPF.  I think if he had participated in

our  dialogue  sessions, he would know that our  workers  are

more  concerned  with keeping their jobs than  keeping  their

wages  intact.  If the factories cannot survive and  have  to

close  down, their jobs are gone.  If the orders are reduced,

then they would have to settle for shorter working hours, and

that  means  less  income.  If Mr Chiam  See  Tong  does  not

understand  this  problem, then let me give him  an  analogy.

Many  people are complaining that they have been  working  so

hard  that their hair has turned grey.  To them, I would say,

"Consider yourselves



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>



lucky that you are still having hair on your head. There  are

many others who have no hair at all."  So having grey hair is

still  better than having no hair at all!  I think  having  a

job is surely better than having no job.  This is the reality

of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Mr Chiam does not understand, I would urge him to

come  with  us to visit the factories.  We, labour MPs,  have

been visiting the factories and speaking to the workers.   We

know  what  the  workers are going through.  At  the  present

moment  of recession, the workers' concern is not for  higher

income.   They  are more concerned with keeping  their  jobs.

They  also  know  where  the  challenges  are  and  they  are

adjusting their expectation.  But it takes time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think our union leaders understand the situation

better  than  Mr Chiam See Tong.  Even in Vietnam,  they  are

facing challenges from China.  In the past, they had a lot of

bicycles  on  the road.  Now there are a lot of  motorcycles.

Why  is  it  so?  This  is because Vietnam  is  also  getting

affluent.  They are challenging us.  Their workers' salary is

only  one-fifth of what our workers are getting. In the past,

they had a Japanese motorcycle company, Honda, which produced

a  very  popular locally manufactured model called  "Dreamy".

It  was selling at US$2,000.  But now, with motorcycles being

imported  from China, "Dreamy" has to be sold  at  less  than

US$2,000.  The Chinese produced a motorcycle known  as  "Hong

Da"  and  it  is  now selling at only $600.   The  Vietnamese

manufacturers soon find that they could not sleep  at  night,

and hence "dreamy" no more!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam See Tong also mentioned that the Government has

not given the  Opposition parties their due recognition.   He

said  that  they  are now being reduced to the  status  of  a

fortune  teller.   I  do not think he is  a  fortune  teller,

otherwise he would not have introduced Dr Chee Soon  Juan  to

his  Singapore  Democratic Party.    Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  some

people  said  that  Singaporeans are  very  obedient  to  the

Government.   When  the  Government  asks  them  not  to   do

something,  they  would not do it.  But  now  the  Government

wants



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>



them  to  change  jobs.  They called upon  the  employers  to

employ  the  older  workers.  But there are  still  problems.

Why?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, when the Government formulates its policies,

it  often  fails  to have a good grasp of the  human  nature.

Very  often,  it  will take the available statistics  as  the

basis  to  work out some solutions, without making  some  in-depth analysis of the characteristics of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is this argument that there are a few hundred

thousand foreign workers here and there are less than 100,000

unemployed Singaporeans, and if all Singaporeans are prepared

to  take  up these jobs which are currently taken up  by  the

foreign  workers,  then there should not be any  unemployment

problem.  But then, we must not forget that in the process of

transition,  there  are  many  problems  relating  to   their

children's education, family members, etc, which have  to  be

taken  into  consideration.  Of  course,  we  know  that  the

Government  has recognised the importance of re-skilling  for

our  workers, but then, even after re-skilling, the employers

might not want to employ them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite another example. In Singapore, there are

many people who are unmarried.  By the same logic, if we  ask

all  the  unmarried males to marry all the unmarried females,

there  would not be any problem of low population growth  and

excessive  unmarried  young people in our  society.   But  we

observe that there are a lot of foreign brides and a  lot  of

foreign grooms in Singapore, while the unmarried  ones remain

unmarried.  This is a problem similar to that of the  foreign

workers.   Even when these people get married,  it  does  not

necessarily  mean  that they would have  children,  and  many

marriages even end up in divorces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these figures and statistics can only serve as a

reference.   We  must not neglect the human  factor  when  we

formulate Government policies.  We cannot always explain  the

trends  by  the data and figures at hand.  In  the  past  two

years,  many events have happened in Singapore, such

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>

as  the DBS incident and the erroneous utilities bills.   HDB

planned their building programmes based on the demands of the

people.  Yet, there is now an over supply of flats. These are

some  examples of how we have neglected the human nature when

we formulated the policies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the initial period of our nation-building, we wanted

to  build a rugged  society, one that can withstand  all  the

thunderstorms, one where the people fear no  difficulties and

one   where   the   people   could  actually   move   forward

courageously.    Over   the  years,  Singapore   has   become

prosperous  and there is home for everyone. With the  various

HDB  upgrading programmes, we have covered walkways that link

the  apartment  blocks to the bus stops,  and  linkways  that

connect  one  block to another.   But now the  residents  are

still  complaining. They cried, "No linkway,  how  to  go  to

market?"  Yes, they are never contented.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, many Singaporeans do not bother to use their

heads  to  resolve even very minute problems.   Many complain

that  they  are "stuck".  They cannot go up or go  down.   In

actual  fact, all they need to do is just to use their heads,

put in  a little effort, make some adjustments, you can go up

or  get down.  They can easily get themselves "unstuck". Yet,

all  they do is to sit around and wait for the Government  to

solve their problems, and alas, the Government has come!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, everybody is waiting to see what the Economic

Review Committee can do to cut business cost and enhance  our

global  competitiveness. The people are also waiting  to  see

how  the  "Re-making Singapore Committee" is going to reshape

Singapore  to  establish  itself  as  a  regional   hub   and

metropolitan city of excellence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my sincere hope that while transforming and

restructuring,  these committees and the  various  ministries

and  statutory boards would take into consideration not  only

the  data  and  statistics but also  the  characteristics  of

Singaporeans, typified by the kiasu (afraid



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>



to  lose)  and kiasi (afraid to die) mentalities.  We  should

train our people and cultivate in them what I would call  the

"camel spirit".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camel is a very kind-natured animal. It can move

steadily  and steadfastly, even in very difficult situations.

They  are  not  afraid of the sand-storm, and not  afraid  of

having no water supply - even if Malaysia cuts off the  water

supply, no problem!  They can carry heavy objects and  travel

afar.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans certainly have this potential. We have

already  seen many Singaporean "camels" in action.  In  fact,

when Singaporeans, young or old, men or women, travel abroad,

their  "camel  spirit" is fully manifested. The  moment  they

have  checked  into the hotel, they will rush  out  into  the

streets, making full use of every second available.  They are

not  afraid of going the wrong way, not afraid of walking for

miles and miles, not afraid of missing dinner, and not afraid

of  having  no water to drink. They would just go  ahead  and

shop,  shop and shop, so much so they need to buy a few  more

suitcases to bring home their purchases. If you go to  Changi

Airport, you can see all these "troops of camels" coming home

after  some triumphant shopping expeditions, and showing  off

their trophies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we all realise that Singapore is facing

a  lot of challenges.  We want to participate and shape a new

Singapore  so  that  we  can  be  victorious  in  the  global

competition.   But  we must not be afraid of  suffering,  nor

afraid  of facing difficulties.  This is the "camel  spirit".

The  first  generation of Singaporeans  acquired  this  camel

spirit,  while the second generation strove to maintain  this

camel spirit. Now, the  third generation of Singaporeans must

also  possess  this  camel spirit  of  not  being  afraid  of

sufferings and not afraid of facing hardships. They must  not

end up like the ostrich instead!

<br>2.10 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Gan Kim Yong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I speak in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>



support  of  the motion by the Member for Marine Parade  GRC.

Sir,  I  know  the daunting task of holding the attention  of

Members after seven speakers before me.  Therefore, I  intend

to keep my speech brief.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Singapore is at a crossroad. As we

look back into the history of nation-building, we have indeed

come   a   long  way.   We  saw  the  nation  struggled   for

independence.  We felt the anguish of Singapore's  separation

from  Malaysia and we saw the turbulence of racial conflicts.

We  enjoyed the unprecedented economic growth and prosperity.

We went through the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s.

We  experienced world economic recession and the emergence of

international terrorism in the new millennium.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our parents had witnessed the birth of our

nation,  the  struggle it went through  and  the  success  it

achieved.   They identified readily with the first generation

leaders who have led them through the early dead years of our

history.   They have developed a strong sense of comradeship.

They understand the sacrifices and the price that one has  to

pay  for the security and prosperity that so many of us  have

enjoyed and taken for granted today.  They can appreciate the

necessity  of  building  a strong and  cohesive  multi-racial

society.  Some of us in our own generation may have  seen  or

experienced  part  of that and can relate to  the  issues  of

concern to the leadership.  However, when we look at our next

generation, future leaders of our nation, we will  invariably

come  away  with  a  sense of anxiety and  uncertainty.   The

younger  generation was born and brought up in  a  relatively

secure  and prosperous period of our history. They  have  not

seen  the  turbulence nor the struggle our  nation  has  gone

through.   You can expect quite a different perspective  from

the   younger   generation.   Furthermore,   as   we   become

increasingly globalised, many Singaporeans will be travelling

overseas,  and  some  of them may end  up  working  overseas,

especially the younger generation and the entrepreneurs.  The

attraction



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>



of  better pay and perceived greater opportunities  in  these

countries  may cause some of them to think of migration.   It

is  therefore  crucial that we deal with the aspirations  and

expectations  of our younger generation in order  to  prepare

them for the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our search for new economic opportunities, we must

also  be  mindful  of  the  need  to  strengthen  our  social

cohesion.   In his speech, the President also mentioned  that

in  addition  to economic restructuring, the Government  will

also focus on promoting social cohesion.  Mr Speaker, Sir,  I

am  glad  that other than the Economic Review Committee  that

was  set  up  to chart the new direction for our economy  and

develop new engines of growth, the Government has also set up

the  Remaking  Singapore Committee  to  look  into  the  non-economic aspects of our renewal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, nation building is more than rebuilding the

economy.   In fact, to build a nation, we need to start  with

building  a  people, because our people  are  our  only  real

asset.   With a strong and committed people, we will then  be

able  to  build a connected and cohesive society.   And  with

that,  we  can  begin to build a progressive  and  prosperous

nation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to build a Singaporean people, I think three areas

need to be looked at.  Firstly, we need to inculcate a strong

sense   of   belonging.    We  are,   first   and   foremost,

Singaporeans.  We may speak different languages  or  practise

different  religions and traditions, but we are Singaporeans.

We  are  all  members of the same family, regardless  of  our

academic  or financial achievements.  We are a small  nation.

We  need to constantly strive for excellence just to survive.

However, in our pursuit of excellence, it is inevitable  that

some  members  of the family may lag behind.   Some  of  them

would eventually catch up, but some may not be able to do  so

for  various reasons and would feel a sense of despair.  They

are nonetheless members of the Singapore family.  We need  to

reassure them that they remain so and there is always a place

for them here in their home.  Through the actions of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>



Government  and  the society, we must not  label  them  as  a

burden  or  as  a liability to the nation, but as  an  asset.

While it is critical that we attract foreign talents to  help

make  us internationally competitive, we must also be mindful

to intensify our efforts to nurture and develop local talents

as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I had a meeting with a neighbourhood primary

school  principal.  She told me that her school had a  banner

that said, "Every child is a gift to us, taught and cared for

as  a  gifted  child".  She wanted to remind  every  teacher,

every student and every parent that each child is special and

a  gift  to be treasured regardless of their results.   I  am

sure students and parents of that school would feel proud  to

belong to such a school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we can succeed in making Singaporeans feel that

they  are   a  gift to the nation and that we  treasure  them

regardless  of  their achievements, they in  turn  will  feel

proud  to be Singaporeans.  We will then have taken the first

step towards building a united Singapore people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the second thing I believe we must do

is to inculcate among Singaporeans a sense of responsibility,

not  only towards oneself but to fellow Singaporeans, to  the

society and to the nation.  As we push for economic progress,

there  is  a risk that some Singaporeans may become  somewhat

individualistic, and seek progress at the expense of  others.

We  are beginning to see some signs of this among our younger

generation.  If we are to build a cohesive society,  we  will

need  to  constantly  remind ourselves that  we  survive  and

thrive not as individuals but as a collective people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my university where I studied, there was a very

popular sports event  - boat racing.  Boat racing is  one  of

the most demanding team sports.  Other than physical fitness,

coordination  and team work are often what give  the  team  a

winning  edge.  We are like rowing a boat.  We need  everyone

in the boat to pull in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>



the same direction in order to arrive and win as a team.   If

one of us decides to push ahead at the expense of others,  we

will  simply go around in circles.  As our economy progresses

and  our  society matures, income gap is likely to widen  and

social   tension  likely  to  increase.   To  ensure   social

cohesion, it is necessary to have a safety net to help  those

who  fall between the cracks.  However, I think it is equally

important,  if not more important, to strengthen  the  social

fabric  by  promoting  mutual  help  and  support.    It   is

particularly crucial for us to remind our younger  generation

that  as  they strive for higher achievements,  they  have  a

responsibility towards fellow Singaporeans, especially  those

who are not as economically successful.  We need to encourage

charity   and  volunteerism  and  to  provide  the  necessary

framework to facilitate them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important for us to develop a greater

capacity  and  tolerance for failures.  There was  a  Chinese

saying se pai nai chng kung chi mu, failure is the mother  of

success.  Indeed, failure is but a stepping stone to  success

for  as  long as one continues to try.  One will  truly  fail

when  one  stops  trying.   Our emphasis  on  excellence  and

achievement might have caused us to be somewhat less tolerant

for  failures.  We need to be mindful of the risk of becoming

a  perfectionist  society, be it our  education  system,  our

economy  or  our  society at large.  We need  to  consciously

enlarge  our  tolerance for failures.  We can then  begin  to

build  not just a progressive society but also a responsible,

caring and tolerant society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the third area of focus in building a

people is to develop a sense of ownership.  Many Singaporeans

own  a home today, be it a Housing and Development Board flat

or  private  property.  In fact, quite a number of  them  own

more  than  one  property,  and not  just  in  Singapore  but

overseas as well.  Therefore, property ownership is no longer

the sole factor in Singaporeans' minds when they consider the

issue of national ownership.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I travel widely in my private job and stay in hotels

regularly.   It is clear to me that hotels are not  my  home.

If  the  hotel I stay in is poorly managed, I will switch  to

other  hotels next time.  If the hotel suffers a major crisis

and  has to shut down, I just move on to another one.  I have

no  say  in  how the hotel is run and I have no  relationship

with  the  hotel.  But my home is not a hotel.   My  home  is

where  my  family is.  My home is where I have a say  in  how

things  are  done after consulting my wife,  of  course.   If

there is a problem in my home, I do not run away and move  on

to  the  next home.  I will stay and help solve the  problem,

because I am involved in building the home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is not a hotel. It is a home. It is our

home.   The  five-star facilities it has do  not  make  it  a

home.   It  is  you  and I that make  it  our  home.   It  is

therefore   important  for  us  to  continue   to   encourage

Singaporeans  in  all  quarters as we  build  our  nation  to

involve  them.   Greater  participation  and  involvement  by

Singaporeans  will undoubtedly give them a greater  sense  of

ownership.  When the country needs them, they will  stay  and

help because this is their home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I believe the starting point to build a

nation  is  to  build  a  sense  of  belonging,  a  sense  of

responsibility  and a sense of ownership.  And  the  starting

point  of  that process is education.  We take pride  in  the

academic  achievements  of  our  students  which  have   been

outstanding  compared  to many other countries,  even  better

than  some of the developed countries.  It is perhaps equally

crucial to develop the character of our students, their moral

standards  and their value system.  In the early years,  this

has  primarily been the task of parents.  Other  than  verbal

instructions, parents also serve as role models.  But as  our

society progresses, I am afraid this is fast becoming a  lost

art.   Many  young  parents today are no longer  equipped  to

impart  sound  moral  standards or  value  systems  to  their

children.   In many instances, both parents are  working  and

they  spend  little  time with their  children  during  their

formative  years.  Granted that parents cannot absolve  their

duty in bringing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>



up  their  children  properly, we  need  to  recognise  their

practical limitations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is perhaps useful for us to revisit the curriculum of

our  schools  to  see if it is possible to  strengthen  those

components   relating  to  moral  education   and   character

building, and to provide more opportunities to allow them  to

interact and develop their social skills.  I think pre-school

education  in  particular  should  perhaps  focus   more   on

character  building rather than academic work.   I read  with

great  interest the Ministry of Education's Addendum  to  the

President's  Address  wherein  the  Minister  said  that  his

Ministry will pay particular attention to curriculum  design,

teacher  training and regulation in pre-school education.   I

hope the Minister will take into account the need for greater

emphasis on character building in its reviews.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In primary and secondary schools, we should perhaps

consider  enhancing  the  community  involvement  programmes.

Some  of  these  programmes may be conducted in collaboration

with  selected community and welfare organisations   so  that

there  is greater professionalism and more meaningful  focus.

Effective  and early participation in community and volunteer

work  will  allow our students to develop a strong  sense  of

responsibility to the community during their formative years,

which ultimately may become the foundation of their character

as they mature into adulthood.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as the President has said in his

Address,  the world has changed.  We must change  too  if  we

want  to  remain relevant.  A good Government and a  cohesive

people  are  what brought us here so far.  We  will  need  an

equally  good Government, different style perhaps,  but  good

nonetheless  to  lead us forward.  We need an equally  strong

and   cohesive  people,  different  aspirations  and   dreams

perhaps,  but cohesive nonetheless as our source of  strength

when we face the challenges and explore the opportunities the

future holds for us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this note, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Halimah Yacob -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Halimah Yacob (Jurong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to

speak  in  support of the Motion of Thanks moved by  Mrs  Lim

Hwee Hua.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to join the other speakers

before  me  in congratulating the President for a significant

and  comprehensive  speech touching  on  issues  of  national

security, economic survival and social cohesion which  deeply

concern  all  Singaporeans.  I also welcome  the  President's

reminder  on  the need to engage all Singaporeans,  including

those who disagree with specific Government policies, so long

as  they  have Singapore's interest at heart.  I  agree  that

there  is  no  monopoly  on wisdom  and  those  who  are  not

represented  in this House or who do not agree with  us  must

still have a role to play.  So I would like to encourage  all

Singaporeans  to  come  forward and participate  actively  in

debating   policies  and  contributing  ideas.   Cynics   and

sceptics should dispense with their judgements and allow this

maturing phase of our political process to develop.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we face serious challenges as we move

ahead.   So  we need to bring everyone on board in our  quest

for  better  solutions and ideas.  It is my  belief  that  we

stand  a  much better chance to succeed if there is a greater

sense  of involvement and ownership of the changes that  take

place  which affect all our lives.  We share a common destiny

and  whether  or not we reach our destination  rests  in  our

hands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I note the President's concern that as

we restructure our



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>



economy, there will be dislocations.  And I completely  agree

with  him  that we have to intensify efforts to  help  lower-income  and  low-skilled Singaporeans.  In this respect,  the

Ministry  of  Finance's aim for a modest budget surplus  over

this  financial  year so that it could deal with  the  social

challenges of economic restructuring and ageing population in

a  sustainable way is greatly welcomed.  This is an important

policy  consideration, as I note that the President had  also

mentioned  that taxes should be kept as light as possible  to

provide   incentives   for   corporations   and   high-income

Singaporeans to work hard.  If there are changes, I  do  hope

that adequate measures will be put in place to help our lower-income  Singaporeans to adjust.  It is my strong  belief,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  that long-term economic development  is  only

sustainable if it is also complemented by an effective social

development programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most Singaporeans, education and health care are key

concerns.   In  this respect, I note in the Addendum  of  the

Ministry  of Health that the Ministry intends to introduce  a

selective  means testing to ensure that health care subsidies

which are targeted for low-income groups actually reach them.

While  I  welcome  this move, as it can weed out  undeserving

cases,   I  would  also  like  to  advise  caution   in   its

implementation so as not to result in a system which is  very

rigid, and make it difficult for people to enjoy the subsidy.

Means  testing of public assistance programmes is a difficult

issue.   While the intention is to assist those in need,  and

income  level is one yardstick, too much procedural  red-tape

can  cause  delay and frustration and limits access  to  what

many Singaporeans would consider as basic needs.  At the same

time, a lot of middle-income Singaporeans also need help,  as

health  care  cost has been rising and medical treatment  can

cause  a squeeze on their finances as well.  So, quality  and

pricing  of  medical services impact on the accessibility  of

health  care  in  Singapore  and  remain  a  key  concern  of

Singaporeans.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore urge the Ministry of Health to ensure that

medical  services continue to be affordable  and  within  the

means  of  the  average Singaporean.   I  also  call  on  the

Ministry  to ensure that all existing hospitals, as  well  as

the two new ones that are being built, contain enough C class

and B2 wards to take care of the needs of the low income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, on the Ministry of Manpower, I support

its   mission  and  objectives  wholeheartedly.    Tripartite

cooperation  and industrial harmony have been the cornerstone

of  Singapore's  industrialisation strategy.  Many  countries

envy  our good track record and many have studied our  system

in  an  attempt  to  duplicate it.   Our  unique  system  has

functioned  well because the Government treats employers  and

trade  unions as social partners.  Trade unions are consulted

not only on issues affecting workers but also on economic and

social  policies.   This has provided us  with  an  effective

channel  to  voice workers' concerns and aspirations  and  to

play   a   significant  role  in  Singapore's  progress   and

development.    If   trade  unions  had   been   ignored   or

marginalised, as it is happening in many countries, I am sure

that we will have a completely different outcome today.   We,

in  the  NTUC and the trade unions, will continue to  do  our

part  to  ensure Singapore's competitiveness, focus on  jobs,

articulate  workers' concerns and ensure a fair  distribution

of the rewards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also support the call for a review of our

employment regulations to ensure their relevance.  Tremendous

changes  are  taking place in the world of work.   Employment

relationships are being redefined.  The traditional  lifelong

employment model that characterised the industrial era is now

increasingly  being  replaced  by  contract,  part-time   and

temporary work.  In Japan, about 23% of those employed are in

this  kind  of work.  In the Netherlands, it is 37%;  in  the

United Kingdom, 24%; and in Korea, almost 50%.  Singapore  is

no  exception although at present the number is still  small.

A key employment legislation is the Employment Act, which was

passed   in   1968   during   the   first   phase   of    our

industrialisation programme.  It was one of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>

most progressive pieces of legislation of its time.  Many  of

the aspects that other countries are grappling with today and

are  trying  to  include in their labour laws,  causing  much

industrial  strife in the process, were already  included  in

our laws at that time.  Key among these is discipline at work

and  labour flexibility, but with clear basic protection  for

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, whilst the overall framework of the

legislation remains very much relevant today for the  reasons

I have mentioned, refinements are necessary.  Our economy has

shifted  from being labour intensive to capital intensive  to

one  which is increasingly knowledge intensive.  One critical

area of review would clearly have to be the scope of coverage

of the Employment Act.  There are three issues here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the Act makes a distinction between workmen and

employees.  But as we can no longer classify jobs  so  neatly

into manual and non-manual, the underlying rationale for  the

distinction, it will be increasingly difficult to  implement.

Secondly,   the   present  restriction  which   allows   only

employees, that is, non-manual workers earning not more  than

$1,600  to  benefit under the Act, is unrealistic  as  income

levels  have risen over the years, and the Act runs the  risk

of  covering  an ever shrinking base of workers.   We  should

work out a mechanism that will be self-adjusting so that  the

salary  ceiling  can move automatically.   Thirdly,  the  Act

covers   only  those  employed  under  contract  of  service.

Increasingly, there will be more portfolio workers  or  those

employed under contract for services.  Such portfolio workers

may  not  be  formally  classified  as  employees  but  their

relationships with companies retain a major component  of  an

employment relationship that is dependent on the user company

and brings to the contract only their own labour or expertise

and  nothing  else.  So, even if there is  a  review  of  the

income  ceiling,  as more contract or portfolio  workers  are

employed,  they will fall outside the ambit of  the  Act  and

will  not  have the protection of the Act.  It  is  therefore

imperative  that we review the scope of this  legislation  to

ensure that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>



enough numbers of workers are covered under the legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laws of many countries extend coverage to all

workers,   regardless  of  whether  there  is  an  employment

relationship.   In  this respect, the UK's  Trade  Union  and

Labour  Relations  Consolidated Act of  1992,  for  instance,

defines  a worker as someone who is employed under a contract

of service or a contract for service.  Likewise, the position

in  Japan  where under both the Labour Standard Law  and  the

Trade Union Law, a worker is defined as a person who lives on

his  wages, salaries or other remuneration, regardless of the

nature of his employment contract.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A review of the Employment Act will not be complete

without a review of the other labour legislation as well,  in

particular the Trade Unions Act and the Industrial  Relations

Act.   I  call  upon  the  Ministry of Manpower  to  consider

reviewing these laws as well.  In particular, for the reasons

mentioned  earlier, it will be opportune  to  assess  whether

there is a need to restrict the scope of unions' coverage  so

narrowly to only those with employment relationships.   As  I

have  mentioned,  as  more and more people  are  employed  as

contract or portfolio workers, we have to look at this aspect

of  covering them as well, in relation to our social security

legislation, in this instance, the CPF Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the President's statement that the

Government  will  protect  the  minority  communities,  their

cultures and their ways of life is most reassuring.   At  the

same time, the President has called upon groups to adjust and

compromise  in  order to live harmoniously in a multi-racial,

multi-religious society.  This is a timely reminder as events

around  the  world  show time and again just  how  precarious

racial relations can be.  Sometimes people of different races

and  religions that have co-existed peacefully for many years

could fall apart when certain events take place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, Malay Muslims in Singapore are in many

ways at the crossroads.  Globalisation and modernisation



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>



have  brought  about  new  opportunities  but  also  cultural

changes  that  have  caused some concerns in  the  community,

fearful that this would erode its values.  There is therefore

a  greater  fall back on religion to provide the ballast  and

counter  what are perceived as negative influences.  This  is

very  much  like the discussion that has taken place  in  the

Chinese  community  and  the strong sense  that  Mandarin  is

critical  in ensuring that Chinese Singaporeans retain  their

cultural  and traditional linkages.  Lest I give an erroneous

impression, Sir, let me assure Members that these concerns of

the community have not resulted in a withdrawal, rather Malay

Muslim Singaporeans have participated actively in Singapore's

development  and nation-building process and  have  benefited

from  it.    The median monthly income of Malay workers,  for

instance,  was $954 in 1990, but has increased to  $1,790  in

2000.   But  I think that it is important that we  understand

what  are  some of the concerns and stresses that affect  the

Malay  Muslim  community,  so  that  there  will  be  a  more

meaningful  and  effective dialogue process when  we  discuss

issues and formulate responses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Malay Muslim community can carve a very strong

niche for ourselves provided we continue to invest heavily in

education and skills upgrading.  A critical factor will be in

creating  a conducive home environment where parents  provide

adequate supervision over their children's activities  and  a

learning  environment.  There is clearly  greater  scope  for

parents,  schools, Ministries and organisations to  cooperate

on this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, an equally important issue that we must focus on is

the  impact  of the economic restructuring on Malay  workers.

As  there are more Malay workers in the lower end jobs and in

certain  sectors, such as manufacturing, Malay  workers  have

been affected quite badly as a result of the recent downturn,

and  will  continue to do so as the economy restructures  and

goes  into  even  more  higher value-added  activities.   The

situation  will  worsen if Malay workers fail  to  seize  the

opportunity now



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>



and seriously upgrade our skills and qualification level.  We

have  to  bear in mind that even after the economy  recovers,

old  jobs  will  not return.  New jobs will be created  which

require  new  skills, aptitudes and qualifications.   Even  a

simple  manufacturing job today will require the ability  for

workers to read English and perhaps some Mathematics as well.

MOM's  statistics have shown that, on average, those  without

skills find it more difficult and take a longer time to  find

another  job.  If Malay workers do not want to end  up  doing

the kind of jobs that are currently being done by work permit

holders,  then  we must treat the President's  message  as  a

strong  wake  up  call  for  the community  to  urgently  and

immediately  get  into action to prepare  ourselves  for  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the economy itself is undergoing rapid

changes.  From now on, the race will assume a completely  new

dimension.  It is no longer even a brisk walk but we have  to

actually  run  in  order to achieve not a  higher  level  but

perhaps  even a lower level of growth, compared  to  previous

years.  This is the real challenge for all Singaporeans.  The

President's   Address  has  highlighted   many   issues   and

challenges.  I would like to urge all Singaporeans  to  study

these  carefully and consider the impact on Singapore and  on

our  lives.  They should guide us as we plan and prepare  for

the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I wish to call upon all

Singaporeans  to rally together, stand united.   Although  we

may  have  different  views  and  approaches,  we  should  be

prepared to defend what we hold sacrosanct and dear to us  as

an  independent nation - values, such as meritocracy,  multi-racialism and help and support for the poor and less able.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the motion of thanks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of State for Education and Manpower (Dr Ng Eng Hen): Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to add my voice to the

chorus   of  thanks  to  the  President.   He  has   reminded

Singaporeans  that times have changed and we  must  adapt  to

survive.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it appears that change spares no one. Take me, for

example.   This  time  last year, I  would  have  been  in  a

different  chamber.   No doubt, the operating  theatre  would

have been less august, but equally bright.  I would have been

comfortable  and confident, the environment predictable,  the

patient  blissfully asleep, while I did what had to be  done.

Little  could I guess that within a few months, I would  have

to  switch  from grappling with the problems of  patients  to

solving the nation's woes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Prime Minister said that he would throw us, new

office  holders,  into the deep end, I had not  realised  the

full  implications, neither the extent nor the  pace  of  his

intent.  Barely two weeks after agreeing to be in office  and

still operating on humans, I mean, the waves flowed fast  and

furious  -  the Jobs Task Force, an unemployment high  of  15

years    and    climbing,   100,000   unemployed,    economic

restructuring, terrorism within our borders, racial  harmony,

tudung,  water,  frictions with our  neighbouring  countries,

remake  Singapore, review our educational institutions.   All

in a day's work?  Not quite.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the President has said, and I quote:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next few years will present us with the most severe

challenge  since  independence.  Singapore is  at  a  turning

point."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I chose the change. But I can empathise with those

whose change was neither invited nor welcomed, who had change

foisted  rudely upon them.  It must indeed be unsettling  for

many  to  be out of job, to feel that they are no  longer  in

control  of their destiny, to be unable to provide for  their

families.   How do we help Singaporeans respond to  and  cope

with  this  change  and more to come?   In  his  Address  and

Addenda, the President has wisely outlined the challenges and

how  we must respond to continue to thrive and prosper in  an

uncertain world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that all of us will have to dig deeper

within  ourselves if we are to meet these challenges.  Permit

me   to   use  a  medical  analogy.   The  bug  that   causes

tuberculosis is endemic, that is, it is always present.   But

not all those who are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>



exposed  will  get tuberculosis.  Those that do get  infected

are  more  likely  to be those with a weakened  constitution.

Similarly,  in  an  Intensive Care Unit,  some  patients  are

treated  with  every known antibiotic but will still  succumb

because they have lost their innate immunity.  Nature teaches

us  that each individual must develop his own set of survival

skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this regard, our past successes may have created

a  sterile  environment, such that when  exposed  to  a  germ

attack,  some  Singaporeans may develop full-blown  pneumonia

rather than a self-limiting infection.  The last time we  had

a protracted unemployment of this magnitude was 15 years ago.

So  it would be quite natural for some Singaporeans and their

children  who live in such an environment to expect  lifelong

employment.   Just  a  year ago, we had two  jobs  for  every

worker.   Now,  we have three jobless looking  for  one  job.

When  we  first launched the Economic Downturn Relief  Scheme

(EDRS)  last  year, I had quite a few constituents  who  were

young and able-bodied, who requested for the EDRS but had not

even  put  themselves on any job search list.  My  grassroots

leaders  and I decided that we would not succumb to the  soft

approach.  It would have been like giving steroids  when  you

make  the patient feel good but reduce his immunity.  Doctors

use  steroids  judiciously, even though, to  many,  it  is  a

miracle drug.  Ask the wheezing asthmatic or the patient with

rheumatoid arthritis with painful joints.  To these  patients

steroids alleviate discomfort and suffering.  But there is  a

downside.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steroids also weaken a person's immune system so that

they  are  less  able  to  mount  appropriate  responses   to

infection.  An appendicitis, for example, becomes a  critical

event   because  the  steroids  prevent  the   patient   from

displaying early warning signs of fever and pain, until it is

too   late  and  the  infection  overwhelming  and  systemic.

Steroids  also weaken the bones so that prolonged  users  are

prone to fractures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the parallel between liberal administration of

steroids and the indiscriminate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>



use  of assistance is too close for comfort.  Both can  erode

the  basic  strength and structure on which  our  health  and

prosperity were built.  We decided, my grassroots leaders and

I,  to  award the EDRS only to those who have signed  up  for

training or looking for jobs.  By the beginning of this year,

things  improved and the message got through, such that  most

of  them  were  at  least on the job bank when  applying  for

assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe we need to go further and invoke the

spirit  of resilience and self-sufficiency that our  pioneers

had  when  they built this nation, and if I may  add  against

much  greater odds.  I have two such grassroots leaders  that

come  to mind who exemplify this spirit.  One is in his  mid-50s,  survived and prospered by selling provisions to  hotels

and  the  like,  speaks mostly Hokkien.  A minor  celebration

erupts in my constituency when we can persuade him to put  on

shoes  rather  than his Japanese slippers.  Regales  me  with

stories  of  how heavy a load he can carry on his  shoulders,

even  though he can afford to hire others to do  it.   He  is

wealthy  but chooses to live in Toa Payoh where he has  lived

for  over  half a century.  Walks up to his flat rather  than

takes  the  lift  for exercise.  Supports my meet-the-people-session  (MPS) faithfully by his physical presence  since  he

cannot draft the letter.   But came election time last  year,

he  was  sweating  away  putting my posters  up.   Picture  a

millionaire putting up my plywood posters!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, do not misunderstand me. I am not extolling this

man's  virtues  because he helps me during the  election.   I

praise  him  because he knows that there can  be  dignity  in

labour.   Sir, this is a man that is unschooled and the  less

enlightened might even say uncouth.  But I have more  respect

for  him  than  most  because he has made  good  despite  his

shortcomings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is a man in his 60s, another provision shop

owner.   We  have many of those.  About a month ago,  he  had

difficulty breathing.  His lung burst, probably



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>



from scarring due to an old infection.  So when I visited him

in  Tan Tock Seng Hospital, he had a tube sticking out of his

left  chest to drain out the air that escaped.  I asked  him,

"Do  you  know  what the doctors are going to do?"   He  said

stoically   and  matter-of-factly,  "Yes.   They  used   some

chemical  or powder to seal up the hole or perform  surgery."

Two  weeks  after his discharge, he is back  at  my  MPS  and

helping me as usual.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these people bounce back because they have an

innate  resilience  of  spirit born  of  adversity.   Do  not

misunderstand  me  again!  I am not advocating  a  return  to

menial labour.  The world and our population have changed too

drastically  for that model to be sustainable.  80%  of  each

cohort now has at least a post-secondary education.  We  have

educated  them  well  but we must do more  to  inculcate  the

attitude of self-sufficiency, endeavour and enterprise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By whim of geography and capricious twist of history, we

were landed up with 680 sq km of land after reclamation,  and

each  other.  Lifelong learning applies to everyone.  Let  me

give  you a personal anecdote.  I have always struggled  with

my  second language.  Chinese has been my bane.  When I  went

into  medical school, I was quite glad to be rid  of  it.   I

thought,  as a doctor, I would use less.  When I  did  indeed

become a doctor, I found that most patients spoke Hokkien  or

Mandarin and to get a consistent and proper history, I had to

speak  Mandarin.   When I went into private  practice,  there

were  Indonesian patients who spoke Chinese.  So there I  was

speaking half the time in Chinese.  Then, of course, I became

a  Member of Parliament and had to make speeches in Mandarin.

So there I was studying hanyu pinyin listening to the correct

diction with CDAC's help.  And I thought what a bitter  irony

or  bitter  twist  life deals to me.  When  you  are  bad  in

something and you have to learn again, your occupation forces

you  to  do  it,  I  was getting a bit paranoid.   I  thought

perhaps the PAP particularly put me in Toa Payoh to brush  up

my  Chinese.   When that did not work, they  put  me  in  the

Ministry  of  Education.  So I thought before  this  got  any

further, I better brush



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>



up  my  Chinese and get tuition.  So here I am, aged  44  and

taking Chinese tuition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, lifelong learning is for everyone. The road ahead

is uncertain for our people.  Business cycles are shorter and

likely   to   be   more   disruptive.    Globalisation    and

interconnectivity  have created rapid  response  times.   The

just-in-time  concept   applies  both  to  manufacturing  and

service  sectors.   I  read recently  that  Starbucks  has  a

quality target based on what is known as the "Order to  Froth

Time".  This is the time it takes for a customer to give  his

order  and  for him to receive or to drink the froth  of  his

coffee.  Their software tracks this in all their branches and

mobilise  their  workforce to meet this  demand  and  deliver

coffee  within  a prescribed interval.  Sir,  the  "Order  to

Froth Time".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the aftermath and havoc following September 11,

inventories  were slashed with astonishing speed  because  of

the  rapid assimilation of information.  Correspondingly, the

downsizing   of   companies  must  have  followed   just   as

responsively.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in this brave new world, employment

cycles are likely to be disruptive and discontinuous.   While

Government  will  do everything within its  power  to  assist

Singaporeans, each must take personal responsibility for  his

or her well-being.  Government can help the citizens turn the

corner.  But without an intrinsic level of resistance,  minor

infections can become fatal.  We should help our people  face

these  challenges squarely without the use of steroids.   Our

pioneers  succeeded  with this approach  and  so  shall  this

generation.    Within  the  Jobs  Task  Force,   we   decided

collectively to speak plainly to those unemployed and  risked

the  accusation of being insensitive.  I am happy  to  report

that,  as a result of this strategy, our job placements  have

gone up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans have understood, and now about 1,000 a

month are finding new jobs through the CareerLinks at MOM and

CDCs.   We must continue to cultivate strength in our people,

to  give  them  respect  and help  them  survive  and  indeed

prosper.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does this then mean the Government can take a reduced

role?  On the contrary, adversity provides us the opportunity

to work harder.  The Government must intensify our search for

new  growth areas.  We must continue to invest in our  people

and  capitalise  on  opportunities when  the  global  economy

recovers.   But,  above  all,  we,  this  generation  of  new

political  leaders, must win by their own merit  and  effort,

trust  and confidence.  Almost 75% of voters reaffirmed  last

October their belief in us to govern.  But for me, this trust

was  vicariously  obtained.  Did the  people  vote  for  this

Government so resoundingly because of the new faces and their

great  abilities?  I would be the greater fool if I chose  to

believe  that.   No, they did so because the  party  and  the

Government before me has never broken faith with the people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am acutely aware that my position is obtained through

the  sacrifices and efforts of those who preceded me.  I reap

where others have toiled.  How have previous Governments  won

the  explicit  trust  of  its  citizens?   Through  sustained

honesty and consistency.  It never promised what it could not

give  and accomplished only what it could promise.  It  never

went for soft options, believed that its people could rise to

the challenges and, as a result, prospered.  This trust is  a

source  of  our nation's strength.  This recession will  pass

but there will be another.  The tudung issue will revisit  us

in a different form and religion constantly seeking to divide

and  weaken us.  But the trust that exists between us and the

people  is  that which sustains us.  When that is  shattered,

all else is lost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is a marathon not a sprint, Senior

Minister says.  I take heed.  Learn how they did it,  I  tell

myself,  more  so than what they did.  What have  I  learned?

You  see,  just as I expect each Singaporean to take personal

responsibility  for  his well-being,  I  must  be  personally

accountable to the people.  What then is the ethos with which

I  hope to serve?  Of what do I remind myself?  Expect people

to  come  to you with problems.  That is what you got elected

for and appointed to do.  Remember your oath



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>



before the President.  Be a servant, but do not diminish your

people  or your office as a Member of Parliament.  Be  honest

and  upfront.   The  patient never got better  through  empty

platitudes;  neither will the nation.  Be diligent.   Get  to

the  root  of  the  problem.  Ask and  listen.   Do  not  get

bedazzled  by  brilliance and be wary of  those  who  try  to

befuddle you.  Diagnose wrongs and say plainly what you  need

to  do.  Do not promise more than what you give, but when you

say  something, see it through.  If the problem needs  fixing

and  surgery  is  required, for goodness  sake,  get  a  good

anaesthetist to minimise the pain.  You are not  perfect  and

will  make  mistakes.  Admit them, correct the  complications

and move on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I started by saying how change can be

unsettling.   Despite  these difficult  times,  I  have  been

strangely calm.  I am confident that we will emerge  stronger

and  more  united.  My confidence and strength come from  the

people's  trust,  the  commitment  of  my  comrades  and   my

captains'  ability.  In my captains, I have only  seen  care,

never  fear.  Their calmness and collectedness have  inspired

me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am, by training, not a poet. I cut better than I

speak.    But   since  we  are  encouraging  creativity   and

innovation in our schools, I thought it wise, or foolish,  to

lead  by  example and close with a poem.  At the very  worst,

both  you  and  I will know that I am completely  lacking  in

literary skills.  Here I am, through the sacrifices of  those

before  me, sacred trust received, honour and duty conceived.

On  my  plate of service, offerings of diligence,  compassion

and  integrity.  Tis I have.  Nothing more, nothing less  you

shall  receive.  Tis enough I hope.  Must be enough, I  wish.

Here I am, stand or fall with me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this time last year, I would have been

in a different chamber, and the poorer for it.

<br><br><!-- Mr Matthias Yao Chih (Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Mr Matthias Yao Chih):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the

Motion.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are signs that our economy is bottoming out. We

may see recovery in the second half of this year.  We are out

of  a crisis situation.  But we may well go into a crisis  if

we are slow in reacting to the changes around us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current crisis in Argentina's financial system is

instructive.  After a period of hyper-inflation in the 1980s,

Argentina adopted a currency board and pegged the peso to the

US  dollar.   This  brought  down the  inflation  rate  to  a

comfortable  level.   For several years, Argentina's  economy

grew strongly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the world is not static. In 1994, Mexico entered

the  North  American  Free Trade Agreement  (NAFTA).   Almost

immediately,  exports from Mexico into the US  boomed.   This

resulted in strong growth for Mexico.  Before 1994, the total

GDP  of  Mexico was only half that of Brazil's in  US  dollar

terms.  Today, Mexico's GDP is bigger than Brazil's.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of keen competition from Mexico and the fallout

of  the  Asian  financial crisis, Brazil had to  devalue  its

currency  in  1999.   That  put pressure  on  Argentina,  but

Argentina  kept to its currency peg.  Exports suffered,  debt

mounted and the financial system collapsed.  Of course, there

are  also  other  contributing  factors.   But  the  changing

dynamics  of  trade  and capital flow external  to  Argentina

became a key cause of her internal problems.  A solution that

worked for them for a while failed to work any more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Argentina is far away from here. But can there be

a parallel scenario in our part of the world?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China has entered the WTO. What is the impact on

Southeast  Asia?   The  President said in  his  Address  that

"China's low costs, abundant talent and huge domestic  market

are  attracting  MNCs  to relocate  plants  to  China.   Good

quality  but  cheaper  Chinese products  are  flooding  world

markets.    Adapting  to  China's  emergence   and   economic

transformation will pose a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>



major   challenge   for   many  Asian  countries,   including

Singapore."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does all this mean to our workers? To see for

themselves,  several  groups  of  trade  union  leaders  have

visited  China  in  recent  years.   They  visited  companies

located  in  Beijing, Suzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen and  Xiamen.

They  spoke  to  managers, union officials, factory  workers,

taxi  drivers  and shopkeepers.  They came home impressed  by

the  focus,  the  hunger and the confidence  of  the  Chinese

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before their trips, some thought that Chinese workers

were  not very productive.  They discovered that the  Chinese

workers  were  highly  educated and  well  trained,  and  the

monthly  salary was just the equivalent of our own employers'

CPF contribution in Singapore.  Some thought that the Chinese

products  might  not be very good.  They  discovered  in  one

Singapore-owned factory in China that the tools and precision

die  used by the workers in Singapore were made by the  China

factory,  not  the  other way round.  Some thought  that  the

public  toilets  had  no doors or flushing  system  and  they

prepared  themselves psychologically before they went.   They

were  surprised  by 5-star toilets that had  TV  screens  all

around on the walls showing CNN broadcasts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The union leaders who visited China now understand why

companies want to relocate there.  They are worried  that  we

will  lose  more jobs to China.  Yes, they are  worried,  but

they are not defeated.  They have all come back with a firmer

resolve  to urge their fellow workers to retrain and  upgrade

themselves  so  that we can all float on the moving  tide  of

global economic change, and not sink under its currents.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem our workers face is serious, and will remain

serious.   There were 25,000 retrenchments last year.   There

will  be  more  to come, at least in the first half  of  this

year.   The nature of retrenchments is changing.  Last  year,

poor business accounted for 44% of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>



retrenchments  in  the  unionised companies.   In  the  first

quarter of this year, this has dropped to just 18%.  Now, the

most    common   reason   for   retrenchment   is    business

restructuring,  which  includes  downsizing  and  relocation.

Last   year,   restructuring  accounted  for  only   32%   of

retrenchments.  In the first three months of this  year,  the

percentage has shot up to 59%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More restructuring and relocation will be carried out,

whether  we like it or not.  We cannot dictate that investors

must  come  to Singapore and stay here.  We can only  attract

them to come here by offering to them what they need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the companies do not relocate, old industries

die and new industries take their place.  Remember we used to

have  factories making typewriters here?  They are all  gone.

Soon, the factories making TV picture tubes will also go,  to

be   replaced   by   those   making  thin-screen   TV   sets.

Technological change will cause many more industries to  rise

and fall.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will happen to our workers in these circumstances?

If  we are complacent, if we are slow to react, if we hang on

to  the  old  solutions hoping that they will solve  our  new

problems, we will not be able to keep the good jobs here  and

create  new ones.  If our workers do not take full  advantage

of  the  opportunities  to  learn and  retrain,  it  will  be

difficult  for  them to get out of work  that  is  no  longer

competitive into new growth industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is growing not by staying still. It is

undertaking a huge restructuring programme.  Its workers  are

adapting swiftly to the change.  We cannot afford to be  left

behind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President's Address and the Addenda from the various

Ministries  set out the challenges we face and the  direction

we  should  take.  Our workers, employers and the  Government

must work hand-in-hand together to make our plans succeed.

<br><br><!-- Ms Indranee Rajah -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms Indranee Rajah (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

support the Motion by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>

Member for Marine Parade GRC absolutely and completely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President, in his Address, touched on many aspects

of the things that we are facing today, and it is quite clear

that  we  are at a crossroad.  We are facing a great deal  of

change.   The  only  question is, in  Singapore,  how  do  we

respond  to this change?  Well, for those of you who  studied

in  the  1970s, there is a Billy Ocean song "When  the  going

gets  tough, the tough gets going", and that is  what  we  in

Singapore  must be like.  We must be able to respond  to  the

changes  that  face us today and to be able  to  find  a  new

balance to deal with the changed circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three areas I would like to raise in respect

of  how  we  can change.  The first is changing our mindsets.

In  many  ways, we in Singapore are the victims  of  our  own

success.   We have come from a Third-World country  that  was

poor  and had a lot of low-income people, to a country  which

is  affluent in the region.  What has happened as a result is

that  Singaporeans, especially young Singaporeans, have taken

success and economic prosperity for granted.  That, in  turn,

results  in a certain complacency of thinking and  a  feeling

that  there will always be jobs there, there will  always  be

comfortable situations and circumstances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But modern Singapore did not come into existence just

like  that.  If we think about it, what are we?  A very small

red  dot, or so we are told, with no natural resources.   The

only thing that we have is our people.   The making of modern

Singapore is very much an act of will.  It was an act of will

of  a small group of people who sat down and said, "These are

the overwhelming odds, but we will make it."  And we stand at

a   very  similar  crossroad  today,  in  slightly  different

circumstances  where we are a bit more  affluent.    But  the

challenge  is  exactly the same.  It is how to overcome  odds

that   are  put  before  us.   And  in  order  to  do   that,

Singaporeans today need to have a certain mental toughness, a

certain



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>



resilience and the ability to overcome the odds that face us.

We must not back down in the face of difficult circumstances.

We  must  be,  really, like bamboos:  firmly  rooted  in  our

constitutional  principles, but able to bend with  the  wind.

We do not break.  We bend but we stay firm.  And that is what

we need in the modern Singaporean mindset.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President John F Kennedy once famously said, "Ask not

what your country can do for you but what you can do for your

country."  I do not agree entirely.  I think there is no good

reason  why  a Singaporean cannot ask what the PAP Government

can  do  for him.  The PAP Government says it can do lots  of

things,  so  by  all means ask.  But, at the same  time,  the

Singaporean must also ask himself or herself "What can  I  do

to  help  myself  and  what  can  I  do  to  help  others  in

Singapore?"   It  is a two-way street.  It is  not  just  the

burden  of the Government, it is not just the burden  of  the

Ministries.   It  is a challenge that faces  all  of  us  and

something which all of us work and pull together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the subject of employment and how we can

change  mindsets  here, there is a need  to  change  mindsets

because,  for  some employees whose jobs have gone,  I  think

they  have  to  accept  that these jobs  are  gone  and  will

probably never come back.  Not in the same form.  So what the

employee has to do is to be able, ready and willing to try an

alternative  employment.   I  hear,  for  example,  from  the

Central CDC that someone in Bukit Merah was offered a job  in

Marine Parade but did not want to go there because it was too

far.   In a situation like that, it is very difficult to  say

to that person "I can give you financial assistance", because

that  person has the option to earn.  So we do need  changing

mindsets on the part of employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But having said that, there are some people who are

willing to work but cannot find work, and this is because the

employers  do  not  change their mindsets.   There  are  many

employers out there who do not want to employ people in their

40s



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>



and  50s  because they feel that they are old,  difficult  to

retrain and simply would not take them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I met a woman in my constituency the other day who had

been looking for a job.  She had applied to the CDC, she  had

gone for an interview, but in the end, they did not want  her

because  she  was too old. She had been turned down  in  some

other  applications that she had made.  And what she said  to

me  was, "What is there for someone like me?  The only  thing

that I can do now is to sit here and wait to die."  She is in

her  late  50s.   I think that was one of the saddest  things

that  I ever heard.  I would do something and try to see what

I  can do to give that woman a job or to find one.  It  is  a

very  difficult thing for people in that situation when  they

are honestly looking, honestly wanting but cannot find a job.

In  this kind of situation, what we need to do is to try  and

see  whether there is something out there for people who fall

within this age group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I can think of is this. There are many young

people  who do not have the time to do their domestic chores,

simply because they have a lot of work.  It is difficult  for

them  to do grocery shopping, find the time to do the ironing

or,  in  some cases, just to do cooking at home.  But you  do

have  a  lot of the aunties in the HDB areas who are able  to

cook, able to provide ironing services and who can help  with

purchase of groceries.  But the only thing you need to do  is

to ensure that there is some kind of quality control.  What I

think  the  CDCs could do is, perhaps, help bridge  this  gap

between the demand and the supply and hopefully, come up with

a sort of training programme for some of these ladies who are

in their late 40s or 50s, who are willing to provide domestic

services for which they can earn a certain amount.  At  least

if they provide these services, where there is a demand, they

can  earn  and have a feeling of self-respect, and a  feeling

that  they  are contributing and able to stand on their  own.

That  is  the  first  change  I  would  advocate  -  changing

mindsets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is changing traditional attitudes. In this

respect, I have found in my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>



MPS  that there are many poor income families who come to  me

and yet have many children, and you can just see that this is

a  cycle  of  poverty  because  the  parents  are  poor,  the

children's education is neglected and the children are  going

to  grow up poor and are not going to be able to advance  and

progress.   The  key to this is education.  It  is  extremely

important.   And  in  this  regard,  I  would  also  strongly

advocate  education for the girls.  I think across the  board

and certainly for some of the minority communities, education

for the girls may not be considered as important as it is for

the  boys  simply because there is the traditional perception

of  a woman's role in society which is that, ultimately,  one

day,  she will meet her Prince Charming who will provide  for

her and be able to look after her from the day of marriage to

the  day  she dies.  Unfortunately, it does not quite  happen

like that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many women out there who either get divorced

or  are  victims of domestic violence or, at  some  stage  in

their  lives, are not able to fend for themselves.   I  think

education for women at all levels is very important.   It  is

the  one  single  defence that a woman has  against  poverty,

against being dependent, against the kind of vicissitudes  in

life.   It  is  important for women to  have  the  option  of

financial independence.  If you do not want to exercise  that

option and if you wish to be a homemaker, that is fine.   But

there may be circumstances when you are not so fortunate, and

in that situation, you do need to have that option. Education

for women is very important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On traditional attitudes, there are also the stresses

and strains in Singapore faced by professional working women.

Let  me  tell  you a story that illustrates the  point  I  am

trying to make.  Somewhere out there in Singapore, there is a

little  boy  and  he  is  brought up,  as  in  all  immigrant

societies,  because we want our children to  have  the  best,

either his mother would wash his plate, make his bed or if he

is  more affluent, the maid will do it.  He is brought up  to

have  someone to look after him, always taking  care  of  the

domestic chores and he is socially conditioned to expect that

this is going to be done for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>



him and chances are that if it is a woman who is doing it for

him, then he is going to have that expectation in life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere out there, there is a little girl and she has

been socially conditioned by her parents that she must get an

education, she must become an entrepreneur and she must get a

good  job  later on in life.  And one day, they are going  to

meet.   Then  you  know  what happens when  the  irresistible

objects meet the immovable force because they have completely

different  expectations.   We  are  having  more   women   in

Singapore who are being more educated.  Their aspirations are

different from the generation of women before them.  But,  at

the same time, we need to understand that there are pressures

on  them  because  they are expected by  the  husband,  their

mother,  their mother-in-law, to also, in addition to holding

down a job, take care of the children.  What we must seek  to

do  is to find a new balance and to understand that parenting

and  family are a shared responsibility and you need to allow

them  some space in order to be able to achieve all of  their

aspirations which, in many cases, is to be able  to  work  as

well as to have a family.  That is something where we need  a

change in traditional attitudes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to the next point where I think we could also do

some change and this is in housing policy.  By and large,  we

have  done a wonderful job because we have been able to house

a  very large percentage of the population.  But there  is  a

segment  which does not have access or full access to  public

housing and that is of course those who are single.  A person

who  is  under  35 years will not be able to purchase  a  HDB

flat;  35  years  and  above, as I understand  it,  they  can

purchase  a resale flat.  With respect to rental,  there  are

joint  rental schemes but you have to be 35 years  and  above

and you have to find somebody else.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, especially among the younger ones, the

expectations and the needs are changing.  There is a greater



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>



desire  for  personal space.  They are not any  less  filial.

They  just need or want to have some personal space and  this

is simply a function of the fact that the society in which we

live  is changing.  So you cannot say to a young person, "You

cannot have a HDB flat and, by the way, we want you to be  an

entrepreneur, but please live with your mommy and daddy until

you  are  35  years  old."  It would not work.   We  have  to

seriously  consider and think about how the mindsets  of  the

younger  ones  are  changing.  I do  understand  that  public

housing  is funded by public funds and therefore,  it  should

also  meet the public policy.  But, as the President said  in

his Address, no policy is so cast in stone that it cannot  be

changed  and  this  is one policy which is worth  looking  at

because the numbers of singles are not going to go down.  The

pressures  of  the  society are such that there  is  a  great

possibility  that they will increase and they should  not  be

denied  access  to  public housing simply  because  of  their

marital status.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then come to the changing environment on

entrepreneurship.  We have made a call for entrepreneurs  but

you cannot have entrepreneurs overnight.  Entrepreneurs are a

combination  of two things.  One, there are some  people,  by

their  very nature and character, entrepreneurial by instinct

but there are also others who will become entrepreneurial  if

the  circumstances are right.  If we want people to  be  more

entrepreneurial in Singapore, there has to be a lighter touch

on  regulation, the environment must be such that it  enables

them  to  feel free to be entrepreneurial and they  must  not

feel  stifled.  There are various ways in which this  can  be

achieved.  But the simple point that I am making is that  you

cannot  just  snap  your fingers and say that  we  need  more

entrepreneurs  and  have them appear overnight.   They  would

not.   They  are a result of both nature as well as  nurture.

With this, I conclude my address to this House.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have

overcome many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>



major  political  and economic crises  in  the  past.   These

crises  have  taught us many lessons.  A key lesson  must  be

that situations are never static.  Our achievements today  do

not  guarantee our successes in future.  We must stand  ready

at  all  times, not just to react to unexpected changes,  but

also  to position ourselves for the future.  In this context,

I fully support the initiatives to remake Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, "restructuring" and "remaking" have been

very much in the news lately.  The letter "R" seems to have a

lot of exposure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we understand that it is important that we have to

find  new  energies  and  directions  to  bring  us  forward.

However, as we seek to rejuvenate ourselves, perhaps  we  can

seek some inspiration from how companies renew and reposition

themselves to changing consumer trends and market situations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was recently at the Equinox Restaurant, a new

restaurant  at  Raffles City, for lunch last month.   Equinox

occupies the top level of Raffles City Complex, at what  used

to  be  Compass  Rose.   It  is, however,  almost  completely

different  from what we know about Compass Rose.   There  are

now  five  restaurants  and bars.  It  is  a  completely  new

environment  with  different dining experiences.   It  is  an

example of renewal and rejuvenation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic, political and social challenges ahead of

us  require  us  to respond with new strategies  and  renewed

energies.    Remaking  ourselves  will  give   us   the   new

strategies,  while rejuvenation will give us the strength  to

carry the strategies through.  Both are equally important.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, however in the example that I have just

mentioned  of  the  new  restaurant  in  Raffles  City,   not

everything was renewed and rejuvenated.  One key strength  of

the  new restaurant remains from Compass Rose - the excellent

view  from the top of Raffles City.  In fact, I have observed

that  the  restaurant's renovation had further  enhanced  the

view to attract



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>



customers  to  come  back.  It is  an  example  where  a  key

strength   was   "recycled",  not   necessarily   "remaking".

Recycling  is based on the principle of finding new  uses  of

things that are useful.  The same principle can be applied in

how we tackle our future challenges.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are some of the strengths that we can recycle as we

remake ourselves?  As a labour MP, I immediately think of the

tripartite  partnership between workers,  employers  and  the

Government.   The partnership is based on trust and  respect.

It has helped us tackle all the past crises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Minister for Manpower has given the

assurance in his Addendum to the President's Address that the

Government   will  continue  to  strengthen  the   tripartite

partnership.   This partnership must be preserved  and  built

upon.   It  is a pillar that binds us workers, employers  and

the  Government to the future of Singapore.  That pillar will

provide  strength  as  we collectively  face  the  challenges

ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the President talked about how the world has

changed and how severe the challenges ahead.  Indeed, we live

in  uncertain  times.   I would even  say  that  we  live  in

unsettling times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unemployment remains high. Our workers face wage

restraints,  wage  cuts  and  retrenchment  as  the   economy

restructures.   The jobs that they lose today will  not  come

back tomorrow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our regional environment is worrying too. The terrorist

threats  have  not been completely eliminated.  There  remain

issues  in  our  relations with our neighbour Malaysia.   One

union  leader tells me that he is worried when he travels  to

Malaysia.  He said he was in a taxi in Malaysia and the  taxi

driver  was so angry with Singapore.  He could not understand

why  Malaysians  are so angry with Singapore  over  what  are

essentially our domestic affairs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, even the talks about restructuring of the economy

and remaking of Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>



are  so worrying from the point of view of the workers.   The

CPF  will  also  be  reviewed.   MOM  will  be  refining  the

components  of  the employment benefit system, including  the

payment  of  retrenchment benefits.  How will  these  changes

affect workers?  The tax system is undergoing review as well.

How   will  this  affect  workers  and  how  will  it  impact

Singaporeans?  There is indeed uncertainty and when there  is

uncertainty, worry is unavoidable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in such an environment of uncertainty,

it  is  important that we bring in another "R", that is,  the

Government must constantly and clearly reassure Singaporeans.

Such  reassurance will cushion the impact of uncertainty  and

prepare  Singaporeans  for  the policy  changes  ahead.   For

workers,  the  reassurance  can  take  many  forms,  such  as

affirming the commitment to help them move into new job areas

in  the  new  growth industries through training  and  skills

upgrading  and  such as those schemes to  ensure  that  their

healthcare needs will be looked after.  As a labour movement,

the  NTUC  has repeatedly reassured workers that  the  unions

will   protect   their   interests  even   as   the   economy

restructures.   We  will do our part.  We will  call  on  the

Government and employers to do theirs too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Singaporeans, it is important to reassure them that

the  Government has their best interest at heart.  For  major

policy  changes,  the  reassurance must be  through  concrete

actions taken to minimise the policy impact.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the most important "R" that we have talked

about today is reassurance.  If workers and Singaporeans  are

not  reassured, it will be difficult for them  to  understand

the  policy changes, much less accept them.  I thus urge  the

Government  not  to  neglect  the  importance  of  reassuring

Singaporeans,  from the initial stages of discussions,  right

through the end of the policy formulation and implementation.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are at a critical juncture of our development. The

steps  that we take today will shape our future.  We  can  do

more  to  build and improve the infrastructure  to  fuel  our

growth ahead.  Let me cite three examples.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, our public transport system. The public

transport  system  links  our homes to  our  workplaces,  our

relatives  and  families, and the recreational facilities  as

well.  It gives us greater mobility in our lives.  We already

have  a  sound public transport system.  However, we  can  do

even more to improve it.  For example, we know of workers who

are  reluctant to take up jobs in far away places because  of

the  transportation time and cost.  So I urge the  Government

to  bring  forward  its plan to improve our public  transport

system  by  extending the MRT and LRT network  to  cover  all

housing estates as soon as possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, our telecommunications system. We now have

features  of a world-class telecommunications system,  as  we

have one of the highest mobile phone penetration rates in the

world.  However, I think another area we should also be  able

to  do it fast is to quickly link up all homes with broadband

as  well.   While I am sure that there must be sound  reasons

behind  the  current policy, I hope that the authorities  can

continue to study and review other options.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, our living environment. We have almost universal

home  ownership  today.  We have embarked  on  programmes  to

upgrade  our living environment for our residents.   We  must

not  stop  there.  As our population grows and ages,  demands

will  change,  and  we must stay ahead and  anticipate  these

changes.  We have to lay the bricks and foundations today  so

that  we  can build a much better living environment for  our

people in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the seeds we plant today will bear fruit

in  future.  While we remake and rejuvenate ourselves to meet

future  challenges, we cannot completely discard the  sources

of  strength that have brought us successes thus far.  We can

recycle



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>



and  reuse  some  of  them  and, most  importantly,  we  must

continue to clearly reassure Singaporeans that we will always

have  their  best interests in mind.  This will prepare  them

for the challenges ahead.
