<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Leong Horn Kee</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister what

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 643</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

whether the Government intends to adopt a pro-active approach

in  expediting  a settlement of the deadlock  on  the  frozen

Central  Limit Order Book (CLOB) shares prior to the ultimate

deadline of 30th June 2000.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I last updated Parliament on the CLOB issue  in

November.  I informed Parliament then that the Stock Exchange

of  Singapore, which is now called the Singapore Exchange  or

SGX, had written to the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) on

15th  November 1999.  The letter reminded KLSE that  SGX  had

yet  to  receive  a  reply to its proposal  for  a  staggered

release  of CLOB securities.  SGX sent KLSE another  reminder

on  7th December 1999 to ask for a response within one month.

SGX has not received any reply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGX's lawyers had circulated a legal summary to all CLOB

investors  on  17th  December  1999.   The  summary  apprised

investors  of  their  legal rights  as  owners  of  the  CLOB

securities.



<br><br><i>Authorised Nominee Status</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In late December, Malaysian Prime Minister Dr Mahathir

and  Finance Minister Tun Daim Zainuddin said that  the  CLOB

securities  might  be  transferred to the  Malaysian  Finance

Minister  when  the  Central  Depository's  (CDP)  authorised

nominee  account expired at the end of 1999.  They  commented

that  CLOB investors should accept some of the private sector

offers  promptly  to resolve the matter.   On  31st  December

1999,  KLSE  announced  the  extension  of  CDP's  authorised

nominee  status for a "final period of six months to  end  of

30th June 2000."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS responded with a press statement on 29th December

1999.    It  cited  the  unanimous  view  of  legal  counsel,

including  Queen's  Counsel, that SGX, actually  the  Central

Depository (CDP), has acted in accordance with the  law;  and

that  there  is no basis in law for a transfer  of  the  CLOB

securities to the Malaysian Minister for Finance,  either  on

31st December or at any other time.  Whether KLSE extended

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 644</b></font><br><br>

CDP's  authorised  nominee status was not  relevant,  because

CDP's  and  CLOB investors' legal rights under the  CDP-SCANS

agreement  and  under Malaysian law did  not  depend  on  the

nominee status.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLOB investors are asking for the securities to be

migrated into individual securities accounts, in keeping with

Malaysia's   obligations under the WTO, KLSE's public  duties

under Malaysian law, and KLSE's contractual obligations under

the  agreement between CDP and SCANS.  Private sector  offers

cannot  resolve  the  CLOB  issue.   They  do  not  supersede

obligations that are binding in law, nor can they absolve the

relevant parties from their legal responsibilities.



<br><br><i>Malaysia's WTO obligations</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Government has been advised by WTO legal

specialists that the measures taken by Malaysia against  CLOB

are   inconsistent  with  the  most  favoured  nation   (MFN)

provision  of the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services,

because  they  discriminate  against  CLOB  vis-a-vis   other

foreign exchanges.  The failure to migrate the CLOB shares is

inconsistent  with  Malaysia's  obligations  under  the   MFN

provision of the General Agreement on Trade in Services,  and

its  specific  commitments to provide national  treatment  to

foreign  providers of financial services, recognised  by  the

WTO.   This is an issue that, if brought to the WTO  for  its

review, would have to be resolved government-to-government.

<br><br><i>KLSE's legal obligations under Malaysian law</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Malaysian Securities Industry (Central Depositories)

Act amendments of September 1998 provide for the transfer  of

CLOB  securities in the securities account of  CDP  into  the

accounts of individual CLOB investors held with the Malaysian

Central  Depository (MCD).  This requirement under  Malaysian

law  to migrate the securities into individual accounts is  a

statutory duty.  It is not a discretionary exercise.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 645</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>The CDP-SCANS Agreement</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an effort to resolve the situation, CDP has also

entered  into  an  agreement  with  the  Securities  Clearing

Automated Network Services (SCANS), which is a subsidiary  of

KLSE,  to  migrate  CLOB securities into individual  accounts

held at MCD.  This is a key agreement whose significance  the

Malaysian authorities have played down.  KLSE stated  in  May

1999  that  the  agreement "was entered into  to  assist  SES

(Stock  Exchange  of Singapore) and CDP in  facilitating  the

resolution  of the CLOB problem".  And more recently  in  its

31st  December  1999 statement, KLSE made no mention  of  the

agreement, but continued to maintain that "it is the duty and

responsibility of SGX and CDP to resolve the [CLOB] problem".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The settlement of the CLOB issue is a matter of public

interest.   Furthermore, the failure of KLSE to  migrate  the

CLOB   shares   in   accordance  with  this   agreement   has

implications under WTO law.  I am therefore providing Members

with  copies  of  the  actual  legal  document.   [Copies  of

agreement distributed to hon. Members.]  I have the  original

copy here with me and what Members have are photocopies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Members can see, this is a formal legal agreement

concluded between the two parties.  Mr Lim Choo Peng, who was

President of SES [SGX], had met with Dato' Mohd Azlan Hashim,

Executive Chairman of KLSE, on 8th September 1998 to  discuss

how  to effect the migration of accounts on CLOB to the  MCD.

Arising  from their meeting, the two sides formed  a  working

group  comprising senior executives of the KLSE  and  SES  to

work out detailed procedures for migration.  The outcome  was

this CDP-SCANS Agreement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Agreement is dated 18th September 1998. It was

signed, as you can see, on page 7, by Yang Mulia Ungku  Abdul

Razak,  duly  authorised  for and  on  behalf  of  Securities

Clearing  Automated Network Services Sdn Bhd, and by  Mr  Kok

Kar  Wing  duly authorised for and on behalf of  The  Central

Depository Pte Ltd,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 646</b></font><br><br>

and  this  was done in the presence of witnesses.   Singapore

and  Malaysian counsels as well as QC have advised that  this

agreement  is  a legally binding contract and is specifically

enforceable in Malaysian courts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agreement lists clearly the steps by which CLOB

securities  are  to  be transferred into individual  accounts

with the MCD for trading on the KLSE.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer Members to clause 2 of the agreement which

defines the obligations of the CDP.  This is on page 3 and is

titled OBLIGATIONS OF CDP.  Clause 2(a) reads as follows:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"CDP shall unconditionally and irrevocably grant SCANS

the power and authority to act as follows:

<pre>

     (i)  to accept all securities to be transferred from CDP and

          to be deposited into a securities to be established by SCANS

          on behalf of CDP;



     (ii) to hold the said securities in custody and thereafter

          transfer the securities to the respective Depositors' interim

          securities accounts to be established and maintained by

          SCANS;



     (iii)  upon request of the Depositors through their ADAs

          and/or ADMs (these are intermediaries through which investors

          open and maintain their MCD accounts), to transfer the said

          securities from the respective Depositors' interim securities

          accounts maintained by SCANS to the respective Depositors'

          securities accounts established or to be established by the

          ADAs and/or ADMs."

</pre>

Those are CDP's obligations.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the agreement, which is on page 4, defines

the Obligations of SCANS.  This is the Malaysian side, and  I

read you Clause 3(a) to (c):

<pre>

     "(a)   SCANS  shall  provide the  services  pursuant  to

        Clauses   2(a)(i)  and  (ii)  only  when  SCANS   has

        verified   and  is  satisfied  with  the  information

        furnished  by  CDP  under Clause  2(b).   (And  these

        services  being  to accept all the securities  to  be

        transferred  to  hold  it in custody  and  thereafter

        transfer  them to the respective depositor's  interim

        securities accounts.)



     (b)  SCANS shall provide the services pursuant to Clause

        2(a)(iii)  above  only  upon  the  request   of   the

        Depositors through the ADAs and/or ADMs.  (And  these

        services  refer  to transferring the securities  from

        the  interim  securities accounts to  the  respective

        depositors' accounts.)

</pre>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 647</b></font><br><br>

<pre>

     (c)   SCANS' responsibilities herein are merely  in  the

       capacity  of  a  custodian  to  provide  the  services

       pursuant to Clause 2(a) above, without any obligations

       and/or liabilities howsoever derived or arrived."

</pre>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December 1998, KLSE stated in a letter to SES and CDP

that  SCANS' role is merely as custodian and shall be without

any  obligations  and/or liabilities and  they  cited  clause

3(c).  SES responded stating that it had been advised by  its

lawyers that the clause does not excuse SCANS from performing

any  and all obligations assumed by SCANS as custodian  under

or  in connection with the agreement.  At the same time,  CDP

also  wrote  to SCANS to emphasise that the agreement  was  a

legally  binding contract, and CDP having performed  all  its

obligations, was entitled to enforce the performance by SCANS

of  its  obligations  under  the  agreement.   There  was  no

rejoinder from either KLSE or SCANS.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDP has fulfilled its part of the agreement. It has

provided  SCANS  with  all  information  required  under  the

agreement and the CLOB securities have been transferred  into

a  consolidated account held with the MCD.  MCD informed  CDP

on  20th  October 1998 that individual interim  accounts  had

been opened in the names of the persons appearing on the list

furnished  by the CDP.  But SCANS has failed to complete  its

obligations  and  continues not to  perform  its  contractual

duties.   CDP has since repeatedly requested SCANS to provide

the  interim securities account numbers.  SCANS has not  done

so to date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the KLSE has not replied to SGX's letter to it asking

for  a  response within one month of 7th December  1999,  the

Minister  for  Finance, Dr Richard Hu,  has  written  to  his

Malaysian  counterpart, Tun Daim Zainuddin, on  13th  January

2000.   Dr  Hu's  letter sets out the Singapore  Government's

understanding of the legal issues involved, and requested Tun

Daim  to  ask the KLSE to fulfil its legal obligations  under

the CDP-SCANS agreement.  Dr Hu is now awaiting the Malaysian

Finance Minister's reply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CLOB issue must be settled in accordance with the

law, and with the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 648</b></font><br><br>

rights  and  obligations of CLOB investors and the  Malaysian

authorities.  An early resolution is in the profound interest

of  both  countries.   The SGX and the  Singapore  Government

continue to be anxious to resolve the matter bilaterally with

Malaysia  and  will  make  every effort  to  do  so.   It  is

therefore premature to speculate on what further steps may be

necessary should a bilateral solution not prove feasible.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I have a few

supplementary  questions  but,  before  asking  them,  may  I

declare  that I have no personal pecuniary interest  in  this

matter because I have no investment or shares in CLOB at all,

but it is in the interest of 170,000 Singaporean shareholders

who have shares in CLOB.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister, in

view  of  the  tardiness or lack of reply from the  Malaysian

authorities,  whether  he  would  convey  to  the   Malaysian

authorities  the  impatience and  indignation  of  investors,

mostly  Singaporeans  and, in fact some  Malaysians,  on  the

delay.   This  delay  has  actually caused,  in  some  cases,

hardship or perhaps even bankruptcy to the investors who  are

caught in the bind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we have read in the newspapers that our Prime

Minister  is  going to have a meeting with Dr Mahathir  after

the  Chinese New Year.  I would like to ask the Deputy  Prime

Minister  whether  he would ask that the  Malaysians  include

this CLOB issue as an agenda item in the discussion with  the

Prime Minister of Malaysia and also to convey the Singaporean

investors' indignation and impatience over this issue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third question is, while we are being patient

ourselves  and  waiting  for  the  Malaysian  authorities  to

respond  to  our various letters, especially the most  recent

letter from the Minister for Finance, and in view of the June

2000  deadline, will it not be possible for us  to  institute

the  legal process at the same time, because six more  months

is  not a very long time.  This matter may still drag on  for

more than six months.  So is it possible for us to do it in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 649</b></font><br><br>

parallel, ie, institute the legal process through the WTO and

through  the  Malaysian legal system?  At  least,  we  should

register our displeasure with the matter.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first on the

impatience and indignation of investors, we have pressed  the

matter with the Malaysian authorities with all the vigour and

urgency  which  we  are capable of.  They are  aware  of  the

impatience  of  the  investors.   SIAS has  expressed  itself

repeatedly in public, including in Malaysia, and  I  am  sure

that proceedings in this House are also reported.  It can  be

seen  that many of the MPs have raised this matter on  behalf

of investors and wanted it to be solved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Prime Minister meeting Dr Mahathir, I think

what the Prime Minister said was that he may meet Dr Mahathir

after the Chinese New Year period, not now.  If, by the  time

he  meets Dr Mahathir, the matter is not resolved, it will be

raised between them.  It cannot not be raised, because it  is

one  of  the  issues.  But we are not depending  on  personal

arrangements to solve this problem.  This problem has  to  be

solved  in accordance with the law, with the contracts,  with

the  solemn  obligations which the Malaysian  Government  has

undertaken at the WTO.  That is why Dr Hu has written to  Tun

Daim  in order to ask him to get his officials to pursue  the

matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong then talked about the possibility of legal

process  in  parallel.   As  I have  said,  it  is  a  little

premature for us to commit now and speculate on what we would

do  if our bilateral measures do not work.  Dr Hu's letter to

Tun  Daim  was on 13th January 2000.  It is only a  few  days

ago.   So  it is only courteous for us to give the  Malaysian

side  some  time to study the letter before we see  how  they

decide to respond.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, while

we  wait  for  the  reply  from the  Malaysian  Minister  for

Finance, can we at the same time set certain

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 650</b></font><br><br>

deadline for ourselves as to what we would do next in case we

do  not  have a satisfactory response?  I think the investors

have  waited  quite a long time and they are  dragging  their

feet on this issue for too long.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are pursuing

this  matter.  I do not know whether it would be helpful  for

us  to conduct our negotiations in effect in public, which is

what  we  will do if I oblige Mr Inderjit Singh, but  we  are

pursuing it urgently.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Two supplementary

questions,  Sir.  I note that this agreement is  between  CDP

and  SCANS.   I would like to know whether this agreement  is

legally binding on the KLSE and MCD.  If so, how does it bind

them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I feel that the issue of CLOB has been long

outstanding.  Perhaps the Government should set a deadline to

resolve the issue.  If not, what is the course of action that

the  Government will take?  Otherwise, Singaporean  investors

would just be waiting with no solution.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I have

explained,  the agreement was signed between CDP  and  SCANS.

It  is binding on the KL Stock Exchange and MCD.  That is our

legal advice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of deadline, I understand Mr Low's view.

This  is exactly what Mr Inderjit asked just now and the same

reply applies.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> It is

really  echoing  what Mr Inderjit Singh and  our  Member  for

Hougang  have  asked.  In view of the time  taken,  does  the

Government  not think it proper and reasonable to inform  the

Malaysian  authorities  that unless the  matter  is  resolved

within a set period, the matter will have to be resolved by a

court?   There  is  no question that the  matter  has  to  be

resolved according to law.  So why are we dragging our feet?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a rare

occasion, but for once I fully

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 651</b></font><br><br>

sympathise  with Mr Jeyaretnam's sentiments.   I  agree  with

him.   It  is not a matter to be dragged on.  We are pursuing

it  urgently, but I do not think it is helpful for us to make

public  announcements of deadlines and then  bind  ourselves.

But  we  are  not  standing around.   As Mr Jeyaretnam  says,

finally  it has to be resolved  in a court, if it  cannot  be

resolved any other way.  As the Prime Minister has said, this

is not just a Malaysian court issue, but if there is no other

way,   it  has  to  also  go  to  the  WTO.   [Mr  Jeyaretnam

interrupted.]   Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  Mr  Jeyaretnam  can  rest

assured that the grass is not growing beneath our feet.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S C Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

may  I ask the Deputy Prime Minister, while I recognise  that

there  is no need for public deadlines, it may not be in  our

interest, will the Government at least set itself an internal

deadline?  Can we be assured of that?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, given that the WTO remains a matter of

recourse,  the Deputy Prime Minister must be aware  that  the

first  complaint  filed  with WTO was between  Singapore  and

Malaysia regarding petrochemicals.  Why is this so different?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, if I tell him that

I have an internal deadline, it becomes a public one.  As for

WTO, I am aware that the first complaint at the WTO was filed

by  Singapore with the Malaysian authorities and  the  matter

was  entirely and satisfactorily resolved within a reasonable

period of the complaint being filed.  If you ask why is  this

different, my answer is, this is not different.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, firstly, while there

may  not  be a need to disclose an internal deadline,  it  is

useful to have the Members of Parliament on this side of  the

House  to  express that we prefer a stated deadline of,  say,

three  months,  that we want to make public to the  Malaysian

authorities.   Thereafter, we would start the legal  process.

Otherwise, the legal process will never get started.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to ask the Deputy Prime Minister,

among all the proposals

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 652</b></font><br><br>

that have been tabled or made, is there any one that seems to

be favourable or fair to our Singapore investors?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the position which the Malaysians have

proposed.  They have threatened that if it is not solved, the

shares  would  be transferred to the Malaysian  Minister  for

Finance.  Is there any basis for the Malaysians to claim that

these  shares could be transferred to the Malaysian  Minister

for Finance?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we have beaten the

issue of deadlines to death.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On whether any of the proposals are favourable and fair,

it  is not for me to judge.  If a private sector proposal  is

made,  which  is  fully in accordance with  the  law  and  we

distribute  it,  then it is up to investors  to  make   their

decisions and decide whether it is favourable to them or not.

They know their legal rights.  We have informed them of their

legal rights.  They know that we are pursuing the matter with

the  Malaysian  Government in order to help them  to  enforce

those legal rights.  So it is not a matter whether generosity

has   been  exercised,  but  have  their  legal  rights  been

fulfilled or not?  If so, they settle.  If their legal rights

have  not been fulfilled or there has been a breach, then  it

is up to them whether they want to settle for less.  But as I

have  explained  in  my  main answer, private  sector  offers

cannot  solve  the  CLOB  problem because  the  CLOB  problem

involves the two authorities.  The Malaysian authorities have

a responsibility to deal with this.  The CLOB investors, some

of  whom  are  not Singaporeans, have rights which  they  can

expect the Malaysian authorities to respect.  If you ask what

is  a fair agreement, I say a fair agreement is in accordance

with the law and the contract.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether there is a basis for transfer to the

Minister  for  Finance  of Malaysia if  they  do  not  accept

private  sector  agreements, MAS has issued a statement  last

year  which  I referred to, there is no basis of transfer  to

the  Minister  for Finance under Malaysian  law.   I  am  not

saying whether it will or will not take

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 653</b></font><br><br>

place.   But if you ask me whether under the law there  is  a

basis, the answer is no.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> General Lee, I take it that Questions 1 to 3

have been dealt with.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Yes.

<div align="center"><b>FOREIGN CORPORATIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Listing of shares and issue of bonds in Singapore dollars)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Deputy Prime Minister

what  are the pros and cons of allowing (i) foreign companies

to  list  their shares in Singapore dollars and (ii)  unrated

foreign corporations and sovereigns to issue Singapore-dollar

denominated bonds.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in 1998, MAS

revised its guidelines on the non-internationalisation of the

Singapore dollar (S$) to make it easier for foreign companies

to  list their shares in S$.   The aim was to attract foreign

companies  to list in Singapore to add depth to  our  capital

market.   As a precaution, MAS required the foreign companies

listing in S$ to have at least 20% of their revenues, profits

or  expenses attributable to their Singapore operations.  But

few foreign companies came, as most of those eligible to list

have  little or no operations in Singapore.  While they could

still  list  here  in  foreign  currencies,  not  many   were

interested  in  doing so, because foreign  currency  listings

generate less trading interest than S$ shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in November 1999, MAS lifted the 20%

requirement,  and  allowed foreign companies  to  list  their

shares  in S$ on the Singapore Exchange (SGX), provided  they

met SGX's listing requirements. However, they had to keep the

S$  proceeds  from the share issue with a bank in  Singapore,

and  convert  them  into foreign currency before  using  them

outside Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, MAS also revised its guidelines to allow

foreign  entities  of  good  credit  standing  to  issue   S$

denominated bonds,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 654</b></font><br><br>

provided  they swapped the S$ proceeds into foreign currency.

This  has  boosted  the  development of  the  Singapore  bond

market.  It  provided a greater variety  of  debt  papers  to

investors,   in   addition  to  the   traditional   Singapore

Government and Singapore based corporate issuance.  So far, a

total  of  S$3  billion  of foreign  bond  issues  have  been

launched.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Industry players have fed back to MAS that further

widening  the  range  of  instruments  allowed  would   offer

investors  more  opportunities to diversify  their  holdings.

Thus  MAS  announced  in November 1999 that  it  would  allow

foreign  companies and sovereigns, both rated or unrated,  to

issue  S$-denominated bonds. For unrated bonds, the  investor

base is restricted to sophisticated investors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are indeed risks when Singaporeans buy bonds

issued  by   unrated foreign entities.  For  bonds  that  are

rated  by  internationally reputable and  independent  rating

agencies,  investors have the benefit of  their  analyses  to

guide their decisions.  While some unrated issuers are indeed

financially  strong,  investors at large  may  not  have  the

benefit of independent analyses to aid them in their decision

making.   Also, such issuers are not necessarily  subject  to

internationally  accepted disclosure rules.   Investors  must

therefore do their own homework to make an informed decision.

That  is why we have decided to restrict the sales of unrated

bonds  to  sophisticated investors.  These are investors  and

corporations  who  have high net worth or  incomes,  and  who

should  be  able  to make their own financial decisions  with

fewer constraints.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes to the equity and bond markets will bring

more  international  participation in  our  capital  markets,

adding depth and critical mass. Listings of foreign companies

increase the capitalisation and turnover of Singapore's stock

market,   expand  the  universe  of  investible   stocks   to

investors, and attract more research analysts, fund  managers

and  underwriters  to base here.  For the  bond  market,  the

changes  will broaden the credit spectrum of foreign entities

tapping the Singapore bond market. A vibrant

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 655</b></font><br><br>

bond  market in Singapore will provide corporations here  and

in  the  region with another efficient avenue to raise funds,

on  top  of bank borrowings and equity issues.  It will  help

Singapore to develop as an international financial centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thrust of our policy on the non-internationalisation

of  the S$ is to prohibit non-residents from borrowing S$ for

activities which are unrelated to the Singapore economy. This

could   lead  to  the  build-up  of  a  pool  of  S$  abroad,

potentially  jeopardising  the effective  management  of  our

exchange rate. To minimise this risk, we have maintained  our

requirement that the S$ proceeds raised by foreign companies,

either  through a share listing or a bond issue, be converted

into  foreign  currency  before  they  can  be  used  outside

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have assessed the potential impact of the above

changes to our effective management of the S$ exchange  rate.

While they may make the S$ exchange rate more volatile,  MAS'

assessment  is  that  the movements can  be  managed.   These

initiatives  will make Singapore more attractive for  foreign

companies  to  tap our capital market, while strong  economic

fundamentals, sound policies and ample reserves should enable

us to withstand any market fluctuations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Deputy  Prime Minister says in the long term, to be a leading

financial  institution, the internationalisation of Singapore

Dollar is inevitable.  At the end of the day, I think that as

long  as we have a strong economy, and he has mentioned about

the surpluses to keep the Singapore Dollar strong, how do  we

on  the one hand become a leading financial institution, like

New  York  and London, and at the same time hold  on  to  the

Singapore Dollar and not internationalise.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, that is another

issue.  Increasing internationalisation in the long term,  as

Mr  Chng  says, is inevitable.  But it is not something  that

happens overnight and it is not a black and white issue - you

are either

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 656</b></font><br><br>

open,  or you are not.  It is a matter of degree.   It  is  a

matter of time.  It is a question of what safeguards you  can

put  in, even partial safeguards, in order to deter excessive

capital  flows  - sudden amounts coming in or sudden  amounts

going out - which can push the exchange rate either very high

or  very  low  and  affect our exports, our trade,  our  real

economy  and our jobs.  It is not easy to do because  even  a

big  country, like Japan, finds the Yen pushed in  directions

which  are against its basic real economy.  And when the  Yen

is  high  at  90,  or at one stage below  90  to  US$,  their

manufacturing exports suffered, and many of their  industries

became uncompetitive.  Then market sentiment changed and  the

Yen  moved to 150 and they became worried that this was going

too  far and they intervened.  So even a big country does not

have full control.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a small country, a very open economy, so we

cannot  have  full  control.  But we can have  a  significant

degree  of control, firstly, because our economy is basically

sound.  Secondly, because we are running significant physical

surpluses, that means, there is no reason for anybody to lose

confidence.   And thirdly, we have significant reserves.   So

if the exchange rate is pushed in the wrong direction, we are

not  defenceless.  We have resources with which to intervene.

Of  course,  you  must  judge that you  are  right,  and  the

exchange  rate has gone in the wrong direction.   So  anybody

who  wants to speculate in the Singapore Dollar has  to  take

that  into account.  That has served us well for a long  time

and I think that continues to be our approach.  We have in  a

controlled way liberalised.  That is why we took a first step

in  1998.   Then we took a year.  We watched the  experience.

Some  companies  listed.  There were  some  bonds.   Quite  a

number  of  foreign  entities issued  S$  bonds.   We  gained

confidence in the new position, we took a further  step.   So

we will take it incrementally and carefully.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, in view of the

fact that foreign companies are allowed to list in Singapore,

and I think a lot of investors in Singapore may not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 657</b></font><br><br>

know  very  much  of  what  is happening  overseas,  ie,  the

companies  that are based overseas, what would  be  the  risk

involved and what is the Government's advice to investors?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> The Government's answer is if you

do  not understand, better do not gamble.  That is a problem,

whether  it  is  a  foreign company or a  Singapore  company.

Because  even with many Singapore companies, their  investors

do  not really know what the risks are, but they stand there,

look  at the TV screen behind the glass, and get photographed

for television, and they hope that they will predict the next

wiggle   in  the  chart  before  everybody  does.   But   CPF

statistics show that most of them do not outperform.  Many of

them underperform.  That is why our advice is, whether it  is

a  Singapore stock or a foreign stock, unless you  know  what

you  are doing and you can absorb the risk, do not punt.  Far

better,  put it in a fixed deposit or a unit trust  with  the

appropriate  risk profile or, as a last resort, leave  it  to

CPF.    From   MAS'  point  of  view,  we  would  like   more

Singaporeans to take an active responsibility to manage their

funds  and  put  them  outside of the CPF.   But  that  is  a

decision  which  individual Singaporeans  have  to  make  for

themselves.

<div align="center"><b>BILATERAL ISSUES WITH MALAYSIA</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin</b> asked the Prime Minister

what  is the status of the outstanding bilateral issues  with

Malaysia  and whether there has been any progress  since  the

Malaysian elections.

<br><br><!-- Prof. S. Jayakumar (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Prof. S. Jayakumar) (for the Prime Minister):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Prime

Minister has asked me to reply on his behalf.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Members of the House will recall that at our

sitting on 17th August 1999, I informed the House that senior

officials  from  both  countries have  had  three  rounds  of

discussions on the package of bilateral issues  in  1999.   I

also  informed the House that it is Malaysia's turn  to  host

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 658</b></font><br><br>

next meeting in Kuala Lumpur.  The Malaysians have on several

occasions indicated that they are aware that the ball  is  in

their  court.  But they have not yet responded with  specific

dates.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I

would  like  to  ask the Minister whether bilateral  relation

between  Singapore and Malaysia is affected by the delay  and

non-resolution  of the outstanding issues.   Second,  whether

this  delay and non-resolution has affected ties in terms  of

sports,  arts  and  culture.   We  used  to  have  a  lot  of

relationships.  Thirdly, the CPF issue.  The fact  that  they

are  requesting  that  we  return  CPF  monies  belonging  to

Malaysian  workers  is  a  major  obstacle  in  the  apparent

unwillingness of Malaysia to resolve these bilateral  issues.

And fourthly, whether we should, in fact, fix a definite time

line  to  resolve  these issues.  So at  least  we  get  some

commitment  and  secure  terms to  negotiate  some  of  these

outstanding issues.

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> First, on the fourth aspect about

deadline, maybe I should adopt, as the lawyers say,  "mutatis

mutandis",  everything that Deputy Prime  Minister  has  said

about deadlines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that various ties, whether sports, cultural

and  other  relationships, have continued.   But  as  Members

know,  these  are very much affected by episodic or  cyclical

ups  and downs in bilateral relations.  I would say bilateral

relations have on the whole been maintained.  But if you look

at  the list of issues in the package, such as the withdrawal

of  CPF  funds  earlier than the legal requirements  by  West

Malaysians,  the long-term supply of water to Singapore,  the

position of KTM land in Singapore, the Singapore Air  Forces'

use  of Malaysian airspace and the location of Malaysia's CIQ

in  Singapore - if you look at all these issues  -  obviously

these  are  outstanding bilateral issues and  it  is  in  the

interest   of   both   countries  that   they   be   resolved

expeditiously.   Now, I cannot speculate why  they  have  not

reverted  with dates - whether it is because they  have  been

pre-occupied with certain domestic considerations

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 659</b></font><br><br>

which could be one explanation.  But I cannot speculate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was mentioned in discussions on the questions arising

from  CLOB,  it was mentioned by Members that Prime  Minister

has  said that he hoped to meet Dr Mahathir after Chinese New

Year,  and  Dr Mahathir is reported to have said that  he  is

agreeable to such a meeting.  But when exactly such a meeting

will  take  place I do not know.  And I also do not  wish  to

predict  the  substantive outcome of such a meeting.   But  I

would  anticipate that when the two Prime Ministers do  meet,

one  possibility is that they may give certain directions  to

the   officials  on  this  whole  question  of  the   package

discussion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the Member's specific question on the CPF, which

is  one  of  the  bilateral issues to  be  discussed  in  the

package,  I  think Singapore's position on why  we  have  the

legal requirements governing withdrawal of CPF funds by  West

Malaysians has been made clear by my colleague, Dr  Lee  Boon

Yang,  and  many others in this House as well  as  elsewhere.

Essentially,  the rules have provided for certain  withdrawal

procedures  and  we  have  followed  the  rules.    And   the

explanations  for the existence of the rules have  also  been

explained,  and  the  points have been  registered  that  the

regime of withdrawal for West Malaysians is, in fact, in some

sense,  more  advantageous than that for  Singaporeans.   The

West  Malaysians can withdraw it, I think, five years earlier

than  Singaporeans and they do not have to have  any  minimum

sum.  But notwithstanding this, we have said that as part  of

an  overall package deal, we are prepared to look at it,  and

that position continues.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, in this sense, has packaging them

together  actually  helped  us  resolve  these  issues   more

speedily  or  should we relook at unbundling the  package  or

packing  them  in slightly smaller parcels?  Is  there  issue

overload instead?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Let us not forget that these issues on

their own can be negotiated and tackled separately and it has

gone on for some time prior to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 660</b></font><br><br>

two  Prime  Ministers'  meeting in Hanoi  in  1998.   It  was

because the previous approach of treating them separately had

not produced results that the two Prime Ministers agreed - Dr

Mahathir  proposed, and our Prime Minister agreed -  that  we

should  try to look at this as a package with officials  from

both sides.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also stress that some of the issues involved

questions  of  principles and law.  And  these  positions  of

principle,  whether  it  is  on  sovereignty  or   on   legal

interpretations  of existing agreements such  as  on  railway

land,  have to be maintained by Singapore.  So the fact  that

there is a package discussion and it is taking some time does

not  in any way affect the legal position of these agreements

under  the law.  And if you recall what I said in this  House

in  1997 on the legal position on the railway land under  the

Points  of  Agreement, Members will recall very clearly  that

there are clear legal undertakings and responsibilities under

these agreements and the time schedule under these agreements

is  not  affected.  There are certain things to be  performed

and  undertaken under the agreements and that continue to  be

our position.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Minister

regarding  the withdrawals of CPF funds by Malaysian  workers

or  employees  who elect to go back.  Is it not the  position

that a national from any other country is allowed to withdraw

his  entire  savings  and  leave  the  country?   Why  is  it

different  for  Malaysians?  If the fear  is  that  they  may

return  to  work in Singapore again, having taken  out  their

CPF,  surely  that  can be overcome by a requirement  -  they

either return whatever they have withdrawn back into the  CPF

fund  or  they  be  told that they cannot come  and  work  in

Singapore anymore.  Why are we holding on to their monies?

<br><br><!-- Prof. Jayakumar -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prof. Jayakumar:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I propose not to go

into  details  in repeating whatever has been  said  in  this

House.   There  is  a  clear question of what  is  the  legal

position.   And  the legal position is being  adhered  to  by

Singapore.  If he wants a repetition of the answers given in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>

this  House, he can file a Question and I am sure Dr Lee Boon

Yang would be happy to answer the question.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Surely the Minister is aware that merely

stating what the law is does not really help.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, the Question is a separate

matter  and  I think it should be directed to the appropriate

Minister.  Mr Iswaran.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 661</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>BILATERAL FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH JAPAN</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr S. Iswaran</b> asked the Minister for Trade and

Industry  what  are the potential benefits  of  the  proposed

bilateral  free trade agreement with Japan and  how  it  will

complement   trade   liberalisation   efforts   within    the

Association  of  South East Asian Nations,  the  Asia-Pacific

Economic Cooperation and the World Trade Organisation.

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo (Minister for Trade and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Trade and Industry (BG George Yong-Boon Yeo):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Japan and Singapore are close

economic  partners.  Since 1970, Japan has consistently  been

among Singapore's top three trading partners.  Japan is  also

currently  the  second largest investor  in  Singapore,  with

cumulative investments of over S$14 billion.  There are today

about  1,700 Japanese companies in Singapore, accounting  for

about  one-third  of  the  5,000  multinational  corporations

(MNCs) operating here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These strong bilateral economic ties are underpinned by

a  congruence of geopolitical interests.  Both our  countries

support the US' engagement in Asia, to maintain a balance  of

power  and  ensure peace and stability in the  region.   Both

recognise    the   importance   of   trade   and   investment

liberalisation,  and are active players in  multilateral  and

regional fora such as the WTO, APEC and ASEM.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Japan-Singapore Free Trade Agreement will build upon

and strengthen these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 662</b></font><br><br>

close ties.  It is a natural development of our relationship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An FTA with Singapore will help to lock in Japan's

engagement  in Southeast Asia for the long term.  The  region

will benefit from Japan's enhanced presence.  Japan has been,

and  will continue to be, an important source of investments,

capital  and technology, and a major export market for  ASEAN

economies.   Before  the Asian crisis,  Japanese  investments

contributed  significantly to the regional  boom.   When  the

crisis  struck,  Japan offered much assistance  to  help  the

Southeast Asian economies recover.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also expect the proposed Japan-Singapore FTA to

stimulate  further trade liberalisation in  the  Asia-Pacific

region.   While Singapore's primary commitment  remains  with

the  multilateral trading system, we believe  that  bilateral

and  regional FTAs which are WTO-consistent and framed on the

basis   of   open   regionalism  (as   opposed   to   forging

protectionist blocs) strengthen, rather than weaken, WTO  and

accelerate   global   trade  liberalisation   through   their

ratcheting  effect.  It is on this basis  that  Singapore  is

pursuing FTAs with Japan, Mexico and New Zealand to help fast-track  trade liberalisation in the Asia-Pacific, and to build

bridges across the different regions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see already some positive effects. For example, at

the  recent  ASEAN  Informal Summit in  Manila,  the  Leaders

agreed  to advance the timetable for the complete elimination

of tariffs within the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement from 2015 to

2010.   ASEAN  economies have also agreed to explore  an  FTA

with New Zealand and Australia.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea for an FTA between Japan and Singapore was

conceived  with  these  strategic  considerations  in   mind.

Following  the  decision by Prime Minister Obuchi  and  Prime

Minister Goh to convene a joint feasibility study in December

1999,  officials from both countries will meet in  the  first

quarter of this year to discuss the possible nature and scope

of an FTA.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 663</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Singapore and Japan are already relatively open

economies with regard to trade in goods, the focus of the FTA

would likely be on investments and further integration in the

services  sectors.   This is why we hope  to  go  beyond  the

traditional FTA to a "new-age" FTA focusing on liberalisation

and  cooperation in the high growth services sectors  of  the

future, such as the transport, financial and information  and

communication technology sectors.  Such a forward-looking FTA

will   enhance   and   strengthen  the  competitiveness   and

capabilities of both our countries.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Would the Minister comment

if  such bilateral FTAs initiated by Singapore would increase

the  probability that other countries within ASEAN  and  APEC

would  also embark on similar bilateral FTA efforts  if  they

are  major traders?  If that is the case, then would that  in

fact  be  detrimental to the regional and multilateral  trade

liberalisation talks that are taking place?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> The FTAs, Sir, would have to

be WTO-consistent and within what is allowed by WTO, and this

has  always been our pledge.  We are working towards the APEC

Bogor  goals of open trade and investment regime in the Asia-Pacific by 2010 for developed economies, and by 2020 for  all

economies.   So what we are doing is entirely consistent  and

beneficial to the cause of free trade in the world.

<br><br><!-- Mr Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Iswaran:</b> Would the Minister say that our efforts on

these  bilateral  fronts are actually  a  reflection  of  our

dissatisfaction  with the rate at which trade  liberalisation

and  facilitation has taken place at the ASEAN, APEC  or  WTO

levels?

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b> To some extent, yes. We see

ourselves   as   a   catalyst  spurring  on  others   towards

liberalising their economic framework.  When we embark on  an

FTA  discussion with New Zealand, neither side would  benefit

greatly from such an FTA, but we thought that someone  should

initiate the process and encourage others to go along.  After

that,  we  were  able  to get ASEAN and  the  CER  countries,

Australia and New

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 664</b></font><br><br>

Zealand,  to  convene a high level task force  to  look  into

establishing an FTA between ASEAN and CER economies by  2010.

So there is a catalytic effect which such FTAs can help bring

about.

the  Seattle WTO Ministerial Conference to launch a New Round

of multilateral negotiations is a great disappointment to us.

Although it has no immediate impact on the Singapore economy,

as  a  trading  nation, we are naturally concerned  that  the

momentum of multilateral trade liberalisation could falter as

enthusiasm  wanes  in  the  wake of  Seattle.   We  are  also

concerned  about  the  systemic implications,  in  particular

political  support for the institution of the WTO in  various

countries.   Already,  protectionist  forces,  emboldened  by

their perceived victory in Seattle, are now on the offensive.

For  example, labour groups and NGOs in the US have  publicly

stated  that  their next target is to block the  granting  of

permanent  Normal Trade Relations with China when  the  issue

comes up before the US Congress this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will work with other like-minded countries

towards the expeditious resumption of negotiations at Geneva.

A New Round which takes into account the interests of all WTO

members  would be important in ensuring that the  world  does

not slip into protectionism.  There is a danger that if we do

not  push  forward  on  trade liberalisation,  then  we  will

gradually move back.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In parallel, Singapore will pursue complementary regional

and bilateral initiatives, especially within APEC, to further

the cause of multilateral trade liberalisation.

<div align="center"><b>ALTERNATIVE MEDICAL BENEFITS SYSTEM</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

what is the progress in the implementation of the Alternative

Medical Benefits System, which was proposed by the Tripartite

Committee on the Extension of Retirement Age in 1995.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  in  November 1995, my  Ministry  appointed  a

Tripartite Committee to review the minimum retirement age and

the  cost  implications of a higher retirement age, including

the  desirability  to  move away from  the  employer-provided

medical  benefit  system.  The Committee recommended  raising

the   minimum  retirement  age  from  60  to  62.   This  was

implemented with effect from 1st January 1999.  The Committee

also  recommended  several  measures  to  help  enhance   the

employability  of  older workers so  that  the  extension  of

retirement  age  would not undermine cost competitiveness  of

the  employers.   These  measures  include  the  capping   of

retrenchment benefit payment, the implementation of the base-up wage system, and the replacement of the existing employer-provided  medical benefit scheme with an Alternative  Medical

Benefit Scheme.  Progress has been good in voluntary adoption

by  employers  and  unions  of the  capping  of  retrenchment

benefit and base-up wage system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there has been no progress in the case of the

Alternative  Medical Benefit Scheme.  Under this  Scheme,  as

proposed  by  1995  Tripartite Committee, existing  employees

will  be given average in-patient expenses for the past three

years  plus  1%  of salary as an additional  contribution  to

their  Medisave  account.   New  employees  will  receive  an

additional 1% of their salary also to be contributed to their

Medisave   accounts.    For  outpatient  expenses,   existing

employees  will receive a salary adjustment  of  1%  or  some

other mutually agreeable and appropriate level

in return for co-paying their outpatient expenses.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 666</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, both unions and employers had encountered

difficulties   in  applying  this  idea.   The   unions   had

difficulty in persuading existing employees, particularly the

older  ones,  to opt into the scheme because  they  were  not

willing  to give up the comprehensive medical benefits  which

they  currently  enjoy.   As the trade-off  benefit  for  new

employees is lower at 1%, unions were also concerned that the

older  retrenched  employees, who would be  regarded  as  new

employees when they join another company, could end  up  with

insufficient Medisave to meet their in-patient expenses.   On

the other hand, employers were concerned about the additional

cost of implementing the Alternative Medical Benefits Scheme.

They were concerned that not all existing employees would opt

into  the new scheme.  Employers would then end up having  to

operate  more  than  one  medical benefit  scheme,  which  is

administratively very cumbersome. Some employers,  lacking  a

long-term  outlook,  felt  that the current  medical  benefit

system  was  not too onerous and therefore saw no  reason  to

change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are concerned that changes in the labour market

and  the  rapid ageing of our workforce will, over the  long-term,  create  severe problems for the present employer-based

medical  benefit  system.  The traditional  employer-provided

medical  benefits  tend  to reduce  job  mobility  for  older

workers  and those with poor health, by tying them  to  their

current employers and medical benefits.  Under this system, a

worker who loses his job would automatically lose his medical

benefits.  This would not matter if he is young and  in  good

health.   He  can find a new job quickly and  be  covered  by

medical  benefits provided by his new employer.  However,  if

he  is an older person and not in good health, a new employer

will  be  reluctant to employ him and accept  the  burden  of

higher  medical  expenses.  This could  happen  even  if  the

medical benefits were provided in the form of a group medical

insurance, because group medical insurance policies are  tied

to the employer and not transferable to a new employer.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 667</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with increasing technological changes and business

competition,  companies often have to make quick  changes  to

their  structures, operations, marketing strategies, manpower

requirements and skills in order to survive and prosper. This

means   that  business  re-organisation,  restructuring   and

retrenchment will be common occurrences in the  future.   The

concept  of life-long employment will no longer be  relevant.

Even  in  Japan, where life-long employment has long  been  a

sacred cow, companies are having to retrench workers in order

to survive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, our workers must also expect to change

jobs  several times in their lifetime.  Hence, it is in their

interest  to  have up-to-date skills and benefits  which  are

portable,  that  means, they can transfer those  benefits  or

accumulate the benefits and transfer them to their new job if

they  have  to switch jobs.   We should therefore  move  away

from the employer-provided medical benefit system and replace

it with a portable system, which allows employees to save for

their future medical needs.  The Alternative Medical Benefits

Scheme  proposed by the Tripartite Committee  seeks  to  make

medical  benefits  portable and encourage employees  to  take

individual responsibility towards their own health.  It is in

the  interest of both employers and workers for such a scheme

to be adopted widely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my Ministry will establish a follow-up committee,

including the Singapore National Employers' Federation,  NTUC

and  MOH to review the concept of a portable medical benefits

scheme to speed up its application.  The Committee will  look

into ways to promote the Alternative Medical Benefits Scheme,

including    tax    incentives   for   additional    Medisave

contributions and cost of employer-provided medical benefits,

including outpatient benefits.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, instead of the

portable  medical benefits scheme, is the Government  willing

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 668</b></font><br><br>

amend the Employment Act to give the workers a medical scheme

under the statutory provisions?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when I announced the

recommendations of the Tripartite Committee - I believe  this

was  in  1996 - I did say that we would like to implement  an

Alternative  Medical  Benefits Scheme on  a  voluntary  basis

initially.   Whether there is a need to legislate or  provide

an  Alternative Medical Benefits Scheme in the Employment Act

is something that the Committee will also look into when they

convene to study this issue.

<div align="center"><b>SECURITIES INDUSTRY (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last two years, we have taken a series of

measures  to liberalise and allow freer play in the financial

sector.  Our aim is to create vibrant financial markets  that

fuel  economic growth.  This requires a regulatory  framework

that  is  sound,  strong  and in line  with  best  practices.

Financial markets work freely only with an appropriate set of

ground rules operating in the background which everyone knows

and  plays by.  Regulators and enforcement agencies  must  be

able  to  promptly  detect and deal with  actions  that  harm

investors.  If investors lose confidence in the integrity  of

our  securities markets, we will enter a vicious cycle. Stock

valuations  will  be poor because there is  little  secondary

activity.  Good companies will shun listings on  the  market,

while doubtful ones embrace the opportunity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules therefore do matter. The two principal pieces of

legislation  governing trading on our securities markets  are

the  Securities  Industry Act and the  Futures  Trading  Act.

While  the  latter  was substantially amended  in  1995,  the

former  has not been amended since 1986, when it was enacted.

For example, our insider trading

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 671</b></font><br><br>

provisions,  which are found only in the Securities  Industry

Act, were drawn from 1980 Australian legislation. Australia's

practice has subsequently evolved, and their legislation  was

amended  in 1991, but we have not yet brought our legislation

up to date.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAS has examined the provisions governing insider

trading  in Australia, as well as the laws in other countries

with more developed markets.  We have concluded that the most

pressing  gaps are in the lack of civil remedies for  insider

trading. These gaps will be remedied by this amendment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides insider trading, the other main amendment in

this  Bill  is  to  the  rules  governing  the  provision  of

assistance  to  foreign  regulators.   We  propose  to  enact

specific provisions in both the Securities Industry  Act  and

the Futures Trading Act to extend MAS' powers in this regard.



<br><br><i>Civil remedy for insider trading</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently, under the Securities Industry Act, insider

trading is a criminal offence.  In addition, an investor  can

obtain  civil compensation from a person convicted of insider

trading. The civil action has to be brought within 2 years of

the date of the offence, and depends on a criminal conviction

being  secured within that period.  However, securing such  a

criminal conviction is difficult because the elements of  the

offence  have  to be proved "beyond reasonable doubt".   Many

developed financial jurisdictions have therefore complemented

their  criminal  regime for insider trading  with  autonomous

civil  actions,  where the burden of proof  is  only  on  the

"balance of probabilities".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to introduce two such civil actions,

both  with limitation periods of 6 years, instead  of  the  2

years  previously.  First, the proposed section 104A empowers

the  regulator,  MAS, to bring an action to  obtain  a  civil

penalty. Where MAS succeeds in such an action (under sections

103(1), (2), (3) or (6)), the Court may impose a penalty  not

exceeding  three times the amount of profit gained,  or  loss

avoided, by the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 672</b></font><br><br>

contravening person, subject to a minimum sum of $50,000  for

an  individual, and $100,000 for a body corporate.  Where the

insider procures another person to trade, or communicates the

inside  information to another person for that  purpose,  and

thus  does  not himself make a profit or avoid  a  loss,  the

civil penalty will range from $50,000 to $250,000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This penalty is in effect a fine, but the regulator only

needs  to  meet  the civil burden of proof,  instead  of  the

standard of proof of a criminal conviction. While new to  our

jurisprudence, there are overseas precedents. Both the United

States  Securities and Exchange Commission  and  Hong  Kong's

Securities and Futures Commission have successfully  utilised

it  for  some time.  The United Kingdom has also  proposed  a

civil  penalty  regime  for market abuse,  including  insider

trading, in their Financial Services and Markets Bill 1999.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed section 104C also creates an independent

civil action, enforceable by "contemporaneous" investors,  to

obtain damages from the contravening person. The compensation

will  be limited to the gains made or losses avoided  by  the

contravening  person.  The  phrase  "contemporaneous"  covers

investors  trading  at  or  about  the  same  time   as   the

contravening person, whether or not their orders were in fact

matched  with the contravening person.  This is because  they

would  have been adversely affected, even if their particular

orders were not matched. The price at which they traded their

shares  would  have been quite different had the  information

been in the marketplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 104E, investors can submit their claims on

the  coat-tail  of a criminal conviction or successful  civil

penalty action by MAS, and will not need to re-prove all over

again  the  elements of the contravention.  They  have  three

months from the date of the conviction or award of the  civil

penalty is made final to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This three-pronged regime is quite similar to the

existing framework in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 673</b></font><br><br>

United  States.   We  believe it is  the  best  approach  for

combating insider trading.  Investors bear responsibility for

their own investment decisions, but the playing field must be

kept  level.   Strong capital markets will attract  investors

from  abroad,  boost stock valuations on the Stock  Exchange,

and  in turn, draw dynamic and well-managed companies to list

on  the  Exchange.  More financial intermediaries will follow

their  customers  to  Singapore and  a  creation  of  such  a

virtuous  circle begins with the quality and  enforcement  of

our financial laws.



<br><br><i>Assistance to foreign regulators</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have always made arrangements for mutual cooperation

between   financial   regulators.    Through   Memoranda   of

Understanding, we have had arrangements with other regulators

on a national basis.  But in the past, most regulatory issues

were  national issues.  Trans-border cases involving multiple

jurisdictions  were  the  exception.   But   now   with   the

globalisation of financial markets, financial crimes too have

gone  international.   Money  laundering  and  complex  scams

straddle multiple jurisdictions, taking advantage of the gaps

in  oversight  and co-operation between national authorities.

This   has  called  for  a  regulatory  rethink.   Individual

regulators  cannot go it alone, and hope to be successful  in

maintaining fair, efficient and transparent markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few years, the Singapore authorities have

received   more   requests   for  assistance   from   foreign

regulators. While we have co-operated with them as  fully  as

we  could,  within  the constraints of  our  law,  on  a  few

occasions,  the  legal restrictions have  prevented  us  from

providing  the  information they sought,  even  though  their

requests appeared legitimate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also been participating in international bodies

like  the  Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  The  FATF  is

concerned  with  international co-operation to  combat  money

laundering.   FATF reviews have highlighted weaknesses in our

legislation,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 674</b></font><br><br>

and  brought  home  to us the necessity of  cooperating  more

closely  with other financial centres.  We have  to  maintain

our  good  reputation  as  a centre which  does  not  shelter

illegal gains.  Singapore is not the place for the laundering

of drug money or dodging regulatory oversight.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formation of cross-border exchange alliance is

another factor.  The SIMEX, now called the Singapore Exchange

Derivatives Trading, has had a mutual offset arrangement with

the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) for 15 years.  Now this

arrangement is being expanded and strengthened to become  the

GLOBEX Alliance, involving more exchanges in other countries.

Before  foreign  regulators  give  their  approval  to   such

exchange  alliances, they invariably want MAS to  enter  into

information sharing arrangements with them.  In the  case  of

the   SIMEX-CME   link-up,  MAS  has  had   a   long-standing

arrangement  for  mutual assistance  with  the  US  Commodity

Futures  Trading  Commission.  Now with the GLOBEX  Alliance,

which includes the SBF-Paris Bourse, MAS had recently entered

into  MOUs  on mutual assistance with the French  regulators,

the COB and the CMF.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill will strengthen these relationships with other

regulators, and further facilitate our cooperation with them,

particularly  regulators  in  developed  economies  like  the

United States, United Kingdom and Hong Kong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes specific provisions on the nature of

assistance, the conditions for assistance and the  safeguards

that  apply.  Upon receiving a request, MAS will  examine  if

the pre-conditions necessary for it to render assistance have

been  fufilled.   For example, MAS must be satisfied  that  a

request  relates to a matter of sufficient gravity, and  that

the  information requested cannot reasonably be  obtained  by

any  other means.  The granting of assistance also cannot  be

contrary  to  the  public interest or  the  interest  of  the

investing  public.   If  the conditions  are  met,  MAS  will

consider further factors such as reciprocity, and whether the

act committed overseas would be an offence under our relevant

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 675</b></font><br><br>

legislation  had  it  been  committed  in  Singapore,  before

deciding whether to grant assistance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The types of assistance MAS may provide include

transmitting information in its possession, and  requiring  a

person  to furnish the requisite information to MAS for  that

purpose.    MAS  can  also  require  a  person   to   furnish

information  directly to the foreign regulator.  Persons  who

comply with MAS' requirements in this regard receive immunity

where they would otherwise have been in breach of obligations

such as client confidentiality.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In parallel with this, we are also amending other laws

to improve cooperation with foreign regulators.  In September

1999,  we  amended  the  Drug  Trafficking  (Confiscation  of

Benefits)  Act to lower the threshold requirement for  mutual

legal assistance, and to expand the scope of offences covered

beyond  drug  trafficking to a range of  established  serious

crimes.   The  Minister of State for Law has just  introduced

for  First Reading the Mutual Assistance in Criminal  Matters

Bill  which,  when passed, will enable us to conclude  mutual

legal assistance treaties with other governments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new provisions therefore provide adequate safeguards

to  prevent foreign authorities from fishing for information,

and   protect   the   legitimate  needs  of   investors   for

confidentiality   of   their   financial   transactions   and

arrangements.   Our provisions will be similar  to  those  in

other  established  financial centres, including  Switzerland

and  Hong Kong.  Investors need not worry that the provisions

will undermine the protection they have hitherto enjoyed.  On

the   contrary,   enhanced  cross-border  cooperation   among

securities regulators should increase their confidence in the

soundness and integrity of Singapore's capital markets.



<br><br><i>Enhancing Regulatory Efficiency</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these two main amendments, the Bill proposes

several  changes  to fine-tune provisions in  the  Securities

Industry  Act.   These include empowering the  MAS  to  issue

written notices, which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 676</b></font><br><br>

are  deemed  not to be subsidiary legislation,  to  licensees

under  the  Act  (this  is under new section  33A);  and  the

rationalisation  of the trust account rules for  dealers  and

investment advisers (sections 58 and 65 respectively).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes to amend the fidelity fund

provisions in the Act to cover defalcation or breach of trust

by  remisiers, as well as the financial default of members of

the   Exchange  licensed  by  the  MAS.   Finally,  the  Bill

strengthens the criminal sanctions for market misconduct such

as  price  manipulation and insider trading.  It proposes  to

raise the maximum stipulated fines in section 104 of the  Act

for  the  market offences created by Part IX from $50,000  to

$250,000 for an individual, and from $100,000 to $500,000 for

a body corporate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, amongst other

things, the amendments, which I support, seek to tighten  the

rules  on  insider  trading and to offer those  aggrieved  by

insider trading a less onerous route towards seeking redress.

I  would  like to begin by focusing on some of the  practical

issues of the related amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the civil action alternative is welcomed.

However,  it  may  still  prove  to  be  onerous  for  retail

investors,  especially for those who have already lost  large

sums  of  money  to insider trading.  If they  are  fortunate

where, following action by the Authority, there is conviction

or  imposition  of  a civil penalty, they can  then  leverage

their claims accordingly.  However, if the Authority has  not

initiated  any action, as provided for under the new  section

104A,  these retail investors themselves would have to  mount

civil  suits  on their own.  While the level of  proof  in  a

civil  suit is theoretically lower, retail investors continue

to have limited access to necessary documents or information,

especially if it is cross-border in nature.  Would the Deputy

Prime  Minister  consider making available a simpler  process

for retail investors to seek redress, whether it

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 677</b></font><br><br>

be  opportunity to persuade the Authority to commence  action

or  through the appointment of an ombudsman or a civil  body,

such as an investors' association?



<br><br><i>Stock options</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in relation to some of the inherent difficulties of

initiating civil action by individuals, I would like to touch

on  an  emerging trend, that of stock options for  employees,

which  may add to the complexity of defining insider trading.

Employee stock option schemes have a relatively short history

in   Singapore.    There  are  numerous  justifications   for

encouraging even more companies to consider this as  part  of

the  overall compensation structure, particularly as  we  are

positioning  as a hub of intellectual capital.  Sir,  I  laud

the  efforts  to promote such a scheme, as I believe  it  can

indeed  be  an  effective  way  of  rewarding  and  retaining

contributors  to  corporate innovation and  energy.   As  the

scheme  takes  off, it would soon be commonplace  to  have  a

larger  pool  of  interested parties within an  organisation.

And, therefore, the potential for insider trading may rise in

tandem.  Whilst this may not be addressed specifically by any

clause  in  the  Bill,  I would like  to  urge  the  relevant

authorities, as a preventive measure, to help raise awareness

of   such  possibilities  of  insider  trading  amongst   the

increasing pool of equity partners.



<br><br><i>E-trading</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on electronic trading, I would like to

seek  the Deputy Prime Minister's clarification.  Fuelled  by

technology and further liberalisation, electronic trading  is

likely  to  increase by leaps and bounds, with  many  brokers

already offering a variety of services.  Would the amendments

apply equally to those who have transacted electronically, be

they  the claimants or insider traders?  Specifically,  would

the  factors  for  consideration under the new  section  104C

encompass trades carried out through electronic means?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, Mrs Lim has raised

three questions.  First,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 678</b></font><br><br>

the   difficulty  for  retail  investors  to  initiate  civil

actions.  The short answer is that indeed it is difficult for

retail  investors to bring independent civil action.   It  is

always  the  case  that insiders have more  information  than

retail investors, and if the insider trading does not come to

light,  the retail investor would not even know that  he  has

been taken advantage of.  Even if he suspects something,  the

sheer  complexity  of establishing the facts  of  an  insider

trade  and  the  need  to  prove  all  the  elements  of  the

contravention requires financial and legal expertise, both of

which are very costly.  So, we expect most investors to  wait

for  successful criminal prosecution or civil penalty  action

by  MAS before filing their claims under the proposed section

104E.   This  is already a big improvement from  the  present

position,  because  presently you can only seek  compensation

after a prior criminal conviction and, furthermore, you  have

to do it within two years of the offence.  So, if there is no

criminal conviction or if the criminal conviction takes  more

than two years, then nobody can file and claim civil damages.

Now  you  can  claim  civil damages  within  six  years  and,

furthermore, you can claim it on the coat-tails not just of a

criminal  conviction, but of the civil penalties as a  result

of MAS' action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, we now allow contemporaneous investors to tag

their claim to such criminal or civil proceedings.  So you do

not  have to trade opposite the contravening trader.  You  do

not  have to sell directly to him.  Even if you had  sold  to

somebody else at about the same time when he was trading  and

taking  advantage of the market, you can still  have  a  case

against him.  So that is another significant step forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Attorney-General's Chambers and the MAS decide

not  to  pursue  the matter, then, of course,  it  is  up  to

investors to chart their own course.  But that is the case in

every contentious court matter.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some jurisdictions which do not even allow an

independent  civil  claim  by  investors.   In  other  words,

investors  do not have a cause of action against an  insider.

Instead, only the state can take

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 679</b></font><br><br>

criminal action.  That is the current position in the UK.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Australia and Hong Kong, investors can bring civil

action  for  damages, but they have to show that their  order

was matched with the insider before they have a case.  So  if

your  order was not matched with the insider but matched with

somebody  else  at  about the same time, you  have  no  case.

Whether  your  order  was matched with the  insider  or  with

somebody  else a few seconds later, it is really a matter  of

chance.   You  do  not have control over it.   But  you  were

affected whether or not the matching took place.  So we  have

decided  to go for this more encompassing approach of  giving

contemporaneous  investors  a  cause  to  sue,  and  that  is

something which the US already has.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans do have widespread securities class action

litigation.   That means a group of people get  together  and

sue  on  behalf of all the investors.  The danger of this  is

that  it  could lead to frivolous law suits that may  tie  up

innocent insiders and their companies costly litigation.   So

our  independent  civil  action by contemporaneous  investors

with the ability to tag on their claims goes, I think, as far

as  is wise and acceptable in our jurisprudence.  Let us gain

some  experience  with this, and if we need to  take  further

steps later, we will review the position after a few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim's second question was on stock options and

whether this increases the pool and level of insider trading.

Yes,  the  use of stock options will increase the  number  of

employees  holding  options in their own companies,  and  all

these employees, under section 103 of the Act, are considered

to  be  officers  of  their company and  therefore  insiders.

Therefore,  they  are  prohibited  from  dealing   while   in

possession  of  price  sensitive  information  that  is   not

generally  available.  This means that it includes exercising

the stock options or possibly later on selling the underlying

shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do not know whether stock options will

necessarily raise the level of insider

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 680</b></font><br><br>

trading.   Because  if  the employee has inside  information,

which  he  does, and he wants to take advantage of  it,  even

without the benefit of stock options, he could have just gone

on  to  the  market to buy and sell the shares himself.   And

even  if  he did not do so personally, he could have procured

somebody   else  to  do  so  and  communicated   the   inside

information  to that person for that purpose.   So  companies

should  make a timely disclosure of material information,  to

put  it in the public domain as quickly as possible.  And  in

cases  where  the information has to remain confidential  for

legitimate   reasons,  they  must  set  up  proper   security

procedures to limit employees access to it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, if somebody is tempted to do an insider trade by

his  stock  options, we have a good chance of  detecting  it.

Because  if an employee is dealing for himself, it is  easier

to  detect than if somebody else was transacting whom we  did

not  know  was  connected with the company.   Not  only  will

market surveillance by the Singapore Exchange pick up unusual

trades  to  be  matched against names  of  employees  of  the

company, but the issuer company itself keeps record  of  when

their employees exercise their stock options.  So it is a cat

and  mouse game.  There is never a final solution,  but   the

cat  is  trying to get smarter all the time, and I  think  we

will stay ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim's third and last question was on e-trading, and

whether the amendments apply equally to electronically traded

securities.    The  answer  is  yes.   The   legislation   is

technology-neutral.   This  is  in  line  with  one  of   the

principles  adopted  by  the  International  Organisation  of

Securities  Commissions, that the fundamental  principles  of

securities regulation do not change based on the medium.   Of

course,  the Internet does show up difficult issues, but  not

totally  novel ones.  Technology will heighten the  need  for

fine-tuning the Act, as we have done, for example,  with  the

definitions  of  stock  market and investment  adviser.   But

where  insider  trading is concerned, the problems  posed  by

Internet  trading are more of detection and enforcement,  and

they have been with us

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 681</b></font><br><br>

from  the  old days of physical delivery of share scrips  and

rolling  settlements.  Indeed, it may be that as the Internet

relies on electronic systems in communications, if you design

your  electronic systems properly, then you  will  create  an

electronic  audit  trail that may enhance the  monitoring  of

illicit  transactions.  So I believe that the  Exchange,  MAS

and  the  Commercial Affairs Division will be able to  ensure

that  insider  trading  does  not  grow  with  the  projected

increase in on-line securities transactions.

<div align="center"><b>FUTURES TRADING (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>2.04 pm

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving the Second Reading of the Securities Industry

(Amendment)  Bill just now, I explained the  importance  that

investors place on sound regulations, and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 682</b></font><br><br>

on  the  proper  enforcement  of these  regulations.  I  also

described  how the lack of investor confidence would  have  a

detrimental effect on our financial markets, and consequently

the  real economy.  Although the focus there was on the  cash

market,  the  same  considerations apply in  the  derivatives

market.  The amendments proposed in this Bill are a subset of

those that we had considered earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main amendment is the proposed new Part VIIA of the

Act,  which  enhances  the  level of  regulatory  cooperation

between  MAS  and other futures regulators.  I  have  already

explained  the significance of this international cooperation

for  our  development as an international  financial  centre.

Besides this, the Bill proposes a new section 21A which gives

MAS  the  authority to issue written notices  to  holders  of

licences  under  the  Futures Trading  Act.   The  Bill  also

proposes  to amend some of the current provisions  concerning

the fidelity fund in order to extend the coverage of the fund

to  include the financial default of members of the  Exchange

that  are  licensed by MAS.  Finally, the  Bill  proposes  to

raise the maximum stipulated fines for Part VIII of the  Act,

which  covers trading offences such as bucketing. At present,

the  sum is $100,000. This will be increased to $250,000  for

an individual and $500,000 for a body corporate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will notice, however, that the new civil actions

for  insider  trading are not found in this  Bill.   This  is

because insider trading itself is not presently proscribed by

the  Futures  Trading  Act,  which  governs  the  derivatives

market.  We are aware that jurisdictions like Australia  have

made   insider   trading  an  offence  under  their   futures

legislation.    With  the  proliferation  of  new   financial

instruments,  futures  contracts, for  example,  stock  index

futures,  can theoretically be affected by specific corporate

information.   So it is possible for insider trading to  take

place involving derivatives instrument.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking forward, we may therefore also want to make

insider  trading a crime in our derivatives markets.  MAS  is

still studying the matter. We are considering

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 683</b></font><br><br>

streamlining  our  securities and  futures  legislation,  and

combining  both into a single omnibus Act.  This  will  be  a

natural consequence of the demutualisation and merger of  SES

and  SIMEX,  and the worldwide convergence of  the  cash  and

derivatives markets.  Such combined legislation will  provide

a  unified framework for dealing with insider trading on both

the cash and derivatives markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may take us one or two years to prepare omnibus

legislation.  Until  we  take this  next  step,  the  present

amendments will keep us in touch with current developments in

the capital markets.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fire Safety Act, or FSA in short, was enacted in

1993.   In order for SCDF to keep up to date, it is necessary

to  amend the FSA to provide for new powers for the  SCDF  as

well as to fine-tune some of the existing provisions.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 684</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><i>Graduated penalties for Registered Inspectors and the establishment of a Committee to investigate complaints and to recommend penalties</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall first touch on the proposed changes to the

Registered Inspector (RI) scheme.  Registered Inspectors  are

a  group  of professional architects and engineers registered

under  the  Fire Safety Act.  The owner of a newly  completed

building  is  required to appoint a Registered  Inspector  to

inspect  and  test  fire safety works in the  building.   The

Registered  Inspector  has to certify that  the  fire  safety

works  are completed in accordance with the fire safety plans

and  the  Fire Safety Act before the Commissioner will  issue

the  Fire  Safety  Certificate  for  the  occupation  of  the

building.    While  the  current  Fire  Safety   Act   allows

Commissioner  SCDF to appoint a committee to  assist  him  in

considering  applications  for  registration  as   Registered

Inspectors,  it  does not provide for the  appointment  of  a

committee to assist the Commissioner to investigate into  any

complaints  of  misconduct  or  negligence  by  a  Registered

Inspector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide for a more transparent system of

investigation, clause 4 of the Bill will create new  sections

6A  to  6D  to give Commissioner SCDF the power to appoint  a

Committee  either  on his own accord, or upon  receipt  of  a

complaint,  to  investigate  into  any  complaint  against  a

Registered Inspector.  Members of the Inquiry Committee  will

comprise qualified persons such as professional engineers and

architects,  and  officers from the SCDF.  The  formation  of

such   a   committee   will  ensure  a   greater   level   of

professionalism   and  independence  in   the   investigation

process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fire Safety Act currently only allows Commissioner

SCDF  to  de-register  a  Registered  Inspector  because   of

misconduct.   There  is  no other form  of  punishment.   The

current   law  does  not  provide  for  graduated   penalties

commensurate with the gravity of the misconduct.    Clause  3

of  the  Bill  amends  section 5 of the Fire  Safety  Act  to

empower  the  Commissioner  to  impose  additional  forms  of

penalties, namely, suspension from

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 685</b></font><br><br>

practice,  and  written warnings.  The new  section  6C(7)(d)

inserted by clause 4 also empowers the Commissioner to impose

a  fine  of  up to $5,000.   The Commissioner will  only  de-register a Registered Inspector if the latter is involved  in

serious  cases  of negligence or misconduct  such  as  fraud,

misrepresentation or dishonesty.



<br><br><i>Power to disapprove plans without a written direction and revoke approvals granted for plans of fire safety works</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now move on to the system for approving fire

safety  plans. Currently, a person who wishes to construct  a

new building has to appoint a Qualified Person (QP), who is a

professional engineer or architect, to prepare a fire  safety

plan.  This plan has to be submitted to SCDF for approval.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of checking the plans submitted by the

Qualified Person, SCDF has detected errors, such as the  lack

of  endorsement  from  the  QP in the  plan  submissions,  or

sprinklers  are  not  specified.  Under  section  23  of  the

current  Fire Safety Act, Commissioner SCDF cannot  reject  a

plan  submitted  to  him  without  first  issuing  a  written

direction  to the Qualified Person to ask him to comply  with

the  fire  safety  requirements.  This has led  to  instances

where  some  Qualified Persons made careless submissions  and

relied on the SCDF to point out their mistakes in writing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, under the self-regulation system put in place

by  SCDF  since September 1998, SCDF would approve  the  fire

safety plan prepared by a Qualified Person immediately if the

Qualified  Person  has also filed a written declaration  that

the  plan fulfils the fire safety requirements under the Fire

Safety Act.  If an approved plan is found not to be complying

with  the  Act in subsequent audit checks, current provisions

in  the Fire Safety Act do not allow SCDF to revoke it.  SCDF

can  only  issue  a written direction for the  owner  of  the

project to make the necessary amendments to the plan.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 will amend section 23 of the Act to allow

Commissioner SCDF to reject

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 686</b></font><br><br>

a  submitted plan outright, without having to issue a written

direction.  This power will be used for cases where there are

glaring errors in the submission plans.  This will place  the

onus  on  the  Qualified Persons to ensure that  their  plans

comply  with  all  fire safety requirements.   It  will  also

prevent the Qualified Persons from being reliant on SCDF  for

the written directions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment to section 23 also empowers

Commissioner  SCDF to revoke an approval granted  earlier  if

audit  check  reveals that the Qualified Person  has  made  a

false declaration of compliance or provided false information

to the Commissioner during the submission of the plan.



<br><br><i>Fire  Safety Certificate or Temporary Fire Permit  for  newly completed building</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, under section 29 of the Act, the person for

whom  the  fire safety works are carried out is  required  to

apply to the Commissioner for a fire safety certificate.  The

concept  of  self-regulation  for  Qualified  Persons   under

section 23 will be extended to the submission of approval for

fire  safety  certificates under section  29.    The  amended

section 29 of the Act will empower Commissioner SCDF to issue

a  Fire  Safety Certificate (FSC) or a Temporary Fire  Permit

(TFP)  for  a  completed building based on the  certification

given  by  a  Registered Inspector.   Random  checks  may  be

carried  out  before or after such certificates  are  issued.

The  Commissioner  will also be empowered under  the  amended

section 29 to similarly revoke the Fire Safety Certificate or

the  Temporary  Fire  Permit if  he  is  satisfied  that  the

certification   or  information  given  by   the   Registered

Inspector  is false or if the applicant fails to comply  with

his order to carry out rectification in the building.



<br><br><i>Provision for powers to order the demolition, removal, closure, alteration or demolition of buildings</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to enforcement action to be taken

in  respect  of  non-compliance of fire  safety  requirements

under  the Act.  Clause 8 inserts new sections 30A,  30B  and

30C.  These sections

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 687</b></font><br><br>

will confer powers on SCDF to take appropriate action against

cases  of  unauthorised  fire  safety  works.   Section   30A

empowers Commissioner SCDF to order the demolition or removal

of  illegal  fire  safety  works  in  cases  of  severe  non-compliance.  He may issue an order for closure of a  building

or  part of it, and enter any building to demolish, remove or

alter  any  works  causing the non-compliance.   Section  30B

provides  for  the  servicing and enforcement  of  a  closure

order, while section 30C provides a channel to appeal to  the

Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new provisions will enable SCDF to better deal with

cases  of  non-compliance.  The power to demolish a  building

will  only be used as a last resort, in situations where  the

unauthorised fire safety works or the building works actually

pose  an  immediate danger to the occupants of the  building.

These  new provisions are in line with similar provisions  in

the Building Control Act.



<br><br><i>Making Fire Hazard Abatement Notice permanent</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also proposes amendments to facilitate the

enforcement of the Fire Safety Act.  Currently, under section

13  of  the Act, the Commissioner has to issue a Fire  Hazard

Abatement  Notice (FHAN) to the occupier, owner, or  employee

of  a  premises to remove the fire hazard each  time  a  fire

hazard  is  detected, for example, blocking of passageway  to

the  fire exit.  The FHAN also specifies a timeframe for  the

removal  of the fire hazards.  If the FHAN is complied  with,

then the case is closed.  Otherwise, SCDF can either compound

the  offence, remove or seize any property causing  the  fire

hazard, order the owner or occupier to close the premises for

up  to  72 hours to remove the fire hazard, or apply  to  the

Magistrate's Court for a Fire Hazard Order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, under the current law, there is nothing to stop

the  owner  or  occupier from committing a  new  fire  hazard

offence  after  the  previous fire hazard has  been  removed.

SCDF needs to re-issue the offender with a fresh FHAN even if

the nature of the new fire hazard is similar to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 688</b></font><br><br>

the  previous act.  As a result, SCDF has to closely  monitor

recalcitrant cases and issue a FHAN each time the  same  type

of offence is committed.  This is unproductive. The number of

such recalcitrant cases has been on the rise.  There were  63

cases in 1999, compared to only 15 cases in 1997 and 12 cases

in 1998.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To close this loophole, clause 5 amends section 13 of

the  Act to empower the Commissioner when issuing a FHAN,  to

require  the offender to take the necessary steps to  prevent

the  re-occurrence  of  the  said  fire  hazard.   With  this

amendment,   SCDF   can   take   immediate   action   against

recalcitrant owners/occupiers.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposals that I have presented today are necessary

to  ensure that the Act remains relevant to our needs.   They

will  enable  us to maintain one of the highest  fire  safety

standards in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

first, I declare myself as a practising architect.  I support

the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, it has always been a long and tedious

process  for  the  professionals  to  obtain  building   plan

clearance from the Fire Safety Bureau.  Usually it  takes  up

to  two to three months or maybe even longer.  It was due  to

the  differences in the interpretation of grey areas  in  the

Fire  Code,  resulting  in time spent vetting  the  plans  in

detail   and   the   to-and-fro   discussions   between   the

professionals  and  the  Fire  Safety  officers.   With   the

introduction  of the amendment of section 23, new  subsection

23(4),

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where an application for approval of the plans of fire

safety works under subsection (1) is accompanied by a written

declaration  by the qualified person who prepared  the  plans

declaring  that  the plans have been prepared  in  accordance

with  the  Fire  Code  adopted  under  section  55,  and  the

provisions  of this Act and any regulations made  thereunder,

the Commissioner may, without checking the plans, approve the

plans  on  the  basis  of  the  written  declaration  by  the

qualified person.",

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 689</b></font><br><br>

this  results in the time taken to approve the  plans  to  be

shortened to less than a week.  This dramatic improvement  is

due  to  the  doing  away with the time-wasting  and  tedious

process  necessary in the old system of vetting and  checking

through  every plan submitted.  I must commend the tremendous

effort  put  in  by the Fire Safety Bureau and the  Singapore

Institute  of Architects in working out all the  details  and

safeguards that make this new submission procedure possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In safeguarding that there is no abuse to the new

procedure  under  the  same  section,  new  subsection  23(6)

provides that -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Commissioner may at any time revoke any approval

granted in respect of any plans of fire safety works -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) under subsection (2) (a), if he is satisfied that

any  information given in the application for approval or any

document  submitted to the Commissioner  in  respect  of  the

application  for approval is false in a material  particular,

and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) under subsection (4), if he is satisfied that the

written   declaration  submitted  by  the  qualified   person

referred to in that subsection is false."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I think that this safeguard is necessary, and

although  the Fire Safety Bureau and the Singapore  Institute

of Architects have worked very hard in refining the grey area

in  the Fire Code, there will always be problems arising  out

of  the  different interpretation of the Code and not due  to

the  qualified  person  (QP)  intentionally  producing  false

information or trying to violate the Code.  Even  though  the

FSB  officers  have been very cooperative  in  granting  pre-consultation to the professionals, there may still  be  areas

where  interpretation of the Fire Code differs.  And if  this

surfaces  after  the  building is  completed,  it  will  have

serious and irreversible consequences, as it is stated in the

new  section  30A  wherein  the Commissioner  can  order  the

demolition,  removal, etc. of unauthorised fire safety  work,

if  he  deems  that the building built has not  conformed  to

regulations laid down by the Fire Code.  These include  cases

where  the plan has been certified by the QP and accepted  by

the SCDF during submission stage.  So, when the building

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 690</b></font><br><br>

is  completed,  an application is made for  the  Fire  Safety

Certificate.   If the Fire Safety Bureau or  SCDF  has  found

that  a  portion of the building which is built according  to

the  submitted plans cannot be accepted due to the  different

interpretation  of  a certain clause in the  Fire  Code,  the

Commissioner can under section 30A order the affected part of

the  building to be demolished or removed.  It may  sometimes

create an impossible situation as it is very difficult to  do

so  in  order  to  comply  with  the  new  SCDF  requirement,

especially if it is a high-rise building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate, let me give you an example. If the

interpretation  of the provision of minimum distance  between

two   staircases   differs,  as  it  is  subject   to   other

considerations  such  as provision of  external  ventilation,

provision  of fire doors, etc, and if the final  decision  by

the SCDF is that the distance falls short of the requirement,

then  it will be a very difficult situation for the owner  as

it  may  not only be extremely costly to do any rectification

at  that stage, but it sometimes may not be practical  to  do

so.  Although there is a provision for an aggrieved person to

make  an appeal to the Minister under section 30C, it may  be

too  late to dispute who has the correct interpretation,  and

usually the FSB or the SCDF will win.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it would be most important that we ensure

that the Fire Code is so clear and precise that it leaves  no

room  for  different interpretation.  At this point,  I  must

commend  that  the SCDF and the Institute of Architects  have

put  in  tremendous  work  in  drafting  the  handbook  which

addresses  most  of these grey areas in the Fire  Code.   But

there should be constant review of the Code to ensure that no

ambiguity, especially those involving critical areas, is left

unresolved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to request the Minister to look

into  an  area  which is not covered in this Amendment  Bill.

Under  the  old system, the developer has to pay  a  sizeable

plan  fee  for  the plans to be processed.  It  is  justified

because  much time and effort has to be made by  the  FSB  to

process  all  the  plans submitted.  However,  now  that  the

system has been streamlined and no vetting of plans is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 691</b></font><br><br>

needed  and no administration time is required, I  hope  that

the Minister can consider adjusting the plan fee accordingly.

Besides,  under the new system, a fee has to be paid  for  an

appeal for waiver is submitted anyway.  Therefore, it is only

appropriate that the plan fee required under the  old  system

be reviewed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, I rise to support the motion.  Before I proceed, I would

like  to  declare  my interest.  I am one  of  the  qualified

persons mentioned in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, fire safety is one of the important issues for

buildings, especially for public buildings, because there  is

risk  of life in the event of a fire.  To ensure fire  safety

work  to be properly designed, built and maintained, the Fire

Safety  professional, the qualified persons,  the  Registered

Inspector and the landlord must do their part to comply  with

the Fire Safety Act and the related Code of Practice.  It  is

not  uncommon  for people to violate fire safety regulations.

Just during the last Christmas shopping season, the Singapore

Civil Defence Force had found that some shopping centres  did

not comply with the fire safety requirement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in a free market economy like Singapore,

businessmen  try  to save cost and professionals  try  to  be

competitive,  and lower their professional  fees.   Both  the

business cost and the professional fee could only be  lowered

to   an   extent,  where  minimum  standards  of  the  safety

specifications  are still achievable, below which  they  will

all  breach the Fire Safety Act and will be punishable  under

the  Act.   The Act must therefore be crafted in a  way  with

sufficient deterrent measures which are effective  enough  to

deter  any person from violating the Fire Safety Regulations.

These  amendments  spell  out  the  type  of  punishment  and

disciplinary   action   against  the  Registered   Inspector,

qualified person and the landlord.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the Registered Inspector, the newly added

punishment for written warning, short-term suspension and the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 692</b></font><br><br>

imposed  $5,000 penalty by the Commissioner of Civil  Defence

Force are commendable.  The penalties imposed range from  low

to  high  to  deal with the different degrees of severity  in

breaching  the fire safety requirements.  We do not  need  to

wait  for an error or violation to be so great that a  person

should be punishable under the Professional Engineers Act  or

the  Architects Act with a fine of up to $50,000  and  to  be

struck  off  from the register.  With this new  measure,  the

incorporation  of  a minor penalty, the Registered  Inspector

has  to be careful, regardless of the size and nature of  the

work.   By  doing so, the RI has to be more thorough  in  his

work and he will exercise care, even though it is a small job

and with a small fee of only a few hundred dollars.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister, when a person is

penalised  under  this  particular minor  punishment  by  the

Commissioner  of  Civil Defence Force,  is  the  person  also

subjected  to  the disciplinary action under the Professional

Engineers Act and the Architects Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amended section 6A(7) states that in the absence of

the  Chairman of an Inquiry Committee, the Commissioner  will

appoint  an acting Chairman.  Section 6B(3) states  that  all

the members of the Inquiry Committee must be present in order

to  constitute  a quorum of the Inquiry Committee.   I  would

like  to ask whether there is any conflict between these  two

clauses.  The amendment focuses on the issue of investigation

of  complaint  against the RI and whether he is guilty  under

the  Act.   However,  the Act is silent on  the  complainant.

Should  the  complainant  also be subject  to  some  form  of

punishment  if he makes a frivolous complaint  against  a  RI

without any reasonable ground?  This will prevent people from

taking advantage of the Act to go against any RI.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new section 23(4) is the implementation of the self-declaration for fire safety work by a qualified person. The

Commissioner  will  approve the submission  plan  immediately

without  checking.  This is a positive measure  to  speed  up

application work and could save a lot of money for

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 693</b></font><br><br>

the   landlord  who  is  desperate  for  time  to  carry  out

construction  or renovation work.  This measure places  trust

on   the  qualified  person  and  also  puts  a  very   heavy

responsibility on him.  This is because the qualified  person

designs the work based on the code of practice.  This kind of

code will not be exhaustive in the coverage of all aspects of

the   work   involved.    Sometimes,   it   is   subject   to

interpretation  when there should be a  grey  area.   In  the

older  system,  the qualified person will wait for  approval.

Otherwise,  it  is  amended  in accordance  with  a  list  of

approved conditions.   Under the new rules, if the grey  area

should  be spotted and declared as non-compliance,  the  risk

will be that they have to face additional costs, loss of  use

and  also  the possibility of withdrawal of the  Fire  Safety

Certificate after the completion of fire safety works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, the Commissioner will go after the

qualified person but, in actual fact, the cost and  the  loss

of  use  of  the premises are normally borne by the landlord.

The  latter may resist and delay the rectification  work  and

cause  the  qualified  person to  commit  the  offence  under

subsection (9).  Could the Minister explain how the Bill will

deal  with these situations, as I have explained, so that  no

party involved could obstruct the measures taken in order  to

comply with the specific notice issued by the Commissioner?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of demolition and removal order under

section  30, it will be served to the landlord or the  tenant

if the building had already been issued with a temporary fire

certificate.   However, the order is actually served  to  the

qualified  person if the fire safety works are  in  progress.

For  the  latter,  in my view, the landlord  and  the  tenant

should  also be served with a similar order because they  are

likely  to be the party causing obstruction to the action  in

compliance with the demolition and removal order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In section 30B, it is mentioned that a premises could be

issued  with  a closure order and the order could  be  lifted

later.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 694</b></font><br><br>

There  is no mention about why a closure order is issued  and

on what grounds the order will be lifted.  Could the Minister

explain  the  rationale behind the closure order  in  section

30B?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> I thank the Members for supporting

the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chen is concerned about the grey areas of

interpretation after the building work is done.   I  am  sure

FSB  in working together with the various professional bodies

will make sure that such problems do not regularly happen and

that  the Fire Safety Code is regularly reviewed to make sure

that  grey  areas  are clarified.  As  far  as  the  Code  is

concerned,  we  can make it as explicit as  possible  but  we

cannot  cover  all eventualities.  But with  the  process  of

dialogue which has been going on for a long time between  the

various professional bodies and SCDF, I think this process of

consultation will continue to work well to improve  the  Fire

Safety Code.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the plan fees, I would like to assure the

Member  that  we  are not reaping all the  benefits  of  cost

savings  and not returning some of the savings to the parties

concerned.   Even  before  the  self-regulation  system   was

implemented,  it  has always been the responsibility  of  the

qualified persons to ensure that the plans comply fully  with

the  fire  safety  requirements.  The self-regulation  system

only entrusted the qualified persons to take greater care  in

preparing  their  plans  and  ensure  that  the  fire  safety

reqirements  are  fully complied with.  But  with  the  self-regulation  system,  the FSB's efforts are  now  directed  at

providing consultation to the public and conducting  detailed

audit  checks  on the plans that were submitted.   Plan  fees

were already revised and adjusted in September 1998 when  the

self-regulation system was implemented to better reflect  the

actual  resources used by the FSB.  Compared to the  previous

plan  fees structure, I am told that the FSB's assessment  is

that  there is an average cost reduction of about 23% for  an

application.  So it is quite a substantial reduction in  view

of the new system.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 695</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Prof. Low's questions, I will deal with them

specifically.  Firstly, with regard to whether the Registered

Inspector will be subject to disciplinary action by  its  own

professional  body,  it  is  really  up  to  the   respective

professional body to decide whether the Registered  Inspector

has   breached  or  contravened  any  of  the   board's   own

regulations  or  provisions under the Professional  Engineers

Act or the Architects Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the conflict about appointing an acting

Chairman and that section 6B(3) requires that all members  of

the Inquiry Committee must be present, I have been advised by

the  Attorney-General that there is no conflict between these

two  clauses.  The acting Chairman, if so appointed, will act

in  the capacity of Chairman for the Inquiry.  Together  with

the  rest of the members of the Inquiry Committee, they  will

still fulfill the requirement that all members of the Inquiry

Committee must be present to constitute the quorum.  I  would

like  to  assure him and Members of the House that  the  same

people  who  have  been  appointed  to  sit  in  the  Inquiry

Committee will investigate the case from the beginning to the

end.   The  Commissioner  would not exercise  his  powers  to

substitute  the  Chairman, if that is what  he  is  concerned

about,  or  any  other member, if the Inquiry  Committee  has

commenced its proceedings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also asked whether the complainant who makes

frivolous  complaints against a Registered Inspector  without

any  reasonable  ground  should be  punished.   There  is  no

provision  in  the current Bill for any action  to  be  taken

against  any  person  who makes false  complaints  against  a

Registered  Inspector.  Even under the present law,  no  such

provision is in place and the Attorney-General's Chambers has

told  me  that  this  is also the case for  the  Professional

Engineers Act and the Architects Act.  The check really  lies

with  the  SCDF  where  the Commissioner  must  exercise  his

discretion  in screening the complaints to ensure  that  they

are  not frivolous or that they are not without basis and the

SCDF  is prepared to re-look into the issue if there  is  any

evidence of abuse.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 696</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low also talked about the grey areas he spotted

and  the additional cost involved, and he also alluded to the

point  that the landlord normally may want to resist or delay

the  rectification work causing the QP to commit the  offence

under  section  7(b).  I would like to explain  that  section

7(b)  itself  is not amended.  But under section  23(7)(b)  - maybe he is referring to section 23(7)(b) instead - the order

to   rectify  non-compliance  is  issued  to  the  owner  and

therefore  it  is in the owner's interest to  carry  out  the

rectification work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a couple of points on the demolition order or

removal order under section 30,  which is being served on the

landlord  if  the  building has already been  issued  with  a

temporary fire certificate.  Prof. Low says that the order is

served  only  to a qualified person if the fire safety  works

are  in progress and in the case of a completed building,  he

thinks the landlord or tenant should also be served with  the

order  because  he  is  likely to be the  party  causing  the

obstruction  to the actions.   Let me assure  him  that,  for

cases  where the fire safety works are in progress, the order

can  be served to either the owner or qualified person.   And

in  practice, the SCDF serves the order on both the owner and

the qualified person.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prof. Low's last point is on section 30B where he

mentioned  that the premises could be issued with  a  closure

order  and the order could be lifted later and that there  is

no  mention at all why a closure order is issued and on  what

grounds  the  order would be lifted.  He wanted to  know  the

rationale  behind  the closure order  in  section  30B.   The

closure  order would only be issued in a scenario  where  the

owner refuses to comply with the order by the SCDF to rectify

any non-compliance in the fire safety works and the situation

is  such that the non-compliance will pose an imminent danger

to  the  occupants of the building.  With the closure of  the

building, the Commissioner may then take action to carry  out

the rectification works and the closure order would be lifted

when  the  necessary rectification works have been  completed

and the building meets the fire safety requirements.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 697</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have answered all the questions raised by the

two Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>FACTORIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>2.43 pm

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be  now  read  a

Second time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill before the House seeks to amend the

Factories   Act  to  introduce  provisions  to  enhance   the

framework  for  self-regulation and  to  improve  safety  and

health standards at factories and other workplaces.  The Bill

also  seeks  to  extend the scope of the Act  to  cover  more

workplaces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, over the past 10 years, the industrial

accident  situation  has improved.   In  1990,  the  accident

frequency  rate was 4.0 accidents for every million man-hours

worked.   It  fell  to  2.5 accidents per  million  man-hours

worked  in 1998, which is a reduction of about 40%.  I cannot

use the more recent figure for 1999

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 698</b></font><br><br>

because the statistics have not been finalised yet.  So I  am

comparing it to the 1998 figure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the improvement was seen across the board even in

industries,   such  as  shipbuilding,  ship   repairing   and

construction.   The  marine industry, for  example,  suffered

12.2  accidents  per million man-hours worked  in  1990.   In

1998,  there  were  only 6.1 accidents per million  man-hours

worked, which is an improvement of 50%.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the construction industry, the accident

frequency rate also fell from 3.7 in 1990 to 2.7 in 1998,  an

improvement  of  about  30%.  These  improvements  could   be

attributed  to  the implementation of safety regulations  and

improved  self-regulation by the industries.   Despite  these

improvements,  we  must continue with  our  efforts  to  make

workplaces safer for all workers.  We must bear in mind  that

current  safety  performance  is  still  below  that  of  the

developed  countries.   For example, the  accident  frequency

rate  for  Japan in 1997 was only 2.08 accidents per  million

man-hours  worked compared to Singapore's 2.6  accidents  per

million  man-hours  worked for the same  year.  One  area  of

particular concern is that we still see many fatal  accidents

in the construction industry. The number of fatalities in the

construction industry had increased to 73 in 1998 from 36  in

1990.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to emphasize, right from the onset,

that  legislation  alone  will not resolve  the  problems  of

safety  and  health  at the workplace.  The  efforts  of  the

Government  must  be  complemented by the  employers'  strong

commitment  to  the  safety and health  of  their  employees.

Employers and management must, therefore, take ownership  and

set  their agenda to improve safety and health conditions  at

the workplace.  Supervisors and workers must also be alert to

workplace hazards and learn to work safely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic framework to get the industries to self-regulate has been put in place for some time. Since then, my

Ministry  has  been  actively  promoting  self-regulation  in

industry and implementing

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 699</b></font><br><br>

programmes  to  help factory occupiers and employers  towards

this objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments to the Act will further enhance

this  framework by introducing provisions to require  factory

occupiers  to  take  a more pro-active role  to  protect  the

safety and health of workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall now highlight the key amendments in the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of the Bill amends the Factories Act to expand

the interpretation of "factories" to include any premises  in

which mechanical power is used in sorting, packing, handling,

or  storing of articles which is carried out by way of  trade

or  incidental  to  other  businesses.   Currently,  the  Act

contains  a provision to cover workers involved in this  kind

of  work,  that  is,  the  sorting, packing  or  handling  of

articles  in a warehouse only where such work is carried  out

as  a  business  or  by way of trade.  In  other  words,  the

warehouse must be a commercial warehouse taking in the  goods

for storage for and on behalf of customers.  However, whether

the  warehouses where such activities are being  carried  out

are  in  the  warehousing business or just  a  company's  own

warehouse to store its own products or materials, workers are

actually  exposed  to  the  same  kind  of  hazards.      The

Ministry, therefore, proposes to expand the scope of the  Act

to include warehouses or open yards where such activities are

carried  out and where mechanical power is used.   Warehouses

where  no  mechanical  power  is  used  are  obviously   less

hazardous  to  the  workers. Hence,  the  amendment  excludes

premises which are essentially stores where articles are kept

incidental to business activities and no mechanical power  is

used  at  all.  The  extension of the Act  will  ensure  that

workers  who  are  exposed  to occupational  hazards  in  all

warehouses  and  open storage areas where mechanical  devices

are in use would be adequately protected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Workers engaged in the maintenance work on the MRT and

LRT  tracks,  ie, for repair or maintenance  of  the  railway

tracks,  including  viaducts  and  tunnels,  are  exposed  to

various hazards such as falling

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 700</b></font><br><br>

from  the  place  of  work, or hazards  posed  by  electrical

equipment  and  also  moving vehicles on  the  tracks.   Such

workers  should  also be accorded protection under  the  Act.

Clause  2 of the Bill will amend the Act to cover maintenance

work on the MRT and LRT.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 creates a new section 24A to require occupiers

of  factories to establish and implement a "Lock-out"  system

to  prevent  accidental activation of machinery or equipment.

This  consists of a device to lock-out the power source  such

as  an  electricity supply, and a related set  of  procedures

using  special  tags  or additional locks  to  indicate  that

workers  are  still engaged in the work.  Such  a  system  is

designed  to  ensure that any plant, machinery  or  equipment

that   is   under  inspection,  cleaning,  repair  or   other

maintenance work would not be inadvertently switched  on,  or

activated in any way that might endanger the workers involved

in the repair or the maintenance work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a recent case, we had two mechanics trying to clear a

choke in a machine. They had actually deactivated the machine

by  turning off the isolation switch to the machine.  One  of

them  had  to  leave the job to attend to a  related  matter.

When  he returned, he assumed the choke had been cleared  and

switched on the power supply to the machine. This resulted in

the  amputation  of a finger of the other  mechanic  who  was

still  working  on  the machine. With the  "Lock-out"  system

envisaged  in  this amendment, a lock or some other  suitable

device would have been used to indicate that someone is still

working  on  the machine and therefore power to  the  machine

should  not  be turned on.  We would then have prevented  the

accident.   Hence,  we are moving towards this  direction  of

requiring "Lock-out" mechanisms to be used.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 creates a new section 27A to require occupiers

of  factories  to ensure that certain categories  of  persons

employed  in a factory are given safety training.  The  Chief

Inspector  is empowered to specify the training  courses  and

the  categories of persons, such as managers of  construction

projects

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 701</b></font><br><br>

or  wafer  fabrication plants, supervisors of processes  that

pose  specific risks, and workers who have to work in tunnels

and  other confined spaces.   Such training for employees  or

workers is fundamental to workplace safety and health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 creates a new section 47A that prohibits the

commencement of any hazardous work specified in a new Twelfth

Schedule,  unless  certain  specified  precautions  had  been

taken.   These  include  identifying  the  hazards  to  which

persons  at the workplace could be exposed, setting out  safe

work  procedures,  and implementing safety  measures  in  the

course of work and during an emergency. For example, if  work

is  to  be  done in a confined space where there is  risk  of

suffocation  or  fire or explosion, then procedures  such  as

carrying out the necessary tests on the air quality, briefing

workers  on the nearest emergency exit, and measures such  as

providing  adequate  ventilation  and  continuous  monitoring

should be undertaken before commencement of the work itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 re-enacts section 49 to provide additional

powers and penalties -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to reinstate the power of the Chief Inspector under

the repealed section 48 to stop the use of machinery or plant

in a factory;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to raise the maximum penalty for failure to comply

with  an  order  under the section, that is,  a  "stop  work"

order,  which requires the occupier to remedy the  danger  to

persons  or to stop any process or work in the factory.   The

maximum  penalty will be an increase in the current  fine  of

$10,000  to  $200,000;  or  to imprisonment  of  a  term  not

exceeding one year instead of the current term of 6 months or

to  both.   In the case of a continued offence,  that  is,  a

"stop work" order has been issued but the occupier disregards

the  "stop  work" order and carries on with  the  work,   the

penalty  would  then be increased from a fine  not  exceeding

$1,000  per day to a fine not exceeding $20,000 per  day.  To

put this in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 702</b></font><br><br>

perspective,   the  maximum  fine  under  the   Act   for   a

contravention  that  results in two  or  more  fatalities  is

$200,000. Therefore, the proposed fine is in keeping with the

severity  of the offence and will deter any factory  occupier

from  deliberately  violating such a "stop  work"  order  and

knowingly  putting workers at risk because in many instances,

the  liquidated  damages for any delay in a project,  or  the

losses  due to suspended production are far more costly  than

the existing fine of just $10,000;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to empower the Chief Inspector of Factories to take

appropriate  measures to prevent unauthorised  entry  to  any

area, or unauthorised access to any machinery affected by the

order;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to empower a police officer or an inspector

authorised  in  writing  by  the Chief  Inspector  to  arrest

without  warrant any person who contravenes  the  section  by

entering  areas, or gaining access to machinery  affected  by

the order, without the authorisation of the Chief  Inspector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 creates three new sections, 70A, 71B and 71C.

These  will  empower  the Minister to  require  occupiers  of

certain factories -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to appoint a safety co-ordinator, with suitable

qualifications and training, to promote the safe  conduct  of

work generally within a factory, under the new section 71A;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to implement a safety management system to ensure

the  safety, and to protect the health and welfare of persons

employed, under the new section 71B; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to appoint a competent person (who must be approved

by  the  Chief  Inspector of Factories) to  conduct  periodic

safety  inspections, carry out the recommendations  resulting

from  the  inspections  and  to  submit  the  report  of  the

competent person to the Chief Inspector when required,  under

the new section 71C.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 24 creates a new section 78A to empower the

Minister  to  require occupiers of factories to  comply  with

prescribed Singapore Standards and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>

Codes of Practice published by the Singapore Productivity and

Standards Board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 25 amends section 85 to increase the maximum

penalty for obstructing an inspector in the execution of  his

duties under the Act from a fine not exceeding $2,000 to  not

exceeding  $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding  3

months to a term not exceeding 6 months.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 26 amends section 88 -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to provide under subsection (2) that any person

who  contravenes  any  provision of  the  Act  or  subsidiary

legislation made under the Act is guilty of an offence;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to empower the Chief Inspector, under subsection

(3),  instead of the Commissioner, to authorise an  inspector

to  arrest without  warrant, any employed person who wilfully

interferes  or misuses any means or appliances  for  securing

the health and safety of workers;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) to extend the provision relating to corporate

offences  under subsection (13) to cover offences under  both

the  parent  Act  as  well as offences under  the  subsidiary

legislation  made  under the Act, instead  of  covering  only

offences under the Act; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) introduce a new subsection (14) to make every

partner in a partnership liable for any offences committed by

the partnership.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the other provisions on penalties were

introduced  more  than 20 years ago, that is,  the  penalties

stipulated  in the existing Act were nearly two decades  old.

Besides the penalties which I have mentioned earlier, we have

also  reviewed  other  provisions to  ensure  that  penalties

remain  effective  deterrents and help to better  ensure  the

safety of workers at the workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 27 amends section 89 -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to increase the maximum penalty for offences under

subsection  (1)  from $1,000 to $2,000  and  from  $2,000  to

$5,000;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) for contravention which is likely to cause death or

bodily  injury  to any person, to increase the  maximum  fine

from $10,000 to $20,000;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) for contravention which results in a dangerous

occurrence  or  serious  bodily  injury  to  any  person,  to

increase the maximum fine from $25,000 to $35,000; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) to provide for an enhanced penalty of up to twice

that  provided under the Act if the offender is convicted  of

committing  an  offence  in  the same  designated  categories

listed  in the Fourteenth Schedule for a second or subsequent

time.   These  include offences arising from persons  falling

from  height as a result of failure to provide barricades,  a

safe  work  platform or workplace; falling  objects  injuring

workers;  electrocution, just to name a few.   Investigations

carried out by my Ministry indicated that the majority of the

fatal accidents could be attributed to these examples which I

have  just mentioned.  We have recorded instances where  such

accidents  recurred because the occupier of a  factory  or  a

worksite  did  not  seem  to  learn  the  lesson  from   past

accidents.   They  continued to allow  unsafe  conditions  to

remain and suffer a second accident as a result.  My Ministry

therefore  proposes  that the fines  for  such  offenders  be

doubled  as  an added deterrent.  There is no reason  why  an

occupier  should allow an unsafe situation which had  already

resulted  in  an  accident to be continued  and  for  another

accident  to be repeated.  We hope that the enhanced  penalty

for  those  situations listed in the new Fourteenth  Schedule

will deter employers/occupiers from allowing unsafe situation

at the workplace to continue, and to take immediate action to

rectify  and  to  prevent  the  recurrence  of  such   unsafe

situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 28 amends section 90 to increase the maximum fine

from $300 to $1,000 per day for non-compliance of an order of

the Court to remedy a contravention under the Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 29 amends section 91 to increase the maximum

penalty  for  any forgery of certificate, false  entries  and

false declarations from $2,000 to $5,000.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, presently, the Chief Inspector may compound any

offence  under  the  Act for an amount not exceeding  $1,000.

Composition has proven to be an effective and efficient means

of  persuading  occupiers to take prompt  action  to  rectify

unsafe  conditions.  To further enhance the effectiveness  of

this  enforcement option, the Ministry proposes  to  increase

the  maximum compound fine to $2,000.  This amendment  is  in

clause 31.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 32 amends section 102 to include radiant heat

amongst  the list of factors for which the Minister may  make

regulations for its control in factories, and to  make  minor

drafting  amendments.  Radiant heat is generated by  furnaces

or similar processes.  Similar to lighting or humidity, it is

one of the factors that may affect workers' health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 33 amends section 104 to limit the circumstances

in  which  the  Minister may amend the  Fourteenth  Schedule.

This  is  the  Schedule  listing  out  all  the  offences  or

infringements under which a repeat offence can  result  in  a

double  penalty.   This Schedule, as I  said,  sets  out  the

classes   of  offences  for  which  a  second  or  subsequent

conviction  carries an enhanced fine under  the  new  section

89(6).   The  new subsection (2) provides that the Fourteenth

Schedule cannot be amended to include new offences or classes

of  offences,  or to change the classification  of  offences.

However,  the  new  subsection (3) makes it  clear  that  the

Fourteenth  Schedule  may  be amended  for  the  purposes  of

correcting    cross-references,   re-numbering    or    other

consequential changes.  In other words, the list of  offences

which  will attach a heavier penalty for a repeat offence  is

fixed,  as it is now in the Bill and it cannot be just  added

on without coming back to Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 34 amends the Fourth Schedule by adding three

other  classes  of  dangerous occurrences:  in  other  words,

incidents  that  must  be reported to  the  Chief  Inspector.

These are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Failure or collapse of form-work or its supports;

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Collapse in part or in whole of a scaffold

exceeding  15 metres in height or of a suspended scaffold  or

hanging  scaffold from which a person may fall a distance  of

more than 3 metres;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Accidental seepage or entry of seawater into dry or

floating  docks  resulting in flooding of  the  dry  dock  or

floating dock.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill also contains other amendments that are

made  for  the purpose of bringing the Act up-to-date.   They

are  mostly  of a technical nature.  Explanations  for  these

amendments can be found in the Explanatory Statement  of  the

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<div align="center"><h4>FACTORIES (AMENDMENT) BILL</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Charles Chong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Charles Chong (Pasir Ris):</b> Sir, thank you for

allowing me to join in this debate.  Sir, I support the  Bill

moved by the Minister for Manpower.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the Factories Act, in order to expand

the  coverage  of this legislation, in areas  not  previously

covered,  such  as  MRT and LRT tracks, and warehouses  where

mechanical  power  is  used, are  indeed  timely.   The  work

environment  is  changing rapidly, with  development  of  new

technology and the creation of new types of occupations,  the

existing  legislation will therefore need  to  keep  up  with

these changes.  However, I would like to urge the Minister to

consider  eventually transforming the Factories Act  into  an

Occupational  Safety and Health Act so that all  work  areas,

and not just factories

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>

and the limited areas currently defined in the Factories Act,

can  also be covered by the relevant safety provisions in the

Act.  For example, new section 27A of the Bill regarding  the

provision  of  safety training for employees  could  then  be

applied  to  cover domestic workers at their work  places  in

high  rise  homes  in  order to reduce or  eliminate  mishaps

involving  falls from windows or balconies in the  course  of

their  work.   There has been a sharp rise in the  number  of

such mishaps.  We are aware that the Ministry of Manpower has

already  taken  measures to promote safety  awareness   among

foreign  domestic workers and their employers.   However,  if

these  measures do not achieve their desired  results,   then

mandatory  safety training, as stipulated in new section  27A

of the Bill, should be considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the revision of the penalties imposed for

the  various offences under the Factories Act.  As  mentioned

by  the  Minister, many of these penalties were enacted  more

than  20  years ago, and it has not been updated.  A revision

of  these  outdated penalties would make them more  effective

and relevant to present day situations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, new sections 71A, 71B and 71C empower the Minister

to  make  it  mandatory  for  occupiers  of  any  factory  to

implement  safety  management  systems  and  also  to  employ

competent  safety  coordinators and  appropriately  qualified

safety  auditors  and  to carry out regular  inspections  and

audits to ensure the safety, health and welfare of the people

employed in the factory.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safety objectives of such provisions in the Bill are

quite  obvious.   However, the provisions should  not  be  so

onerous  that it would hinder operational efficiency and  add

unnecessary  costs.   Requiring  factories  that  engage   in

relatively  low hazard activities to implement  sophisticated

safety management systems and employ safety coordinators  and

safety auditors, adds very little value to the safety of such

factories  but  may  add significantly to  the  cost  of  its

operations.  I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>

would therefore like to urge the Minister to be judicious  in

gazetting factories that would be required to comply with the

provisions  of  new sections 71A, 71B and 71C.  Consideration

should  be given not just to the size of the factory and  the

number of workers it employs, but also, more importantly,  to

the hazard level of its activity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, new section 47A of the Bill

stipulates that safe work procedures must be employed  before

any  activity  can  commence in any  factory  or  potentially

hazardous work environment specified in the Twelfth  Schedule

of  the  Bill.   Among the safety measures  listed  are  that

hazards and potential harm to which persons at the work place

could  be  exposed  as  a result of  such  work  have  to  be

identified  and that appropriate measures must  be  taken  to

eliminate  these hazards.  Workers should also be made  aware

of safe work procedures, safety precautions and actions to be

taken  during  an  emergency and they must be  provided  with

proper  personal protective equipment.  But most importantly,

every  person  must  observe and comply with  the  safe  work

procedures in a potentially hazardous work environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I strongly support the legislation of safe work

procedures  in  such  work  environment.   But  I  share  the

Minister's view that the problem of safety in the work  place

cannot be resolved solely by enactment and strict enforcement

of the law.  The efforts of the Government must be matched by

a  strong determination by employers and management to ensure

the  safety of their workers through self-regulation.  Unions

and  workers must also play their part by adopting safe  work

procedures complying with safety regulations and by taking an

active part in creating a safe work environment at their work

places.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Mohd Magad (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

in  support  of the Factories (Amendment) Bill moved  by  the

Minister for Manpower.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my belief that this Factories (Amendment) Bill is

long  overdue considering the fact that some of the items  in

the current Act has not been revised as far back as 1973,  or

about 27 long years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of such items is defying a stop work order which

carries, among other stipulations, a maximum fine of $10,000.

The amendment Bill seeks to increase the penalty for such  an

offence to $200,000 and also double the imprisonment term  to

a year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several other provisions to increase penalties

ranging  from approximately a 40% increase from  the  current

quantum to a three or four-fold increase.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I support the increased penalties in view of

the increased number of fatal accidents over the last several

years,  particularly involving errant contractors failing  to

take  adequate measures to protect workers' safety,  I  would

appreciate it if the Minister could explain why the  proposed

penalty   for defying a "stop work" order has been raised  by

20 times, and also why it took 27 long years for this penalty

to  be  revised rather than raising it incrementally  as  the

need arises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For repeat offenders, especially those who have caused

deaths  due to deliberate safety negligence at work sites,  a

mandatory jail sentence should also be considered in addition

to the proposed higher penalties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the enhancement of penalties generally serve well

as  a deterrent, I personally believe that such measures  may

not  necessarily go a long way in preventing accidents at the

work  place.   This  view  is also  that  of  several  of  my

colleagues  in the GPC for Manpower.  Sir, I think  paramount

to  instilling proper sense of Occupational Safety and Health

(OSH)  at  the workplace is continuous education of employers

and  workers.   It  is a widely known fact that  we  are  now

moving into a knowledge-based economy in which people will be

the key competitive factor.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>

Safeguarding  the  safety and health of our  workforce  will,

therefore,  become  even  more  critical.   To  motivate  our

workers  to  perform  at their best at  all  times,  we  must

continually  accord priority consideration to  their  safety,

health and general well being.  They must feel good and  safe

knowing  that great care has been taken to ensure  that  they

are in the best work place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manpower 21 has introduced bold and exciting initiatives

geared  to  place  Singapore in a strategic  position  as  we

emerge  from the economic crisis into the new millennium.   I

am  glad to note that one of the  key aspects of Manpower  21

is  Occupational Safety and Health 21 (OSH 21) and  that  the

programme has considered various improvements to the  current

OSH  system, in addition to identifying strategies and  areas

of  focus to propel Singapore towards realising our vision of

having the best OSH standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is imperative that future OSH activities must not

just  be about preventing accidents but also take on  a  more

developmental and proactive approach in tackling  safety  and

health  issues  so as to maximise our overall potential.   It

should  lead  to  a new national OSH culture.  Responsibility

for OSH hazards must be placed  on the shoulders of those who

create  the  risk,  such  as  architects  and  developers  of

buildings,   as  well  as  designers  and  manufacturers   of

machinery and equipment, who must ensure that the safety  and

health  of  the workers will be adequately safeguarded.   The

Ministry  of Manpower should clearly communicate  this  major

challenge  that  our  organisations  and  employers  need  to

shoulder in dealing with OSH issues in the 21st century.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Annual Safety Performance Awards (ASPA) scheme which

was  introduced in 1986 to give recognition to companies that

have  achieved excellent safety performance should  be  given

expanded  coverage  and  used as  an  education  platform  to

propagate  the  importance of OSH.  OSH Excellence  and  Gold

award winners should share their experiences and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>

successful implementation of their safety management  systems

(SMS)  in  the  light  of the proposed  framework  for  self-regulation  by industries.  Since there is a requirement  for

the  safety  management systems of companies to be  gradually

audited, my concern is for smaller establishments which  need

guidance  and time to prepare themselves to comply  with  the

requirements  of the revised Act.  How will the  Ministry  of

Manpower deal with this issue?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from recognition at the Annual Safety Performance

Award  ceremonies,  the  Ministry  of  Manpower  should  also

consider devising incentives to encourage best practices  and

recognise  companies  that  have  consistently  put  in  good

efforts to improve work environment and prevent  injuries  at

the work place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, workers who have shown exemplary safety

consciousness  and  responsibility at the work  place  should

also  be made role models and accorded proper recognition  to

motivate  others.  It must be made a requirement for  workers

to  make  safety  at their work place a part of  their  daily

routine  and priority, and continually reinforce in them  the

importance of adopting safe work procedures at all times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another question that comes to mind is whether the

amended  Act  sufficiently addresses the  safety  and  health

issues  in  new industries in Singapore, such  as  the  wafer

fabrication and the bio-technology industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The safety of foreign domestic workers engaged in window

cleaning  has been given much public airing lately.   My  GPC

Chairman,  Mr  Charles Chong, has spoken at  length  on  this

topic  earlier.   I hope the Ministry of Manpower could  also

consider introducing legislation to provide for the safety of

such  employees  either  under  the  Factories  Act  or   the

impending Occupational Safety and Health Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a whole, the Act should ideally aim at making all

workplaces  safe  instead  of confining  it  to  specifically

defined work

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>

places.    Its   ultimate  aim  should  be  such   that   all

constituents  responsible for bringing about  safety  at  the

workplace  -  be it the Government, employers or employees  - are  motivated  to work together to do their  best  to  bring

about the highest level of safety at the workplace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have mentioned earlier, we are rapidly

transiting  into a knowledge-based economy.   It  will  be  a

world  in  which  economic value is derived from  the  active

generation and application of knowledge, a world where  human

capital  forms  the new basis for wealth.   Safeguarding  the

safety  and  health of our workforce should therefore  become

more  important than ever.  It is essential not only to train

our workforce in new technical skills and knowledge, but also

to  cultivate  the  humanistic respect for  human  lives  and

dignity.   There is no excuse whatsoever for  any  worker  to

lose his life or become permanently disabled in an industrial

accident.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we discuss the amendments to the Factories Act today,

I  would  like to urge the Ministry of Manpower to accelerate

the  implementation of its Occupational Safety and Health  21

programme,  which  aims at transforming the work  environment

and  propelling  as many Singapore companies as  possible  to

achieve world class OSH standards in the new millennium.   An

enhanced  and  transformed  work  environment  will  help  to

instill a new national OSH culture, which not only will raise

productivity  and participation rates of our  workforce,  but

will  also  increase the competitiveness  of  businesses  and

provide for a better quality of life for the workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, once again, Sir, I support the Factories

(Amendment) Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo (Kreta Ayer-Tanglin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

stand   to  support  the  Factories  (Amendment)   Bill.    I

wholeheartedly support especially the part of the  Bill  that

further ensures the safety of factory workers.  I would like,

however,  to seek clarifications on certain aspects regarding

the safety of workers in factories and comment on some of the

amendments to the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how does the Ministry monitor and ensure that all

the  factories  using  hazardous materials  comply  with  the

safety  precautions  required in the use of  such  materials,

especially  of  new  chemicals?  There are  new  advances  in

technology all the time and as such, new chemicals and  other

substances  are constantly being churned out for use  in  our

factories.   Section  60A  in  the  Factories  Act   provides

regulatory  control  on  the  use  of  toxic,  corrosive  and

inflammable  substance under the Material Safety Data  Sheet.

How  does  the  Ministry enforce this regulation,  especially

with  regard to new materials used?  Indeed, Mr Speaker, Sir,

how  does the Ministry keep track and recognise adverse  side

effects that these materials may possess?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 60A(3), the fine for contravening the

aforesaid  regulation has not been changed from  $5,000.   Is

this  an  oversight, in view of the increasing  relevance  in

this  area with more newer, possibly toxic, substances  being

available due to improved technology?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a provision in the Factories Act (section 69)

requiring  all factory workers that are exposed to  hazardous

materials to go for regular medical check-ups.  How does  the

Ministry  ensure that the exposed workers go for  the  check-ups?   Furthermore, how does the Ministry help the  factories

determine "at risk workers" that should go for regular check-ups?   Sir,  I have encountered factories sending  all  their

staff,  including  their  managers,  who  do  not  deal  with

hazardous   substances,  for  regular  check-ups   for   such

substances, and thereby adding unnecessary costs to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>

their  healthcare expenditure.  How does the Ministry  decide

on  the interval on the compulsory medical check-ups required

by  the  workers for each hazardous substance?  How does  the

Ministry   balance  the  safety  aspect  of  each   hazardous

substance  with the cost for the factories?  Furthermore,  is

the   Ministry  providing  designated  factory  doctors   the

necessary  continuous updates and education on new  hazardous

materials  approved by the Ministry so as to ensure  adequate

check-ups   through  appropriate  blood   tests   and   other

investigations on their factory patients?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More importantly, Sir, how does the Ministry help to

educate  both  the  management and the workers  on  the  side

effects of the hazardous materials?  Here, the age-old  adage

"prevention  is  better  than cure"  is  most  apt.   If  the

management  were  aware  of the harmful  effects  of  certain

substances,  they  would  be more  inclined  to  provide  the

necessary protection for their workers.  If the workers  know

about  the  adverse effects of certain substances  that  they

handle  each  day,  they will certainly be more  prepared  to

comply  with  the  safety measures that  are  prescribed  and

provided.   Take, for example, the use of earmuffs  at  noisy

factories  to  prevent noise-induced deafness.  Most  workers

complain  of  discomfort or inconvenience in  their  use  and

often  ignore the advice given.  They will probably  be  more

compliant  if  they realise how easily they  may  suffer  the

debilitating effects of noise-induced deafness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what are the measures taken by the Ministry

concerning  the  protection  of  expectant  mothers  in   the

handling   of   materials  that  may  cause  abnormality   to

developing  foetuses?  Do we compel our factories  to  inform

our  female  workers  on the dangers  to  their  newborns  in

certain  hazardous  factory jobs?  This  is  to  ensure  that

expectant   mothers  cease  holding  such  jobs  from   early

pregnancy,  that these teratogenic effects take place  during

their  early weeks of pregnancy must be highlighted to  these

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister can enlighten me on the queries I

have posed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like now, Mr Speaker, Sir, to comment on some of

the amendments in the Factories (Amendment) Bill as follows.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment of section 6 - I believe that the word

"liquified"  appearing in section 6(2)(m) also  needs  to  be

amended to read as "liquefied" similar to section 6(2)(t).

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment of section 9 - I feel that some flexibility

has  to  be given for the fixed period of one month.  Perhaps

the  substitution should read as "one month or such  extended

period as the Chief Inspector may approve in writing".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 27A - I feel that these words "if so

required  by  the  Chief  Inspector  in  writing"  should  be

inserted  immediately after these words, "The occupier  of  a

factory  shall", appearing on line 31.  It is  difficult  for

the  occupier of a factory to know whether his employees fall

into that class or description, unless some form of notice is

sent  to  him  by  the  Chief Inspector indicating  that  his

employees  do  fall  within  that category  requiring  safety

training courses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New section 47A - I note that section 47A(1) (d) and

(3)(b)  require  employees to be  made  familiar  and  to  be

informed  on  the  safe work procedures and means.   Further,

section 47A (4) states that a written description of the safe

work  procedures  shall  be  kept  by  the  occupier  or  the

employer.   As  such,  I  feel that section  47A  (5)  should

provide  that the occupier of the factory or the employer  is

required  to  ensure that every person in  the  factory  will

observe  and  comply with the procedures.  Sir, the  proposed

section  47A (5) does not seem to impose such a duty  on  the

occupier  or  employer.   Also  I  wonder  whether  the  word

"inspector"  appearing on the last line of  section  47A  (4)

refers  to  the  Chief Inspector.  If it is,  why  not  state

"Chief Inspector"?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment of section 88 - Mr Speaker, Sir, may I ask the

Minister  for  Manpower if the new section 88(14)  is  really

necessary.   I ask because the law on partnership  is  clear,

and we have a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>

Partnership Act (Chapter 391) covering this situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment of section 89 - as the explanatory note

states, this new section 89(6) is to enhance the penalty  for

second or subsequent conviction.  However, one may note  that

all  other subsections have provided that additional fine per

day  could  be  imposed for further offence if  contravention

continues  after the conviction.  As such, I  wonder  whether

the  enhanced penalty, that is, the amount of fine in the new

subsection 6, includes the additional fine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I stand to support the Factories (Amendment) Bill.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, first, may I thank

all  the  hon.  Members for speaking up in  support  of  this

amendment to the Factories Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now respond to the various comments and queries

that Members have raised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Chairman of the GPC for Manpower, Mr Charles

Chong,  asks  whether  we  would  consider  transforming  the

Factories Act into an Occupational Safety and Health  Act  to

cover  all work areas.  The answer is yes.  This is, in fact,

one of the recommendations of the Manpower 21 Committee.  The

Committee  has recommended that Government consider  enacting

an Occupational Safety and Health Act to cover all workers at

work.   Government  has  accepted  this  recommendation.   My

Ministry  is,  in  fact, studying the  requirements  and  the

implications of creating such a legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Occupational Safety and Health Act will obviously

cover  a  wider group of workers and cover more  work  places

than  the  existing Factories Act, even after this  amendment

before the House.  Currently, the Factories Act covers  about

700,000  employees.  If we adopt an Occupational  Safety  and

Health  Act  for  all work places, conceivably  we  could  be

covering in the region of 2 million or more workers.  We

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>

are, in fact, working on this piece of legislation, and as  I

said earlier on, studying the various implications and how to

go  about formulating such a legislation.  We expect the  new

law  to  be ready by sometime next year.  But for the moment,

we  are still proceeding with this amendment to the Factories

Act  because we cannot wait till the new Occupational  Safety

and  Health Act is in position.  In the interim, the  amended

Factories  Act will provide better protection for workers  at

their work place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Charles Chong suggested that we should consider

whether  to bring in the work places of the domestic workers,

in other words, the home, under the coverage of the Factories

Act,  or in the future when we enacted an Occupational Safety

and  Health  Act, to include homes so that domestic  workers,

particularly the foreign domestic workers, are not exposed to

dangers of falling from windows while they are cleaning high-rise  windows.   I think Mr Ahmad Magad has also  touched  on

this aspect.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we share the concern of Members for the safety of

domestic  workers working in the homes of their employers  in

Singapore, particularly if they have to clean windows in high-rise  dwellings.   We  have  considered  the  possibility  of

legislation  to  address this issue.  But we  concluded  that

legislation is, in fact, not the best approach to  deal  with

this  problem.  There was, in fact, a question raised  by  Mr

Kenneth  Chen  at  this sitting's Question for  Oral  Answer.

Unfortunately,  time  did  not  permit  me  to  answer   this

Question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to say in response to both Mr Charles

Chong  and  Mr  Ahmad  Magad  is that  domestic  workers  are

employed  in  residential premises to do  ordinary  household

chores.   They are not trained and we cannot expect  them  to

undertake  risky jobs, unlike construction workers and  other

workers working in factories.  In fact, there is no necessity

for a foreign domestic worker to be asked to climb out of the

window in order to clean

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>

the  window or to be standing up in a precarious position  to

clean the windows of high-rise flats.  There are available on

the  market  cleaning  implements with handles  that  can  be

extended  which will enable a domestic worker to  clean  both

the  exterior and the interior of the windows safely, without

exposing herself to any risk of falling from the window.   So

employers  of  foreign domestic workers  should  teach  their

domestic  workers and provide them with the right  implements

to  undertake this window cleaning job, and they  should  not

require  or  ask them to clean the window in a  dangerous  or

hazardous  manner.  It is not quite the same as  construction

workers.   There is no recourse but the construction  workers

just  have  to work on a worksite, in an incomplete  building

where  there  are  many hazards present.  It is  unavoidable.

Therefore, we have to bring them within the coverage  of  the

Factories  Act  or,  in future, the Occupational  Safety  and

Health  Act  (OSHA)  to ensure that they  are  given  maximum

protection, for instance, requiring them to use safety  belts

or  safety  harnesses if they are working on the  edge  of  a

building  and  if  there  is a danger  of  falling  from  the

building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Domestic workers are not in the situation at all. They

are  in  the safe home environment of their employers.   They

should  not be exposed to the risk.  Therefore, it would  not

be quite appropriate to cover them under the Factories Act or

the Occupational Safety and Health Act.  I have been informed

that  other  countries  which  have  introduced  Occupational

Safety  and  Health  Act,  such as  US,  Canada,  Sweden  and

Germany,  have  also excluded domestic work  from  such  law.

They  have  already considered this issue and they have  felt

that domestic work should not be part of an OSHA legislation.

So I think we should adopt the same position.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with the domestic workers being exposed to

risks  at the place of work in their employer's home is  best

addressed   through  proper  public  education   by   raising

awareness  among the employers and their domestic workers  of

some of the hazards that can be found in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>

their home, such as cleaning windows.  We should educate  the

employers and domestic workers so that they know what is  the

safe  way  of  cleaning windows.  There is no reason  to  put

themselves  at  risk.  I believe that with  sustained  public

education  both employers and domestic workers can  learn  to

work  out  safe  procedures to carry out all  their  domestic

tasks.  There will be no need for further legislation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Chong also supported the section requiring

factories  to  implement safety management  systems,  appoint

safety  coordinators, conduct safety audits and have  regular

inspections.   This  is  in clause 20 and  the  amendment  to

sections  71A,  71B  and 71C.  But he questioned  whether  by

requiring  such  an intensive or elaborate  safety  framework

would   add  costs  to  all  employers,  particularly   those

companies  that are not involved in hazardous  work  or  deal

with  hazardous substances.  I share his view.  I agree  with

him.   We  should be rational.  We should not be over-zealous

in   implementing   our  safety  regulations.    Our   safety

regulations  should  be  applied in a  focused  and  targeted

manner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will identify factories which have the highest risks,

which  are  using hazardous chemicals and ensure  that  these

factories impose the most stringent safety management system,

regular  inspection and safety audit in order to  ensure  the

safety  of  all  their  workers.   Whereas  in  the  case  of

factories  with very few hazards or no hazard at all,  we  do

not  have  to impose such a heavy requirement on them.   They

need   not  be  gazetted  under  the  category  of  factories

requiring  safety management system.  But they can employ  or

appoint one of their employees to act as a safety coordinator

to deal with various safety and health issues in the factory.

This safety coordinator could be one of the existing managers

or  supervisors, and it would of course be part of his  other

duties.   And it would certainly not add to the cost for  the

employer.  That is the approach that we would take and it  is

a  sensible and rational way of requiring industries to adopt

the  new  safety management system.  It is not an across-the-board blunderbuss kind of approach.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>

For  instance, even for construction worksites which are,  in

some  cases, quite dangerous for the workers, we have certain

criteria.   For example, they must have a contract  value  of

$10  million or more before we require them to implement  the

safety  management system because the value  of  the  project

indicates the complexity and is very often the height of  the

building.  If you build a low-rise building, a single  storey

building, it is unlikely to cost a lot of money.  But if  you

build a multi-storey building, then it is going to cost  tens

of  millions  or  even hundreds of millions of  dollars.   In

which  case, you must have a more elaborate safety management

system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of shipyards, if they employ 200 or more

workers, we will require them to employ external auditors  to

regularly  audit  their safety management system.   Likewise,

external  auditors or safety auditors will only  be  required

for  construction projects which are in excess of $30 million

or more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now turn to Mr Ahmad Magad. Mr Magad also

supports the Bill.  He feels that some of the amendments  are

long  overdue.  Yes, we could have amended them  earlier  on,

but  perhaps  at  that point in time, it was  felt  that  the

penalties  were adequate and the situation did not warrant  a

revision,  particularly the various penalties.   Now  is  the

time  to  address some of these issues which is  why  we  are

prompted  to  review  the whole Factories  Act  dealing  with

various  provisions.   In fact, some of the  provisions  were

actually introduced earlier on by way of regulation.  But  in

order to give them a stronger force of law and to ensure that

non-compliance will constitute an offence, we have decided to

bring   in  some  of  these  provisions,  particularly  self-regulation into the main Act itself.  So it is not as  if  we

have not done anything to amend the Act.  In 1995, we had  in

fact  amended the Act to beef up various provisions.  We have

already introduced, as I said earlier on, various regulations

to  improve  the  safety  situations,  particularly,  in  the

shipyard and the construction sites.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Magad also mentioned the large increase in penalty

for occupiers who defy

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>

a  "stop work" order.  Under the existing Act, occupiers  who

violate  a  "stop  work"  order, in  other  words,  a  safety

violation had been detected on the premises and we had issued

a  "stop  work" order to protect the workers but the employer

persisted   in   continuing  with  the  work  and   therefore

endangering  his  workers,  the  existing  penalty  is   only

$10,000.   The amendment before this House seeks to  increase

the  penalty to a maximum of $200,000.  Let me point out that

a  "stop work" order is only issued when a workplace is found

to be unsafe and workers are being exposed to severe risks or

accidents  by continuing to work on such an unsafe  worksite.

Therefore, when an employer deliberately violates or flouts a

"stop  work" order, he is actually putting the worker's  life

and limb at risk.  We feel that, under these circumstances, a

maximum  fine of $10,000 is not adequate for such  a  blatant

disregard for the workers' safety and health.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons is that in the case of, let us say,

the  construction  industry, the  construction  projects  are

planned  on a very tight schedule and the developer or  owner

of  the  building under construction often imposes liquidated

damages  on  the  contractors.  And some of these  liquidated

damages  could range from $1,000 to more than $50,000  a  day

for any delay.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our experience with enforcement of the Factories Act in

the  construction industry, for example, shows that it takes,

on average, about seven to 10 days for contractors to rectify

the safety defects on their worksite and then we can lift the

"stop  work" order and they can resume work.  In other words,

in  certain construction projects, the liquidated damages can

easily  accumulate to more than $200,000  in  excess  of  the

existing fine of only $10,000.  This could result in tempting

some contractors, for instance, in the industry who receive a

"stop  work"  order to disregard the order and carry  on  the

work.  In fact, the penalty is much less than what they  will

have  to  pay to the developer by way of liquidated  damages.

In recent years, my Ministry has found

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>

three  contractors  who had blatantly  violated  "stop  work"

orders issued by the Chief Inspector of Factories.  The  Bill

therefore proposes to raise the penalty for violation of  the

"stop  work"  order by increasing the fine  to  $200,000,  or

imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, or  both.   I

think  this  is necessary in order to ensure that contractors

or  factory occupiers who are served with "stop work"  orders

do  not take this lightly and do not continue to endanger the

safety and health of their employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Magad also asked whether we would consider

introducing  mandatory jail sentences for  repeat  offenders.

Sir,   presently,  the  Factories  Act  does  not  have   any

provisions  with  mandatory  jail  sentences.   But  it  does

contain provisions to enable offenders to be penalised  by  a

fine, or a jail sentence, or both a fine and a jail sentence.

Sir, generally, contravention of the Factories Act arises  as

a  result  of  failure of the employer or  occupiers  of  the

factory  to take measures, such as the provisions of personal

protective   equipment,  proper  work   platforms,   suitable

barricades or similar means to ensure the safety of  workers.

Failure   to  take  measures  or  provide  necessary   safety

provision  is  generally  an  act  of  omission  rather  than

intentional  malice.  In such circumstances, I  believe  that

the  present penalty under the Act would serve as an adequate

deterrent.  The court will evaluate the evidence presented in

each  case and mete out the appropriate penalty.  Whether  it

should  include a prison term or not should be  left  to  the

court  to  decide.   Generally, if an accident  resulting  in

death  or  serious  bodily injury was caused  by  a  rash  or

negligent act of any person, my Ministry could also work with

the  Police  to charge the person under the Penal Code  which

carries more severe penalties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the factors and circumstances leading to an

accident are varied.  Therefore, the option of mandatory jail

sentences  as  a  deterrent has to be considered  with  great

caution.   Nevertheless, where the circumstances warrant,  my

Ministry   will  certainly  press  for  deterrent  sentences,

including sentencing repeat offenders to jail.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Magad also emphasised the importance of moving

towards an occupational safety and health approach to enhance

the  working environment which is ideal, a concept  which  we

fully  support.   And as I said earlier on, the  Ministry  is

studying  this issue and we will look into how  to  enact  an

OSHA legislation some time next year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Magad suggested giving extended or better coverage

for  the  various  safety  awards  that  are  being  made  to

highlight the good or best practices by various employers.  I

agree  with him.  In fact, this is something that my Ministry

has  been  doing.  We will be giving recognition to companies

that have good safety records, and the best practices through

our  annual  safety performance award.  And  more  than  just

giving  the  awards to factories that have good  records,  we

have  been actively organising seminars and talks by inviting

the  award winners back to participate in these seminars  and

talks  and inviting other employers or managements  from  the

same industry to attend these talks so that the experience of

the  company  that  has  got good practice  and  good  safety

records can be shared with the other employers.  In that way,

we can extend the benefits of best practices to all the other

employers  in the same industry.  This is something  that  my

Ministry takes on very earnestly and we would continue to  do

so  to  propagate the benefits from best practices  that  are

already tested in the industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also consider his suggestion about highlighting

the  importance of workers who have been able to  maintain  a

safe working environment, holding them up as role models  for

other  workers.  In fact, this is very important  and  it  is

best done within the companies. Each company should highlight

their  own  employees  who  have contributed  to  the  safety

performance of the company and give recognition to their  own

employees, for instance, the Safest Worker for the  Month  or

the  Safest  Worker for the Week, so that  their  efforts  to

ensure   work  safety  for  all  their  fellow  workers   are

recognised and noted.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also asked whether the amendment would deal with the

new  hazards  introduced  by new industries,  such  as  wafer

fabrication,  bio-technology and other  new  industries  that

might  be  coming  in the pipeline. The answer  is  yes.  The

Factories  Act  itself is non-specific  in  that  sense.   It

applies  to  all the industries but we can use the provisions

to  deal with any new hazards that might arise in the  course

of economic development.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I now turn to the points raised by Dr Lily Neo. She

supported  the  amendment but asked how  the  Ministry  would

monitor  factories which are using hazardous  chemicals.  For

instance, how would we know that a factory is using hazardous

chemicals and therefore they should implement certain  safety

procedures?  In fact, all factories are required,  under  the

Factories  Act, to be registered with the Chief Inspector  of

Factories.   Before  they start work  in  establishing  their

business  and  building up their factory,  they  are  already

required  to  inform the Chief Inspector. When  applying  for

registration, the factory occupier must submit the  necessary

information,  including  a list of  all  the  chemicals  used

within  the  premises,  and they must  include  the  Material

Safety Data Sheet of all the chemicals that are likely to  be

used on the premises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 60A(2) of the Factories Act requires factory

occupiers  and  employers  to obtain  the  relevant  Material

Safety  Data Sheet (MSDS) of hazardous substances,  including

new  chemicals  which  they may use in the  course  of  their

operation  later  on.   This  MSDS  contains  information  on

toxicity, health effect and all the safety measures that have

to  be  taken in connection with workers who are  exposed  to

such chemicals.  This information should be made available to

all  employees  on  the  premises who are  exposed  to  these

chemicals  and  are, therefore exposed to  the  hazards.  The

Department of Industrial Health checks the list of  chemicals

to  identify the high-risk factories and to place them  under

an industrial hygiene monitoring programme and the Department

of Industrial Safety will then send inspectors out to conduct

regular inspections to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>

check on the effectiveness of the control measures introduced

or applied by the employers or occupiers of the premises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry also checks for compliance with the MSDS

requirements at the time of factory registration as  well  as

during   subsequent  inspections.  For   instance,   if   the

prospective  occupier  tells  us  that  they  are   using   a

particular  chemical that requires a special  set  of  safety

precautions, we would check that in the design and layout  of

the  factory  and  the  installation of  the  machinery,  the

appropriate   safety   measures  and   precautions   can   be

incorporated.  Checks are also made on the  accuracy  of  the

information in the MSDS provided by the supplier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo also asked why is it that with all the penalties

being  revised,  there  is a particular  penalty  in  section

60A(3) of a fine of $5,000 for non-compliance by the supplier

for  not providing adequate and accurate information  in  the

MSDS  which, in this amendment, we have not amended it.   Let

me  point out that this fine was introduced only recently  in

the  1995 amendment of the Factories Act and, in our  current

review, we felt that since it was only introduced in 1995, it

is  still effective as a deterrent.  There is no real need to

increase  the penalty unlike the case of some other  offences

where  we  have revised the penalties because they  were  set

almost 20 years ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo wanted to know how the Ministry ensures that only

the  workers who are at risk or exposed to various  hazardous

chemicals go for regular medical check-ups and how to  ensure

that such medical examinations are in fact cost-effective and

are  not  just  conducted on every worker,  even  though  the

person may not be exposed to the chemicals.  Sir, workers are

required to undergo specific medical examination if they  are

employed  in any hazardous occupation listed under Regulation

2  of  the  Factories (Medical Examinations)  Regulations  to

ensure  that they remain fit for work within that  particular

factory  or  working environment. An example of  a  hazardous

occupation is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>

one  which  involves the use or handling of  or  exposure  to

fumes,  dust or vapour of arsenic, cadmium or lead.  All  the

various   hazardous   chemicals  are   identified   and   the

Regulations  would  spell  out which  are  the  companies  or

occupiers  who have to take special notice.  If the employers

are  not  sure which workers they should send for the medical

examination,  they  can  always  consult  the  Department  of

Industrial Health. We will advise them on who are the workers

who need to be sent for this medical examination on a regular

basis.   The employer may also consult the designated factory

doctors.  We have appointed about 600-odd designated  factory

doctors  throughout the whole island who serve  employers  in

various  factories  and  other  places  which  use  toxic  or

hazardous chemicals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the workplace is identified to have a low exposure

to  the  hazards  that  are listed in  the  Regulations,  the

frequency  of  medical  examination may  be  reduced  or  the

factory  itself may be exempted from having to  send  workers

for  such medical examination.  And to date, we have exempted

178  factories from medical examination required  under  this

Regulation.  If an employer has any doubt, please consult the

Department of Industrial Safety. We would provide the  advice

and  if  it  is  found that in that particular  factory,  the

medical examination is really not necessary, we would  exempt

the  factory  so that the employer does not incur unnecessary

cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also update all the designated factory doctors by

sending   out  circulars  and  conducting  regular   briefing

sessions for them so that they are kept informed of  the  new

requirements  and  various industry  practices,  particularly

when  new  chemicals  or new processes  are  introduced  into

Singapore, we would update the factory doctors so  that  they

are  well  informed and knowledgeable about the changes  that

are taking place.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo also wanted to know how the Ministry helps to

educate  both the management and the workers on side  effects

of  hazardous  materials.  We  recognise  the  importance  of

education of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>

the  workers, occupiers or employers. As I said right at  the

onset  in my Second Reading speech, legislation alone is  not

adequate.   For us to succeed in creating a safe and  healthy

working  environment,  we need the full  commitment  of  both

employers  and  workers.  And to help employers  and  workers

better  understand  the hazards of the various  chemicals  or

other  risks that they are being exposed to at the workplace,

my  Ministry  conducts training courses for safety  officers,

safety  committee  members and the  workers  themselves.  The

effect  of  hazardous materials which they may be exposed  to

are  covered  in  these safety courses.   The  Department  of

Industrial  Health  also  conducts  workshops  and  talks  in

factories  on topics such as handling of hazardous  chemicals

and  dealing with various hazards at workplaces. In addition,

during  routine  factory inspections,  our  inspectors  would

highlight various safety aspects of materials that  are  seen

to  be used or being handled by workers in the factory.  They

would   highlight  the  danger,  risk  and  also  the  safety

procedures  involved  in handling such  materials.   We  also

publish  extensive  educational pamphlets and  best  practice

guidelines  on various occupational health topics  which  are

then  distributed to workers, management and to  occupational

health personnel during factory inspections and at our safety

seminars and talks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo also pointed out the question of spelling. I

must  compliment her on her eagle's eye to have noticed  this

little discrepancy in the way the word "liquefied" was  spelt

in  section 6(2)(m).  It was spelt with an "i" instead of  an

"e".   We have, in fact, introduced an amendment but we  have

overlooked section 6(2)(m). I thank her for pointing  it  out

to  us.   But  I understand the word "liquefied", spelt  with

either  an  "i"  and  "e",  is both acceptable  although  the

spelling  with an "i" is considered obsolete and the  present

modern  form is to spell it with an "e".  But that is besides

the  point.  We should amend section 6(2)(m), as pointed  out

by  Dr  Neo,  to make it consistent with the other provisions

which have used the spelling of "liquefied".  As this is only

a question of spelling which will not affect

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>

the substance of section 6(2)(m), I suggest that we leave  it

to the Law Revision Commissioner under the Revised Edition of

Laws  Act  to correct this spelling error. The Factories  Act

would  probably  be revised by the Law Revision  Commissioner

sometime towards the end of this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo asked for a flexible period for occupiers to

submit  their  applications for factory  registration.   Sir,

under the Act, it is an offence for a person to occupy or use

any premises as an unregistered factory. The existing section

9(2)   of  the  Act  stipulates  that  the  application   for

registration  of factories shall be submitted not  less  than

two  months before the operation of the factory. This was set

sometime ago to allow the Department of Industrial Safety  to

process  the  application  and  to  issue  a  certificate  of

registration  to  the factory occupier before  they  actually

commence operation. This amendment seeks to reduce the period

of  two  months to one month which is already an  improvement

because  the two months means that they have to get ready  so

much  more in advance of the actual operation.  Now,  we  are

giving them one month's advance notice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo asked whether we could give them a shorter period

instead  of  a minimum of one month. The question is  whether

the  Department of Industrial Safety would have the  time  to

assess  their  application and to consider all the  potential

hazards   that  might  arise  from  the  operation  of   this

particular factory, or the safety precautions that need to be

taken.   And if we do not have sufficient time to go  through

it  thoroughly, then we would be under pressure to allow  the

factory  operator,  who  has  made  millions  of  dollars  of

investment,  to commence operation before we can clearly  say

that  his factory is a safe place for our workers.  We  would

prefer to stick to the present minimum period of one month to

ensure  that we have adequate time and opportunity to make  a

thorough assessment of the application to ensure that by  the

time  all  factories start operation, the question of  safety

would  have been thoroughly studied and dealt with.  I  would

urge

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>

Dr  Neo  to  support this amendment to keep it at  one  month

which would, in fact, lead to a safer working environment for

all our workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo has asked whether occupiers would be informed if

they  have  to  comply  with the provision  to  send  certain

categories  of  their employees for training  under  the  new

section  27(A).  Sir,  the  answer  is  yes.   If  the  Chief

Inspector  wishes  to specify the class or description  of  a

person  who has to attend the prescribed training course,  he

has  to  make  an order to be published in the Gazette  under

section  27A  (2).  Sufficient details would be  provided  to

enable  the industry to meet these provisions.  I would  like

to  assure  the  Member that my Ministry will also  take  the

necessary  action  to  inform  relevant  employers  of   this

requirement.   We  would make the effort to  inform  all  the

relevant  employers who need to send their  workers  who  are

exposed to certain hazards for training courses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo suggested amending section 47A to ensure that

every person in a factory would observe and comply with  safe

work procedures.  The objective of the new section 47A is  to

make  sure that occupiers and employers set up a safe working

procedure for the workers and adequately inform them  on  the

necessary  actions, including measures and ways to carry  out

their  work safely.  It would not be reasonable to hold every

person  in  a  factory responsible for the action  or  unsafe

behaviour  of every other person.  In the event of  a  worker

who  fails  to  follow the safe work procedure and  puts  his

fellow  workers at risk, he could be taken to task under  the

existing  sections 80 and 81 of the Factories Act.  In  other

words, there are already existing provisions when someone who

misuses an appliance, which has been provided for the  health

and  safety of his fellow workers, could be taken to task and

could  be penalised for such misuse.  If a worker contravenes

the  Act by wilfully endangering himself and that of his  co-workers, there is also a provision under section 81  to  deal

with such wilful endangerment of his fellow

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>

workers.   We  already  have this provision  to  ensure  that

workers pay attention to safe work procedures.  And if in our

inspection of any factory we come across a situation where we

notice such a violation, we would certainly take action.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo also asked what is the intended meaning of the

word  "inspector"  in section 47A(4). The intention  of  this

provision is to require the occupier of a factory or employer

to  keep  a  copy of the safe work procedures and to  produce

this  for the perusal of the inspector who is inspecting  the

factory.   The  word  "inspector"  here  would  include   any

inspector from the Department of Industrial Safety, including

the Chief Inspector himself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the need for section 88(14), let me point out

that  under section 88(13) of the Factories Act, the existing

provision covers company, co-operative society and the office

bearers such as Director, Chairman, Secretary, etc.  However,

partnership  is  not  included under the  provision.   Hence,

section 88(14) is being introduced in this amendment to cover

partnership and to make every partner liable under  the  Act.

We  should  make this completely clear to all occupiers  that

even as a partner in a partnership operating a factory, every

single  partner  is  equally liable for  the  safety  of  the

workers and employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Neo also enquired whether the new provision under

section 89(6) covers a continuing offence.  The provision  to

penalise an offender for a continued offence after conviction

is stipulated in section 89(2) of the Act. Therefore, when an

offender  is convicted under the new section 89(6)  with  the

enhanced  penalty,  the provisions for  a  continued  offence

would  still apply. The Court may impose a fine not exceeding

twice of that provided for under section 89(2) for every  day

during which the offence is continued.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe that I have dealt with all the points

raised by the Members.  Once again, I wish to thank them  for

supporting the Factories (Amendment) Bill.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> I would like to thank the Minister for his

elaborate  and  comprehensive answers.   Would  the  Minister

further  enlighten me on my question about the protection  of

expectant  mothers,  with special regard to  the  teratogenic

effect of certain hazardous materials in our factories?

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, my apology for

overlooking  this point. Where substances are known  to  have

reproductive  health  effect,  the  information  would   have

already  been  included in the Material  Safety  Data  Sheet.

Factory  occupiers and employers are required  to  note  such

information  and  to take the necessary measures  to  prevent

hazardous  exposure  of their pregnant female  workers.  They

must also communicate it to their workers who are exposed  to

these chemicals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ministry has provided guidelines to designated

factory doctors on the management of women who are exposed to

substances with established reproductive health risks such as

lead  and mercury.  The designated factory doctor may  advise

the  occupier  to  re-deploy the female  employees  to  avoid

further  exposure once it is found that she is  pregnant  and

her normal work would entail her working with such chemicals.

The  employer is required to comply with the advice given  by

the   designated  factory  doctor.  This  would  ensure  that

pregnant  workers are properly protected and are not  exposed

to any chemicals or substances that may have an impact on the

unborn child.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lily Neo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lily Neo:</b> May I ask the Minister whether we have a

regulation that compels the employers to inform employees  to

stop  work  as  soon as they are pregnant because  we  cannot

depend  on  designated factory doctors.  A lot of  time,  the

designated  factory doctors do not know who are the  patients

that are involved with such hazardous materials.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as I mentioned

earlier in response to another

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>

point,  when the factory applies for registration,  we  would

have known what are the chemicals that they use and where  we

notice  from the MSDS that some of the chemicals may have  an

impact on reproductive health, we would highlight this to the

factory  occupiers' attention so that subsequently,  if  they

know  they  have  women workers, they would have  to  monitor

whether  they should continue to be deployed for  such  work.

The  question of preventing pregnant workers from doing  such

work  does not just lie with the designated factory  doctors.

If  the  issue  is  brought  to my Ministry's  Department  of

Industrial  Safety's  attention, we  will  also  require  the

employer  to cease deploying pregnant workers for such  work.

But,  as I said earlier on, we would have already placed such

factories  using such hazardous chemicals on  our  industrial

hygiene monitoring scheme and we would be keeping a watch  on

all  these companies that use chemicals such as lead, mercury

and  cadmium which have this kind of effect on the developing

foetus  and would advise the employers to make sure that  any

pregnant  worker  should  not be  exposed  to  this  kind  of

chemical hazard.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>LEGAL PROFESSION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br>4.42 pm

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Law) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Law (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."

.     Sir,  this Bill carries the first set of amendments  to

the  Legal Profession Act which my Ministry proposes to table

in  this  House  this year.  There will  be  another  set  of

amendments  mainly  concerning  reform  of  the  disciplinary

procedures which will be tabled later this year after we have

completed consultations with the Law Society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this Bill implements two important initiatives

which  were  announced recently.  The first is to  allow  law

firms to practise in the form of limited liability companies.

The  second is to allow foreign law firms to form  joint  law

ventures  and  formal  law alliances with  local  law  firms.

These  changes will strengthen the legal profession and  make

it  more  competitive,  especially when  firms  go  regional.

There have been wide consultations on these initiatives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now discuss the first change, which is, on the

corporatisation of law practices.  Today, law firms can  only

exist  in  the form of sole proprietorships (if the firm  has

only  one  owner) or partnerships (if the firm has more  than

one  owner).   They cannot form limited liability  companies.

One   characteristic  of  a  partnership  firm  is  that  the

liability  of the firm is not separate from the liability  of

the  partners.  If a partnership does not have enough  assets

to  meet  a claim against it, the claim will have to  be  met

from the partners' personal assets.  Indeed, all the partners

in  the  firm are jointly responsible for the acts  of  every

other  partner.  It is therefore possible for  one  partner's

mistake  to  wipe out the personal assets of  all  the  other

partners.   This acts as a disincentive for the formation  of

larger  law  firms  as, in reality, it is  not  possible  for

partners in a large law firm to adequately supervise  matters

handled by other

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>

partners.  It may also hold law firms back from taking on new

ventures  or expanding operations overseas, as such  ventures

necessarily involve risks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Law Reform Committee of the Singapore Academy

of Law therefore proposed to the Government that law firms in

Singapore   be  allowed  to  operate  as  limited   liability

companies.    In  doing  so,  the  Committee   endorsed   the

recommendations of a Sub-Committee comprising members of  the

Courts,  Attorney-General's Chambers, Law Faculty as well  as

legal  practitioners.   The  Government  has  accepted   this

proposal.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the idea of allowing professionals to form limited

liability  companies  is  not new to Singapore.   Architects,

professional  engineers and land surveyors have been  allowed

to form limited liability companies since 1991.  Allowing law

firms to form limited liability companies will encourage  law

firms  to  grow larger, giving rise to greater  economies  of

scale  and greater competitiveness.  It will allow law  firms

to  build up their institutional identities, thus encouraging

them   to   commit  to  greater  long  term  investments   in

information technology and other high-tech equipment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other jurisdictions like the United States, United

Kingdom,  Australia and Hong Kong allow law firms  to  either

form   limited  liability  companies  or  limited   liability

partnerships.   Hence,  allowing  Singapore  law   firms   to

corporatise  will  enable them to compete  on  a  more  level

playing  field with foreign firms.  This move is timely  both

in  facilitating  the  expansion of  overseas  operations  by

Singapore firms and also in preparing Singapore firms for the

liberalisation of the legal market to foreign firms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now briefly outline the framework under

which  limited  liability company law  firms,  known  as  law

corporations in the Bill, can be formed.  A law firm  wishing

to operate as a law corporation must apply to the Law Society

for approval.  Like other companies, law corporations will be

incorporated under the Companies Act.  They will  be  subject

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>

the  Act's regulatory regime, with a few exceptions,  notably

that  law  corporations  need not  have  the  words  "private

limited"  in  their names, carrying instead  the  words  "Law

Corporation" or the letters "LLC".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limited liability notwithstanding, a number of

safeguards have been built into the Bill to ensure that  high

professional standards are maintained and that the  interests

of consumers are adequately protected.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in the interest of maintaining standards, it is

currently  provided  that  all  the  shareholders  of  a  law

corporation  must be lawyers.  However, to allow  flexibility

for  employee  shareholding and the  possibility  of  forming

multi-disciplinary practices in the future, the  Bill  allows

rules   to   be  made  in  future  to  provide  for  minority

shareholding by non-lawyers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the Bill provides that a lawyer of less than

three  years' standing is not allowed to be a director  of  a

law  corporation unless there is at least one director in the

law corporation who was in active practice for at least three

out of the preceding five years.  This is consistent with the

existing  rules governing partnerships and serves to maintain

professional standards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A valid concern is that limited liability may mean a

loss  of  consumer protection.  Let me assure the House  that

this   will  not  be  the  case.   The  law  corporation   is

essentially   a  vehicle  for  the  provision  of   services.

Individual  lawyers in a law corporation  who  provide  legal

services   will  continue  to  be  regulated  by  the   Legal

Profession Act.  In other words, they will be subject to  the

same  standards  of  professional  conduct  and  disciplinary

controls  as  if  they were providing the legal  services  as

solicitors  in a sole proprietorship or partnership.   Hence,

even   though  the  law  corporation  operates  with  limited

liability, the personal liability of the lawyer who  provides

the legal services will not be affected.  The formation of  a

law  corporation therefore does not shield a lawyer from  the

consequences of his mistakes.  Also, the consumer will know

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>

that  he  is  being  advised by a law  corporation  as  every

invoice  and official correspondence must carry the statement

that the firm is incorporated with limited liability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, on this first amendment, a law corporation will

be  required  to  take out a minimum amount of  coverage  for

professional indemnity insurance.  This is the key  safeguard

for consumers.  If there is sufficient insurance coverage, it

would  not  matter  to the consumer whether  the  law  firm's

liability  is  limited or unlimited.   The  exact  amount  of

insurance  coverage will be spelt out later in  rules  to  be

promulgated by the Council of the Law Society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now come to the second set of amendments in

the  Bill  which relates to foreign lawyers and  foreign  law

firms.   In  1997,  the  Government set up  a  multi-sectoral

committee   headed   by   the  Attorney-General   to   review

Singapore's  strategic legal needs in the  financial  sector,

and  the conditions under which foreign law firms and foreign

lawyers  could be allowed to operate in Singapore, so  as  to

ensure Singapore's competitiveness in financial services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee began its task by soliciting feedback

through surveys from foreign financial institutions, offshore

law   firms   in   Singapore,  local   banks,   corporations,

stockbroking   houses,   Government-linked   and    insurance

companies   as  well  as  local  law  firms.   The  Committee

submitted  its  Report to the Government in June  last  year.

The  Government  has  accepted the Report's  recommendations.

This  Bill  gives  effect to the Committee's  recommendations

which,  in  essence,  seek to promote a  more  vibrant  legal

services sector through closer collaboration between offshore

and  Singapore lawyers.  The focus is on how to supply  legal

services  more conveniently and efficiently and, at the  same

time, upgrade the legal expertise of local lawyers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Bill provides for two types of collaboration

between local firms and foreign firms: joint law ventures and

formal  law alliances.  Let me list, first of all,   the  key

similarities and differences in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>

these two models of collaborations.  First, the similarities.

The Attorney General's approval must be obtained to form both

joint  law  ventures and formal law alliances.   To  maintain

flexibility,  the  criteria  for registration  of  joint  law

ventures  and formal law alliances will be spelt out  in  the

rules.     These   will   be   based   on   the   Committee's

recommendations.  I expect that the rules will  be  published

by  probably April or thereabouts this year.  Lawyers in both

joint  law ventures and formal law alliances will be  allowed

to  draft  documents  relating to cross-border  transactions,

including documents governed by Singapore law.  However, they

will  not  be  allowed to appear in local courts.   Important

benefits  which  both  joint  law  ventures  and  formal  law

alliances  can  enjoy  include sharing  staff,  premises  and

resources; marketing themselves as one-stop service providers

and billing their clients as a single entity.

.     Now,  for  the differences.  A key difference  is  that

foreign  lawyers in a joint law venture will  be  allowed  to

render  advice on Singapore law.  Before doing  so,  he  must

seek  registration with the Attorney General who may  require

him  to  undergo  prescribed courses.  To protect  consumers,

these  foreign  lawyers who practise Singapore  law  will  be

subject  to  local rules concerning professional  conduct  or

ethics,  unless  otherwise exempted by the Attorney  General.

The  AG will have powers to discipline these foreign lawyers.

Another  key difference is that a joint law venture would  be

structured as a distinct business entity from its constituent

firms.   It  can take the form of a partnership or a  limited

liability  company.   In  contrast,  a  formal  alliance   is

essentially  an alliance of law firms without a new  business

entity being created.

.     Sir,  the opening up of our legal market in this manner

will  bring  benefits to players in our financial sector,  as

they can now obtain one-stop service for their legal needs in

international transactions.   While benefits to the financial

sector  are  the  main  focus  of  these  amendments,   these

amendments will also bring in legal

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>

expertise   in   other  fields,  such  as   information   and

communications technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This liberalisation will benefit both Singapore law

firms  and  offshore  law firms.  Singapore  law  firms  will

benefit because, firstly, local firms will be exposed to  the

organisational, management and marketing techniques of  their

offshore partners;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, local firms may gain access to clients of the

offshore firms;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, local firms can upgrade their legal expertise

in  areas of financial work which they otherwise may  not  be

exposed to;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, local firms may use the partnership with

offshore  firms  as  a springboard to expand  their  regional

practice; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, there will be greater possibility of expanding

the  scope  of Singapore law as a governing law for  regional

financial transactions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their part, offshore law firms will benefit because:

first,  they  will  have a Singapore law firm  to  complement

their  global network of law firms; second, they can practise

Singapore  law;  third, they can provide a  one-stop  service

which  they  presently cannot without using a  Singapore  law

firm;  fourth, in time, they will be able to induct the  best

of  our  legal talent into their global practice; and, fifth,

they will feel more at home in Singapore if they are able  to

work with Singapore lawyers for the same goals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main objective of these amendments is to ensure

that  both  the local and offshore legal services sector  can

meet  Singapore's strategic legal needs, in  the  context  of

ensuring  Singapore's competitiveness in financial  services,

and to upgrade the legal expertise of local lawyers; in other

words, the beneficiary will be Singapore.  Singapore aims  to

be   a  strong  financial  centre  with  good  legal  support

services, a major centre for legal and financial services, in

the years to come.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore law firms are already highly-rated in Asia.

As reported in the Business Times of 13th January, the latest

edition  of  Asia  Pacific Legal 500 published  by  Britain's

Legalese Ltd ranked Singapore law firms amongst the  best  in

Asia.   The Report however noted that there were shortcomings

in  the  delivery  of legal services, reflecting  partly  the

prohibition against foreign lawyers from practising Singapore

law.   In  turn, this has made it difficult for local lawyers

to  gain experience in top-flight international and corporate

practice.   The Report then highlighted that the authorities,

recognising   these  shortcomings,  have   taken   steps   to

liberalise the legal sector.

.     Sir,  the  point is that our strategic  move  has  been

picked up abroad.  It has been recognised for what it is.  An

opening up that will further enhance the quality of the legal

profession  here   -   one  which  already  has  gained  some

reputation  in  the  region.   That  can  only  be  good  for

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, Sir, the amendments in this Bill which have

been  carefully thought through over a period of  time,  with

inputs  from many and diverse quarters, should   lead  to  an

upgrading  of  local legal expertise, thus bringing  about  a

stronger  local  Bar,  a more vibrant and  competitive  legal

services  sector, one able to better meet the  challenges  of

the   new  millennium,  including  the  challenge  of   going

regional.

.    Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Chin Tet Yung (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I rise to

speak in support of the Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment Bill contains significant changes to the

way  in  which lawyers can group themselves to provide  legal

services.   Hitherto, lawyers have operated  in  partnerships

and  practise  largely domestic law, with a few larger  firms

undertaking  cross-border work.  Today, we are considering  a

Bill  that  would  allow the setting up of law  corporations,

joint   law   ventures  and  formal  law  alliances.    These

amendments are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>

therefore  important,  not just from the  legal  profession's

point of view, but also from the businessmen's point of view.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>5.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, one of the main reasons for the Bill is to

follow up on the recommendations of the Legal Services Review

Committee  in  June  last year that are intended  to  enhance

Singapore's  competitiveness in the  financial  sector.   The

Committee observed that the weak legal services sector  would

impede  the  growth of Singapore as a financial  centre.   To

quote  the  Committee, "The legal services  sector  plays  an

important  contributory role in enhancing competitiveness  in

financial  services,  but does not  drive  it.   One  of  the

perceived  needs for the legal profession at  present  is  to

develop   the  legal  expertise  for  cross-border  financial

transactions."  In fact, I should go further and say that  as

Singapore   positions  itself  as  an   e-commerce   hub,   a

technopreneurs hub, and a telecommunications hub, in addition

to being a financial centre, it is important to develop legal

expertise in these fields as well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well known that while we do have some law firms

that  can  handle such work as well as the foreign firms,  we

may  lack the number of legal experts that would provide such

services  once  the industry begins to grow.  I  believe  the

assessment of the Committee is that our law firms are  coping

with the current volume of cross-border work, but not if such

work increases substantially, as well it might.  Secondly, it

is  also  clear  that  we  lack the expertise  for  what  the

Committee referred to as Tier 1 "legal software" expertise to

handle  such  matters as project finance,  of  infrastructure

works  such  as  power, roads, water and  telecommunications,

asset  securitisation,  and structured  finance.  This  legal

software can best be imported to Singapore through the import

of foreign talent, ie, foreign lawyers.  Hence, the provision

in  the  Bill for the setting up of formal law alliances  and

joint law ventures.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My comments and queries are directed principally at

clause  15  of  the Bill, referring to the new  Part  IXA  on

"Foreign  law  firms,  joint law  ventures,  and  formal  law

alliances".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill contemplates two different types of

organisation between local and foreign lawyers  -  joint  law

ventures,  and  formal law alliances.  The first  question  I

have  for  the Acting Minister is: what are the  reasons  for

having these two types of organisation?  As far as I can see,

and  from the explanation that the Acting Minister has  given

just now, the privileges are more or less the same, except in

relation to the role of the foreign lawyers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a joint law venture, the foreign lawyer can be

registered  to  practise Singapore law,  but  does  not  have

appearance  rights before any judge, arbitrator or regulatory

body  unless otherwise permitted to do so.  In the case of  a

formal  law  alliance, the foreign lawyer who is a  "partner,

director or an employee of the foreign law firm" may "prepare

all  the  documents  in a transaction involving  the  law  or

regulatory  regime of more than one country or  jurisdiction,

except that any legal opinion relating to Singapore law  must

be  given by a Singapore lawyer" who is in practice.  Is this

not  too  fine  a  distinction to have  in  the  legislation,

especially in the area of banking and finance law, where  the

base  is  contract law, and where Singapore  applies  English

law?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask this question because it is important for the

legislation to be seen to be attractive enough to attract the

best foreign law firms and foreign lawyers to enter into such

ventures  and  alliances with our local law  firms.   If  the

benefits for entering into an alliance and joint venture  are

not evident, we may be disappointed if there is a low take-up

rate  for such alliances or ventures.  I should like  to  add

that  even now we are behind Hong Kong in attracting  foreign

firms  to Singapore.  Hong Kong in 1998 had 86 foreign  firms

compared  to  69  in Singapore for the same  year.   This  is

despite  the somewhat liberal conditions  for the setting  up

of offshore law practices in Singapore.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second question is this: the Bill does not disclose

the   guidelines  for  the  approval  of  such  ventures  and

alliances.  Of course, these are important to know before any

law  firm decides to enter into negotiations with its foreign

counterparts.   Could the Acting Minister let  us  know  what

sort of guidelines would be given?  I know that the Committee

gave several criteria for the approval of such alliances, but

these are specific to the financial sector.  This leads me to

my third question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third question is this: if the guidelines are sector-specific, will there also be guidelines to encourage firms

practising  in information technology law, telecommunications

law,  and  intellectual property law to  enter  into  similar

alliances  with their counterparts in the US and  Europe?   I

see  a great need for us to encourage the setting up of  such

alliances  in  the areas of law that I have  just  mentioned.

Singapore, as we all know, is positioning itself as a hub for

e-commerce, telecommunications and technopreneurs.  Without a

doubt,  these  sectors also require legal  expertise  of  the

highest order.  These are truly the cutting edge areas  where

there  is global competition for lawyers in these fields.   I

would respectfully suggest that we should also encourage,  as

quickly  as  possible, alliances of foreign and  local  firms

specialising  in  these  areas,  if  these  are  not  already

contemplated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, as a last comment, I should like to point

out   that  the  legal  profession  is  facing  its  greatest

challenge  since  the  practice of law  began  in  Singapore.

Lawyers   in  practice  must  now  not  just  compete   among

themselves for business, but may have to compete with foreign

lawyers,  at  least those who are registered  under  the  new

Joint  Law  Venture scheme.  There is a need to upgrade  both

skills  and  knowledge to enable them to compete on  a  level

playing  field.   Our  members of the legal  profession  must

accept that as the amendments bring with it more competition,

it  also has the potential for high reward for those who  are

perceptive enough to take up the challenge to make  Singapore

the legal services centre of the region.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these high hopes in mind, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

thank  you for allowing me to speak on the amendments to  the

Legal  Profession  Act  which I support.   Before  proceeding

further,  allow  me to declare my interest  as  a  practising

solicitor   who  will  be  affected,  whether   directly   or

indirectly, by the outcome of the amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I believe the present amendments have no doubt been

initiated by the recommendations of the Legal Services Review

Committee.  In its report to the Government dated June  1999,

the  Committee made a number of significant proposals that  I

believe  form the basis of the amendments that are before  us

today.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following from the recommendations of the Financial

Sector  Review  Group on the liberalisation of the  financial

sector,   the  Legal  Services  Review  Committee  has   also

recommended that the legal services sector should likewise be

liberalised.  Towards this end, the Committee has recommended

that  the Government allow an unrestricted number of  foreign

alliances  and a restricted number of joint ventures  between

local  and offshore firms.  The recommendations for strategic

tie-up  come with a string of other recommendations; such  as

keeping  tabs on the talent pool of Singapore lawyers working

abroad  and relocating in-house counsel of the global banking

and financial institutions to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to effectively debate on the present Bill, it

is  therefore  necessary  for us to  examine  in  detail  the

underlying   premises   of  the  Legal  Service   Committee's

recommendations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no doubt that the Legal Services Committee has

put  in substantial amount of effort in seeking to tap  on  a

wide  range  of  opinions to see how  Singapore's  long  term

competitiveness  in  the  financial services  can  be  better

served by a restructuring of the legal services industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their findings, the Committee envisaged that the

volume of onshore and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>

offshore and cross-border financial transactions is likely to

increase  in  the coming years.  With the expansion  in   the

volume  of financial services, it would therefore be  crucial

that  the legal services in Singapore have the capability  to

support such an expansion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of finding, the Committee concluded that

Singapore law firms have the capability to undertake  Tier  2

and  Tier  3  work.   On the other hand, the  Committee  also

concluded   that  local  firms  do  not  have  the   adequate

capability to advise on Tier 1 work.  For the benefit  of  my

colleagues   here,   let  me  just  explain   the   different

definitions  with respect to the different  tiers  that  were

referred  to  by the Committee.  By definition, Tier  2  work

refers  to  the  legal  software  required  for  conventional

financial services, such as the issue and trading of  capital

markets  instruments, onshore and offshore financing such  as

syndicated   and  multi-currency  loans,  and   mergers   and

acquisitions.   Tier  3  work refers to  the  legal  software

required  for  Singapore  law  opinion  on  Tier  2  offshore

financial products, domestic property, consumer financing and

unsecured  loans.  On the other hand, Tier 1 work  refers  to

the   software  required  for  the  cutting  edge   financial

products, such as project finance of infrastructure involving

power,  roads,  water  and  telecommunication,  international

capital markets, asset securitisation and structured finance.

In  the area of the legal capability for Tier 1 work,  we  do

not deny that offshore firms, in particular those coming from

the UK and US jurisdictions have it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the recommendation of the Committee to intensify

collaboration between offshore and Singapore firms to provide

convenient  and  efficient  legal services  for  cross-border

financial  transactions is one strategy which  the  Committee

has   recommended  to  help  Singapore  breach  the  gap   in

capabilities for Tier 1 work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee recognised that in contrast to New York

and  English law which is used for Tier 1 work, Singapore law

is  used  largely  for  onshore  and  cross-border  financial

transactions which are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>

typically  Tier 2 and Tier 3 work.  Currently, these  onshore

and  cross-border  financial transactions constitute  only  a

small percentage of the total value of financial transactions

in  the region.  Singapore law services play an insignificant

role   in   enhancing  Singapore's  competitiveness   as   an

international financial centre.  The Committee concluded that

competition  in  Singapore  law  services  alone   does   not

contribute  to  Singapore's competitiveness  as  a  financial

centre.   What  it does mean is that as far as  international

financial  transactions are concerned, parties  still  prefer

the  application of New York and English law as the governing

laws,  especially  for financial transactions  funded  in  US

dollars  which  is  the  standard currency  of  international

finance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offshore firms in Singapore do play a part in meeting

the  demands  for  legal  services  in  respect  of  regional

transactions that apply non-Singapore laws.  It follows  that

unless  and until home-grown Singapore financial institutions

expand  their  capacity for regional lending, the  choice  of

governing law will continue to be New York and English  laws.

In  this regard, it does not appear that, at least in respect

of Tier 1 work, Singapore law is likely to have a significant

role  in  the foreseeable future.  Moreover, because  Tier  1

work  typically involves substantial capital funding,  it  is

unlikely  that  local financial institutions are  willing  to

bear  the  bulk  of the risk without syndicating  such  risk,

often  internationally.  Where there are foreign elements  in

cross-border transactions, and I am referring to the  foreign

banking  and  financial institutions, as  it  stands  at  the

moment,  one  finds  it  hard to see how  we  can  avoid  the

application   of  New  York  and  English   laws   in   these

transactions.   This is also particularly compounded  by  the

fact that the Monetary Authority of Singapore has a stringent

policy against using Singapore currency for offshore lending.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee also concluded that in respect of the

legal  services for Tier 2 and Tier 3 work, Singapore lawyers

are sufficiently equipped and would have the legal

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>

expertise  to undertake these transactions.  The  finding  of

the  Committee  also  confirmed  the  opinion  of  the  large

majority of offshore lawyers that Singapore lawyers have  the

adequate skills for current onshore financing and also for  a

limited range of cross-border financial transactions.  It  is

also  a  known fact that in respect of Tier 1 work, Singapore

law  firms  do  not have the necessary legal expertise.   But

then again, until Singapore law becomes the applicable law in

these  transactions,  it is unrealistic to  expect  Singapore

lawyers to acquire any expertise in Tier 1 work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, having said that, it does not mean that we should

not,  as  part  of  our  evolutionary process  of  our  legal

profession, begin to acquire such expertise.  However, as  it

stands  at  the  moment, unless and until Singapore  develops

substantially as an international financial centre where  the

international community has developed much confidence in  the

use  of  Singapore law, it is unrealistic to expect Singapore

legal capabilities to develop on its own in this direction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current arrangement involving a division of labour

between  offshore and local firms in respect of  foreign  and

local law seems to have worked very well to meet the needs of

the  present  requirements of the financial  sector  in  this

country  in  respect of Tier 1 work.  One would therefore  be

very  hard  put  to  see how acquiring Tier  1  expertise  by

Singapore   lawyers   is   likely  to   improve   Singapore's

competitiveness as an international centre if in  respect  of

these transactions, the governing laws continue to be US  and

UK  laws.   It  is non sequitur, Sir, that because  Singapore

lawyers have acquired expertise in Tier 1 work, international

investors  and  financial institutions are  likely  to  apply

Singapore law as the governing law of the transaction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if as the Committee has concluded, the weakness of

the  local  legal services lies in the lack of capability  in

Tier  1  work,  formal  alliance and  joint  ventures,  which

depending on the nature of the tie-up, allow for the practice

of Singapore law by foreign lawyers is unlikely to help us

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>

acquire Tier 1 capability if Singapore law is unlikely to  be

used  in  Tier  1  work for the foreseeable  future.   As  it

stands, the Committee is of the view that our legal expertise

in Tier 2 work is adequate for our needs.  Giving foreign law

firms and foreign lawyers a licence to practise Singapore law

does  not necessarily assure us that local lawyers will  have

the  hands-on  experience for Tier 1 work.  Unless  Singapore

lawyers  are  equally equipped or qualified to  practise  New

York  or  English law, there is a strong likelihood that  the

joint  venture or formal alliances in form and substance  may

result in a situation where Tier 1 work will continue  to  be

dominated by foreign lawyers and Tier 2 and Tier 3 work  will

continue to be handled by local lawyers with foreign  lawyers

competing  on  Singapore law as well.  What it does  mean  is

that  while there is no assurance that Tier 1 technology will

be  transferred to the local lawyer, greater competition will

result  from  giving  foreign  lawyers  the  opportunity   to

practise local law.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is unfortunate that the Committee did not

consider  in depth the consequences that follow from allowing

foreign  law firms to practise Singapore law.  How  will  the

small  firms  adapt  to  the greater  competition  that  will

result?  The Committee believes that formal alliance or joint

venture  will  provide  a convenient and  efficient  mode  of

delivery   for   legal  service  in  cross-border   financial

transactions and the upgrade of legal expertise of  Singapore

lawyers through the transfer of expertise presumably in  Tier

1  work  from  foreign  lawyers to  Singapore  lawyers  which

hitherto has yet to materialise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would support the amendment to the Legal Profession

Act  not  because  I  believe that the  joint  venture  would

necessarily   transfer  substantial  Tier  1   expertise   to

Singapore  lawyers, but because I believe  that  by  allowing

foreign lawyers to practise Singapore law, it would intensify

the  extent of competition with respect to Tier 2 and perhaps

Tier  3  work, and hopefully result in an overall improvement

in the quality of legal services in Singapore.  Hopefully the

involvement of off-shore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>

firms  in  local  practice  will increase  substantially  the

competitiveness  of our financial services  sector  and  help

promote Singapore as a regional financial hub.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore firms have evolved in its own way because it

has  been a relatively sheltered profession all these  years.

We do not deny that legal services in Singapore have improved

over  the  years.  In terms of the way law firms are  managed

and  run, I would admit that the current local legal services

are  still lacking in some ways when compared to the offshore

firms.   In  this regard, there are many areas that Singapore

law  firms can usefully learn from their counterparts.  Joint

ventures  and formal alliances will give Singapore firms  the

ability  to bring themselves up to the standards and  demands

of  an  international practice.  Intensive  interaction  with

these   law firms will give Singapore lawyers the opportunity

to  provide  legal services at a standard which is comparable

with those of the West.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is right that the Act sets out certain

safeguards in respect of formal alliances and joint ventures.

One must bear in mind that in a joint venture the possibility

of  a  stronger party dominating the weaker one is very real.

Here  unless such ventures are regulated, we cannot  be  sure

how  Singapore  law  firms may not be  overwhelmed  by  their

stronger foreign counterparts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that to focus the changes to the legal

profession on formal alliances and joint venture entirely may

be  to  miss  the  point altogether.   What  is  crucial  and

necessary  to  enhance  Singapore's competitiveness  for  the

future  really  lies in the quality of the  lawyers  that  we

produce.   The  Committee  recognised  that  the  quality  of

lawyers  in  recent  years  has generally  speaking  improved

substantially.  Yet, while the quality of the entrants to the

law  faculty  and the profession has improved,  it  does  not

necessarily mean by the same token that these graduates  will

in  the  course  of  their career acquire  the  cutting  edge

technology in the legal profession which Singapore needs  for

the future.  Acquiring these skills through

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>

hands-on  experience and through formal alliances  and  joint

venture  is  part  of  the solution.  Perhaps  the  authority

should   seriously  consider  setting  up  an  institute   of

financial services within the law faculty of the NUS that  is

dedicated to the teaching and research of Tier 1 work.   This

institute  could  perhaps  be  dedicated  to  acquiring   the

necessary  legal software and know-how and disseminating  the

technology  to  practitioners  who  are  currently   in   the

profession dealing with these sorts of matters.  The focus of

the institute should be more on the practical approach to the

law,  including drafting and negotiation.  And  I  might  add

that in the curricula, they should include subjects from  the

other  disciplines as well, such as business  administration,

economics  and accounting.  By acquiring an overall expertise

in  not just law alone but in the other disciplines, I  think

we  will  go  a  long way in the training of our  lawyers  to

acquire Tier 1 expertise.  There is a great gap at present in

our  legal  education  at this moment with  respect  to  such

requirements,  and I would urge the Government  to  seriously

consider such an initiative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was greatly encouraged by another amendment which

allows the formation of limited liability corporation.  It is

a  fact  that as lawyers, unlimited liability hangs  over  us

like  a sword of Damocles.  This adds greatly to the stresses

and  anxieties  that a solicitor has had to  face.   The  new

arrangement means that a lawyer's liability need no longer be

unlimited  in  respect  of  his partners'  deeds.   Presently

lawyers,  as  you may have heard earlier, act in partnerships

and are liable for one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while I welcome the amendment, I would say that the

amendment,  however,  does not go  far  enough.   Presumably,

retaining  the  personal liability of the solicitor  at  law,

despite the formation of law corporation, is meant to  ensure

that  the  solicitor continues to give his full attention  to

his work.  This provision seems to assume that the removal of

the liability of the solicitor under a corporation would mean

that a solicitor would not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>

give his full attention and this may increase the possibility

of  negligence  on  his  part.  I am not  sure  whether  this

assumption is borne by any empirical evidence.  Does it  mean

that  the  solicitor  will be careless  in  his  work  simply

because  he  no  longer  suffers  from  being  liable  in  an

unlimited manner?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the concerns are with the care and diligence with

which a solicitor handles his work, and the protection of the

clients, these issues can be dealt with in several ways.  For

instance,  a  solicitor  can be  struck  off  the  Rolls  for

negligence, in which case the price he pays will be a loss of

livelihood through legal practice.  Alternatively,  the  laws

could  be  amended to ensure that there is adequate insurance

coverage  in  such  matters.  The  extent  of  the  insurance

coverage may be made known to the clients in advance so  that

if a client chooses to deal with the solicitor on a matter in

excess of the amount covered by the insurance, he deals  with

his solicitor at his own peril.  Additionally, where most  of

these  transactions  run  into astronomical  sums,  making  a

solicitor liable will not help recompense the victim  in  any

way.  It is unlikely that the solicitor is ever going to have

sufficient assets to pay for his mistakes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems strange to me that fund managers who give wrong

advice and cause people to suffer losses in their investments

should  be  able  to  hide behind the veil of  incorporation.

Lawyers, on the other hand, are expected to face consequences

on  their  own.   Sir, I believe this is an anomaly.   It  is

archaic and should be rectified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all said, subject to my earlier comments, I support

the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr K. Shanmugam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr K. Shanmugam (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I speak in support of

the  amendments.  And if it needs to be said, let me  declare

my  interest as a practising lawyer, and I practise in a  law

firm  that  has  perhaps the keenest interest  in  how  these

amendments work out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has pointed out the two major elements in

these amendments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>

First,  is to allow law firms to corporatise and, second,  is

to  allow  foreign lawyers to practise Singapore law,  within

the  framework set out in the amendments.  Both  changes  are

revolutionary in the context of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first change, the move to allow law firms to

corporatise, is to be welcomed and really for law firms,  the

decision to corporatise should be a no brainer, and I say  no

more about that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second change sought to be brought about by these

amendments  has  drawn mixed reactions among  local  lawyers,

foreign lawyers, as well as in the corporate world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reaction of these proposed amendments has differed,

depending  on the perspectives and interests of  the  parties

involved.  Singapore lawyers have reacted with concern  about

the    entry   of   foreign   lawyers.    Foreign    lawyers,

understandably, welcome the move to open up the legal  sector

in Singapore.  People who use lawyers are also divided.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this scenario, what is the best policy? I would

argue  that  the  proposed Bill seeks  to  strike  the  right

balance  between the competing interests and  concerns.   The

question  for the policy maker has to be not what is  in  the

interests  of Singapore lawyers.  Nor should the question  be

what  is  in the interests of foreign lawyers.  The  question

instead  should  be, what is in the best  interests  for  the

majority of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it in the interests of Singaporeans that the legal

profession be opened up, albeit in a limited way?  Convincing

and  powerful  arguments can be made both for opening  up  as

well as for retaining the existing system.  Singapore lawyers

would  say,  as  my colleague, Mr Sin Boon Ann,  has  said  a

little  bit  earlier, that the level and  competency  of  the

legal  services is high in Singapore and that  the  entry  of

foreign lawyers is really not necessary, and will only  serve

to drive up costs and perhaps affect the profession as it is.

Foreign  lawyers and non lawyers will not be  sympathetic  to

such arguments and will

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>

say  that  competition can only be better for all  concerned.

Singapore  lawyers'  case  is  not  much  advanced   by   the

perception,  sometimes  exaggerated, about  the  compensation

lawyers  get  in  Singapore.  The figures  one  sees  in  the

Business  Times  and Straits Times do not reflect  what  most

lawyers  earn.   They  reflect the  income  of  a  very  tiny

minority.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving aside the issue of income, and weighing the

reasons  for and against opening up, I think the balance,  in

recent  times,  has  swung  towards  opening  up  the   legal

profession, in the way these amendments seek to do.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say this because the risks of not opening up outweigh

the   risks  of  opening  up.   If  we  open  up  fully   and

immediately,  that would create a level playing  field  where

the  players would be of vastly different sizes.  The largest

firms in Singapore can probably be bought up with one or  two

months'  cash flow of some of the world's largest law  firms.

A legal scene devoid of local firms may not necessarily be in

the  interests of Singaporeans.  At least, we cannot say with

certainty at this stage that that is a desirable outcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there are very significant risks if

we  were not to open up at all.  There is a revolution  going

on  in the market place throughout the world.  Technology and

global  integration are moving at lightning speed.   And  for

those of us who have not woken up, the fact that AOL can take

over  Time Warner is a real wake-up call.  All that does  not

automatically  mean that opening up is the correct  thing  to

do.  Only time will tell if opening up is the right strategy.

However, if we have not opened up, and that is a mistake, and

by  the time we realise that we should have done so, it  will

probably  be  too late.  On the other hand,  if  we  open  up

cautiously  now, giving ourselves flexibility, in future,  to

adapt  policies,  as  dictated by changed circumstances,  and

hindsight, that will probably be a better option.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also other advantages. Mr Sin, my colleague,

said earlier that local

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>

lawyers  do  not  do Tier 1 work anyway and how  would  these

amendments  seek to introduce Tier 1 competency  among  local

lawyers.  I think the answer is this.  At present, perhaps we

are  completely  out  of  the market.   If  there  are  joint

ventures   and   alliances  allowed,  there  is   a   serious

possibility  that when there is Tier 1 work involved  in  the

region,  some  of the local lawyers involved  in  such  joint

ventures and alliances would get access to their expertise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also suggested that the Committee perhaps did not

consider  the impact on small firms.  Perhaps one could  make

two points.  The Committee's role was perhaps not to consider

what  other interests of the small firms.  It was to consider

what  best  enhances  the competitiveness  of  the  financial

sector in Singapore in the context of the provision of  legal

services.  But more importantly, small law firms are  not  in

this  market  anyway and they are unlikely  to  be  seriously

affected  by this opening up, because the kind of  work  that

major foreign law firm would go for would not be the kind  of

work  that  the small law firms would be handling.   To  that

extent, the people most affected are the larger law firms and

most of us know their names.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suggested that Prof. Chin consider seriously

introducing  some classes on Tier 1 work.  Again,  I  suppose

one  has  to make the point that for Tier 1 work, you  really

become  an  expert by doing it and there is a limited  amount

that you can do in the law faculty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I welcome the fact that the amendments provide

for  a considerable degree of flexibility.  In line with  the

recommendations  of the Legal Services Review  Committee,  no

doubt  the Attorney-General would approve joint ventures  and

alliances which would be structured to provide for a transfer

of  know-how,  in  return for the foreign  firms  getting  an

equitable share of our growing economy.  Though the Attorney-General  needs  no such urging, I would point out  that  "Ali

Baba" arrangements should be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>

discouraged.   There is a serious risk, in my view,  of  that

happening.  Only genuine joint ventures and alliances  should

be promoted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, Prof. Chin, asked why the proposal to have

a  difference between joint ventures and formal alliances.  I

can  understand the question.  The answer is  this,  that  in

practice, both the bigger Singapore law firms as well as  the

bigger international law firms, which would look towards this

potential  marriage as a loose liaison, might want  to  check

each other out.  They might not want to immediately rush into

a  serious  joint venture.  For those who are  concerned  and

want  a  looser form of arrangement, and there are many  like

that,  an  alliance  makes sense.   And  for  those  who  are

absolutely sure of the marriage or the union, a joint venture

makes  sense.   So  it  is  to  be  welcomed  that  there  is

flexibility in the amendments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, Prof. Chin made the point that perhaps we are

a  little bit behind Hong Kong in that Hong Kong has over  80

foreign  law firms whereas we only have about 69.  I  do  not

think  policies  should  be dictated  by  that  consideration

alone.  And the reason is simple.  Hong Kong was, until  very

recently,  a  colony, a haven for British law firms  who  had

free  access and the economy was considerably monopolised  by

British companies, and there was a good historical reason for

the  number of foreign law firms that one sees in Hong  Kong.

It  is  not  necessarily the best policy to  encourage  local

talent to thrive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, he suggested that we should consider joint

ventures  and alliances to be moving into other  areas,  like

information  technology, and so on, as quickly  as  possible.

My  own  view would be that the speed and pace of the  reform

and  change,  as  emphasised  by  the  present  Bill,  should

probably  be  adequate because this is an area one  wants  to

proceed.   Open up and let the best of the foreign law  firms

to  come in, have loose forms of alliances and joint ventures

and take it one step at a time.  Because the level of playing

field  on a completely open environment in any sector in  the

Singapore economy is perhaps a long term objective.   But  if

we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>

want to make sure that Singaporeans are left standing at  the

end  of  the  day,  perhaps a step by step process  might  be

better.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments are also significant in that they

vest  a  comfortable degree of discretion  on  the  Attorney-General  or  discretion that he has been given.   And  he  is

given  the  discretion to approve the structure of the  joint

ventures and formal alliances, the discretion to approve  the

terms  on  which  licences are given to  joint  ventures  and

alliances,  and  absolute  discretion  to  also  revoke  such

licences.  There can be no appeal to the Minister in  respect

of these matters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not someone who usually likes to see

legislation  which  invests  absolute  discretion  on  anyone

without further recourse.  That is not the norm.  However,  I

can  understand  and  I  support the considerable  degree  of

discretion   that  is  given  here  to  the  Attorney-General

because, I suppose, one is unclear as to how these amendments

would work out and have an impact on the legal profession and

the  economy as a whole.  To that extent, it is perhaps  best

that  considerable discretion be given to see  through  these

amendments  as it were over the next few years.   However,  I

would suggest that consistent with all aspects of the rule of

law,  that as time goes by and the situation becomes clearer,

perhaps  one should move towards institutionalising how  this

discretion is exercised in a slightly more structured way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I support the amendments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> I want to make a clarification.

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Please do so.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, thank you for

allowing me to clarify the point which I made earlier.  In my

speech  earlier,  I  said  that,  for  Singapore  lawyers  to

practise  here,  the opportunities are  not  that  many.   My

learned colleague has replied by saying that there are plenty

of opportunities.  I do not deny that at this present moment,

the opportunities for tie-up and therefore to learn areas  of

Tier 1

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>

work,  which we otherwise do not have, are there.  Presently,

the  opportunities  are  there for  Singapore  law  firms  to

acquire  Tier  1  expertise through continuing  participation

with  their  foreign  counterparts and  their  regional  work

itself.   What  I  am  saying  is  that  to  formalise   this

arrangement  by  an  amendment to the legislation  under  the

Legal  Profession Act may not be necessary if  that  was  our

only concern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point which Mr Shanmugam said is in respect

of  small  firms.  I agree that the mandate of the  Committee

does   not   encompass  the  effects  of   allowing   foreign

competition  on small and medium-size practices.   One  would

however need to consider the issue of excesses in competition

that  would result from increasing competition in Tier 2  and

Tier  3  work  which results from allowing foreign  firms  to

practise  Singapore  law.   We  all  know  that  excesses  in

competition  may not necessarily be good for  the  consumers.

One  of  the  concerns  arising  from  this  competition  and

allowing foreign law firms to practise Singapore law  is  the

increase in costs for the consumers.  With rising costs, I am

not  sure  whether or not this would have an  impact  on  the

competitiveness of our financial services sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the third point about my suggestion that the

faculty set up an institute of financial services, I  do  not

deny that hands-on experience is important.  But I would also

at  the same time like to add that hands-on experience is  of

limited application if it is not tied up with theory which is

acquired  in  the  classroom.   I  think  with  maturity   of

experience in practice, going back to the classroom  and  re-examining some of the propositions in law and having a deeper

understanding of the legal theories would help make us better

lawyers.   In  this regard, I stand by my earlier suggestions

that  there  is a place for such an institute  to  be  formed

under the auspices of the Law Faculty.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, much has been

said  and  I  do not propose to repeat what has already  been

said by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>

the  others.  But before I begin my speech, may  I  also  say

that  I  am  a  practising lawyer but  I  have  no  pecuniary

interest in this Bill, nor do I hope to have any interest  in

this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say that I am not very concerned or worried about

the first part of the Bill which seeks to allow law firms  to

corporatise  except  to  add that  I  personally  regret  the

passing of a law firm which is a personal service rendered by

the  solicitor to a client into a kind of impersonal  service

and  the practice becoming a business.  But I suppose  it  is

thought that in these days, the bigger the better.  I am  not

sure  that  the  bigger the better is right.  I  hear,  quite

often,  clients or people coming to tell me when I  see  them

outside,  "Oh, we never get to see the lawyer who himself  is

handling our work.  We are always delegated to somebody  else

in the firm or even the clerks.".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said about the corporatisation of the local

firms, may I say something about clause 15 which introduces a

new  part, Part IXA, into the Act, ie, allowing the entry  of

foreign  lawyers into Singapore practice.  It  seems  to  me,

speaking not on behalf of the big law firms, but on behalf of

the  smaller  firms and especially those  who  do  a  one-man

practice, that perhaps in the pursuit of financial excellence

or  wanting to become an international finance centre, we are

sacrificing our lawyers to whom we have a duty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not very long ago, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, that it

was  thought  we  had  too  many  lawyers  in  Singapore  and

amendments  were made to restrict Singaporeans  who  obtained

their  degrees  outside  from  practising  in  Singapore   by

requiring  that  they  had to hold their  degrees  only  from

selected  universities.  The number of universities  was  cut

down  drastically and they were also told that  they  had  to

have a Second-Class Honours degree before they could apply to

practise  in Singapore.  Hand in hand with that,  action  was

taken  to  restrict the number of people coming  out  of  the

National University of Singapore to practise law.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>

The feeling was that there were too many lawyers in Singapore

and  there  was of course the other action taken to  restrict

the almost ad lib admission of Queen's Counsel to do work  in

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Courts were required to insist on greater requirements

for  the  necessity  for  the  admission  of  the  QC  before

admitting the QC.  But now, it seems to me that suddenly  the

Government  seems to have a change of mind.  This Bill  seems

to  open the door, perhaps not the floodgates altogether,  to

foreign  lawyers coming into Singapore, not only just  to  do

offshore  work  but  also  to practise  Singapore  law.   The

Minister  of State said they would not be able to  appear  in

the  Singapore courts.  But as I read the amendment, if  they

are  registered by the Attorney-General and if they have  got

their  registration  approved by the  Attorney-General,  then

they  can do whatever the Singapore lawyer can do under  Part

IV of the Legal Profession Act.  That is how I read the Bill.

If  I am wrong, I wish to be corrected on it.  But I see that

to  practise Singapore law the definition is to be able to do

whatever the Singapore lawyers can do under Part IV and  have

the same rights and privileges, and of course the major right

and  privilege is the appearance in Singapore courts.  So  we

are  now opening the door to foreign lawyers coming in.   Are

we  going  to  place the same restrictions on  these  foreign

lawyers who come in, requiring them to have degrees only from

selected universities, and of attaining a certain standard in

their  degree  before  they  are admitted?   What  about  the

question  of whether they are to be resident in Singapore  or

not?   Are  we going to allow a foreign lawyer,  who  is  not

resident in Singapore, to apply for registration, and then to

turn  up in Singapore to do court work?  That does not appear

clear to me.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that we are unduly favouring foreigners

at  the  expense of our own people.  This, I suppose,  is  in

line  with the declared policy, that we have heard from  time

to  time, that Singapore needs foreign talent, that  we  have

not  got  the talent.  I question that.  It seems to  me  too

easy a way out.  And Mr Sin, may I say, rightly asked whether

the expectations of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>

transfer of expertise is not perhaps misplaced.  How is  this

going  to  ensure, as he has pointed out, that the  expertise

will be transferred to Singapore lawyers unless, again as  he

says, Singapore law becomes the governing law?  Is there  any

great  expectations of that happening?   And  how  will  that

happen  by  just allowing foreign law firms to go into  joint

law ventures or law alliances with the Singapore firms?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other concern I have is that after a foreign lawyer

has  been registered with the Attorney-General, he enjoys the

same rights and privileges, including the right to appear  in

the courts on any matter, not just a case involving financial

transactions.  He is not limited to that.  He  is  not  under

the  disciplinary control of the Council of the Law  Society,

but  he  is  under the disciplinary control of the  Attorney-General.   Why  this  differentiation?   If  he  is   to   be

registered and to enjoy the same rights and privileges  as  a

Singapore   lawyer,   and   has   the   required   practising

certificate,  should  he  not  come  under  the  disciplinary

control  of the Council of the Law Society, rather  than  the

Attorney-General?    Would  he  be  required   to   pay   the

subscriptions that Singapore lawyers pay to the Law Society?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like an answer to these questions from the

Minister  of  State.  But, as I said, it  seems  to  me  that

suddenly we are opening the doors to foreign lawyers, and not

necessarily  the  right  kind of  lawyers  that  we  need  in

Singapore at the expense of our own local lawyers.

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Ravindran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Ravindran (Bukit Timah):</b> Sir, first of all, I

would like to declare my interest as a practising lawyer, and

also  to  state  that  I have no interest  in  the  amendment

involving formal law alliances  and joint law ventures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as far as the amendments go, I think they are

timely.  They come in the wake of the recommendations of  the

Legal  Services  Review Committee, chaired by  the  Attorney-General, and the Law Reform Committee, chaired by the Justice

of   Appeal,   L.P.   Thean,   on  Corporatisation   of   Law

Partnerships.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our judicial system and the legal service have won world

accolades  for being progressive, and being ready to  embrace

change.   It  is  timely  that  our  legal  profession   also

positions  itself for change  -  change to become better  and

to become world-class law firms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendments before this House seek to address

two  critical issues for the legal profession.  The first  is

the  corporatisation of legal practice for the setting up  of

law   corporations.   I  am  happy  that  corporate   limited

liability will be extended to legal practitioners.  It is not

uncommon  in  the past for all partners of a law  firm  being

exposed  to claims and, in some cases, to substantial claims.

Whilst   insurance  helps,  in  cases  of  fraud  and   other

instances,  insurance  does  not  cover  these  areas.   With

limited  liability, the directors and shareholders  of  these

law  corporations  can  enjoy protection  on  their  personal

assets, save for the partner who is in default.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my only concern is: how do we ensure that the

client is adequately protected in instances where there is  a

misfeasance by a partner or a practising lawyer  of  the  law

corporation?    Whilst   the   Law   Society   arranges   for

professional indemnity as a group, my concern is that not all

law  firms take insurance to provide for non-negligent areas,

particularly like fraud.  I was happy to hear the Minister of

State say that he will be looking carefully into the area  of

insurance,  and I would urge that serious attention  be  paid

into   the   area  of  insurance  coverage  for   these   law

corporations.   Many  a time,  law firms  choose  a  form  of

insurance  which is low cost, because if they take  a  policy

which  is  very extensive and covers every field of  possible

claim,  then  it  will  lead to the cost  of  services  being

rendered much higher.  So I would urge the Minister of  State

to look carefully into the form of insurance that needs to be

taken  up by these law corporations, so that clients  of  law

firms  who  engage  these  law  corporations  are  not  short

changed,  as  many laymen may not be able to distinguish  the

difference between a sole proprietorship, a partnership and a

law corporation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue that I would like to raise in respect

of  law  corporations is the question  of  why  is  there  no

minimum paid-up capital for these law corporations.  Here,  I

am  concerned  because looking at the way the amendments  are

drafted,  there is no clear minimum paid-up capital  that  is

needed for these law corporations.  Even an employment agency

that  is being set up under the Ministry of Manpower, I think

they   require   a  minimum  paid-up  capital  of   $100,000.

Similarly,  there  are  many  other  corporations  which  are

regulated  by various bodies where a minimum paid-up  capital

is  required.  I would recommend that, depending on the  size

of the law corporation and depending on the number of lawyers

who are involved, perhaps a minimum paid-up capital needs  to

be  laid  down,  so  that  members of  the  public  can  feel

comforted  by the amount of paid-up capital that a  law  firm

has.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third issue that I would like to raise is why

do  we  limit  the shareholding of these law corporations  to

lawyers  only.   New  section 81H  of  the  Legal  Profession

(Amendment)  Bill  will  only  allow  solicitors  to   become

shareholders.   Subsection (2) says, "may  be  held  by  such

other  persons  or  class of persons as may  be  prescribed."

Sir,  it is unclear now who is this class of persons who  can

hold shares in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would urge that the shareholding structure of these

law  corporations  be liberalised for several  reasons.   For

one,  some lawyers have expressed the view that allowing non-lawyers to become shareholders in these law corporations will

have a great impact on them, particularly in relation to  the

ethical   standards,   and  that   as   compared   to   other

corporations,  law  corporations  are  distinct  because,  as

officers of the court, they owe a duty to the court.   But  I

believe that these can be addressed with adequate provisions,

as these standards and duties are personal to the lawyer as a

legal practitioner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one possible way to ensure that lawyers remain in

control is perhaps by restricting the non-lawyer shareholding

to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>

not more than 49% at any time.  I am quite sure that such  an

approach will allow for the flow of investments to law  firms

from  other  professionals.  And such an approach will  allow

for  cross  shareholding among the different professions  and

pave the way for multi-disciplinary practices in future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another creature that could also be considered to

allay  the  fear  that  shareholders will  interfere  in  the

practice of law is perhaps a class of shares, like preference

shareholding,  be created.  Because some law firms  could  be

limited  in  size,  and finance also.  If they  are  able  to

obtain  external finance, it could be a form  of  investment.

They  could  invest  in better IT equipment,  recruit  better

lawyers  and  expand  their business.   So,  allowing  for  a

different  form of shareholding besides ordinary shareholding

will allow law firms to tap into other forms of investment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me now move on to the other amendment that is

before  this  House,  which  is the  creation  of  joint  law

ventures and formal law alliances under Part IXA of the Legal

Profession  (Amendment) Bill.  The provision  for  joint  law

ventures and formal law alliances is in line with the move to

make   Singapore  a  premier  financial  centre.   The  legal

profession here has been recognised as being among  the  best

in  Asia, as was highlighted by the Minister of State from an

article  in  the  Business Times of 13th  January.   However,

there  has  been criticism that there is only a very  limited

pool   of   local  practitioners  experienced  in   top-notch

international and corporate practices such as securitisation,

project  finance  and  structured finance.   Sir,  some  have

attributed  this  to the ban on foreign law firms  not  being

able  to  practise  local law and restricting  themselves  to

offshore work only.  Not doing anything will lead to the  big

businesses who do cross-border transactions having to  engage

local and foreign law firms to advise them or document cross-border transactions elsewhere.  This certainly increases  the

cost  of  the  work and also takes more time to complete  the

work.   The  provision of joint law ventures and  formal  law

alliances  will allow for local firms to tie up with  foreign

firms and offer

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>

one-stop  service  centres.  This will  certainly  allow  for

world-class   legal  service  for  businesses  operating   in

Singapore and in the region.  This will certainly enhance the

reputation   of   Singapore  not  only  as  an  international

financial  hub  but also as an international legal  hub  just

like London and New York.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment also comes at a time when some of our

law  firms are also expanding in the region.  Just as our law

firms wish that they will be allowed to practise local law in

these  countries  where they are now expanding,  foreign  law

firms  are also wishing that they can be allowed to  practise

local  law through these vehicles as they would also like  to

offer one-stop legal services to their clients for their home

countries.  Hence, this amendment comes at a timely moment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, however, there are concerns raised whether the law

firms  will be aggressive and take away substantial  business

from  the  bigger  law  firms  who  will  face  the  greatest

competition  from  these joint law ventures  and  formal  law

alliances.   How  do we ensure that these foreign  law  firms

indeed pass on the specialised knowledge which is purportedly

lacking  in Singapore law firms?  How do we also ensure  that

these  foreign law firms do not become a means to  monopolise

international  legal work here with little or no  benefit  to

the  local firms.  I would urge the Attorney-General  who  is

given  great  powers under the Bill to carefully monitor  the

implementation  of the scheme, and to impress  upon  the  law

firms,  particularly the foreign law firms, the intent behind

the whole exercise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the other concern expressed is the shareholding or

associated  structure that will be allowed.   It  is  unclear

what  is  the  formula that these foreign law firms  will  be

allowed to adopt with regard to joint law ventures and formal

law  alliances.  Will these foreign firms be allowed to  hold

99% of these law corporations or joint law ventures?  Because

if   it   means  that  they  control  99%  or  a  substantial

percentage,  I  think it may even lead to a  situation  where

some  of  these smaller law firms, as Mr K Shanmugam  earlier

stated, may be used

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>

as  a  front  like  an Ali Baba operation where  they  merely

rubber stamp documents and the prime beneficiary becomes  the

foreign  law  firm.  I think it is  wise  or  perhaps  it  is

something which we should look carefully into how foreign law

firms  take  an interest in the local practice.  We  have  to

ensure  that  perhaps the local firms which are  involved  in

these  joint  local  ventures or  foreign  law  alliances  do

control the majority, at least in the initial stage, so  that

the  fear  that some of the smaller firms may be  used  as  a

Trojan Horse to win the business of the corporate world  here

will  be  avoided.   I  would urge the  Attorney-General,  in

formulating the rules, to be mindful of the fear of  many  of

the  law firms here that these joint local ventures, if there

are  loopholes in the shareholding structure, may be used  to

come  and  take  away  business from  the  local  law  firms,

particularly the bigger law firms, Sir.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, I support the Legal Profession (Amendment)

Bill, Sir.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, thank you for allowing me to join

in  the  debate.   I  would  like to provide  a  non-lawyer's

perspective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as Singapore maps out its strategy to operate in a

borderless  economy,  the underlying business  infrastructure

must  be  modified  and necessary changes made to  facilitate

the  realisation  of  these objectives, particularly  in  the

financial  services sector.  Towards this end, the amendments

to  the  Bill will go a long way, especially in view  of  the

ballooning  volume of cross-border transactions, as  observed

by many of my colleagues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pro-business stance of Singapore is well known and

often  cited  as  one of the main reasons for investments  by

multi-nationals.  The proposed amendments under  section  103

will  facilitate  the formation of foreign law  ventures  and

alliances,  thereby allowing an integration  of  foreign  and

local expertise.  This is especially crucial to enabling  the

services  sector  to  cater to multiple jurisdictions  in  an

efficient and effective way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from this perspective, I find the process and

decision making relating to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>

the  application  for a foreign law venture  or  alliance  as

outlined in the new section 130B, to be slightly inconsistent

with  the overall intent, and lacking in transparency.  Allow

me, Sir, to elaborate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection (1) provides for the Attorney-General to

consult "such authorities as may be prescribed".  May  I  ask

the Minister who these authorities are, and would the list be

made  public?  In addition, I would like to echo Prof. Chin's

call to publicise the guidelines for setting up such ventures

and alliances.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, as my colleague, Mr Shanmugam has raised,

subsection (4) provides for the Attorney-General to refuse to

approve   an  application  "without  assigning  any  reason".

Furthermore,  section 130H states that the Attorney-General's

decision "shall be final and conclusive".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear, Sir, that these amendments, firstly, do

not  provide  for the degree of transparency  that  would  be

expected  of Singapore by foreign parties; secondly,  do  not

allow  for  an  appeal or further discussion  to  support  an

application;  and, thirdly, would place the  approving  power

solely  with the Attorney-General.  Can the Minister  explain

if  inputs  from either Government agencies or  the  industry

would be incorporated?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, may I end on a short point of

clarification.   Subsection (6) of new section  81H  proposes

that  a  solicitor who is suspended would not be  allowed  to

hold  shares  in a law corporation.  While this is  justified

for those struck off the roll, in the case of a solicitor who

is suspended for only a short period of time, the penalty may

appear  to  be  disproportional.   Can  the  Minister  kindly

clarify, please?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of this Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The introduction of this Bill is timely. It will enable

the profession to move

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>

forward  with  the  times  to keep pace  with  the  worldwide

development  in the profession and to meet the growing  needs

of  the business community.  I would like, however, to  raise

three points for the Acting Minister's clarification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name of the law corporation. Clause 81C of the Bill

proposes  that  every law corporation shall have  either  the

words  "law corporation" or the acronym "LLC" as part of  its

name and that no person, firm or group practice other than an

approved law corporation shall have such words as part of its

name.   I  have received feedback from some quarters  of  the

business community that the use of the acronym "LLC" may  not

be  appropriate.  This is because the acronym may  be  easily

confused  with  the foreign equivalent of "Limited  Liability

Corporation",  which is widely adopted in countries  such  as

the United States and certain tax haven locations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I would like to comment on the shares of the

law   corporation.   Although  the  Minister  mentioned   the

possibility  of  multi-disciplinary firms emerging  from  the

proposed corporatisation scheme, the Bill appears to restrict

the  ownership  of  law corporation basically  to  practising

solicitors.   There  are definite merits in  restricting  the

shares  of  law corporations to within the legal  profession.

An  obvious advantage is that the profession's standards  and

ethics  are  best maintained by solicitor shareholders.    In

this  way,  legal  standards and ethics will  not  be  easily

overlooked or inadvertently diluted by shareholders  who  are

outside the profession and who will be excessively driven  by

commercial  interests  and gains.   The  flip  side  to  this

restriction is that it does not encourage the development  of

multi-disciplinary professional corporations,  which  is  the

growing trend overseas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the business environment is getting more complex

and multi-disciplinary.  News about mega mergers confronts us

almost   every  other  day.   Ironically,  the   demand   for

immediate,  simple and integrated solutions  has  become  the

norm of the day.  This phenomenon has led to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>

propensity of forming strategic alliances across professions,

often  involving  lawyers,  auditors,  tax  advisors  and  IT

consultants.   Going forward, I can envisage one-stop  multi-disciplinary consultancy centres sprouting out in  Singapore.

In the light of this trend, may I ask the Minister to clarify

if  a capping of the percentage of non-solicitor shareholders

to  a fixed  appropriate percentage has been considered.  The

injection of a multi-disciplinary shareholder interest  would

better equip our law corporations to meet with the demand  of

the  business environment with its increasingly regional  and

international  aspects.  At the same time,  the  capping  can

ensure that the legal profession standards and ethics are not

diluted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a similar way, the Bill also seems to rule out the

possibility  of  share option schemes for employees.   Whilst

there are other compensation schemes, many corporations  have

come  to  realise the benefits of rewarding their  loyal  and

quality  employees by way of share options.  Incorporating  a

law  firm  opens up the possibility of extending compensation

schemes to match the trend in the market place which competes

for  the same human talent.  It will also promote job loyalty

and permanence beyond merely direct monetary attractions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ownership of law corporation therefore should be

extended  to  other than practising solicitors  and  a  fixed

percentage specified.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, like what my learned colleague had earlier

said,  I am concerned about the provision of clause 81D which

states  that the personal liability of the solicitor  is  not

affected  by  the mere fact that a solicitor  provides  legal

service  as  a  director or an employee of a law corporation.

Sir,  we  need  to make a distinction as the  claims  against

professionals are grossly disproportionate to the  fees  that

they  earn.  The tendency for such claims is due to the  deep

pocket  syndrome,  as  professionals  such  as  lawyers   and

accountants usually take up indemnity insurance, which  makes

them  prone  to  law suits and claims.  Such disproportionate

claims are neither fair

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>

nor  equitable, given that a single successful claim can wipe

out  the  entire reserves of a law corporation  and,  if  the

latter  is insufficient, the personal assets of the solicitor

providing  the legal service.  In the event that a successful

claim  brings down a law corporation, the repercussions  will

be felt beyond the profession concerned. The employees of the

corporation  will  be  affected and so  would  the  immediate

family of the solicitor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a professional, the ultimate punishment for an

unsatisfactory    professional   conduct   or    professional

misconduct  is to be struck off the roll or to  be  suspended

from  practice.  This recourse is generally available.  Where

a  claim  is  made  on the assets of the  solicitor,  it  may

tantamount to double punishment or jeopardy.  Due to the fear

of  litigation, a solicitor may also so qualifies his  advice

as  to  significantly  reduce his effectiveness.   It  is  of

crucial  importance to the commercial life of Singapore  that

our  professionals should feel free to give advice  in  clear

and forthright terms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the claims sought and awarded against solicitors

should  bear some relationship to the quantum of fees charged

which  is  based  on the complexity and time  spent  on  each

assignment,  and not on the level of risks and likelihood  of

claims.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Minister to clarify whether he

will  consider  a  capping  on  the  liability  of  the   law

corporations, including the solicitor concerned, to a maximum

multiple of the assignment fee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with these few points which I hope the Minister can

clarify, I support the Bill.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, first, let me thank all

the speakers who have spoken up.  I think all of them are  in

support of the Bill, except perhaps for Mr Jeyaretnam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speakers have expressed some concerns. Some of these

concerns  are  valid, which I would deal  with.   But  it  is

heartening  to note that all of them see the need  for  these

changes.  As I have said in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>

my speech which Members have appreciated, this is a cautious,

balanced  start.  These are not sweeping changes.  These  are

carefully  thought  through changes  of  the  Legal  Services

Review   Committee  headed  by  the  Attorney-General   which

consulted  many  players  on the ground,  balancing  what  is

needed  for Singapore.  I think Mr Shanmugam makes the point.

It  is  not for the benefit of Singapore lawyers or  for  the

benefit of foreign lawyers, but a scheme which will fill up a

gap  which  exists in the current legal sector  and  also  to

ensure  that Singapore's financial centre drive continues  to

receive  the support of the legal services.  I think that  is

important.  That is the first point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is that while we make a start, we will

continue to monitor these amendments.  This is a point  which

a  few  speakers  have made, including Mr Ravindran.   It  is

important  because,  for a start, the  Attorney-General  with

inputs,  will have to make a decision as to who to admit  and

approve  as  joint venture partners and to  form  formal  law

alliances.  He will assess how these foreign firms which  are

registered  or  approved will perform and whether  the  needs

are  met  by  their inputs.  These will have to be  assessed.

They are not cast in stone.   But certainly we will take this

approach and we will continue to monitor.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that the Committee's recommendations

have  been  approved  by Government and adopted.   This  Bill

provides  the  framework on which these  recommendations  are

mounted.   But  there  is  also in  place  an  Implementation

Committee headed by the Attorney-General with representatives

from the various involved players, including, I believe,  the

Dean of the Law Faculty, Law Society and so forth, which will

continue  to  make  the rules so that the scheme  will  work.

These are the few general comments that I want to make.  This

is  not a sudden change.  I think Mr Jeyaretnam would want to

paint  the picture that Government is flip-flopping.  But  we

are   talking  about  different  things  altogether   -   the

restriction on the number of lawyers,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>

the  aim  was  to  boost  the  quality  of  lawyers  who  are

practising  here,  especially Singaporean  students  who  are

trained overseas, and that is why there is a requirement  for

them  to  come  only from 15 scheduled foreign  universities.

All those issues have been largely and widely debated.  Their

aims are quite different.  So now we are not just opening  up

to  all  and sundry.   We are doing a very selective process,

opening up a certain sector of the legal services market to a

certain select group of lawyers who can fill that need.   And

even  when they are registered or approved, they can only  do

certain  designated  things, and certainly  not  practise  in

court.   This is very clear from the Committee's report  even

though it may not be expressed in the Bill.  Certainly,  this

is not a back door way for foreign lawyers to come and appear

in our courts.  I can give this assurance to Mr Jeyaretnam.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with one primary concern which Members have

raised.   This  has appeared through different threads.   But

the  point  really is: how do we ensure that  Singapore  will

benefit,  that the regime that is set in place  will  achieve

its  intended  effect of absorbing legal services  that  will

fill  up the recognised gaps?  Prof. Chin puts it this way  - whether  or  not the joint law ventures and formal  alliances

will  also  facilitate the entry of critical non-banking  and

non-financial  areas of law, such as information  technology.

He  sees  that  need.  And indeed there is a need.   But  the

question,  of  course, is the pace and  how  we  do  it.   Mr

Shanmugam has cautioned that we should not open up the  doors

for all and sundry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what the Committee intends to do, I understand, is to

again  take  a  balanced approach.  There  is  a  distinction

between formal law alliances and joint ventures.  Insofar  as

formal law alliances are concerned, I understand that AG will

exercise  his flexibility vis-a-vis foreign firms  which  may

have  expertise in, for example, information technology, with

a  clear  understanding  and proper analysis  of  Singapore's

needs.  I think that is a point I must continually emphasise.

AG, as Chairman of the Committee, was on the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>

job  for  two years.  He knows what Singapore needs from  all

his  consultations.  Members have pointed  out  that  AG,  in

fact, is the key player in the entire exercise.  But he  will

not  be  alone.  Because, for example, in considering whether

or  not an application for a joint venture or formal alliance

should  be approved, he will consult other relevant  agencies

and   authorities,  including  the  Monetary   Authority   of

Singapore.   He will consult them and take their  inputs.   I

believe  that this will be published in the rules  which  Mrs

Lim Hwee Hua has asked.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to whether or not the scheme will allow also the

influx  of expertise in non-banking and non-financial related

areas, the answer is yes.  But again a cautious start through

formal  law alliances, and only in those areas where  AG,  in

the  context  of  Singapore's strategic  needs,  thinks  will

benefit Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, I understand that for joint law ventures,

they may still bring in expertise in some areas, for example,

IT  and  telecommunication laws, as transactions that require

knowledge of IT and telecommunications constitute part of the

larger  project  financing  deals.   There  will  not  be   a

conscious  effort, but it will be one of the side-effects  of

having  these  foreign lawyers come in and  do  the  work  in

Singapore.  So that is the first point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is a good point that Members have made,

which  is, we should ensure that firms that come in  are  not

firms  that  ride on a "Ali Baba" arrangement.   I  think  Mr

Shanmugam made this point.  In other words, we should not  be

taken for a ride.  Some Members have asked if Singapore firms

have that strength, that depth of expertise to really be full-fledged  partners  with these foreign  firms.   I  have  said

earlier on that the Business Times have reported that the  UK

Legalese  Limited Report says that we have  done  very  well.

And indeed, over the last three to five years, many Singapore

firms  have  already  entered into  informal  alliances  with

foreign partners.  So that is not a new game for them.   They

are  already  into this process.  What we are  doing  now  is

giving them a choice of a more formal structure.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is related to a point that Prof. Chin asks: why are

there two types of collaboration?  I think the approach is to

give  law  firms  a choice.  Do they want to  go  in  with  a

tighter  fit, like a joint venture, or a looser fit, sort  of

engagement  before a marriage?  I think Mr  Shanmugam  talked

about  that  process.  You may not want to straightaway  rush

into  it.  Enter into a formal alliance, not a single entity,

where  instead  of a distinct entity, one can  have  all  the

benefits - one marketing centre, one billing centre  and,  of

course,  sharing  some expertise, foreign lawyers  can  draft

documents on cross-border transactions, even including  those

relating  to  Singapore  law,  but  they  cannot  advise   on

Singapore  law.   So  you  see  the  nice  balance  that  the

Committee must have thought through, how to ensure that there

is  a  gradation  for law firms which may not  want  to  jump

straight into the fray.  Then when they are prepared, they go

ahead.   Of  course, there may be some Singapore  firms,  the

bigger  ones, who are confident enough and having  considered

the  pros and the cons, because there will be pros and  cons,

if  you enter into a joint venture with one particular  firm,

you  may  stop  other  referrals from  coming  to  you,  they

proceed.   So  the scheme is such that it is flexible  enough

for  law  firms to make their own judgements,  do  their  own

sums, and then come to a decision how they want to do it.  It

gives them some flexibility.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is this point about how to ensure that law

firms  which come in will indeed add value.  Here, again,  AG

is the person primarily tasked with this important job.  Like

I  have  said,  he  will  consult  other  relevant  agencies,

including the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  He  will,  of

course,  look at the track record of firms which  apply,  and

also  the  track record and expertise of foreign  lawyers  in

these  firms.  Foreign lawyers in these firms -  I  think  Mr

Ravindran  made  this point - should not  come  in  and  take

control.   It is important that they do not come  in  in  the

guise  of  a joint venture when, in fact, they are practising

in  Singapore wholly on their own.  This point has been taken

into consideration.  Because the rules that will be made will

say  that  in  a  joint law venture, the number  of  offshore

partners

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>

should  not exceed the number of local partners, so that  the

management  will  not  fall into the  hands  of  the  foreign

partners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is also important is that each applicant for a

joint  venture licence or registration must submit a business

plan.   In  other words, the ball is really in  their  court.

They  have to persuade and convince the AG that they can  add

value.   And  this strategy is also a good one  because  they

will then be monitored against their business plan over time.

The business plan will therefore act as a benchmark - whether

they  are delivering on their promises.  If they do not, then

the  next  time their registration comes up for renewal,  the

joint venture will not be renewed.  And I think this acts  as

a  very  good safeguard because foreign firms which  want  to

enter  into  joint venture arrangements with Singapore  firms

are reputable firms which will not risk their reputation.  AG

has many years of experience doing this already.  Because  we

have  had many offshore firms coming to Singapore to  set  up

branches here and they must get permission from the  AG.   So

he is not a new boy in the block.  He has been doing this for

a  long  time.   I  believe that the  AG  has  the  necessary

wherewithal to handle this task.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the question arises as to why when foreign lawyers

come  in  they are treated differently from local lawyers  in

terms of the disciplinary process.  The feedback that we have

is  that  foreign lawyers, in fact, prefer a system  that  is

confidential.   They would prefer not to be involved  in  the

disciplinary  processes of the Law Society,  ie,  they  would

rather  that  the current regime continues.  In other  words,

the  AG  will  still be the primary person who will  regulate

them  and discipline them.  But he will not be doing it in  a

vacuum  because  the  Act says that the rules  can  prescribe

Codes of Conduct and Ethics by which foreign lawyers will  be

judged,  will  be  pegged  against,  so  that  when  the   AG

disciplines  them, he will not be doing it in a  vacuum.   He

will  be  doing it in that context.  Indeed, the Act provides

that before he disciplines a lawyer, the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>

lawyer  would  have  the  opportunity  to  submit  a  written

explanation,  and  then  AG will act  if  he  has  sufficient

reasons  to do so.  Mr Jeyaretnam makes that point.   But  he

should not worry for these foreign players who come in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is whether or not the entry of foreign

lawyers  will  lead to hardship for local lawyers.   I  think

there   will  be  some  adjustments.   There  will  be   more

competition.   So  a lot depends on the local  lawyers.   Are

they  up to it?  Do they see the need for the move?  Are they

positive, and indeed I think many are positive.  Two to three

years ago when the fact was announced that the Government was

looking  into  this, local lawyers were more resistant.   But

over  time, partly because of the economic crisis and  partly

because  of what is happening elsewhere, I think they realise

-  and  also  partly because of the work being  done  in  the

region by local law firms - that there is a market out there.

There  is now greater confidence on the part of local players

to tie up with foreign partners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So will local law firms be affected? I think a lot will

depend  on how they respond to the challenge.  If the  scheme

works  out,  as it should, where the AG takes in  established

reputable  firms who will give us their business plans,  whom

the   AG   assesses  will  work  for  Singapore,  and   these

established foreign firms do not take us for a ride, as  they

probably will not, and they come in and do the type  of  work

which  currently only a small percentage of top-notch lawyers

are exposed to, ie, Tier 1 work, which will then be available

to  a  larger  number of Singapore lawyers, a good  start  is

made.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sin Boon Ann wondered whether this will benefit

Singapore lawyers.  I think he himself has answered it.   For

a  start,  it  may not be a quick uplift.  But, I  think,  as

Singapore  lawyers get exposed to Tier 1 work, complex  work,

they will also be clued in.  It may not be Singapore law, but

then   they  will  be  exposed  to  the  documentation,   the

processes.   And  over  time as these joint  ventures  become

larger  and  venture into the region - as I have said  in  my

Second Reading speech - they may,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>

in  fact, push for Singapore law to be the governing  law  of

these  regional  contracts.  So this is  a  process  which  I

think,  if  all  works well, will indeed be  a  boon  to  the

Singapore legal sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said this, small firms will continue to have a

role.   I  think much has been said about this too.   Indeed,

out  of  the 800 law firms in Singapore, about half, 430  are

actually sole proprietorships.  So despite the fact that  the

practice  of  law  has  become harder  -  quicker  deadlines,

greater  client expectations - there is still a large  number

of  small  firms  out  there  - sole  proprietorships,  small

partnerships - who cater to Singaporeans who need services in

contract matters and advice on family law and  criminal laws.

The  point  is  that Singaporeans need not fear that  arising

from  this opening up, costs will rise so astronomically that

they  cannot  even  have  access  to  legal  services.   This

approach  really,  together  with  the  other  amendments  on

corporatisation,   increases   the   choice   for   Singapore

consumers.  We are talking about the mode of delivering legal

services.  So besides the sole proprietorship, you  have  got

your   small  partnerships.   And  indeed  even   for   small

partnerships,  some  of  them have created  niche  practices.

Others  are larger partnerships.  And now there will  be  law

firms  in  the  form  of corporations.   Then  you  have  got

informal law alliances which are existing and soon formal law

alliances,  and joint ventures.  So there is a  whole  range.

Even  as there is a whole range of consumers, now there is  a

whole range of suppliers, and the matching can be done by the

market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope I have answered most of the major concerns which

Members  have  raised.  There are also some good  suggestions

made by Members.  For example, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua asked whether

lawyers  and  law corporations should be required  to  divest

their shares when suspended for a short period.  I think that

is  a  good  point.  The Bill provides that a lawyer  who  is

suspended   from  practice  cannot  take  part  directly   or

indirectly   in  the  management  or  practice   of   a   law

corporation.   However, I think she also has noted  that  the

Bill provides that a suspended lawyer cannot

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 776</b></font><br><br>

hold  any  shares in a law corporation unless the Council  of

the  Law Society grants him a grace period to dispose of  the

shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the point, of course, is that if the suspension is

a  short period, should he be made to divest his shares, only

to,  after  the suspension is over, buy back the shares?   Of

course,  I  cannot  pre-empt the Council who  must  make  the

decision  and  exercise its discretion.  But I  should  think

that  if  the  suspension is really for  an  extremely  short

period,  a few months, for example, so that it is impractical

for  the  lawyers to divest his shares during the  suspension

period and then buy them back immediately, it could well be a

reasonable exercise of the Council's discretion to grant  the

grace period which covers the entire suspension period.   But

we  have  to  wait  and see whether the  Council  takes  this

approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Mr Ravindran argues that law corporations should

have  a minimum paid-up capital.  This question was, in fact,

considered  very carefully by the Law Reform  Committee.   It

was  decided on balance that there was no need to provide for

a  minimum  paid-up  capital, as it was felt  that  the  best

protection for clients or corporations is to ensure that they

are  adequately insured to cover any claims which clients may

make  against them.  Hence, as I said in my speech, the rules

will set out what is the minimum coverage that is required.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, for lenders who lend to these law corporations,

even  though they are private exempt companies and  therefore

need not file annual returns, if they are scrupulous, careful

lenders,  they  can  ask  the firm  for  its  accounts.   For

example, the Bill provides that law corporations must  comply

with  the  Solicitor's Accounts Rules and that  includes  the

filing  of the accountant's report with the audited  accounts

with the Registrar of the Supreme Court.  That is a safeguard

which lenders of law corporations can take up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which Mr Sin Boon Ann makes, and which I

think Mr Noris Ong also supports, is why lawyers in law

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>

corporations  should  not also enjoy limited  liability.   Mr

Noris  Ong's  case  is that his liability should  be  capped.

This  is  of course a matter of debate.  But the position  is

that  if  we take this tack, it may lead to a lawyer lowering

his  guard and hence, lower professional standards.  We think

that  it  is  probably  in the public interest  that  lawyers

continue to be personally liable for matters over which  they

have  personal charge.  We think this is the correct approach

because  lawyers, even though they operate in the context  of

law  corporation, are still professionally charged  with  the

duties that are incumbent on them.  Indeed, they are expected

to  be  competent and exercise due diligence in matters  over

which  they  have  charge.   So  I  would  expect  in  a  law

corporation, the directors would have to decide  who  is  the

best person to handle a particular deal.  That is one of  the

benefits  of  a  law  corporation where  directors  can  have

different  legal expertise.  The point is the directors  will

then  not say, "I don't want to handle this because if I take

it up and anything goes wrong, I am personally liable."  This

is  a  management  decision which  the  directors  in  a  law

corporation  must  make.  Because if none  of  the  directors

wants to handle the deal, then the deal will go elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point which Mr Noris Ong makes is on the

acronym  "LLC".   "LLC"  was  suggested  by  the  Law  Reform

Committee  which included two Senior Counsels and  other  law

firm  partners.   There was no objection  expressed  to  this

acronym  which,  in  our  context, stands  for  "Limited  Law

Corporation".  It is felt that the acronym should  not  cause

any  confusion  when used in Singapore for  domestic  clients

although  in  some  jurisdictions, LLC may have  a  different

meaning,  ie, Limited Liability Company.  But in  Singapore's

context,  the  fact  is that - I have mentioned  this  in  my

speech  -  the  invoice and the official correspondence  must

state  that this is a law corporation with limited liability.

So  domestic  clients  dealing with the  law  firm  which  is

incorporated  will know who he is dealing with.   We  do  not

think it will cause

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>

confusion.   But in any case, for people who  want  to  avoid

doubt, the Bill actually gives an option.  You can either put

"LLC"  or "Law Corporation".  So those law corporations which

have US clients may want to adopt that option.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that has been mentioned is why the

provision that all shareholders must be solicitors.  Both  Mr

Noris Ong and Mr Ravindran know that, from the Bill, this  is

the current position.  But the Bill itself provides that,  in

future,  the rules can prescribe for other non-solicitors  to

be  shareholders.   As some Members will know,  this  vehicle

called  the multi-disciplinary practice is in fact  something

which many other jurisdictions have considered.  I understand

that there is a working committee of the Law Society which is

also considering that.  So I think that is something for  the

future.  And if, indeed, the rules are changed, I am sure the

suggestions  made  by  Mr  Ong  and  Mr  Ravindran  will   be

considered by the Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua</b> asked the Minister for Education,

besides  the proposed adjustment to compensation packages  to

retain  and  attract competent teaching staff, whether  there

are  other  plans in place to ensure a good  fit  and  proper

integration of University-trained manpower into the different

industries, such as engineering, finance and law.



<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the national level, the Government identifies the

broad  areas of manpower needs in the economy.  The  National

Manpower  Council, chaired by the Minister for  Manpower,  is

the  forum  where  such manpower decisions  are  taken.   The

universities'   intake  targets  are   derived   from   these

decisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the university level, our universities proactively

ensure  that graduates receive sufficient preparation to  fit

into specific sectors they are trained for.  This is done  in

several ways.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, our universities receive feedback and inputs from

representatives  from the industries in a systematic  manner.

At  NUS, Departmental Consultative Committees are set up  for

this  purpose.   At NTU, they are called the School  Advisory

Committees.   These  committees  comprise  leaders  in  those

fields  of society and industry most relevant to each of  the

departments  or  schools.  The committees play  an  important

role  in  providing feedback on the quality of graduates  and

industry  trends.  The committees also assist in the periodic

review  of the curriculum so that it will remain relevant  to

the  needs of the industry.  Where appropriate, proposals for

new curriculum or for curriculum review are circulated to key

personnel in the targeted industry for their inputs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the teaching staff are in touch with the

industry.   A  significant number of academic  staff  at  our

universities  have prior work experience in the  industry  or

are  currently  engaged in industrial  consulting  work.   In

addition,  our universities appoint a number of professionals

from  industry  to  be  adjunct professors/lecturers.   These

staff  will  have  a  good sense of what  the  needs  of  the

industry  are.  They can also show students the relevance  of

what  they  learn to real-life problems.  They,  too,  are  a

valuable   source   of   industrial   input   to   curricular

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, a large proportion of our students undergo work

attachments during the course of their undergraduate  degree.

For instance, all engineering students are required to do a 6-month  industrial attachment in their third  year.   Law  and

Business students also have the opportunity to be involved in

various  forms  of attachments during their vacations.   Such

attachments expose students to working life and help them see

how their training in university relates to industry.

<div align="center"><b>INTENSIVE CARE UNIT PATIENTS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for Health

(a)  how  many  intensive care unit  (ICU)  patients  in  the

National  University  National  Hospital,  Singapore  General

Hospital,  Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Alexandra Hospital  had

died  of  pneumonia from 1995 to 1999 respectively;  and  (b)

whether  his Ministry is satisfied with the standard  of  ICU

care in the hospitals.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Hng Kiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual rate of pneumonia deaths in the ICUs of NUH,

SGH,  TTSH  and AH from 1995 to 1998 is low and  ranges  from

0.7%  to 5.3% of all ICU admissions.  Excluding the data  for

1999  which is not yet available, the total number of  deaths

from  pneumonia  in  the ICUs of the four hospitals  annually

from 1995 to 1998 is 63, 104, 88 and 125 respectively.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The incidence of deaths from pneumonia per se is not

appropriate as a meaningful indicator of infection control in

the  ICU.  Patients  in  the ICU are severely  ill  and  more

susceptible  to  complications such as  lung  infections.   A

significant number of patients are also admitted into the ICU

for the management of severe infections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more appropriate and internationally accepted

indicator  of infection control in the ICU which is monitored

by   our   acute   hospitals  is  the  "ventilator-associated

pneumonia  rate".   This  rate  measures  the  incidence   of

pneumonia  associated  with  the  use  of  ventilators.   The

ventilator-associated  pneumonia rates  in  our  major  acute

public  sector  hospitals range from 7.6 to  33.2  per  1,000

ventilator-days,  which is comparable  to  the  rates  of  US

hospitals which range from 12.7 to 26.1 per 1,000 ventilator-days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation of quality of care in the ICU is a

complex   process.   In  addition  to  monitoring   infection

control,   hospitals  regularly  set  and  review  ICU   care

protocols  and guidelines.  They are required to  investigate

into  any  serious  deficiency detected, identify  areas  for

improvement and report their recommendations to my  Ministry.

Since  the licensing of hospitals in 1993, there has been  no

serious deficiency related to outcome of care in the ICU that

required investigation by my Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans can rest assured that the standard of ICU

care  in  public  sector  acute  hospitals  in  Singapore  is

comparable to reputable medical centres overseas.

<div align="center"><b>INCIDENTS OF RAGE</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr S Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr S Iswaran</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs

whether there has been an increase in the number of incidents

of rage, such as those that occurred recently in a cinema and

a fast food outlet, and whether there are adequate provisions

in the law against such misbehaviour.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no specific offence of "rage" in our laws.

Instead, depending on the acts and injuries that result  from

the  "rage", one of the following offences may be  committed:

voluntarily causing hurt, voluntarily causing grievous  hurt,

voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous weapons,  rioting  or

criminal  intimidation.   The penalties  for  these  offences

range  from  a  fine  to life imprisonment  and  caning.   In

serious cases, the prosecution will seek deterrent sentences.

These  provisions  in  our  laws are  adequate  against  such

misbehaviour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of cases of voluntarily causing hurt,

voluntarily  causing grievous hurt, voluntarily causing  hurt

with  dangerous  weapons, rioting and  criminal  intimidation

dropped  from  1,468 in 1998 to 1,109 in 1999.  The  recently

reported  cases of assaults in a cinema and fast food  outlet

should be seen in the context of this declining trend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no cause for the public to be alarmed.

<div align="center"><b>CPF CONTRIBUTION RATES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Minister for

Manpower  (a) if he will explain whether the current  Central

Provident  Fund (CPF) policies in respect of the accumulation

of  balances  in  the individual's account,  will  adequately

ensure  that  retirees, particularly those who are  currently

self-employed,  will be sufficiently taken care  of  for  the

period  of  their retirement; and (b) whether there  are  any

plans  to  increase the CPF contribution rates for the  self-employed  to  bring  them in line with the  CPF  contribution

level of employees.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, employees and their employers contribute a

total  of  30%  of  the employees' monthly  salary  into  the

employees' CPF account - 20% by the employee and 10%  by  the

employer.   The employer's CPF contribution will be  restored

by  2%  point  to 12% from 1st April 2000.  The  CPF  Board's

projections show that despite the lower CPF contribution rate

for  a  few  years,  CPF  members  would  still  be  able  to

accumulate  sufficient savings for basic old-age needs.   CPF

savings  should give an employee who has worked  continuously

for  35 to 40 years, a monthly retirement income of about 20%

to  40%  of his last take-home pay, after paying for  a  home

which  is  commensurate  with his income  and  setting  aside

savings for his medical needs in old age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the self-employed, since July 1992, those

with  a  net  trade income of more than $2,400 per  year  are

required  to  contribute  to  the  Medisave  Account.    They

contribute between 6% to 8% of their yearly net trade income,

depending  on their age. Such contributions are  granted  tax

relief.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As at December 1999, about 231,500 self-employed persons

were  contributing to their Medisave Accounts under the  law.

To encourage self-employed persons to contribute beyond their

Medisave  Account,  tax relief is also given  for  additional

voluntary CPF contributions.  The tax relief is subject to  a

cap of 20% of the self-employed persons' net trade income  or

$14,400,  whichever  is  the lower.   Of  the  231,500  self-employed  persons  who contribute to Medisave,  76,400  (33%)

made   voluntary  contributions  on  top  of  their  Medisave

contributions.  Self-employed persons who only contribute  to

Medisave would obviously not have savings for their  old  age

apart  from savings for medical care.  We hope that they  are

putting  aside  their  own savings or  making  voluntary  CPF

contributions to prepare for retirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the ageing population, savings for old age

needs  are  becoming  more important.  The  Inter-Ministerial

Committee  (or  IMC) for the Ageing Population had  suggested

that  the CPF system be extended to provide coverage  for  as

many  Singaporeans as possible.  The Committee suggested that

contributions  to  the  CPF Special Account  should  be  made

compulsory  for the self-employed.  My Ministry  is  studying

this  recommendation and will consider ways to encourage  and

help self-employed to save for their retirement.

<div align="center"><b>ILLEGAL WORKERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20. <b>Mr Thomas Thomas</b> asked the Minister for Manpower

what  steps the Government is taking or will take to  prevent

unscrupulous  employment  agents  from  bringing  in  illegal

workers on false promises of work in Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry is aware that some unscrupulous employment

agents and employers exploit the ignorance of foreign workers

to  bring  them  here  without  real  jobs  for  them.   This

malpractice  is  most  often seen in the construction  sector

where  large  numbers  of foreign workers  are  brought  into

Singapore  under  construction  work  permits  but  are  then

redeployed to work illegally in other sectors.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As licensed employment agents are regulated by my

Ministry  and are liable to lose their licences and  security

deposit  should they breach the regulations or conditions  of

their  licences,  it is likely that many of the  unscrupulous

agents bringing in illegal workers on false promises of  work

in  Singapore are unlicensed agents operating illegally.  The

penalties  for operating an unlicensed employment agency  are

$5,000  for  the  first offence, and $10,000  for  second  or

subsequent  offences with a possible jail term  of  up  to  6

months.   My  Ministry will not hesitate  to  prosecute  such

illegal employment agents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more effective and substantive measure against such

exploitation is to be more selective in allowing the entry of

foreign  workers, both in terms of numbers and skills levels.

This  would reduce opportunities for unscrupulous agents from

bringing  in  foreign workers illegally in the  first  place.

To this end, my Ministry has adopted a two-pronged approach:



a)   <br><br><i>Review of the Work Permit Allocation System</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we have tightened the Work Permit Allocation

system in the construction sector by introducing a system  of

Man-year  Entitlements,  which  are  allocated  to  the  main

contractors  based  on the project size and  actual  manpower

requirement.   The main contractors will be  responsible  for

distributing these entitlements to their subcontractors.  The

main contractors will also be held responsible for the upkeep

and  welfare  of  the foreign workers of their subcontractors

should  these  workers  be abandoned.   It  is  thus  in  the

interest   of  the  main  contractors  to  ensure  that   the

entitlement goes to genuine sub-contractors who will  do  his

work.   This will result in less opportunity for unscrupulous

sub-contractors  to  apply  for  excessive  number  of   work

permits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry has been monitoring the new Work Permit

Allocation system carefully.  Our findings suggest that  main

contractors have indeed become more circumspect in allocating

their  work permit entitlements to their subcontractors.   So

far,  for  projects that have been completed,  about  55%  of

total work permit entitlements given out have been used. This

system had resulted in fewer work permit applications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longer term objective as spelt out under the

Construction  21  report is to reduce the number  of  foreign

workers in the Construction sector by 50% over a period of 10

years,  that is, from the current 200,000 foreign workers  to

around  100,000  workers.  We may be able  to  speed  up  the

process by reviewing and tightening the allocation formula.



b)    <br><br><i>Ensuring  Better  Quality and  Higher  Skilled  Foreign Workers</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second approach is to ensure that the foreign

workers  brought in are of better quality with higher  skills

level.  We have found that skilled workers are less likely to

be exploited or abused by the employment agents or employers.

They  are  also  less  susceptible to scams  by  unscrupulous

employment  agents,  both   local as  well  as  foreign,  and

employers.   Hence with effect from 1st April 2000,  all  new

non-traditional  source  foreign  workers  employed  in   the

construction   industry  have  to  pass  the   Basic   Skills

Certificate (BSC) test in their home countries.  This is  the

first step in raising the skills requirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the longer-term, as stated in the Construction 21

Report, we hope to have 45% of the construction workforce  as

skilled   workers   by  2005  and  60%  by   2010.    Skilled

construction  workers refer to those who can meet  our  NTC-2

(practical) requirements.



<br><br><i>Conclusion</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry's two-pronged approach will minimize

opportunities  for fraudulent practices by  local  employment

agents  and  employers.  However, we would  not  be  able  to

control  unscrupulous agents in foreign countries.   What  we

can and will do is to ensure that foreigners taking the Basic

Skills  Certificate  tests in their home countries  are  made

aware   of   the  Work  Permit  regulations  covering   their

employment in Singapore before they come here.

<div align="center"><b>INJURIES RESULTING FROM MILITARY TRAINING</b></div>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21. <b>Mr Noris Ong Chin Guan</b> asked the Deputy Prime

Minister  and Minister for Defence if he will give an  update

on  the trend of fatal accidents and injuries resulting  from

military  training or exercises from 1997  to  1999  and  the

adequacy of existing military training safety regulations.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of fatal accidents and injuries in the SAF

has decreased steadily over the last 3 years.  The number  of

fatal accidents had decreased significantly from 6 in 1997 to

1  in 1999, while the number of training injuries had dropped

by 45% in the same period.  This improvement is the result of

sustained efforts by the SAF to improve safety, and has  been

achieved  without lowering the tempo of training and training

standards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, the SAF conducted a major review of its

military  training safety system. Since then, it has  put  in

place  mechanisms  to  regularly review the  training  safety

procedures.  In addition, safety inspections in all  training

activities and safety education amongst officers and men  are

emphasised;  schemes to encourage suggestions from  units  to

improve  the  safety of military training and exercises  have

been introduced; and a high-level standing committee, chaired

by  the  Chief  of Defence Force, was set up to  oversee  the

promotion  of safety efforts in every aspect of SAF  training

and exercises.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAF will continue to ensure that the military training

and exercises are conducted safely.

<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sale of Tenanted Shops Scheme (SOTS) was introduced

in   July  1992  with  the  objective  of  restructuring  and

improving the efficiency of shops in HDB estates. So far, HDB

has  conducted 18 sales with 7,500 or about 75%  of  eligible

shops sold.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the economy has improved and economic growth is

expected  to  continue  into Year  2000,  the  Government  is

mindful  of  the  need  to maintain cost competitiveness  and

ensure  the  growth can be sustained. For  this  reason,  the

Government  has  extended  the  rental  rebates   for   HDB's

commercial properties till the end of December 2000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this moment, HDB has no plans to sell any more shops

under  SOTS. Nonetheless, if there are any specific  requests

from  the  Advisors, HDB will consider each case on  its  own

merits.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All taxpaying mothers of any income level can claim a

"Further Tax Rebate" (FTR) at 15% of her earned income.   The

Employment  Act  allows eight weeks of paid  maternity  leave

only  for  the  first two children.  The  FTR  percentage  is

roughly  equivalent to eight weeks of maternity  leave.   The

FTR  is available for the third and fourth children.   It  is

meant  to  encourage  working  married  women  to  have  more

children  if they can afford it.  The rebate quantum  can  be

claimed  over  a period of 9 years. It should also  be  noted

that  there are tax benefits in addition to the FTR for those

who  can  afford more children, such as the S$20,000  Special

Tax Rebate and Enhanced Child Relief for the third child.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25. <b>Dr Jennifer Lee</b> asked the Minister for Finance (i)

whether  further tax rebates, which are given  to  a  working

mother in the year of the birth of her third or fourth  child

and  which  may  be used up to a period of 9 years,  will  be

subsequently  withdrawn  if  her  marriage  is  dissolved  by

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the marriage is dissolved, the unused Further Tax

Rebate  (FTR)  will cease. The procreation tax  rebates  were

implemented to encourage married couples to have  larger  and

complete families.  Hence divorcees are not eligible for  the

FTR.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tay Beng Chuan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26. <b>Mr Tay Beng Chuan</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether,  in the interest of inculcating a civic  society  in

Singapore,  his  Ministry will consider exempting  non-profit

trade  associations  and other community  organisations  from

corporate  income  tax, since any surplus  accrued  from  the

activities of these organisations is ploughed back  into  the

development  of  long-term projects for the  benefit  of  the

community at large.



<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, non-profit organisations which engage in

charitable  activities can already be exempt from  tax.  Such

charitable  activities include the advancement of  education,

relief from poverty and distress, and relief from sickness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trade associations are traditionally set up to promote

or  safeguard the business of its members and benefit only  a

defined  group  of  persons and not the community  at  large.

Nevertheless, a trade association can be exempted from tax if

more  than 50% of its receipts are received from its  members

in  the form of entrance fees and subscriptions. Tax is  only

imposed  on  those  trade associations which  receive  income

primarily from non-members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a trade association wishes to undertake projects

specifically for the benefit of the community as a whole,  it

would  be best for the association to set up a separate  non-profit organisation for the charitable activity.

Industry  whether  his  Ministry  will  continue  to  monitor

Government  charges and levies closely and wherever  possible

<br><br><!-- BG George Yong-Boon Yeo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG George Yong-Boon Yeo:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last November when Government announced the partial (2%-point) restoration of employers' CPF contribution rate, it

also  stated that Government rebates in key areas of business

costs - namely industrial land rentals, port and airport dues

-  would  be  extended for an additional  year.  The  reduced

Foreign  Worker  Levy rates would also remain  unchanged  for

another  year. This was to help keep business  costs  low  so

that  we  do not choke off the current economic recovery.  My

Ministry  will  continue to closely monitor these  and  other

charges and levies to ensure that we remain cost competitive.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Government cannot freeze all charges and fees

indefinitely.  That will be ultimately harmful to the economy

as   it   would   lead  to  distortions  and  inefficiencies.

Periodically, charges and fees have to be revised to  reflect

changing  market conditions. But, as always,  the  Government

will  exercise moderation, so as to avoid unnecessary  burden

on the economy and our businessmen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Callback services provide healthy competition in the

necessary to place some form of restrictions on the  callback

operators  because of SingTel's exclusive rights  to  provide

IDD  services up to 31st March 2000 and the moratorium period

granted to StarHub from 1st April 2000 to 1st April 2002 when

it   was   awarded  its  telecoms  licence.   In   a   recent

clarification, the Info-communications Development  Authority

of Singapore, or IDA, had explained that the only restriction

on  callback operators is that they cannot advertise  on  the

example,  the  workers  must  be  seated  in  proper  sitting

position  and in a manner that would not cause them  to  fall

off  the vehicle.  For pick-up trucks, the vehicles used  are

required to have proper side-railings to further protect  the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various countries and international organisations are

studying  whether  there  is  a  need  to  label  genetically

modified  food.  The issue is a complex one  and  involves  a

variety  of  factors  such  as the scientific  and  objective

assessment  of  genetically modified food in comparison  with

conventional  food,  the  market  implications  and  cost  of

labelling, the regime of labelling permissible under existing

world   trading   rules  and  issues  of   practicality   and

enforcement.  So far, there is no agreement or  international

trend on this issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some states, including the large producers of such food,

maintain  that where stringent safety evaluation  shows  that

genetically  modified  foods  are  not  any  different   from

conventional  foods, there is no need to make  a  distinction

between  them.  Other countries, including  some  with  large

agricultural communities which feel threatened by imports  of

such  products,  are agitating against their  production  and

imports.  There  is also a school of thought  that  labelling

will allow consumers to make an informed choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Genetic Modification Advisory Committee is closely

following  these developments and will advise the  Government

whether to label such products. We should take a rational and

objective  approach,  considering the  weight  of  scientific

assessment and analysis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Member is referring to residential

properties,  as  a matter of principle, will  revert  to  the

State upon expiry of the lease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that extensions of such leases cannot

be considered upon their expiry.  However, a decision on this

cannot be taken in abstract.  As most residential leases have

more  than  70 years left, it is not possible now to  give  a

general  decision  applicable to all  such  properties  where

there  are  many years, before such leases expire.   We  will

have  to consider each case on its merits, depending  on  the

Government's long-term plans for land uses closer to the time

of expiry of the leases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the changing needs, our economic and social

development, Government must retain its flexibility in  land-scarce Singapore to plan for the longer term. Indeed this  is

one reason why we have 99-year leases.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Yock Suan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Yock Suan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has not banned any art forms in

Singapore.   To  stage public performances, artists  have  to

apply  for  a licence from the Public Entertainment Licensing

Unit (PELU).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forum Theatre and Performance Art are relatively new art

forms  that  have no prepared script but rely on  spontaneity

and  improvisation  with the performers  drawing  inspiration

from  audience  participation.  They pose  greater  risks  to

public  order and decency. The performances may be  exploited

to  agitate  the audience on volatile social  issues,  or  to

propagate  the  beliefs and messages  of  deviant  social  or

religious  groups, or as a means of subversion.  To  regulate

scriptless  public  performances,  PELU  requires  a  licence

application  for  such performances to be  accompanied  by  a

synopsis of the performance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Arts Council (NAC) is monitoring the

practice  of  Performance Art and Forum Theatre in  Singapore

and  abroad to assess their impact and development.  The  NAC

has withheld public funding for these art forms since January

1994, arising from a performance by Fifth Passage in which an

actor  trimmed his pubic hair and another induced himself  to

vomit into a rubbish bin.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications for Public Entertainment licences are

classified  under  `establishment'  and  `ad  hoc'  types  of

licences.  `Establishment' licences are for  premises/outlets

such  as  pubs  and amusement centres, which  provide  public

entertainment.  `Ad hoc' licences are mainly for events  that

last  a  short period of time, for example, concerts, dramas,

plays, variety shows and talks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police has publicly pledged to process 90% of all

establishment licence applications within 8 weeks  and  adhoc

licence   applications  within  3  weeks.  Applications   for

establishment licences take a longer time to process as  more

detailed checks have to be conducted before the Police can be

satisfied that law and order will not be compromised for  the

duration of the licence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1999, more than 50% of all applications were

processed  within  a week while 91% of all applications  were

processed  within  3  weeks.  For ad hoc licences,  96%  were

approved within 3 weeks.  Only 179 (4%) applications  out  of

5,312  applications took more than 4 weeks to  process.   109

(61%)  of  these  179  applications  were  for  establishment

licences.  Only 64 (1% of total) applications, comprising  54

establishment  and 10 ad hoc applications, were  rejected  in

1999.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police constantly reviews its internal processes and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government-linked companies, like all other companies,

are  run on a commercial basis.  They face the usual business

risks, including market, technology, commercial and political

risks.   Not all investments will be profitable, nor may  the

profitable  ones be profitable every single year.  Government

has  to look at the returns on its investments on a portfolio

basis, and not take the simplistic position of looking at the

profits and losses of individual GLCs year to year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are tens of thousands of projects and business

ventures  undertaken  by  GLCs.   They  are  undertaken  with

corporate  and business structures which best facilitate  the

commercial  activities  in  highly competitive  environments.

There are some 1,600 GLCs in total.  To pursue the details of

every venture by every GLC for every year since 1965 does not

make sense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government looks at its investments on the basis of

overall  performance of its portfolio of companies.  As  with

any  other  investments, diversification minimizes  the  risk

level  of  the  entire  portfolio.   Temasek  Holdings,   the

Government  investment  holding company  which  monitors  the

performance of our portfolio, has made profits averaging $2.2

billion  a  year  over  the last 10 years.   It  has  current

shareholders' funds totalling $46 billion.

Development  if  his Ministry will consider bringing  forward

the    implementation   of   major   public    housing    and

infrastructural  projects  to  restore  the  growth  of   the

construction  sector which contracted by  16%  in  the  third

quarter of 1999.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the whole of 1999, the construction sector is

expected  to contract by 15%.  The public sector's  share  of

the  total  construction demand dropped to 56%  in  1999,  as

compared  to  69% in 1998.  This is mainly due to  the  sharp

drop  in  tender prices, rather than the number  of  projects

which  increased by 3.9% from 812 projects  in  1998  to  844

projects in 1999.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect construction demand to pick up this year due

to improved market sentiments in the private sector and major

public  infrastructure projects in the pipeline.  The  public

sector's value share of total construction demand is expected

to  climb  to 70% in 2000.  Public civil engineering projects

are  expected  to  make up 30% of total construction  demand.

Contracts  for large projects such as the S$1 billion  Marina

MRT Line and the S$1.5 billion Jurong Island Phase 4 and Tuas

View extension reclamation project will be awarded this year.

Public  residential  (HDB)  and  institutional  projects  are

expected to contribute another 15% each.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HDB's building programme has to be carried out in tandem

with its public housing programme.  This, in turn, is largely

dependent  on the demand for new flats.  HDB cannot overbuild

just  to  prop  up the construction industry.  Otherwise,  it

will result in high holding costs for the unsold flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is generally a 1 to 2-year time lag before

construction   GDP  picks  up.   As  such,  we   expect   the

construction  industry  to contract by  about  8.3%  in  2000

before regaining positive growth.  Based on feedback from the

various Government agencies, there is a fair distribution  of

major  projects  in  2000  and 2001  which  would  contribute

significantly to the continuous and sustainable growth of the

industry over the next few years.

to enjoy mortgage loans financed by relatively cheap funds.



<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b> asked the Minister for National

Development  how  many  Housing and  Development  Board  flat

owners   who  are  permanent  residents  have  family  nuclei

comprising  permanent residents that have enabled the  owners

to qualify for ownership and what types of flats do they own.



<br><br><!-- Mr Mah Bow Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Mah Bow Tan:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary objective of public housing has always been

to  provide affordable HDB flats to citizen households.  This

fundamental  objective  has  not changed.   Only  Singaporean

families  are allowed to buy subsidised flats from  the  HDB,

apply  for  the  CPF housing grant to buy resale  flats,  and

enjoy  the  HDB concessionary mortgage loans to  buy  new  or

resale HDB flats.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 29,000 flats, or less than 4% of the total stock

of  HDB  flats,  are  currently owned by Singapore  Permanent

Resident (SPR) families.  Over 80% of them bought 3-room  and

4-room  resale flats.  SPR families are only allowed  to  buy

resale flats from the open market at market price. They  will

not be entitled to the CPF Housing Grant.  If they take up  a

HDB mortgage loan to buy a resale flat, they are required  to

pay the prevailing market interest rate.  Hence, SPR families

are  not  eligible  for housing subsidy,  whether  direct  or

indirect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same policy treatment which differentiates between

Singapore citizens and SPRs is also applied by the Government

under  the  Main  Upgrading Programme, the Selective  En-bloc

Redevelopment  Programme, and the  rebates  for  Service  and

Conservancy Charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This differential policy treatment has ensured that our

housing subsidies benefit only the citizen families.  At  the

same  time,  SPR  families  are able  to  acquire  reasonably

affordable housing in Singapore when they contribute  to  our

economy.  They can enjoy the housing subsidies only when they

apply for and are granted the Singapore citizenship.

recruitment   tool  to  attract  more  and  better   manpower

resources.



<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conditions of Employment Survey, which was conducted

in  June  last  year,  covered  about  3,000  private  sector

establishments with at least 25 employees each.  The  purpose

of  this  survey was to examine the extent to which companies

used   various  benefits  to  attract,  retain  and  motivate

employees. The Survey found that about 5.2% of private sector

establishments offered Employees Stock Option  Scheme  (ESOP)

to  their  employees.  The percentage ranged from  18%  among

firms  in  financial services to only 0.5%  in  construction.

These  were  mainly  extended to  senior  management  in  the

companies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ESOP gives employees the right to buy equities in their

companies  at  a predetermined price in the  future.   It  is

practised  by  companies  to  attract,  retain  and  motivate

employees,  particularly among the key executives to  improve

the  performance  of  their companies, and  consequently  the

price  of their stocks.  It has gained popularity among high-tech  start-up  companies which use it as a form  of  pay  or

reward  at  a time when they are making little or no  profit.

Some  MNCs  in Singapore also offer ESOP to their  employees.

In  recent years, ESOP has also been adopted by public-listed

companies  in  Singapore although it is  mainly  confined  to

senior management personnel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Government supports companies in the private

sector  to  introduce  ESOP to attract, retain  and  motivate

their  staff,  it is for the individual companies  to  decide

whether such scheme is suitable.
