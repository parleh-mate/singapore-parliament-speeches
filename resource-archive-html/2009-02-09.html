Thanks to the hard work of our economic agencies like EDB, we have been able to attract global MNCs to invest in Singapore. The Government also offered attractive schemes and incentives to draw in foreign direct and R&amp;D investments. These investments have added value to our economy and created jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, we have to be mindful and realistic that for some of these foreign companies, their business plans are drawn up by their head offices based outside Singapore. Their investments and business plans can change due to the challenges they faced in their home country or other regions they operate.&nbsp; Hence, while we should rightly continue to attract and draw in foreign direct investments, I hope the Government will also spend and commit equally significant funds and resources to help our local enterprises in their set- up and assist them in expanding their capabilities. We should spare no effort in continuing to nurture and grow our steady base of home-bred and locally anchored&nbsp;companies here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad to hear that in this Budget, $130 million will be spent to enhance our grants and training schemes to encourage enterprises across different sectors to refresh and develop new capabilities so as to capture growth opportunities when the economy starts to recover.&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to the announcement of further details as</p><p align=left>Column: 2292<p><p>to how SPRING and IE Singapore can help local enterprises develop new capabilities and globalise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the recommendations put up by the Economic Review Committee in 2002 is to assist our domestic enterprises break out of the low-cost, low-efficiency cycle and move into the innovation-driven cycle of growth.&nbsp; Our aim then was to nurture our domestic enterprises to become the future growth engine for the economy.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister how much progress we have made on this front so far.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>New Market Development to Position for Future Growth</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo (East Coast):</B> Mr Chairman, while we look at measures to support viable businesses in Singapore, to manage cost, enhance cash flow, build and retain capability, we cannot ignore the fact that unless there continues to be demand for services and products, businesses in Singapore, though more resilient, will not be able to survive for too long.&nbsp; Recognising that the economic challenges are global and that our growth and total demand have slowed over the last two consecutive quarters, how are we investing to build capability to create new markets and opportunities to address the demand for our services and products?&nbsp; I would like the Minister to share&nbsp;the initiatives and programmes in place to develop new markets and build capability to support growth for Singapore's economy in the near term.&nbsp; As it will be difficult to generally export demand, what is being done to look for new markets where demand still exists? Do we see the alternative energy sector as one that could support new demand for our services as companies look to improving their energy efficiency in the near term? Given the size of Singapore's local market, unlike other regional countries with large and growing domestic demand, our ability to create and grow local</p><p align=left>Column: 2293<p><p>demand will be limited, what measures are there to encourage Singapore companies to look for new overseas markets?&nbsp; Does the Minister see intra-regional trade and investments as a potential market to drive demand?&nbsp; Or are other markets the focus to drive near term demand for Singapore's services products?&nbsp; How are our local enterprises involved in the development of these markets and capabilities?&nbsp; What about availability of skills locally to support these new sectors or markets?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, can the Minister also share the status of existing and new foreign investments that have remained in Singapore in various industries, from manufacturing plants, facilities and financial services?&nbsp; Given the slowdown in demand and the economic challenges, what are the implications of these investments?&nbsp; Are they at risk?&nbsp; Will we see a shift of investments in Singapore?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this crisis, while we look at ways to ensure that companies survive and weather the storm, we will still need to continue to ensure that we invest the engines for growth and capture opportunities.

What happens after the $17 million&nbsp;CERT Scheme and the $20 million Solar Capability Scheme expire?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must avoid mistakes made by some governments where start/stop policies stunted solar business&nbsp; growth in a country, after which it was difficult to pick up the momentum again. It would therefore be disastrous for Singapore's solar companies if business collapse next year for lack of follow-through of the recent positive initiatives.&nbsp; The same applies to students just starting courses in renewable energy at our polytechnics and universities.&nbsp; Without local demand for their engineering skills, upon graduation, we face an inevitable brain drain of local talent seeking better opportunities abroad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the news, we learn that&nbsp;the new Obama Administration is spending billions to develop green technologies and green jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Japan and South Korea are likewise investing US$30-US$50 billion in the three to four years in green technologies and generating some 960,000 and 1 million green jobs respectively.&nbsp;

Sir, we need to save companies which have viable businesses but are facing the liquidity crunch and unless the Government gets more involved, we will not succeed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have got feedback that since the Government implemented the SRI, some banks have undermined it by transferring their commercial loans to the SRI loans.&nbsp; This defeats the purpose of SRI to catalyse new loans and if all the banks start adopting this approach, we then&nbsp;would have&nbsp;a zero net gain.&nbsp; So while the Government might think that&nbsp;new loans are being created through the SRI, this may not be the case.&nbsp; We need to control this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we hope that the SRI will work, we need to do more.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to suggest&nbsp;three things that we should do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, like in Canada and&nbsp;Taiwan, where the governments till today are still directly involved, we should therefore consider setting up a SME or development bank to do something like this so that in the future, when we are faced with a similar loss of confidence of the financial sector, we will be&nbsp;able to act much faster in getting liquidity going again&nbsp;into our markets and not be held ransom, waiting for the market to get organised again.&nbsp; Such a bank could be still a secondary source of funds while we rely primarily on the tested approach of lending through banks supported by the various Government schemes.&nbsp; To be realistic, it will take time for us to set up&nbsp;such a bank but I think we should think about one for the future.&nbsp; We, therefore, need to work </p><p align=left>Column: 2300<p><p>within the current systems if we want to help companies fast.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, I suggest that we open up a new channel or front for lending where SPRING sets up an investment committee, consisting of bankers, entrepreneurs, consultants and SPRING officers to approve loan applications made direclty to SPRING.&nbsp; Upon approval, SPRING then directs the banks to lend.&nbsp; This may require a different risk-sharing profile for banks to want to participate.&nbsp; I therefore suggest a three-year-loan where the Government gives a 100% loan guarantee in the first year, 80% in the second year and 50% in the third year.&nbsp; This way we avoid the moral hazard of banks lending when it does not make sense because the Government takes 100% of the risk for the full duration of the loan period.&nbsp; If the Government does not want to guarantee 100% and still wants to stick to 80%, then I think this system of in-principle-approval by&nbsp;SPRING can still work if we allow the companies to put a 20% deposit with the banks as their share of the risk while the banks disbursed the other 80% through the SRI.&nbsp; I am sure that these initiatives will better facilitate the cash flow for companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, Sir, I have suggested the setting up of a Corporate Rescue Task Force, where we have the&nbsp;public and private sectors getting together&nbsp;rescuing companies that have capabilities that we may want to keep alive for Singapore in the long term.&nbsp; We should seriously consider this because there are many of these companies that are viable, have good models that could survive in the long term but need a&nbsp;lifeline in the short term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, JTC, like HDB and SLA, is still adjusting rentals upwards.&nbsp; I have seen a number of examples.&nbsp; This needs to stop.&nbsp; JTC should instead conduct a review of market rental rates to be accurate.&nbsp; The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) is doing the same to review </p><p align=left>Column: 2301<p><p>property tax because of the significant drop in properties prices&nbsp;in the last&nbsp;six months.&nbsp; Sir, JTC also recently instituted a new rule to restrict sub-leasing&nbsp;&ndash; I believe not more than 50% of space owned by or leased by a tenant can be sub-leased out.&nbsp; This is rational, but counter-intuitive.&nbsp; In this current environment, it will choke off more of the company's cashflow leaving too much of unutilised space if they cannot lease out.&nbsp; The implication of this is that we will have&nbsp;vacant&nbsp;space left and therefore drive up rentals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, start-ups will be the worst affected by the bank lending squeeze so we must try to help those which are innovative and have got the potential for high growth.&nbsp; I suggest that SPRING proactively extends further investments to all SEEDS invested companies.&nbsp; SEEDS should also be enhanced such that start-ups that find difficulties in finding&nbsp;third-party investors can go to the SEEDS Investment Committee to get an in-principle approval to invest first and then the SEEDS team can help them look&nbsp;for&nbsp;third-party investors.&nbsp; Currently the process is reversed, where the&nbsp;third-party investors need to be found first.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also like to repeat my call for SPRING to set up&nbsp;a&nbsp;Growth Fund, which is a direct investment fund investing into growth companies.&nbsp; This fund can incentivise the entrepreneur to buy back the Government's share at a nominal return to the Government. &nbsp;This will help us build some local anchors capable of playing a big role in our economic development of the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also see no harm in spurring micro enterprises.&nbsp; We should, perhaps, set up what I call an Opportunity Fund to support small or micro enterprises, targeted at helping people who are out of jobs but have some business ideas.&nbsp; Even</p><p align=left>Column: 2302<p><p>if a few succeed, we can create a vibrant environment of many start-ups.&nbsp; SPRING could perhaps work with the various CDCs to co-fund this Opportunity Fund.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, the need on creating demand for our SMEs.&nbsp; While SPRING is focused on&nbsp;growth locally, IE Singapore is focused on growing demand externally.&nbsp; I think IE Singapore has not been effective in bringing our SMEs overseas.&nbsp; SPRING, I think, can do a better job.&nbsp; At the same time, EDB is not interested in attracting foreign SMEs into Singapore and I think there is value in bringing some of them who are thinking of relocating.&nbsp; For this purpose, for gaps that are appearing, I suggest that we relook at how our economic agencies are organised to do this job more effectively.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo (West Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

They are also the most vulnerable&nbsp;in&nbsp;a prolonged downturn.&nbsp; To help SMEs improve their productivity during this time, perhaps the Government could offer a scheme that grants SMEs to carry out an organisational review of their&nbsp;processes and systems to better streamline for optimal manning.&nbsp; So an employer's&nbsp;SPUR can be launched which gives a grant for retaining external expertise service and the allocation of internal resources for such productivity and workflow streamlining exercise.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;I commend the Government&nbsp;for the $5.8 billion to assist businesses and&nbsp;the SRI in assisting to keep these companies afloat.&nbsp; However, Sir,&nbsp;increasing the loan quantum coverage is a thoughtful measure as some SMEs have larger companies as customers and if these larger companies go bankrupt, the SMEs will soon follow suit.&nbsp; There are instances of healthy companies which cannot get loans simply because the banks are reluctant to lend.&nbsp; I think it is </p><p align=left>Column: 2303<p><p>necessary to assess the efficacy of these measures by assessing loan activity on a regular basis.&nbsp; This can be carried out by SPRING Singapore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in times of adversity there can be opportunity.&nbsp; This recession could be a good time to encourage entrepreneurship.&nbsp; Many PMETs are being laid off and this surplus executive-level human capital must be assisted.&nbsp; We can encourage these individuals to tap into their skills to offer services such as business consulting.&nbsp; Therefore, our aim should be to encourage entrepreneurship, flexibility, self-reliance and leveraging on current skills.&nbsp; In this way, we not only achieve our objective of developing the spirit of enterprise, we also help with gainful employment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to urge the Government to develop, one,&nbsp;a database of these consultants and entrepreneurs to facilitate businesses; and, two, a network hub of companies and PMETs to further facilitate job and business opportunities.&nbsp; SME-targeted schemes should be further publicised.&nbsp; Examples, Local Enterprise Finance Scheme, the Micro Loan Programme and the SEEDS&nbsp;Fund for employers with no more than 10 employees.&nbsp;

On the various financing schemes, my friends in the SMEs, they are either not aware of them or they insist that it is just as difficult to get loans.&nbsp; So, I ask the Minister to step up efforts to raise the level of awareness among SMEs of the various help schemes offered by the</p><p align=left>Column: 2304<p><p>Government and to make the process as simple as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have five other suggestions for the Minister to consider.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, Government rental rebates.&nbsp; The Government has given landlords some rebates on their rents. &nbsp;My question is whether these savings are passed on to the businesses who lease these properties?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One way to ensure more landlords do so is to allow those who pass the rebates on to tenants to claim 110%-125% of the amount rebated to tenants against the property tax to be paid.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this way, landlords gain a tax benefit against their property tax while tenants benefit directly. &nbsp;Most landlords will then want to give the rebate to tenants. &nbsp;The scheme is easy to implement, highly accountable and will add to the cashflow of both tenants and developers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, JTC recently announced that it would allow 50% of space in end-user factories to be sub-leased out to third parties. And for the balance 50%, they are imposing a levy.&nbsp;JTC should relax these rules and allow as much sub-leasing as tenants want and suspend the levy. &nbsp;SMEs need cashflow, and if they can get this by sub-leasing surplus space for short periods, then I see this as being&nbsp;a good thing overall.&nbsp; It will also help to lower business costs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, many SMEs are having difficulties producing up-to-date accounts to substantiate their loan applications. &nbsp;SPRING can consider offering cash grants of, say, $10,000 over the next two years to help SMEs pay for their company accounts to be brought up to date.&nbsp; It will also help to lower borrowing costs and these data can be captured in a SME-type credit bureau to spur competition to lend</p><p align=left>Column: 2305<p><p>among financial institutions. &nbsp;I see this as being similar to the sort of credit bureau being used by credit card companies now.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, rental deposits for investors.&nbsp;&nbsp;EDB/SPRING can assist to put up a 50%-75% share of banker's guarantee to landlords, as a means to co-fund investors or&nbsp;businesses trying to expand or consolidate their operations under one roof.&nbsp; This can be limited to a cap of, say,&nbsp;two months and on a gradually reducing scale over, say,&nbsp;three years, starting from 75% in Year 1 down&nbsp;to 50% in Year 3.&nbsp;Some potential tenants who are looking at leasing generally do not want their cashflow tied up via rental deposits.&nbsp; They may also have problems coming up with banker's guarantee in these times, especially SMEs who are starting up or expanding their businesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, could the Government consider buying off some of the assets of banks? &nbsp;These are not bad debts but those on the margins. Perhaps the Government can buy over these assets on the condition that the banks will make the resulting capital available for renewed lending. &nbsp;Instead of waiting for deterioration on the loans portfolio, it is better for the buyout of such marginal assets when the banking system is still robust.&nbsp;&nbsp;The buyout is a concrete step to break the impasse especially for banks which are now forced to withdraw commitments or do not renew maturing loans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in this current crisis, it is time we looked for unconventional and new methods for the future.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman:</B> &nbsp; Miss Penny Low, you have&nbsp;two cuts.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>SOS for SMEs</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Miss Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol):</B> Sir, according to the Global Enabling Trade Report by the World Economic Forum,</p><p align=left>Column: 2306<p><p>Singapore has been increasingly dependent on trade, especially since 2002.&nbsp; While this has boosted our GDP, it also makes us more vulnerable to the global economic climate.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years, our SMEs have also been encouraged to venture abroad, adding to our exposure.&nbsp; Can the Minister explain&nbsp;whether there is a particular Government policy in terms of</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>our GDP versus trade ratio, the impact of this increasing dependency on our SMEs, and what measures might be in place, or not, to help SMEs with large trade exposure, cushion any global downturn?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, SMEs employ some 60% of the workforce and, therefore, keeping them afloat by smoothening their cash flow and credit lines are keys to job preservation.&nbsp; So in that light, I applaud the Government&rsquo;s move in this Budget.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the devil is always in the details of the implementation.&nbsp; Can the Minister explain how will the well-intended policies&nbsp;be operationalised and translated into actual benefits on the ground?&nbsp; For example, is the form-filling process too onerous or is there still a lot of red-tape that could be cut?&nbsp; In cases where credit applications are rejected, how will SPRING reassess such cases?&nbsp; In fact, who has the authority to make these decisions?&nbsp; Will it be based on the number of employees that they have to save jobs or whether the business is in our economic thrust sector?&nbsp; Also, if the credit assessor is a civil servant with no business experience, would he have the wisdom to judge the viability of a business that is hit by the downturn?&nbsp; Some businesses may have a good track record during the boom time but is now hit by a demand drought.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entrepreneurs are the engines of growth and innovation.&nbsp; These mavericks' </p><p align=left>Column: 2307<p><p>job creation and game changing innovations may provide solutions to the present crisis.&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp;can the Minister update the house on its entrepreneurship push and what it intends to do in helping SMEs increase their demand, increase their&nbsp;risk capital pool and raise the bar for societal capital, which is&nbsp;the capacity for failures as norms?&nbsp; And, ultimately, it should not be the one-hit wonders but the pay-offs from persistent ongoing businesses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On to my second cut, Sir, on social economy.&nbsp; Sir, the combined global social economy forms the fifth largest economy in the world.&nbsp; I am wondering how is MTI taking advantage of it.&nbsp; In recognition of the innovative value of those involved in the social economy, several OECD countries have launched a series of strategies to promote social enterprises and social economies and the results have been encouraging.&nbsp; In 2002, UK launched a strategy in their Department of Trade and Industry and even has a Minister for the Third Sector. In 2004, the Canadian government allocated CAN$132&nbsp;million&nbsp;to support social and&nbsp;community academic&nbsp;development and they do it&nbsp;via three levels.&nbsp; One, financing at $100 million over five years; two,&nbsp;capacity building, CAN$17 million over two years; and, three,&nbsp;research, CAN$15 million over five years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The budget is also committed to improving the access of social enterprises to programmes and services for SMEs.&nbsp; And the result? &nbsp;Today, just Quebec alone has 6,200 social economy enterprises that employ 65,000 people and generate annual sales in excess of $4 billion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In contrast, our effort is dwarfed and, hence, the results are wanting.&nbsp; Can the Minister enlighten us on what and how much resources are set aside by MTI to take advantage of this global growth in social economy?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2308<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, EDB amended its Act to include NPOs and NGOs in its ambit, while SPRING Singapore has also become part of the inter-agency Social Economy Implementation Committee.&nbsp; That is laudable.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; due to its constitution, schemes under EDB has been mainly foreign-enterprise focused while SPRING&rsquo;s schemes are largely targeted at for-profit enterprises.&nbsp; Therefore, its spirit is willing but its flesh is weak.&nbsp;While time is needed for our Government-led agency to study the landscape, the changing academic and demographics wait for no man.&nbsp; Like any businesses, social economy enterprises may face overnight demand and credit crunches.&nbsp; Therefore, urgent measures need to be rolled out to help social economy save jobs and create community-based solutions.&nbsp; In such a tumultuous time, a clear signal needs to be sent and I urge MTI not to miss a good opportunity to help build this sector that do good and do well.</p></span></div>																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Consumer Protection and Education</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Marine Parade):</B> Sir, let me first declare my interest in speaking on this topic as the Vice-President of CASE.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In August last year, Parliament passed the Amendment Bill to the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (CPFTA).&nbsp; The Amendment Bill contains several amendments which CASE has advocated for, namely, the extension of the CPFTA to include the sale of financial products, the increase in the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal to hear claims under the CPFTA&nbsp;up to $30,000 and the extension of the cooling-off period for resale&nbsp;in the&nbsp;timeshare industry.&nbsp; There were also four sets of subsidiary legislation proposed, one of which relates to the regulation of motor vehicles dealing with the refund of deposits.&nbsp; May I ask&nbsp;MTI when would the provisions of the amended CPFTA be implemented or </p><p align=left>Column: 2309<p><p>effective?&nbsp; Similarly, when would the different sets of subsidiary legislation come into effect?&nbsp; The sooner the Amended Act and the subsidiary legislation take effect, the better it is as more protection would be accorded to consumers dealing with financial institutions and&nbsp;motor vehicle traders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, for the past few years, the Consumers' Association has received several feedback from consumers who have either parted with monies on false investment schemes, promising to pay large amounts of returns or have parted with monies to businesses, promising to resell timeshare products.&nbsp; Some of the tactics used by these businesses are tantamount to deceit and fraud, making promises to consumers which the businesses do not intend to fulfil or making promises which are not possible to fulfil.&nbsp; Some of these schemes are tantamount to&nbsp;Ponzi schemes where large numbers of consumers were deceived into parting with monetary deposits in exchange for promises of high returns.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While education may be the best way to stop people from falling into potential scams, the presence of a regulating body and legislation is equally important.&nbsp; Had there been a regulatory body in charge of such consumer frauds, then it could be possible that&nbsp;fewer consumers are conned and cheated of their monies.&nbsp; The Director of one such company currently faces prosecution by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD).&nbsp; May I urge MTI to work hand-in-hand with CAD or other relevant authorities to set up an investment fraud division to investigate such fraudulent schemes and to take prosecution action wherever justifiable.&nbsp; Any delay in taking action will result in more consumers being taken for a ride and losing their hard-earned savings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CASE would also request that MTI works with MAS to extend the scope of</p> <p align=left>Column: 2310<p><p>the MoneySENSE programme.&nbsp; We hope that MTI can fund more educational programmes to educate consumers about basic investment objectives and the risks of investment in the financial markets.&nbsp; Looking at the large numbers of consumers who have bought investment products like the Minibonds and other derivatives from the banks and other financial institutions without really understanding what these products are about and the kind of risks involved, it is of great concern.&nbsp; It also suggests that the MoneySENSE programme, or other educational programmes, can do more to reach out to the man-in-the-street to help them become more aware of investment risks.&nbsp; These programmes can reach out to more people through different avenues, such as regular radio broadcast, TV broadcast, newspapers and magazines as well as talks at Commuity Centres and Residents' Corner.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, may I ask MTI when will the Ministry consider implementing a law to regulate timeshare operators?&nbsp; I recognise that there are legitimate timeshare companies which operate genuine holiday sharing schemes.&nbsp; But there are also many operators who sell their timeshare schemes with misleading and false claims.&nbsp; They exert undue pressure on consumers and do not abide by the five-day cooling-off period.&nbsp; It takes a long while for consumers to recover their payments from the timeshare companies.&nbsp; The lack of action from the Government has prompted many other industries to use similar strategies to sell their products.&nbsp; CASE has received many complaints about high pressure selling and coercion from consumers undergoing beauty treatments, massage, slimming treatments, joining a gymnasium and&nbsp;make-over photo shoots.&nbsp; There are complaints that such high pressure selling methods are used to persuade consumers to buy a beauty or slimming package whilst they are wearing a bath towel.&nbsp; These companies which rely on such tactics&nbsp;to increase their </p><p align=left>Column: 2311<p><p>business, bring a bad reputation to the entire industry.&nbsp; Could&nbsp;MTI extend the provision on the five-day cooling-off period under the CPFTA to such industries?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, in the last three years, after the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act was introduced, the timeshare industry continues to top the CASE's complaints chart with complaint figures hovering above 200 cases per year.&nbsp; This shows that we need a new time share registration to provide our consumers with better protection.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the UK and the United States, timeshare operators are required to make clear disclosures such as the description of the accommodation, the services and amenities available.&nbsp; In Malaysia, timeshare operators are also required to issue a prospectus before they can sell such interests.&nbsp; We need a similar legislation framework here to request timeshare companies to disclose material information.&nbsp; The information should also be subjected to stringent audit checks.&nbsp; The requirements should also apply to other timeshare-related businesses as they are also involved in the scam against helpless consumers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the UK, timeshare operators are also not allowed to collect money during the cooling-off period.&nbsp; Breach of this is a criminal offence.&nbsp; In Texas of the United States, any payment made during the cooling-off period&nbsp;is to be paid into a trust or escrow&nbsp;account.&nbsp; We should introduce such regulation here as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to request MTI to extend the current cooling-off period from </p><p align=left>Column: 2312<p><p>three working days to five working days under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act.&nbsp; This is to give consumers more time to reconsider their purchase decision, particularly for timeshare as well.&nbsp; In addition, vendors should not be allowed to collect any deposit during the cooling-off period for timeshare.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Consumers' Association of Singapore also has, for many years, lobbied for the lemon law to be&nbsp;introduced in Singapore.&nbsp; In 2006, there were 1,473 complaints of defective handphones, electrical and electronic products, computers, motorcars, airconditioners, and so on and so forth. In 2008, they increased to 1,670.&nbsp; I am happy that&nbsp;MTI has already set up a task force to look into the possibility of introducing lemon law in Singapore.&nbsp; I hope that we could expedite it and would like to enquire on the progress of the review of the lemon law here and when the law can be expected to come into effect in Singapore to provide better protection for our consumers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr Lim Hng Kiang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Let me respond to the general questions on the economy and explain our strategies for the downturn, Senior Minister of State (SMS),&nbsp;Mr Iswaran, will deal with the questions on resource costs and tourism and then Minister of State (MOS), Mr&nbsp;Lee Yi Shyan, will respond on SMEs, entrepreneurship and consumer protection.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh and Mdm Ho Geok Choo asked about the global economic environment and the outlook for Singapore.&nbsp; Our GDP forecast of between -5% and -2% reflects a sober but realistic view of the economic prospects for Singapore for 2009.&nbsp; The critical uncertainty is the recovery of the G3 </p><p align=left>Column: 2313<p><p>economies, particularly the US economy.&nbsp; The higher end of our forecast range is premised on the G3 economies recovering, albeit weakly, in the second half of 2009.&nbsp; The lower end of our forecast range is based on the G3 economies not recovering until 2010.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many uncertainties in the global economy this year.&nbsp; But what is clear at this juncture are the following:&nbsp; One, the de-leveraging process will continue and credit would be tighter going forward.&nbsp; Two, the synchronised global recession would have a negative feedback loop on the financial sector.&nbsp; Three, the collapse in global demand means overcapacity in many sectors.&nbsp; This is very obvious in the auto and steel industries.&nbsp; Other sectors will face different degrees of overcapacity.&nbsp; There will, therefore, be consolidation and a shakeout.&nbsp;&nbsp;Four, the global &nbsp;imbalances have to be corrected and settled down to a new, more sustainable balance.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how do we deal with this extraordinary downturn and the expected changes in the global environment?</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first priority has been to address our companies' cash flow issues, by introducing the Jobs Credit Scheme, facilitating credit and alleviating cost pressures.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On credit, Members are already very familiar with the Special Risk-Sharing Initiative (SRI) and the other enhanced credit schemes to stimulate bank lending.&nbsp; We introduced a new Bridging Loan Programme to assist companies in their working capital needs. &nbsp;We also introduced Trade Financing Schemes to facilitate trade finance and&nbsp;export credit.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As several Members pointed out, the key is in the implementation. &nbsp;Let me assure the House that MTI agencies will</p><p align=left>Column: 2314<p><p>actively facilitate this.&nbsp; I have explained previously why it is unwise for MTI agencies to replace our banks in the credit evaluation process, but nevertheless we will work closely with the companies and the participating financial institutions to make sure that credit flows to viable businesses.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One outstanding issue is trade credit insurance.&nbsp; We have received feedback from companies that demand for trade credit insurance is growing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Exporters are now more wary of buyers' credit risks and, hence, want to get coverage to protect against the risk of buyers default.&nbsp; But insurers have also become more selective.&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the cost of insurance is rising.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To address this issue, with effect from 1st March 2009,</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

On cost alleviation, the Budget has already provided various measures to help companies manage their costs in order to stay afloat, such as the Jobs Credit Scheme, property tax rebates and rental rebates.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we should also bear in mind that many of the cost pressures we are facing have to be relieved primarily</p><p align=left>Column: 2315<p><p>through market adjustments rather than through direct handouts from the Government.&nbsp;&nbsp;Senior Minister of State, Mr&nbsp;Iswaran, will elaborate on this later.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Credit financing and cost alleviation are immediate solutions we have put in place to help companies in this downturn.&nbsp; Members, such as Mr Zaqy Mohamad, Mr Heng Chee How, Ms Jessica Tan and Mr Liang Eng Hwa, have highlighted the importance of helping our companies source for demand by identifying opportunities where they still exist today.&nbsp; Our companies also need to build up their capabilities so that they can produce products and services to meet the opportunities of tomorrow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as part of the Resilience Package, my Ministry will set aside $660 million over the next two years to assist companies to seek new markets and growth opportunities, and to build up their capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;IE Singapore, STB, SPRING and EDB will enhance their existing programmes in these areas and will also introduce a range of new initiatives.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IE Singapore will set aside $66 million to enhance its internationalisation and export-promotion activities to help companies seek new markets and growth opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;IE Singapore will launch the Exporter Development Programme to develop the export competencies of promising Singapore exporters, particularly our SMEs which have limited export experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;All in, the enhanced schemes under IE Singapore are expected to benefit almost 5,000 companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;The increased funding will allow IE Singapore to support our Trade Associations and our Chambers of Commerce to organise participation in<br>more than 340 international trade fairs and business missions, an increase of 55% from the 220 business missions that we conducted last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;These efforts will support companies to go into new or niche export markets where opportunities remain</p><p align=left>Column: 2316<p><p>despite this downturn and where the Singapore brand is highly regarded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to our strategies to building capabilities for the future, to be ready when the downturn ends.&nbsp;&nbsp;SPRING will enhance its capability development schemes under a new $200 million programme called Business Upgrading Initiatives for Long Term Development (BUILD).&nbsp; Minister of State, Mr&nbsp;Lee Yi Shyan, will elaborate on this later on.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EDB has earlier announced a $100 million programme called PREP-UP (PREParing for the UPturn). This programme will assist companies to preserve jobs and develop capabilities, particularly targeting professionals in the field of science and&nbsp;technology.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EDB will also set up a $200 million Living Lab Fund to make Singapore a "living lab" for companies and entrepreneurs to nurture new ideas, to test innovative solutions and to develop future global businesses.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have explained our strategies for the downturn to facilitate credit, to alleviate costs, to boost demand and to build capabilities. &nbsp;This is what we term as improving the "horizontals". MTI agencies will complement this approach by working with our partners at the cluster level to develop appropriate sectoral responses; in other words, addressing the "verticals".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how we organise ourselves. &nbsp;We have about 160,000 SMEs and more than 1,000 large companies. &nbsp;MTI agencies engage our companies broadly through the SBF, our Chambers of Commerce, SMA, and ASME, etc.&nbsp; We have EDCs as touch points at these organisations.&nbsp; In addition, we have about 30-odd industry and trade associations representing the different sectoral clusters. MTI agencies work with the industry associations through the LEAD programme and other projects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2317<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, I spoke of our growth strategy of developing clusters of industries, exploiting synergies across related activities.&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh asked about how this downturn has impacted manufacturing.&nbsp; Going forward, we can expect the consolidation process to affect the sectors differently.&nbsp; It will be a changed landscape. &nbsp;Some activities will lose relevance while others will become more important. &nbsp;We will need to be nimble in seeking new competitive positions.&nbsp; Let me illustrate by examining a few of our sectors.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the petrochemical sector, we are experiencing a double hit - falling demand because of the global economic recession and oversupply because of significant new capacity coming up in the Middle East.&nbsp;&nbsp;But our major projects remain very much on track.&nbsp; Shell&rsquo;s cracker plant will come on-stream in 2010 and ExxonMobil will have its Singapore Parallel Train ready in 2011.&nbsp; Other projects such as Mitsui's TAFMER plant are also scheduled to start up by 2010.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These various projects are expected to create approximately 1,000 jobs over the next few years.&nbsp; The prospects for our engineering SMEs which provide maintenance services are also very good.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the petrochemical sector, our competitive strength lies in our efficiency, our integration of the various products and processes, our use of technology and our connectivity to the rest of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to invest in the Institute of Chemical and Engineering Sciences on Jurong Island to undertake more world-class research programmes so as to develop new processes and applications that can move our petrochemical industry up the value chain.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will also support our engineering service providers, members of the Association of Process </p><p align=left>Column: 2318<p><p>Industry (ASPRI), to upgrade their capabilities in areas such as plant management, design engineering, machinery upgrading, and maintenance management, so that they can handle larger and more complex projects.&nbsp; In this way, both the big MNCs and our SMEs can leverage on each other to compete more effectively. &nbsp;I believe the business community in the petrochemical sector is quietly confident about their future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me turn to the pharmaceutical industry.&nbsp; This sector is facing key challenges from the slowing global economy. But demand for effective medicines will continue to grow because people become more affluent and people age. &nbsp;Companies want to gear up to access the expanding market opportunities in Asia, and Singapore is well positioned to tap into this. &nbsp;In fact, this sector will be increasing its hiring by bringing in 900 jobs this year, with expansions by companies such as Wyeth, Abbott, GSK Bio, Schering Plough and Perkin Elmer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eleven&nbsp;of the world's top pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have already invested in more than 25 commercial-scale manufacturing facilities in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven new plants are expected to open in Singapore in the next three years.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are confident that more will come to Singapore so that they can reach out to the Asian market more effectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should also prepare for the upturn by anchoring ourselves in new niches.&nbsp;&nbsp;Within biomedical manufacturing, we need to continue to push into areas beyond small molecule &nbsp;pharmaceuticals, such as biologics and medical technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;Biologics manufacturing is expected to be a key growth driver for Singapore&rsquo;s biomedical sciences industry.&nbsp; The global compounded annual growth rate for biologics is 13%, compared to just 0.9% for the traditional pharmaceutical market.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2319<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also continue investing in infrastructure development in Biopolis and the Tuas Biomedical Park, and in our strong scientific foundation through R&amp;D.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli Lilly is one example of a leading company which is investing more in R&amp;D despite this downturn, with their opening of the expanded Lilly Singapore Centre of Drug Discovery in October last year.&nbsp; This expansion, worth US$150 million, is slated to take place over the next five years.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also encourage more companies to explore partnerships to tap on the growth opportunities that result from synergies between our R&amp;D start-ups and mainstream firms based in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp; S*Bio, a homegrown oncology-focused drug discovery firm, recently made headlines with its partnership with Onyx&nbsp; Pharmaceuticals, pairing their complementary capabilities, intellectual properties and technologies in a winning combination.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We believe that more opportunities similar to that of S*Bio will arise during this global financial crisis.&nbsp; So in the pharmaceutical industry sector, we are facing competition from traditional areas like Puerto Rico and Ireland, and also new centres, but because our plants are new and more technologically advanced, we believe we can be competitive.<br></p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now turn to the precision engineering (PE) sector, which is probably one of the most adversely affected by this downturn.&nbsp;&nbsp;As&nbsp;Members know, the demand for precision engineered parts and components across the manufacturing industries has declined sharply.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this sector has been reinventing itself since the previous downturn and has diversified beyond electronics into medical technology, aerospace, oil and gas equipment and, more recently, clean energy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even within electronics, our PE companies have moved from producing </p><p align=left>Column: 2320<p><p>parts for high-volume consumer disk drives to focusing on parts for higher end enterprise drives and disk media production.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, given the fall in demand in all related sectors, our PE sector has to adjust in tandem.&nbsp; They have to shift their production to other sectors which are holding up better than others.&nbsp; They also have to focus on new skills in design,&nbsp;manufacturing technologies, supply chain and materials<br>processing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Already, the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are partnering our suppliers to co-design product and manufacturing processes beyond the traditional "build-to-print" model.&nbsp;&nbsp;The additional support that we have for internationalisation would enable our suppliers to develop access to new markets.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our companies can also tap on the BUILD programme to work with the Precision Engineering Centre for Innovation, that we set up in SIMTech, so as to leverage on technologies for innovation and for growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;BUILD will also help our PE companies to deepen their capabilities and become more flexible and adaptable, and position them better for the upturn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, MTI agencies are engaged with each sectoral cluster to develop the appropriate response for this downturn.&nbsp; Time does not permit me to go into detail into the other sectors.&nbsp; However, SMS Mr Iswaran will be able to cover the Tourism sector to illustrate how this complementary "vertical" approach works.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;to summarise, we recognise the tough challenges that lie ahead of us.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we are in a position of strength because we grew all our clusters and we anchored strategic capabilities here when the global economy was going strong.&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is small.&nbsp; We have no choice but to adopt an outward oriented strategy and to make the world our market.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will feel the pain of global market corrections more</p><p align=left>Column: 2321<p><p>sharply because we are small and exposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;But because we are small, we are also nimble.&nbsp; This gives us an edge over others in good years as it allows us to take advantage of opportunities when they arise.</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.00 pm</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our growth strategy in the last&nbsp;five years has served us well.&nbsp; We managed to grow strongly yet enjoy low inflation.&nbsp; I have distributed a chart comparing Singapore&rsquo;s growth and inflation record with both regional as well as advanced economies.&nbsp; It shows that we have grown faster than most economies in this region and certainly faster than any other economy with a comparable level of per capita income; while still enjoying lower inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp;While our growth has been more volatile, our average has been higher than in the other economies. This is not bad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason why our economy has contracted more sharply than others has to do with our small size, our openness and our dependence on global markets.&nbsp; Other countries that grew at a more moderate pace in the past have also entered into recession.&nbsp; Some, like Taiwan and Ireland, are expected to contract just as sharply as Singapore this year. Others whose economies do not rely on exports as much as we do have also seen similar or even steeper declines in their exports than we have.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are on the right track in pursuing strong economic growth.&nbsp; Growth has helped us to build up healthy balance sheets at the Government, corporate, and household levels.&nbsp; This has enhanced our resilience.&nbsp; Growth has helped us to build up valuable skills and capabilities in our industry sectors and in our workers.&nbsp; This has enhanced our competitiveness.&nbsp; Growth has made possible a strong </p><p align=left>Column: 2322<p><p>investment pipeline that is helping to create jobs even through this recession.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even during this downturn, we continue to think long-term.&nbsp; Over the long term, the Asian growth story is still intact.&nbsp; Asia is in a position to experience rapid recovery once the global economic situation improves.&nbsp; Therefore, we must not lose the capacity, the capabilities and the skills that we have built up over the years.&nbsp; This is why preserving jobs and keeping companies afloat are so important.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to engage our companies and industry associations on a sectoral basis to tailor to the specific needs of each sector.&nbsp; Policies and measures will be reviewed and adjusted to meet new changes and challenges.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world will eventually settle into a new balance, and we must be ready to capture the new opportunities that surface with the tides of change.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Chairman, let me now address a couple of the specific issues raised by Members.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim asked whether the US-Singapore FTA has delivered the expected benefits to Singapore.&nbsp; Let me explain the changing nature of trade between Singapore and the US.&nbsp; Part of the reason why the trade deficit has grown over the years is because a large proportion of goods from Singapore is not exported directly to the US but through China.&nbsp; Because we have gone up the value chain, we are exporting the more value-added components to China; China finishes up the product and sends it to the US.&nbsp; So the trade is still growing but is not reflected in our trade statistics.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Traditionally, we have had a deficit in services but, over the years, I think the deficit has grown smaller because Singapore is also becoming more competitive in services.&nbsp; What has benefited us particularly with the US-</p><p align=left>Column: 2323<p><p>Singapore FTA is foreign direct investments.&nbsp; The foreign direct investments (FDI) stock from the US has increased from S$37 billion as at end 2003 to S$49 billion as at end 2007.&nbsp; So the FTA has encouraged many more US companies to invest and to re-invest in Singapore.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Heng Chee How raised a concern about protectionism, I think this is something that we are very concerned about.&nbsp; Our FTAs with our partners allow us to keep this issue alive.&nbsp; At the various forums, whether within ASEAN, APEC or WTO, we will continue to raise the voice against protectionism.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh asked about how we can engage with our companies and suggested the formation of a Corporate Rescue Task Force.&nbsp; As I mentioned just now, we are engaged very effectively with the companies at all levels.&nbsp; I mentioned that we have about 30-odd industry and trade associations.&nbsp; Each association has about 300 to 400 members.&nbsp; So we are plugged in with all the key members in every sector, and we know the status and the situation in all the clusters.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked about how we can anchor more local companies to complement our MNCs.&nbsp; I think this is what we have done effectively.&nbsp; As I mentioned, the petrochemical, with the MNCs, but our ASPRI members are SMEs and they are working very effectively.&nbsp; Similarly with the pharmaceutical and precision engineering industries.&nbsp; Another example is our Marine and Offshore Engineering industry, where in fact the 'queen bees' are our local shipyard companies, Keppel and SembCorp Marine, and supporting them are some 500 local SMEs with various capabilities.&nbsp; So we have taken a cluster approach rather than a divide between MNCs and local SMEs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I may borrow Deng Xiaopeng&rsquo;s observation, that "it doesn&rsquo;t really matter</p><p align=left>Column: 2324<p><p>if it&rsquo;s a black cat or a white cat".&nbsp; So, similarly for us, we look at a company and assess its value-add, its ability to generate jobs, its commitment to Singapore and its contribution to our economy.&nbsp; It does not really matter if it is an overseas MNC, an overseas SME or a local company.&nbsp; Of course, if it is a local company, we are even more cheered by the prospects of helping our own companies.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let me turn to ask Senior Minister of State Iswaran to continue on resource costs and on tourism.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr S Iswaran)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>The Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr S Iswaran):</B> I will supplement the Minister's response by addressing some specific questions raised by Members which pertain to three broad issues&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;managing resource costs, boosting demand and building capabilities for the future.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Managing the cost of resources is an important concern for businesses, especially so in a recession.&nbsp; Let me start with the cost of energy, which Mr Heng Chee How has raised.&nbsp; As we import virtually all our energy supplies, Singapore is vulnerable to volatility in global energy prices.&nbsp; Competition in our power sector has been a bulwark against rising energy prices.&nbsp; Competition motivates efficiency and exerts downward pressure on prices.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our experience since 2001 when we began to liberalise the electricity market, vindicates this approach. While fuel oil prices have risen by 143%, tariffs have risen by only about 15%.&nbsp; More recently, household electricity tariffs fell by 25% in the first quarter of 2009 after peaking in the last quarter of last year.&nbsp; We can expect a further reduction in April for the second quarter, in tandem with global fuel oil prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EMA will continue to study measures to inject more competition into the </p><p align=left>Column: 2325<p><p>market.&nbsp; One example is the Electricity Vending System (EVS) which would allow households to purchase electricity direct from competing providers.&nbsp; EMA has commenced a pilot of the system which, if successful, will lead to its eventual implementation on a national scale.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the interim, EMA is considering other steps to bring more benefits of competition to small consumers and households.&nbsp; One idea is for the power generation companies to bid for a portion of the domestic electricity load on a competitive basis.&nbsp; EMA expects to complete a detailed study of this proposal by the end of the year.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In October last year, I informed the House of EMA&rsquo;s plan to review the formula for setting household electricity tariffs.&nbsp; The current formula has served us well over the years by providing relative certainty and stability in an era of less volatile oil prices.&nbsp; The aim of the review was to enhance the formula given the greater volatility in global energy prices in recent times.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At present, fuel oil prices in the first month of the previous quarter are used to set the electricity tariff for the current quarter.&nbsp; Going forward, EMA intends to revise the formula by using the average of fuel oil prices in the preceding&nbsp;three months, to determine the tariff for the current quarter.&nbsp; For example, the new formula would have used average fuel oil price from October to December last year, rather than just October, to set the tariff for the first quarter of 2009.&nbsp; This change will entail material adjustments to the hedging operations and processes of industry players.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new approach has two advantages.&nbsp; First, it will help to reduce the volatility of the electricity tariff by averaging fuel oil prices over a longer</p> <p align=left>Column: 2326<p><p>period.&nbsp; Second, with a three-month average, more recent fuel oil price data will be used to determine the tariff.&nbsp; This will allow the tariff to be more reflective of the prevailing market prices of fuel.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EMA will use the revised formula to set the electricity prices for the third quarter of 2009 and beyond, after consulting key stakeholders and industry players.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will now move on to land-related costs.&nbsp; Several Members, including Mr Heng&nbsp;Chee How and Mr Seah Kian Peng, have asked the Government to ensure that the savings from the 40% property tax rebate are passed on to current tenants.&nbsp; Some private-sector landlords like CapitaLand, Lend Lease, Mapletree, City Developments and Frasers Centrepoint have committed to pass on the property tax rebate in full or in part to their tenants.&nbsp; This will exert competitive pressure in the market and I urge more landlords to follow their good example.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Government has taken the lead by providing a 15% rental rebate for HDB, JTC and SLA tenants.&nbsp; Mdm Ho Geok Choo asked if the Government can double the rental rebates to 30%.&nbsp; Mr Chairman, a 15% rental rebate is, in fact, quite significant.&nbsp; It is more than&nbsp;three times what other lessees and tenants would enjoy, even with a full passing through of the property tax rebate.&nbsp; This 15% rebate will provide savings of over $300 million to some 31,000 companies in 2009.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the rebates given by the Government, businesses are likely to obtain additional relief as rentals ease from their peak in the past one to two quarters.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ahmad Mohd Magad has suggested that JTC revive the construction of Ready Built Facilities (RBF).&nbsp; The private sector is actually quite well equipped to provide multi-user space, including RBF. About</p><p align=left>Column: 2327<p><p>80% of all&nbsp;new multi-user space is provided by a diverse group of players.&nbsp; They provide generic factory spaces of varying sizes in different localities and at competitive price points.&nbsp; Market projections indicate that the multi-user space to be released over the next two years will be more than adequate to meet the net increase in demand.&nbsp; JTC will continue to monitor this closely to ensure that there is sufficient supply, which is, I think, Dr Ahmad Magad&rsquo;s concern.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to assure Mr Inderjit Singh that JTC regularly reviews and benchmarks our industrial land costs against locations that compete with us.&nbsp; We stressed that our value proposition here is not just premised on cheap rental, but on the overall total system, cost and value.&nbsp; As a principle, JTC aims to lag the market for upward revisions and lead the market for downward adjustments.&nbsp; In fact, JTC proactively reduced its posted rents and prices by 5% to 10% in January this year.&nbsp; Combined with the rental rebates, all except 0.1% of JTC&rsquo;s tenants, who are on very short-term tenancy agreements, will benefit from the lower rents in 2009.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh and Mr Seah Kian Peng asked if JTC could relax the rule that allows JTC lessees to sub-let only up to 50% of their built-up space.&nbsp; First to clarify, this is not a new rule as Mr Inderjit Singh said.&nbsp; In fact, in 2003, this rule is already pre-existing and JTC relaxed this policy and allowed lessees to sub-let their entire gross floor area (GFA) as a short-term measure to assist companies in financial difficulties because of the economic downturn.&nbsp; The policy was then reinstated in September 2008.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the rationale for the policy&nbsp;is self-evident.&nbsp; Mr Inderjit Singh identifies with it.&nbsp; JTC has to ensure that our limited industrial land is allocated and optimised to support our economy and its key industries.&nbsp; This is why majority-owner occupation must be the norm.&nbsp; At the </p><p align=left>Column: 2328<p>same time, we want to give companies some flexibility: first, to put to productive use vacant space that may occasionally come about; and second, to facilitate co-location of related business activities where it makes economic sense.&nbsp; A 50% sub-letting cap enables JTC to achieve these twin objectives in a balanced manner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I agree with Mr Singh and Mr Seah that in the current exceptional operating environment, the strain on a company&rsquo;s cash flow will be exacerbated if it is unable to sub-let any unutilised space.&nbsp; For this reason, JTC will temporarily lift the 50% sub-letting cap until 31st December 2011 as a relief measure to help businesses ride out the current downturn.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Heng and other Members have highlighted the problems posed by the sudden fall in global demand.&nbsp; I would&nbsp;like to use the tourism industry to illustrate how Government agencies will partner the private sector to seek opportunities to boost demand where possible, a vertical approach which Minister talked about.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2009, the global tourism industry faces a difficult year.&nbsp; For Singapore, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) forecasts&nbsp;total visitor arrivals to be in the range of &nbsp;$9-$9.5 million,&nbsp;a year-on-year decline of 6%-11%.&nbsp; The total tourism receipts generated are also expected to fall to a range of&nbsp; $12-$12.5&nbsp;billion in 2009, that is around a 15%-18% decline.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, our tourism industry approaches this&nbsp;challenging period from a relative position of strength.&nbsp; Tourism projects secured in recent years will generate an estimated 3,000 new jobs this year.&nbsp; This is on top of the 9,000 jobs from the IRs in 2009, building up to 20,000 when the two IRs are completed.&nbsp; Our successful hosting of the world's first</p><p align=left>Column: 2329<p><p>Formula One (F1) night race has captured the attention of the world and the international media with more than 110 million television viewers worldwide.&nbsp;&nbsp;The event also drew more than 40,000 overseas visitors and generated $168 million in incremental tourism receipts, which exceeded our initial estimate of&nbsp; $100 million.&nbsp; As expected, hotels across all tiers benefited substantially in terms of revenue per available room during the F1 race weekend.&nbsp; I would like to inform Mr Heng that the review for the plans for 2009, including the levy, is in its final stages and it will take into account this year's tourism outlook.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To secure demand for our tourism sector in the immediate to short term, and to build capabilities to capture the growth opportunities in the upturn, STB will roll out in a $90 million initiative.&nbsp;&nbsp;The acronym is BOOST which stands for Building On Opportunities to Strengthen Tourism.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the near term, STB will partner stakeholders in a targeted marketing campaign with the theme "2009 Reasons to Enjoy Singapore" - which is a key initiative under BOOST.&nbsp; Travel patterns are expected to change in the current climate with a&nbsp;switch from long-haul to short-haul trips.&nbsp; The campaign will target this potential higher intra-regional traffic from our key regional markets.&nbsp; STB will also reach out to our resident population as a complementary strategy to generate additional demands for our tourism sector.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STB will also increase its support to strengthen bids to attract events to Singapore over the next two years.&nbsp; This will generate demand and yield spin-offs for the wider tourism sector, including our hotels and F&amp;B businesses.&nbsp; STB will leverage on Singapore's reputation as a global business centre to target Meeting, Incentive, Convention and Exhibition</p><p align=left>Column: 2330<p><p>(MICE) events that are aligned to Singapore's economic priorities, such as digital media and environmental technology.&nbsp; Some examples include the Anime Festival Asia and the inaugural Clean Energy Expo Asia which are expected to attract more than 11,000 visitors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me also elaborate how we&nbsp;intend to build our capacity and capabilities in the tourism sector -&nbsp;in terms of human capital, infrastructure, new growth areas, and R&amp;D.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of BOOST, STB will complement SPUR by providing more support for businesses to train and upgrade the skill of their employees under the TIP-iT Scheme which already exists.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STB also strives to foster a business culture in the tourism sector that prioritises service quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Low Thia Khiang raised a question on dishonest retail shops.&nbsp; This, I agree, can tarnish the image of Singapore and undermine visitors' confidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;STB works closely with CASE to address such issues.&nbsp; In the first instance, STB takes a preventive approach to warn tourists against such retailers by publishing a list of errant retailers on STB's website and other marketing material.&nbsp; Now, inevitably, some tourists will still fall prey to such errant retailers and STB investigates such complaints thoroughly and will also mediate on behalf of the tourist for refunds or exchanges and, if necessary, represent them at the Small Claims Tribunal.&nbsp; But I think if we can prevent it, it is far better.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STB also aims to rejuvenate our existing tourism infrastructure to enhance Singapore's attractiveness.&nbsp; Mr Low raised an example of Chinatown which highlights the balance that STB has to strike in developing tourism precincts&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;meeting the development and economic objectives on the one hand without losing the charm and character, and I suppose the inherent</p><p align=left>Column: 2331<p><p>"messiness" of the place which many tourists and locals find quite attractive.&nbsp; STB actively engages key stakeholders in these precincts, both on the development of the infrastructure and also on the softer aspects like activities, to try and preserve that balance and keep it lively.&nbsp; In the case of Chinatown, they work closely with the Kreta Ayer Kim Seng Citizens Consultative Committee, and the celebrations they have for Chinese New Year is a good example of how this collaboration can be very successful.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the IRs and Gardens by the Bay, there are also plans to develop new tourism projects to augment&nbsp;our infrastructure over the next two to three years.&nbsp; The new&nbsp;International Cruise Terminal will allow Singapore to tap opportunities in the&nbsp;Asia-Pacific region to grow our cruise&nbsp;sector.&nbsp; Wildlife&nbsp;Reserves Singapore will also be announcing a first-of-its-kind attraction in the Mandai precinct, which will re-create river habitats from around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will complement the existing attractions and strengthen the draw of Mandai as a destination for families.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Ms Jessica Tan has mentioned, we do need to build our capacity in new areas to support the future growth of Singapore's economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Edwin Khew&nbsp;has also enquired about our medium to long term plans to grow Singapore into a global CleanTech centre.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp;Mr Khew noted, many countries have moved progressively into the CleanTech space, and this will mean greater competition in our bid to attract&nbsp;globally mobile CleanTech investments to&nbsp;Singapore.&nbsp; At the same time, the increased global focus on environmental sustainability will create an even larger market share which we can access.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is well-positioned to be a global leader in the CleanTech space.&nbsp; We are already recognised as a leader in the </p><p align=left>Column: 2332<p><p>environment and water sectors.&nbsp; Our experienced and skilled manpower from existing clusters, particularly in electronics and precision engineering, have enabled Singapore to venture successfully into the clean energy space.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have already attracted&nbsp;significant investments from major players like REC and Vestas.&nbsp; In addition, homegrown companies are also riding the CleanTech wave.&nbsp; One example is Alpha Biofuels.&nbsp; Formed by three entrepreneurs, Alpha Biofuels collects and converts waste vegetable oil into biodiesel.&nbsp; Since its formation in 2004, it has grown significantly and now partners more&nbsp;than 100 establishments&nbsp;to convert their waste cooking oil into biodiesel.&nbsp; Despite the current downturn, Alpha Biofuels has recently moved from their research facility in ITE College East into a bigger factory at Tanjong Penjuru and has plans to expand beyond its current three retail outlets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to assure Mr Khew that Government takes a long-term view of the clean energy sector.&nbsp; We have set ourselves an ambitious target to grow this sector to a $1.7 billion industry in Singapore by 2015.&nbsp; Our plan for the clean energy sector has three thrusts:&nbsp; First, to develop a cluster of strong local and foreign companies; second, to build strong technological and manpower capabilities; and third, to help Singapore based companies internationalise.&nbsp; In line with this, the Government will continue to invest heavily in R&amp;D and test-bedding to better position Singapore to capture the enhanced business opportunities that will arise with technological progress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our strategies will evolve in tandem with the competition from around the world in this space.&nbsp; First, we will ensure our regulatory regime keeps pace with developments.&nbsp; This will ensure that new technologies can be easily integrated into our energy ecosystem.&nbsp; Second, we will position Singapore as a&nbsp;"living laboratory"</p><p align=left>Column: 2333<p><p>for test-bedding CleanTech-based solutions applicable to urban settings.&nbsp; EDB will collaborate with Government agencies to develop platforms that the private sector can use to test-bed cutting-edge urban solutions.&nbsp; Solar test-bedding, which Mr Khew mentioned, is one such example and once proven feasible in Singapore's context, these solutions can be replicated on a commercial scale and exported to other cities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> Mr&nbsp;Chairman, I have highlighted some of the efforts we are undertaking with some key verticals and we are confident that our measures, which are targeted at these&nbsp;very specific sectors and their needs, will help our&nbsp;businesses manage both the immediate challenges and also position them well for the eventual upturn when it comes.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yi Shyan)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

MTI remains firmly committed to helping our SMEs now and in future.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More so than in other countries, our SMEs are closely connected to the global economy.&nbsp; Many of our SMEs play an important role in our key manufacturing clusters like electronics, petrochemicals and precision engineering, supporting larger companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many export to overseas markets and some of them have grown to become small multinationals themselves with operations in the region and beyond.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a doubt, the slowdown is affecting many of our SMEs.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the manufacturing sector, many SME suppliers have seen sharp reductions in their order books.&nbsp; In the services sector, lower tourist arrivals and consumer spending</p> <p align=left>Column: 2334<p><p>mean slower businesses for hospitality, retail and the F&amp;B business. Operating in an open economy like ours, our SMEs have not been immune to the severe shifts in the global market conditions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh and Mdm Ho Geok Choo have asked what the Government would do to help our SMEs to ride out this crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do so through an enhanced SME strategy comprising four pillars. One, alleviate costs and facilitate credit;&nbsp;two, support internationalisation; three, develop capabilities and service excellence; and four, support entrepreneurship. Let me elaborate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget contains many measures that assist all companies, including SMEs, in managing costs and accessing finance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the area of managing costs, businesses will enjoy as much as $840 million in savings on property and transport related costs through the tax rebates announced. &nbsp;For companies that take advantage of the downturn to make capital investments in areas such as renovation and refurbishment, they will get accelerated write-downs.&nbsp; Most importantly, companies that retain their employees will get substantial relief in their wage costs through the Jobs Credit Scheme. &nbsp;For an SME employing&nbsp;10 workers, this translates to potential savings of as much as $36,000 a year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Budget also contains enhanced measures to facilitate business financing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me emphasise that the main beneficiaries will be SMEs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Seah Kian Peng has asked how SPRING will make known the availability of these credit schemes to SMEs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since December 2008 SPRING has conducted 14 financial seminars and briefings to date, reaching out to nearly 2,000 participants.&nbsp; Members would have noticed too, SPRING&rsquo;s advertisements in our local media publicising the many enhanced loan programmes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2335<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Penny Low has expressed concerns with the processing of loan applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure efficient implementation, SPRING helps SMEs in two ways.&nbsp; First, it refers unsuccessful applicants to other participating financial institutions.&nbsp; Second, SPRING makes available experienced financial advisers to advise SMEs on writing up their loan applications and even on alternative financing options and this is for free.&nbsp; Since the launch of this Financial Facilitator Programme (FFP), 285 enquiries have been handled.&nbsp; Of course, I should add that these advisory initiatives are in addition to the many relationship managers from the 14 participating financial institutions, meeting SMEs daily on the ground.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the role of Government can only be facilitative.&nbsp; Miss Penny Low is right that civil servants do not have the experience or the expertise to assess credit worthiness.&nbsp; Government officers seek to supplement, but not supplant the role of bank credit officers in loan credit assessments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must add, however, that even in this global economic downturn and with declining demand, there remain opportunities for SMEs, so long as they are quick to adapt and able to seize new opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;IE Singapore&nbsp;hopes to work through industry and trade associations to help SMEs from different industries to penetrate existing markets and tap new ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has suggested that IE Singapore do more for SMEs which want to export and internationalise.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, as a matter of fact, of the 35,000 companies supported by IE Singapore last year through its broad-based programmes, more than 80% were SMEs.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As highlighted by Minister Lim, IE Singapore will introduce the Export&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2336<p><p>Development Programme (EDP) to develop export competency of first-timer exporters, especially the SMEs.&nbsp; In addition, IE will be increasing the number of trade missions by more than 55% to 340, benefiting some 5,000 companies.&nbsp; It will step up its efforts to help companies secure trade credit insurance. &nbsp;In particular, IE will subsidise 50 per cent of insurance premiums for SMEs under its new Export Coverage Scheme (ECS) that facilitates access to trade credit.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ECS is expected to benefit 1,000 Singapore based companies and cover up to $4 billion worth of trade insured.&nbsp; As such, addressing Miss&nbsp;Penny Low&rsquo;s query, we have indeed expanded our efforts in helping export-oriented SMEs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, let me re-emphasise the need for SMEs to build new capability and capacity even in this period of downturn. This is, in our view, the best way to stay afloat and plan ahead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPRING offers a comprehensive range of capability development programmes, ranging from IT upgrading to design, branding and business management systems, process re-engineering and product development. &nbsp;Over the past year, these programmes have helped some 2,600 businesses to upgrade their capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many have become leaner and stronger.&nbsp;&nbsp;Others managed to increase sales with more effective design and branding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider Tungsan Food Industries, a local manufacturer of sauces.&nbsp;&nbsp;With SPRING&rsquo;s support, it has automated its sauce production process and increased production capacity by 150 per cent.&nbsp;&nbsp;The improved operational efficiency has enabled Tungsan Food Industries to sell more at a lower cost per unit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help our SMEs stay focused on the long-term capability building, SPRING will</p><p align=left>Column: 2337<p><p>launch a new $200 million Business Upgrading Initiatives for Long-Term Development (BUILD) programme as mentioned by Minister Lim.&nbsp;&nbsp;BUILD has two important components.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For individual SMEs, SPRING will increase funding support from 50% to 70% under its capability development programmes.&nbsp; For example, with support from SPRING, Nanyang Optical has built up a strong in-house product development capability.&nbsp; As a result, it will be rolling out a new series of mid-range eyewear targeted at trendy and yet budget-conscious consumers.&nbsp; With increased funding levels under BUILD, SPRING hopes to help other SMEs to continue to upgrade their capabilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For industry-level projects, SPRING will raise funding support from 70 per cent to 80 per cent under the Local Enterprise and Association Development or LEAD programme.&nbsp; Several of our industry associations have been pro-active in responding to this crisis.&nbsp; For instance, the Singapore Furniture Industries Council (SFIC) launched the $1 million Member Assistance Scheme (MAS), which helps eligible members lower business costs and strengthen business capabilities.&nbsp; The funding can also be used to support missions to explore new business opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree with Mr Heng Chee How that agencies and industry associations must work together for collective competitiveness.&nbsp; This enhancement to LEAD will allow associations to provide more customised services to their members.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, a large number of our SMEs are in the services industry.&nbsp; The productivity of the service workers, their inclination and ability to serve with excellence, will have a direct impact on Singapore&rsquo;s aspiration to be an</p><p align=left>Column: 2338<p><p>international hub for business and tourism. &nbsp;In fact, as we prepare to welcome several world-class events, such as the F1, APEC meetings and the inaugural Youth Olympic Games, the task of raising our service sector productivity has become even more urgent.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that we are up to the challenge, SPRING, STB and WDA, NTUC and ISES (Institute of Service Excellence) of SMU (Singapore Management University) recently launched a $100 million GEMS-Plus programme to raise the service standard of our industries in some very fundamental ways.&nbsp; The agencies hope that through the funding, applied in three areas; namely, research on service standards and methodologies; two, capability development and adoption of best practices; and three, promotion and recognition of role models, would raise the service standard of our workers, and the productivity of our service firms to new and international levels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chairman, Mr Inderjit Singh, Miss Penny Low and Mdm Ho Geok Choo have spoken on the importance of entrepreneurship even in this period of downturn.&nbsp; I agree wholeheartedly with them.&nbsp; Start-ups bring renewal and dynamism to our economy, and are the seeds of tomorrow&rsquo;s large enterprises.&nbsp; Our efforts to promote entrepreneurship will not waver even in the downturn.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE) is an important initiative in driving entrepreneurship.&nbsp; Over the years, ACE has reached out to 32,000 aspiring entrepreneurs.&nbsp; Together with other entrepreneurship groupings, ACE has created a strong fraternity, promoting a pro-enterprise culture and the sharing of best practices amongst them. &nbsp;More educated and young Singaporeans are now willing to consider entrepreneurial undertaking as so-called "career choices". &nbsp;Our recent survey suggests that 65% of startups&rsquo; founders are below 40</p><p align=left>Column: 2339<p><p>years old.&nbsp; And more than one-third of our start-ups are<br>started by graduates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have created a conducive environment for start-ups.&nbsp; Our smaller companies and start-ups already enjoy the world&rsquo;s lowest effective tax rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes less than 15 minutes and $300 to register a company in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has been ranked by the World Bank as the world&rsquo;s easiest place to do business for three years running.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we are not contented.&nbsp; Recognising that start-ups too will be affected by this crisis, we have recently enhanced our support in three ways:&nbsp; Providing working capital and equity; encouraging further investments in innovation; providing greater opportunities for student entrepreneurs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current economic climate, start-ups, like all enterprises, may be vulnerable to cash flow problems.&nbsp; Our Government loan schemes, especially the enhanced $100,000 micro-loan programme, will provide loan assistance to all small enterprises, including start-ups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognising that equity capital may also be affected, SPRING recently enhanced the Start-up Enterprise Development Scheme, or SEEDS, in three ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding ratio is now increased from 1:1 to 2:1.&nbsp; We would also allow follow-on funding after the initial investment.&nbsp; The funding cap has also been raised from $500,000 to $1 million per start-up.&nbsp;&nbsp;These enhancements will be available to both new and existing start-ups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond increasing funding options for start-ups, we are also helping nascent start-ups to commercialise their ideas. &nbsp;The Technology Enterprise Commercialisation Scheme (TECS) launched last year provides $50 million to help start-ups create their first prototypes for market trials and acceptance. &nbsp;So far, SPRING has supported 17 such technology </p><p align=left>Column: 2340<p><p>projects, providing up to $500,000 for each start-up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognising that the spirit of enterprise has to be inculcated from young, SPRING introduced The Young Entrepreneur Scheme or YES! in October last year, providing $4.5 million of funding to help schools develop entrepreneurship learning contents.&nbsp; Under YES!, we would also fund student ventures with a 4:1 matching ratio.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example of a recent YES! start-up is Slow Loris, a manufacturer of designer bags catering to the increasingly environmentally conscious commuter.&nbsp; A recent graduate of the Singapore Management University (SMU), Miss Sarah Yip chanced upon the opportunity when she observed cyclists in Europe sporting stylish messenger bags as a lifestyle accessory.&nbsp; Such an ability to smell business opportunities and to convert an idea into a commercial proposition is what we would like to see more of amongst our youth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now turn to issues related to consumer protection raised by the Members.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Lim Biow Chuan asked for an update on the amendments to the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (CPFTA).&nbsp; The CPFTA Amendment Bill was passed in Parliament in August last year. Since then, we have been working with agencies and stakeholders to finalise the supporting regulations, taking into account feedback received during the public consultation exercise.&nbsp; The finalised regulations will be published later this month and will come into operation thereafter in April.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim also recommended that an Investment Fraud Division be set up to deal with fraudulent investment schemes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) of the Singapore Police Force</p><p align=left>Column: 2341<p><p>already has the responsibility and power to deal with such scams.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim suggested that the MoneySENSE programme to deliver financial education be extended to more people through different avenues. &nbsp;MoneySENSE already does this.&nbsp; Besides the various channels mentioned by my Minister in his reply to Ms Penny Low last Thursday, MoneySENSE also partners with the media to arrange print and broadcast programmes.&nbsp; For instance, it had arranged radio programmes which have a total listener-ship exceeding one million.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Mr Lim and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang suggested introducing laws to regulate the timeshare industry. Based on the feedback from CASE, we are strengthening the CPFTA to give consumers even stronger protection with respect to timeshare contracts.&nbsp;&nbsp;The cooling-off period will be extended from three to five days, and will extend to businesses that claim to help consumers resell their rights under timeshare contracts.&nbsp; We are also stipulating a 60-day refund period for contracts that are cancelled within the cooling-off period.&nbsp; The Police will also investigate if there are allegations of cheating or other criminal<br>offences.&nbsp; We should let these new measures take effect and re-assess the needs for further tightening from there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also reiterate the fundamental pillar of our consumer protection framework, which is one based on caveat emptor, free market principles in the provision of goods and services, and the sanctity of contracts.&nbsp; The best protection for consumers is still founded on their ability to discern the best deals for themselves, being vigilant to any unrealistic promises and to walk away from pressure selling with bath towel or otherwise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2342<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim proposed to extend the cooling-off period to the beauty industry and related industries as well. Before introducing legislation to protect consumers against a particular industry, we will consider whether consumers need protection because (1) the product or service is complex and beyond the reasonable understanding of consumers, (2) the method of selling is complex, or&nbsp;(3) existing provisions are inadequate to protect the customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of beauty-related products and services, many of the complaints are related to high pressure selling.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumers victimised by high pressure selling already have clear recourse under the CPFTA against such unfair practices.&nbsp; Members of this committee would probably also agree that facial products and slimming treatments are neither complex nor hard to understand.&nbsp; Patrons of beauty-related industries would probably be better off if they develop a heightened sense of vigilance and self-defence, which would serve them well both shopping here and overseas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also noted the increased number of complaints in the beauty care industry, but the numbers are still much smaller than the time-share industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is despite the fact that the beauty care industry is much larger and does not have a mandatory cooling-off period, unlike the timeshare industry.&nbsp; Thus, we believe that consumer education and industry-led accreditation are still the best way forward. &nbsp;In any<br>event, consumers victimised in high pressure selling already have clear recourse under the CPFTA against such unfair practices.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Mr Yeo asked about the progress of the Lemon Law Taskforce.&nbsp; The Taskforce, co-chaired by CASE and MTI, and comprising representatives from the industries, has been deliberating on the issue. The Taskforce is nearing </p><p align=left>Column: 2343<p><p>completion of its work and formal recommendations will be made shortly.</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Sir, I would like to ask whether&nbsp;this&nbsp;is&nbsp;the Minister and the Ministry's view about all the requests that the MPs have been making.&nbsp; I am, in fact, disappointed that this came from the Chairman of SPRING who should be more sympathetic towards SMEs.&nbsp; His comments belittled the issues taken up by the Members of Parliament who have real concerns for SMEs and want to help solve&nbsp;liquidity problems.&nbsp; I wish that the SPRING Chairman was a bit more sympathetic.&nbsp;

One is, of course, domestic </p><p align=left>Column: 2344<p><p>exports where it is obviously in our interest to be able to sell as much as we produce and to sell more.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second part is&nbsp;re-exports, and this is a very important part of our role as a trading nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you look at our statistics and it shows that our trade is more than three times of our GDP, you must see it in this context&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a big proportion of it&nbsp;is&nbsp;re-export.&nbsp; We do not see this big ratio as a disadvantage.&nbsp; In fact, we see this as a very big advantage of Singapore.&nbsp; In the world trading forums, Singapore&nbsp;clearly is seen as punching above its weight.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that a small country with 4.5 million people is ranked somewhere&nbsp;between 12th and 15th in the world trading league is really something to our credit.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Liang Eng Hwa--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Three of our major gencos are now under foreign ownership and they have paid a significant price&nbsp;for the assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Senior Minister of State whether&nbsp;there are sufficient safeguards to ensure that our utility rates for both&nbsp;households as well as&nbsp;businesses remain competitive or even more competitive?&nbsp; And how do we ensure that these foreign gencos will continue to invest in long-term capabilities?</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr S Iswaran--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr S Iswaran:</B> Sir, I thank the Member for the question.&nbsp; I think, first and foremost, we have to recognise that the companies which invest in power generation are undertaking very substantial capital expenditure.&nbsp; These run into billions of dollars and, therefore, it is evidently and clearly in their vested interest to ensure that,&nbsp;one, they invest and continue to invest in technology and capability that keep them abreast of the competition, and&nbsp;two, they do not end up pricing themselves out, if there are multiple players in the market and the competitive tension is sufficient.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2345<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, our objective in the overall management of the electricity sector, has been to ensure that we have as many players as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;EMA is on record, saying that when there are&nbsp;applications for new planting, they will be considered and be quite generous about it.&nbsp; I think the important thing, then, is to make sure that we create a level playing field where all players feel they can come in.&nbsp; There are no unfair barriers to entry, and once we have that capability, then, that together with the inherent competitive tension within the market, will take care of the concerns that the Member has raised&nbsp;&ndash; whether it is in terms of investment to maintain the capability of your infrastructure or in terms of pricing&nbsp;to ensure that it is fair and reasonable to households as well as businesses.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Seah Kian Peng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Likewise, what about the time taken to process the applications?&nbsp; I think these benchmarks are important.&nbsp; These KPIs are important because I believe that it will set the right framework which our public officers would embrace, adopt and, more importantly, ensure that the intended objectives of these various financial schemes are met.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to ask the Minister on the issue of cost of living and&nbsp;cost of doing business.&nbsp; Annually, there is&nbsp;a Cost of Living survey done by Mercer.&nbsp; It ranked Singapore as the 13th most expensive city in the world for 2008.&nbsp; In fact, it got worse, we were 14th and&nbsp;now, 13th.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask&nbsp;if the Ministry should set&nbsp;a target for us to get out of this top 20 most expensive cities survey by&nbsp;a certain timeline?&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Lim Hng Kiang:</B> Mr Chairman, let me assure the House that SPRING's role in facilitating credit applications is, as&nbsp;I have mentioned, they will take all efforts to make sure that viable and deserving businesses have access to the credit.&nbsp;&nbsp;The way they go about it is to work closely with&nbsp;the companies and&nbsp;the participating financial institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are&nbsp;tracking the status.&nbsp; SPRING follows up when an applicant is&nbsp;not able to get approval from the bank,&nbsp;so that&nbsp;they try and understand&nbsp;from the credit officer, reasons for the rejection.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPRING also facilitates the company to redirect the application to other banks.&nbsp; Sometimes, the bank does not grant the loan because&nbsp;banks adopt a portfolio approach towards bank loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a loan is within a certain sector that has reached the ceiling for that portfolio, then, the bank may not extend additional loans in that sector.&nbsp; But other banks may be underweighted in that sector and&nbsp;portfolio and, therefore, may be prepared to grant loans for that particular sector.&nbsp; So SPRING does this facilitation.&nbsp; SPRING also,&nbsp;as&nbsp;Minister of State Mr Lee Yi Shyan&nbsp;explained, provides assistance in the application process by tutoring and helping the companies&nbsp;to fill up&nbsp;the forms and put up its best case for the companies.&nbsp; So, we do not have a specific target but, clearly, the objective for SPRING is to facilitate and, I think, the senior management and the officers down the line, know their roles.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the cost of living in Singapore, I think this is a very complicated subject.&nbsp; I understand Mercer monitors this and does this assessment but, perhaps, it is targeted&nbsp;at expatriates living in Singapore.&nbsp; And in recent years, of course, the index has gone up because of cost of rental.&nbsp; But, as you know, this is just a cyclical phenomenon.&nbsp; I believe, some years ago, we were ranked probably number 30-something in the Mercer's survey.&nbsp; Many</p><p align=left>Column: 2347<p><p>agencies&nbsp;in Government watch this carefully.&nbsp; And we want to make sure that, for Singapore to succeed as a global city, we have to have an attractive environment but at the same time, we should not be expensive environment.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Yeo Guat Kwang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

That the total sum to be allocated for Head L of the Estimates be reduced by $100.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government has previously made development and environmental sustainability a priority.&nbsp; Could the Minister comment if, in this economically uncertain times, sustainable development and environmental sustainability remain as relevant priorities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am concerned that during this downturn, business owners may be less inclined to devote resources towards developing and improving environmentally initiatives, but may, instead, decide to concentrate their efforts on the core of their businesses.&nbsp; In many cases, this may actually be the right approach to save their businesses and to preserve jobs, but the health of the environment should not depend on the recovery of the economy and it is something that we must look at in good times, as well as&nbsp;in bad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could the Minister tell us if his Ministry will consider extending financial support to businesses and, perhaps, even individuals to improve their resource</p> <p align=left>Column: 2349<p><p>sufficiency and to implement green initiatives, so that the environment is not placed on the back burner while the economy remains troubled?&nbsp; One potential area which the Government can help households and businesses be more environmentally-friendly is by further encouraging energy and water efficiency with more incentives for consumers.&nbsp; Apart from the benefits to the environment, generally, greater efficiency will also lead to cost savings for individuals and business owners.&nbsp; Could the Minister tell us what measures his Ministry has taken or will be taking in these areas?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another area of concern I have is Singapore's air quality, in particular, our fine particulate matter&nbsp;or PM2.5 levels.&nbsp; A large percentage of PM2.5 emissions is contributed by vehicles that run on diesel.&nbsp; With the more stringent Euro IV emission standards, having been introduced for some time already, greater use of CNG by commercial and private vehicles would contribute towards reducing our air pollution.&nbsp; If more vehicles were to switch to CNG, it may even be able to bring down our PM2.5 levels below the level set by the US Environmental Protection Agency.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One reason why CNG is not widely used in Singapore is the difficulty vehicle owners have in filling up their CNG tanks.&nbsp; There are just too few CNG filling stations available in the country.&nbsp; This is especially so for private vehicles which do not have access to the Jurong Island filling station.&nbsp; Feedback from owners of CNG-equipped vehicles has also been that waiting times at stations can be quite considerable, especially if CNG terminals are not able to fill vehicles in quick succession&nbsp;&ndash; the same way as petrol-filling stations can.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the NEA provides co-funding to the private sector to develop CNG</p> <p align=left>Column: 2350<p><p>distribution network through the innovation for environmental sustainability fund.&nbsp; I am concerned that leaving it purely to the private sector to construct the network may take a very long time to happen in the prevailing economic climate.&nbsp; Will the Government consider developing the infrastructure itself, and then handing it over to the private sector, as it did for the MRT system?</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

We need to do more to look into this disease to see how it can be eradicated.&nbsp; What new initiatives will be adopted to inhibit the spread of this disease?&nbsp; In view of the fact that Chikungunya infection has no cure and may limit its sufferers' ability to work, for up to many months, what can be done to curb the ensuing problems of the patients in our workforce?&nbsp;&nbsp;Several of my nursery operators in Bah Soon Pah Road told me that they were fined $2,000 the first time. Soon after that, they were fined $4,000 or $5,000 the second time.&nbsp; And soon after that, they were being hauled to Court and was fined between $12,000 and $13,000.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By any standard, the fine was huge.&nbsp; They cannot afford it especially during this economic downturn.&nbsp; I would like to ask&nbsp;the Minister:&nbsp; is the Ministry imposing such a huge fine to eradicate the mosquitoes or to eradicate the nursery operators?&nbsp; I believe that just as in the case of controlling dengue infection, controlling Chikungunya should be a joint effort between citizens and the Government.&nbsp; More resources should be invested in educating the public on the effective preventive methods and symptoms of Chikungunya. I am very sure&nbsp;my residents in Bah Soon Pah Road are keen to learn the effective way of eradicating mosquitoes and, hence, sharing of good practices with all nursery operators in Singapore and all households </p><p align=left>Column: 2352<p><p>in Singapore could be more helpful and effective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, littering in the neighbourhoods remains a persistent problem even after many years of public education.&nbsp; Our conservancy workers dispose large amounts of carelessly displayed litter daily, ranging from bulky furniture to half-empty drink cans. Publicity campaigns and flyers have proven to exhibit limited results.&nbsp; I believe that the root of the problem could be due to the lack of pride amongst Singaporeans and Singapore residents about their neighbourhood. Without a sense of belonging to the neighbourhood, residents would not have the urge to voluntarily protect it.&nbsp; Likewise, we get feedback about the littering habit of Singaporeans when they are abroad. What can be done to change this mindset and evoke a sense of social responsibility for the environment.&nbsp; Perhaps we need to approach the littering campaign from a different perspective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the economy looking bleak this year, energy efficiency is no longer just a solution to environmental problems.&nbsp; As income is tightened, it becomes all the more necessary to pay attention to efficient energy usage. Expenditure on energy usage can impact the competitiveness of a business.&nbsp; In last year's budget, a comprehensive plan had been drawn up for a multi-tiered approach to involve public sector, private sector and residents in embracing energy efficiency.&nbsp; Although this plan incurred some financial investment, we should continue to promote energy efficiency in Singapore. This way, we would not be penny wise and&nbsp;pound foolish.&nbsp;Given the benefits of energy efficient business practices, will the Ministry consider providing financial support for individuals and corporations not already benefiting from energy efficiency schemes? What are the Ministry's plans to push for more efficient energy usage amongst businesses and households?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2353<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have an ambitious target of hitting a 60% recycling rate by 2012.&nbsp; Our National Recycling Programme has helped boosted Singapore's recycling rate in recent years, but it may not be entirely efficient with regard to household waste.&nbsp; In today's <I>Forum</I> page in the <I>Straits Times</I>, there was an article&nbsp;titled "Recycling: All that effort gone to waste" by Reuel Royston Wee.&nbsp; Are our waste disposal contractors taking waste recycling seriously?&nbsp; Are our residents still putting the wrong items in neighbourhood recycling bins and giving up non-recyclable products for collections?&nbsp; I hope we have more residents like the foreign writer, Reuel Royston Wee.&nbsp; Can more be done to educate the public about recyclable materials?

Sir, sustainable development is important for Singapore's continued progress.&nbsp; Our economy, environment and&nbsp;society&nbsp;are inter-linked.&nbsp; If economic activities lead to more pollution and&nbsp;wasteful use of resources, it will impair our quality of life and threaten our long-term growth.&nbsp; If we make the wrong choices now future generations will likely contend with unhealthy air, water and land and struggle for depleting resources in a congested city with little or no greenery and water areas.&nbsp; We must continue to put sustainable development high on our agenda so that future generations enjoy the same, if not, a better quality of life than what we have today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2360<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sustainable development will contribute towards a more dynamic economy and a clean environment.&nbsp; This is the vision set out by the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Sustainable Development, or IMCSD, which&nbsp;the Minister for National Development and I co-chair.&nbsp; The Committee&nbsp;will release its report in March together with the details on how the&nbsp;$1 billion budget for sustainable development will be spent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, both Mr Charles Chong and Er Edwin Khew asked if sustainable development is still a relevant priority in these economically uncertain times.&nbsp; Given the global downturn the ability to grow the economy in a sustainable way has become more and not less relevant.&nbsp; Continuing to achieve good growth while maintaining a good environment will require, first, the prudent use of natural resources; second, building capability in the environmental sector; and, finally, protecting our environment to ensure that environmental standards do not slip and even improve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prudent use of natural resources is particularly pertinent during this period of economic uncertainty.&nbsp; By continuing to take a long-term view and sustaining investments and resource efficiency, our economy and companies can emerge from the economic crisis with leaner cost structures, higher productivity and greater competitiveness.&nbsp; Similarly, Sir, by becoming more efficient, households and families can save energy and water, cut cost and cope better during tough economic times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Faishal asked how the Ministry will help households and businesses to&nbsp;become more resource efficient while several Members asked about the Ministry's plans for energy efficiency.&nbsp; But, Sir, let me address Mr Charles Chong's question on our vulnerability to climate change before I elaborate on the&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2361<p><p>initiative that my Ministry is embarking to promote resource efficiency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in 2007, the NEA commissioned a two-year study to better understand the long-term effects on climate change such as sea level rise and temperature changes in Singapore.&nbsp; The study is expected to be completed in the middle of this year.&nbsp; Preliminary results indicate that our existing infrastructure is sufficient to address the risk in the short to medium term.&nbsp; For instance, the mean sea level rise for Singapore is expected to be between 23 cm and 69 cm by the end of this century and our current&nbsp;land reclamation levels which are set at 1.25 m above the highest tide level are sufficient to address this rise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, Sir, we will continue to work closely with the relevant Government agencies to assess the need to implement&nbsp; additional adaptation measures in the longer term.&nbsp; We will also be embarking on the second phase of the study on Singapore's vulnerabilities to climate change to look at how climate change may affect both public health and bio-diversity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, energy efficiency is our key strategy to mitigate climate change.&nbsp; It is also a pragmatic approach to lower business cost&nbsp;and increase our competitiveness.&nbsp; The Energy Efficiency Programme Office (E2PO) led by the NEA was set up in 2007 to drive energy efficiency efforts across sectors.&nbsp; It has rolled out measures to increase awareness on energy efficiency, incentivise update of energy efficient technologies and develop capability in energy management.&nbsp; Discussions&nbsp;are on-going on suitable national targets for energy efficiency and these will be released later this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To increase public awareness on energy efficiency, NEA launched the 10%</p><p align=left>Column: 2362<p><p>Energy Challenge in April 2008 to encourage households to reduce their energy consumption by 10%.&nbsp; Every household can save electricity with simple habits, like not leaving household appliances on standby, using a fan instead of an air-conditioner and using more efficient light bulbs.&nbsp; The 10% Energy Challenge&nbsp;Campaign uses a range of media platforms such as television, internet and events to inform households of such energy saving tips.&nbsp; Sir, the early results are promising.&nbsp; The average monthly household electricity consumption from May to August last year fell by almost 4% compared to the corresponding period in 2007.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grassroots organisations and companies have also been encouraging households to conserve energy.&nbsp; For example, residents in the South East District took part in quizzes on energy conservation in exchange for energy saving light bulbs for needy households.&nbsp; Over&nbsp;3,000 light bulbs sponsored by Philips Electronics will be given out to more than 600 needy households.&nbsp; Separately, Osram Singapore is partnering North West CDC and is donating 1,000 energy light bulbs to needy families in Marsiling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to enable our household to choose more energy efficient equipment, air-conditioners and refrigerators in stores, now Sir, carry the mandatory energy label.&nbsp; MEWR and NEA are also working with our retailers and supplies of home appliances to promote the sales of energy efficient appliances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I announced last year that the Government will introduce the mandatory fuel economy labelling scheme&nbsp;(FELS) for passenger cars from April this year to help car buyers choose more fuel efficient vehicles.&nbsp; All car retailers will display the fuel economy labels or passenger car models at the showroom.&nbsp;&nbsp;We estimate that the car owners can save nearly $900</p><p align=left>Column: 2363<p><p>in fuel cost each year by switching to a more fuel efficient car and practising good driving habits.&nbsp; We have been in close consultation with the industry to prepare them for FELS and of course will take into account their feedback in the&nbsp;implementation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help businesses keep&nbsp;costs down, NEA will extend the waiver on registration fees for air-conditioners and refrigerator models under the Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme (MELS) by an additional year, until 30th June next year.&nbsp; NEA will also waive the registration fees for clothes dryers under the&nbsp;MELS and for vehicles under FELS till 30th June of next year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the business sector, we see huge potential to save energy and reduce cost by investing in energy efficient technology.&nbsp; Some companies are already implementing energy efficiency measures and realising the savings.&nbsp; For example, United MicroElectronics Corporation is reaping energy savings of about one million kilowatt-hour or over $200,000&nbsp;per month by improving the efficiency of its chiller system.&nbsp; To encourage wider adoption of energy efficient design, technologies and practices, we have put in place a number incentives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we launch the Design for Efficiency scheme to co-fund workshops to design new energy intensive facilities to be as energy efficient as possible.&nbsp; And for existing industrial facilities, we launch the Grant for Energy Efficient Technologies (GREET) to co-fund up to&nbsp;50% of the cost of energy efficient equipment or technology.&nbsp; Sir, the response by industries is encouraging and NEA is working with them on several energy efficient proposals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To build capability in energy management, NEA launched the Singapore Certified Energy Manager (SCEM) training grant to co-fund the cost of attending SCEM courses.&nbsp; The SCEM programme</p><p align=left>Column: 2364<p><p>equips facilities and building managers, engineers, technicians with the skills to manage energy services.&nbsp; Since the launch of the grant in September 2008, we have approved 82 applications and all the applicants have started their training.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government is also taking the lead on energy efficiency.&nbsp; We earlier announced that all Government buildings with more than 15,000 sq m of air-conditioned floor area will conduct energy audits by March 2010.&nbsp; Sir, we are on track to meet our goal.&nbsp; Twelve out of 48 Government buildings have completed their energy audits and are now implementing&nbsp;the recommendations, and this will achieve about&nbsp;$3 million in total annual savings.&nbsp; Another 10 buildings have completed their energy audits and are implementing the recommendations.&nbsp; An additional $2.5 million in total annual savings could be realised&nbsp; if all the identified measures are implemented.&nbsp; Sir, the remaining 26 buildings will complete their audits within the next year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, all large public buildings are also to ensure that the ambient indoor air temperature is maintained as high as comfort levels allow within the range of 22.5 to 25.5 degrees Celsius.&nbsp; Going forward, we will look into extending this requirement to cover all public sector premises.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to thank Mr Seah Kian Peng for his suggestions on how we can be more energy efficient as a country.&nbsp; My Ministry will continue to look into how the Government can improve resource efficiency as well as how we can engage the private and people sectors on similar efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there is more that Singapore can do to improve our&nbsp;energy efficiency.&nbsp; As we progress towards more prudent energy use with &nbsp;greater awareness, expertise and&nbsp;support by the Government, we also need to lock in the gains by introducing mandatory efficiency standards selectively </p><p align=left>Column: 2365<p><p>to ensure a permanent improvement in energy efficiency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the household sector, the NEA will implement the Minimum Energy Performance Standard (MEPS) for household air-conditioners and refrigerators by 2011 to remove the least efficient models from the market.&nbsp; The minimum standards will be set between the one-tick and two-tick range and will affect less than 20% of the existing appliances models.&nbsp; Consumers will continue to have a sufficient variety of appliance models to choose from while suppliers have a two-year lead time to clear their existing stocks and bring in the new models.&nbsp; Beyond 2011 we will look into the feasibility of introducing MEPS for lighting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the buildings and industry sectors, we are studying the feasibility of mandating good energy management practices such as regular monitoring and reporting of energy use and the appointment of trained energy managers for facilities with high energy consumption.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Singapore will continue to depend on fossil fuels in the near future.&nbsp; Improving energy efficiency is the most cost effective way of enhancing security while lowering energy bills and is a key thrust&nbsp;of our sustainable development strategy.&nbsp; The industry and community must therefore work in active partnership with Government to push aggressively on energy efficiency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Lim asked about the deployment of solar technologies.&nbsp; Solar energy is still more costly than conventional grid electricity generated from fossil fuels but prices are expected to come down as the technology matures.&nbsp; To build up our capabilities for future adoption when it is cost effective to do </p><p align=left>Column: 2366<p><p>so, we will continue to research and test-bed such new technologies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the National Research Foundation (NRF) has set aside $170 million for research&nbsp;into clean energy.&nbsp; The Clean Energy Programme Office under the EDB also launched the $17 million Clean Energy Research and Testbedding Programme in 2007 to support the testbedding of clean energy applications in Government buildings and facilities, and a $20 million Solar Capability Scheme which was launched last year, to offset part of the capital cost for installing solar technologies in new buildings.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Sir, Dr Lim also asked about recycling.&nbsp; I will respond to his points later.&nbsp; Mr Charles Chong also raised&nbsp;several points.&nbsp;&nbsp;With his indulgence, I will address them later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me now move on to water.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like energy, water is a key resource in which we have to optimise.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the completion of the Marina Barrage last year, we now have the Marina Reservoir. Punggol and Serangoon Reservoirs are on track to be completed later this year.&nbsp; Our largest NEWater plant at Changi is also on track to be completed in 2010. &nbsp;Through forward planning, we ensure sufficient supply to meet demand.&nbsp; We will continue to monitor the demand trends and review the need for new projects.&nbsp; Developing our resources in a timely way to meet demand helps to ensure an affordable water supply.&nbsp; We also strive to improve efficiency and leverage on technology to manage our costs amid other cost pressures, such as inflation and fuel cost.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Four National Taps strategy also provides us with useful options during dry</p><p align=left>Column: 2367<p><p>weather.&nbsp; Some&nbsp;Members may be aware that this January&nbsp;was drier than usual, and traditionally February is a dry month too.&nbsp; While our reservoirs may not be as full as they usually are, I would like to reassure Singaporeans that we have adequate water to meet our needs.&nbsp; With our diversified water sources, we can supplement our supply with desalinated water.&nbsp; Since 2003, we have been introducing NEWater via indirect potable use into our reservoirs, and we can increase this if need be.&nbsp; NEWater and desalinated water are not affected by fluctuations in rainfall, and thus we are in a stronger position to meet any challenges from dry weather.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though much has been done to improve the drought resilience of our water supply system, we are nonetheless dependent upon the rain for our supply, and the vagaries of&nbsp;the weather that seem to have hit many countries may not spare us either. &nbsp;New water sources are also costly to develop.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore important for everyone to conserve water and use it efficiently.&nbsp; The current dry season is an opportune time to remind ourselves of the significance of this, and to play our part.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, several Members have asked about the&nbsp;10-Litre Challenge.&nbsp; The 10-Litre Challenge&nbsp;is a major initiative launched in 2006 to engage the public in water conservation and help households save on their water bills. &nbsp;The community has taken an active role.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventy-four Water Volunteer Groups have been formed in 42 constituencies.&nbsp; And together with PUB, they visit households to educate them on water conservation practices and install water-saving devices, such as thimbles and cistern water-saving bags.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through these outreach efforts, the domestic water consumption per person per day decreased from 157 litres in 2007 to 156 litres in 2008, and&nbsp;we are on track to meet the Singapore Green Plan target of 155 litres by 2012.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2368<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I announced last year, Sir,&nbsp;that we will mandate water efficiency labelling of taps, dual-flush low capacity flushing cisterns&nbsp;(LCFCs) and urinals from 1st July 2009, so that consumers can make smart purchasing decisions and use water-saving devices to conserve water. Industry consultation started in late 2006 and we are in regular contact with them to ensure a smooth implementation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, from 1st July this year, taps, urinals and dual-flush LCFCs installed in all new developments and existing premises undergoing renovation must have at least a one-tick water efficiency rating. &nbsp;All new domestic premises and existing domestic premises undergoing renovation will also be required to use dual-flush LCFCs from July this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, we launched a set of initiatives under the 10-Litre Challenge to promote water conservation in the non-domestic sector.&nbsp; The aim, Sir,&nbsp;is to encourage users to manage their water demand along the value chain, from sustainable and efficient design, to the use of water conservation devices and water demand management.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A one-stop website was set up, offering a tool for organisations to assess their water consumption, benchmark against similar organisations and identify areas for improvement.&nbsp; It also provides water efficiency tips, such as improving the design&nbsp;and operation of cooling units.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To build up industry capabilities in water management, a two-and-a-half-day course for building facilities and operations managers was developed by PUB and Singapore Polytechnic.&nbsp; To-date, 29 participants from hotels, building managing agents, and plumbing companies have been certified.&nbsp; An industry guide on Water Efficient Building Design has also been published.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 2369<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the profile of water use varies across industry sectors, we are adopting a sector-specific approach to identify areas for improvement and share best practices. &nbsp;For a start, we have worked with the Singapore Hotel Association and the Ministry of Education to encourage hotels and schools to work towards being water efficient buildings, and reduce their water consumption by 10%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regent Singapore Hotel&nbsp;showed that water savings of up to 16% can be achieved by adopting a Reduce, Replace and Reuse approach in water management.&nbsp; The hotel installed water efficient taps, uses NEWater for cooling towers, irrigation and water features, and has a system to monitor for any abnormal increase in water consumption.&nbsp; For its efforts, the hotel was awarded Gold Plus under the BCA&rsquo;s Green Mark Scheme and certified a Water Efficient Building by PUB.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Best practices and success stories, such as Regent Singapore Hotel have been shared at water conservation seminars. &nbsp;Following the engagement with schools and hotels, PUB will broaden its focus to include commercial and Government buildings, and Town Councils this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, PUB is doing more to help users save water and cut costs. To help needy households reap savings, PUB will spend $600,000 to install water-saving devices in such households with above average water consumption.&nbsp; PUB is working with the People&rsquo;s Association and the CDCs, and engaging volunteers to conduct house visits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For non-domestic customers, PUB has increased the co-funding for small and medium enterprises&nbsp;(SMEs) for water efficiency projects carried out under the</p><p align=left>Column: 2370<p><p>Water Efficiency Fund, from 50% to 80% of the cost of qualifying projects.&nbsp; The aim is to help SMEs reduce their water costs in these lean times.&nbsp; And the PUB will work with SPRING Singapore to promote the use of the Fund to SMEs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To help SMEs benefit from the lower price of NEWater, PUB will also provide assistance to defray part of the retrofitting costs involved in switching to NEWater. &nbsp;PUB will also work with SMEs to manage their water consumption and work towards reducing their water bills by providing free constant flow regulators and spray nozzles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We previously announced that we would look into restructuring used water charges into a single volumetric fee. Sir,&nbsp;in the light of the economic downturn, we recognise that the changes could add to the sense of uncertainty for households, and therefore we&nbsp;will hold off the revisions for now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will take&nbsp;the other cuts of Members later.&nbsp;</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Charles Chong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Recycling</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Charles Chong:</B> Sir, could the Minister provide us with an update of Singapore's recycling and waste minimisation efforts?&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Waste Management and Recycling</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Er Edwin Khew Teck Fook:</B> Sir, before I speak on the subject, I would like to declare my interest as I manage a food waste and renewable energy company.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The recycling rate of waste in Singapore, in general, has been slowly increasing by 1% to 2%&nbsp;per year over the last&nbsp;four to five years.&nbsp; Based on the statistics given by NEA for 2007,&nbsp;four out of 12 or 33% of the categories of waste types have achieved or exceeded the Singapore Green Plan (SGP) 2012 target.&nbsp; Four have a fair chance of reaching the target by 2012,&nbsp;but four&nbsp;of the categories (ie, plastics, horticultural waste, glass and food waste) have no chance of reaching the target as the discrepancies between the current and the SGP 2012 target figures are greater than 15%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the current global economic situation, commodity prices for paper, steel, plastics and other recyclables have seen a sharp decline which will, no doubt, have a major effect on the recycling rate of all waste, making the&nbsp;four waste types, which have a fair chance (which includes paper, wood, cardboard, ferrous and non-ferrous metals)&nbsp;not achieve the 2012 targets.&nbsp; This, then results in&nbsp;eight, or 67%, of waste types not reaching the&nbsp;SGP 2012 targets.&nbsp; This, in turn, means that our incinerators will have to work harder and our landfill in Palau Semakau will have to receive more waste.&nbsp; This is obviously not desirable for Singapore's waste management strategy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;in my consultation with the Waste Management and Recycling Association&nbsp;(WMRAS) and a number of waste recyclers,&nbsp;I would&nbsp;like&nbsp;to feedback to the Minister, the suggestions that the industry have that will relieve the projected weak situation on recycling, so as to bring recycling back on track.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Increase the gate or tipping fee into the incinerators, as it is currently too</p>	<p align=left>Column: 2372<p><p>low compared to many of the developed countries.&nbsp; Having such low rates will not promote segregation and recycling.&nbsp; There is also little&nbsp;or no incentive for recyclers to invest in alternative waste recycling technologies (eg, innovative recycling and recovery technologies and hi-tech waste to energy plants).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's waste operators must move up the innovative and technology chain so that they can showcase these technologies in Singapore to their prospective customers in the East Asian market, ie, develop Singapore into a hub&nbsp;for waste technology and solutions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Mandate the segregation of waste at source&nbsp;for industrial,&nbsp;commercial and large institutions to support and complement point&nbsp;(1) above.&nbsp; Segregation at source also supports and encourages recycling, particularly food waste from recyclables as&nbsp;food waste contaminates&nbsp;recyclables, therefore rendering them non-recyclable.&nbsp; Since there is a back-end facility to treat food waste, the recovery of recyclables should increase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Provide grants, funds and incentives to support recycling and recyclers who are introducing innovative&nbsp;and technology to recover resources, particularly in the current economic crisis.&nbsp; The Government should invest during this downturn in this sector to exploit opportunities and to sustain and create new "green" jobs.&nbsp; As technology is applied, most of these "green" jobs will require technical skills which will be suitable for Singaporeans.&nbsp; Grants can be given to organisations prepared to upgrade and apply innovative solutions in their premises to segregate and facilitate the easy handling and disposal of their segregated waste.&nbsp; Similarly, incentives should be given to recyclers who are prepared to invest in segregated collections, and then applying innovation and technology to recover resources from the waste.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>	<p align=left>Column: 2373<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to seek the Minister's views on the above suggestions.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education and Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Masagos Zulkifli B M M)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As&nbsp;Er Lee Bee Wah has noted, public education is important, and these efforts will continue.&nbsp; She referred to the article in the <I>Straits Times</I> today.&nbsp; I will address that later,&nbsp;in terms of what we do at the constituencies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA also collaborated with the food and beverage sector on the voluntary Singapore Packaging Agreement to reduce packaging waste.&nbsp; Results are encouraging with a total of 850 tonnes of packaging waste avoided in the first year.&nbsp; On the "Bring Your Own Bag Day" initiative, which is introduced by the Singapore Environment Council (SEC), we will let the participating retailers determine if the frequency needs to be increased, as suggested by Dr Lim.&nbsp; This is now led by SEC and they will work with the industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Charles Chong also asked about recycling in our households.&nbsp; The NEA launched the National Recycling Programme&nbsp;(NRP) in 2001. &nbsp;Under the NRP, the public waste collectors (PWCs) serving HDB and private landed estates provide door-to-door collection of recyclables once a fortnight.&nbsp; The participation rate in the NRP increased from 15% in 2001 to 63% in 2008.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 2007, the PWCs have also provided 1,600 centralised recycling bins in the common areas of HDB estates.&nbsp; There is a set of bins for every five blocks of HDB flats and the majority of residents need not walk more than 150 metres from their blocks to use them.&nbsp; The response from our residents has been encouraging.&nbsp; The average amount of recyclables collected from each set of bins increased by 58% from 65 kg per month in 2007 to 103 kg per month for 2008.&nbsp; However, there is still room for improvement, and I encourage all residents to make full use of </p>	<p align=left>Column: 2375<p><p>the recycling facilities, but in a responsible manner.&nbsp; The location at which the recycling facilities are located is a decision made by the Town Councils in consultation, sometimes, with the Residents' Committees.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the case reported in the <I>Straits Times</I> today,&nbsp;we have asked the waste collector for that area to investigate.&nbsp; As the recycling bins are on rollers, they are, therefore,&nbsp;easily moved by anybody who may want to move it.&nbsp; So we will ask them to study how best we can avoid such a problem, as mentioned in today's papers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Dr Lim also asked&nbsp;whether there are enough centralised recycling bins, and he offered Canberra as an example.&nbsp; NEA's data shows that the number is sufficient.&nbsp; But if Dr Lim wants to experiment, I am sure the NEA can work together with the PWC, and if they are prepared to do it, I will leave it to the PWC to work together with Dr Lim on this matter.&nbsp; But for locations where the bins are filled up more quickly, NEA has been working with the PWCs to increase the collection frequency from the usual once per week to twice per week.&nbsp; NEA will continue to monitor the usage of the recycling facilities and review their adequacy on an ongoing basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last year, I announced that NEA will mandate the provision of recycling receptacles in condominium and private apartments by 2009.&nbsp; Implementation has been ongoing in phases to give the management councils and waste management companies sufficient time for compliance.&nbsp; NEA targets to achieve full implementation by the end of 2009.&nbsp; All households in Singapore will then have convenient access to recycling facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Er Lee Bee Wah and Er Edwin Khew spoke about our new measures to improve our recycling rate.&nbsp; Our recycling rate improved steadily from 40% in 2000 </p>	<p align=left>Column: 2376<p><p>to 56% in 2008, and we are on track to meet the Singapore Green Plan 2012 target of 60%.&nbsp; We also achieved high recycling rates for waste streams, such as used slag, construction debris and ferrous metals.&nbsp; While these results are encouraging, it will become increasingly challenging to sustain this progress, as the remaining waste that is disposed is not easy to segregate and recycle.&nbsp; We agree with Mr Khew that&nbsp;additional measures will be needed to further increase our overall recycling rate and the recycling rate of waste streams with lower recycling rates, such as food waste and plastic waste.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I&nbsp;am pleased to inform the House that NEA will be launching an $8 million 3R Fund over the next&nbsp;two years to co-fund new waste minimisation and recycling projects.&nbsp; So those ideas that Mr Khew has suggested, some of the companies can consider submitting a proposal.&nbsp; The Fund will co-fund up to 80% of the qualifying costs, subject to a cap of $1 million per project.&nbsp; NEA has received several preliminary proposals from its industry consultations, and these include the separate collection and recycling of food and garden waste, glass and batteries.&nbsp; More details on the Fund will be provided by NEA when it is launched within the next&nbsp;two months.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of the Government's efforts to help businesses tide over the current downturn, my Ministry will give a 15% monthly rental rebate from January to December this year to the recycling companies located at the Sarimbun Recycling Park.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this will help them in these difficult times.&nbsp; We are aware that some developed countries have used legislation to mandate recycling.&nbsp; In view of the current economic downturn, we are not looking at introducing legislation in the near future, as it would likely increase costs for businesses and households.&nbsp; However, in the longer term, we will</p>	<p align=left>Column: 2377<p><p>study the use of legislation to further improve our recycling rate. &nbsp;We will also review our gate fee regularly, taking into consideration the need to appropriately price our waste disposal operations and the cost impact on businesses and households.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Charles Chong asked about Semakau landfill.&nbsp; It is located off mainland Singapore.&nbsp; Semakau landfill is clean and free from smell. &nbsp;In fact, it is open to the public for them to enjoy its rich biodiversity.&nbsp; That said, we hope to achieve even more with Semakau.&nbsp; We are developing a plan to turn it into an Eco Park, where companies can conduct field testing of renewable and clean technologies, such as wind and solar energy.&nbsp; More details will be announced when the concept plan has been finalised.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have spoken about resource efficiency and how this supports sustainable development.&nbsp; Our second key thrust to ensure sustainable development is to build capability in the environment and water sector.&nbsp; This will not only generate new solutions for Singapore, but create economic opportunities that Mr Khew mentioned about.&nbsp; Environmental goods and services are expected to have a global market worth over US$500 billion&nbsp;each year.&nbsp; New materials, energy technologies, and applications to minimise waste and conserve resources will be important in future.&nbsp; By building up our capabilities in sustainable development, we can secure a long-term competitive advantage for Singapore in this sector.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Masagos Zulkifli asked for an update on our efforts to build up Singapore's capabilities in environment and water technologies.&nbsp; I am pleased to share that we are making very good progress.&nbsp; In 2008, the Environment and Water Industry Development Council&nbsp;(EWI) injected another $21 million into the</p>	<p align=left>Column: 2378<p><p>R&amp;D ecosystem through the award of 14 R&amp;D projects to companies and institutes of higher learning based in Singapore.&nbsp; This contributed to a high level of R&amp;D activities, and attracted global ideas and talents into Singapore.&nbsp; To grow the local pool of talent in water technologies, EWI supports promising candidates to pursue Masters or PhDs through scholarships.&nbsp; In 2008, EWI widened its outreach to overseas-based applicants and this saw the award of&nbsp;eight PhD scholarships, up from&nbsp;two in 2007.&nbsp; The&nbsp;third round of PhD scholarship applications just closed in January, with more than 60 applications received.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The EWI regularly reviews our schemes to develop the water industry.&nbsp; In 2008, the TechPioneer scheme was enhanced by removing the need for grant repayment, to encourage more companies to adopt new technologies early.&nbsp; One project that has benefited from the enhancement is Keppel's membrane distillation project which is scheduled to commence in the first quarter of this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore's vibrant water industry continues to attract reputable water R&amp;D institutes and companies.&nbsp; For instance, Nitto Denko will be the first Japanese enterprise to set up a water R&amp;D centre in Singapore.&nbsp; It will invest a modest sum, to begin with, of about $6 million to focus on R&amp;D in membrane applications for desalination and water reuse.&nbsp; Another example is Marmon Water, a US-based company, which is investing $24 million to set up a water filter manufacturing facility in Singapore, employing&nbsp;100 staff.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The EWI also made good progress in grooming local SMEs and encouraging them to develop capabilities and proprietary technologies that can be exported.&nbsp; For example, PUB is working with a local company, Optiqua, to test and validate sensor applications to detect organic and biological contaminants in water.&nbsp; More Singapore water companies</p>	<p align=left>Column: 2379<p><p>have started to export their expertise and expand their overseas presence.&nbsp; In 2008, our water companies continued to internationalise, securing a total value of more than $1.3 billion of contracts.&nbsp; While most projects came from the key markets of China and the Middle East, Singapore companies are also enjoying some success in regions such as North Africa.&nbsp; For instance, Hyflux secured a $630 million Algerian desalination contract.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore International Water Week&nbsp;(SIWW) 2008 held in June 2008 received strong global support with more than 8,500 participants from 79 countries.&nbsp; Business deals in excess of $367 million were inked.&nbsp; Extensive local and international media coverage profiled Singapore as a global water hub to the world.&nbsp; SIWW 2009 will ride on this success and aim for greater participation from China, Middle East, India and South East Asia, which are key markets for our water technologies.&nbsp; This year's event will focus on water infrastructure and technologies with the theme "Sustainable Cities&nbsp;&ndash; Infrastructure and Technologies for Water".&nbsp; To further bolster this theme, the 7th Ministers' Forum on Infrastructure Development in the Asia Pacific Region will be one of the key events to co-locate with this year's SIWW.&nbsp; Drawing from industry feedback, SIWW 2009 will feature a larger exhibition area, more networking opportunities, and environment technologies and companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the water sector, my Ministry, together with the EDB and IE Singapore, have been studying market drivers, technology trends and Singapore's competitive strengths and value propositions in the environment sector.&nbsp; Our study assessed that clean environment technologies will be an important growth area for Singapore's environment and water sector.&nbsp; My Ministry will, therefore, be working with our research institutions and industry to build up Singapore's research and development capability in clean</p>	<p align=left>Column: 2380<p><p>environment technologies over the next few years.&nbsp; Possible focus areas being considered include waste management which has been assessed to have good market potential.&nbsp; This new effort will complement the existing Clean Water and Clean Energy programmes, and enhance Singapore's position as a hub for environmental solutions and technologies that Mr Khew spoke about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the economic downturn, MEWR will sustain efforts to develop Singapore's capabilities in environmental and water technologies. &nbsp;We are offering courses to build up specialised competencies in the environment and water sector.&nbsp; For example, NEA's Singapore Certified Energy Manager, or SCEM, programme,&nbsp;which I spoke of earlier, will provide the foundation for engineers to become professionals in the promotion of energy efficiency.&nbsp; In the water sector, PUB has worked with the Singapore Water Association to roll out competency programmes for membrane technologies employed in the production of water.&nbsp; These programmes will not only augment our pool of skilled manpower, but are also timely for mid-career professionals, such as engineers and plant managers, who want to re-skill themselves, particularly in this downturn. There are opportunities in the environment and water sector for mid-career professionals, both in the public and private sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I will again take some other cuts later on.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chairman:</B> &nbsp; Order. &nbsp;We will take the break now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thereupon Mr Speaker left the Chair of the Committee and took the Chair of the House.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Speaker:</B> Order.&nbsp; I suspend the Sitting and will take the Chair again at 3.20 pm.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align="right"><I>Sitting accordingly suspended</I></p><p align="right"><I>at 2.58 pm until 3.20 pm.</I></p><p align="right">&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      	<p align=left>Column: 2381<p>		<P><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><em>Sitting resumed at</em> 3 <em>.20 pm</em><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>	<p align="center"><strong>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="left"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Debate in Committee of Supply resumed.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><strong>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</strong></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="left"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> <em>Head&nbsp;L (cont.) &ndash;</em></p></span></div></P>      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lim Wee Kiak--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Protecting and Enhancing Our Environment</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Lim Wee Kiak:</B> Sir, in a very densely populated island like Singapore, protection of the environment is critical.&nbsp; The effect of any pollution on the population is almost immediately felt as there is very little buffer space.&nbsp; This applies to air, water and noise pollution.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are we doing for air pollution?&nbsp; What is our PM2.5 in year 2008?&nbsp; As PM2.5&nbsp;is linked to respiratory diseases, such as asthma and bronchitis especially in the vulnerable young and old, it is critical that we hasten our efforts to improve our air quality to ensure that our air is safe for the population, especially for the vulnerable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main source of PM2.5 pollutants is motor vehicles.&nbsp; Like&nbsp;hon. Nominated Member of Parliament, Mr Edwin Khew, I would like to appeal to the Government to implement more measures to increase the proportion of green cars on our roads and encourage the use of cleaner fuels and engines.&nbsp; Suggestions, such as green car COE&nbsp;is one fast solution that will entice more drivers and the motor industry to embrace green cars,&nbsp;were&nbsp;made previously but were sort of put on hold.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Government can further enhance the green car scheme and&nbsp;will&nbsp;consider further measures, such as green car COEs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me shift our attention to larger particulate matters in the air.&nbsp; Two years</p><p align=left>Column: 2382<p><p>ago, I requested MEWR to work with shipyard operators and factories near Sembawang town to reduce the black dust pollution problem&nbsp;to the nearby HDB households.&nbsp; I am pleased to inform the House that the problem has significantly reduced, but I would like to urge&nbsp;MEWR to continue the good work to ensure&nbsp;black dust pollution is kept to the lowest&nbsp;possible level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad that the Government is pump-priming the economy by bringing forward many infrastructural projects.&nbsp; Can the Minister update the House on whether projects under the ABC programme will be brought forward?&nbsp; If so, which projects?&nbsp; What is the current status of the programme?&nbsp; I hope the Minister can also include some waterways which were not included,&nbsp;such as Sungei Sembawang, in this programme.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the completion of the Marina Barrage, what is the status of the water quality in the Kallang River and the new Marina Reservoir?&nbsp; What measures are taken to ensure that we will continue to have clean water, beautiful and active waterways?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last, we all hope for a quiet and clean&nbsp;home&nbsp;to relax after work.&nbsp; Noise pollution from domestic, construction and traffic can impact one adversely.&nbsp; Can the Ministry update the House on the status of noise pollution in Singapore and the measures that are taken?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Air, water and noise pollutions are challenges that we have to tackle fast and head on if Singapore wants to continue to be the choice location for global talents and the best home for all Singaporeans.&nbsp; As the population strives to increase to 6.5 million in future, I am sure this pollution problem will be even a greater challenge if we cannot take this on now.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

That is an increase of about 20%.&nbsp; However, the number of complaints on construction noise received by the NEA increased from 6,160 in 2006 to 9,228.&nbsp; That is an increase of 50%.&nbsp; We live in a country where space comes at a premium.&nbsp; Having more apartments and houses mean that we are living closer and closer to each other.&nbsp; In a crowded and developed society like ours, it is impossible to guarantee complete peace and quiet for residents.&nbsp; There must be an element of give and take, of live and let live.&nbsp; But Singaporeans also deserve an opportunity to rest and spend quality family time without being constantly harassed by noise pollution.&nbsp; The rising number of complaints is evidence of an issue worth looking into.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Environmental Protection and Management (Control of Noise at Construction Sites) Regulations have a detailed and complex list of noise levels allowed in different areas, times and</p>  <p align=left>Column: 2384<p><p>duration.&nbsp; However, the current regulations are difficult to understand and are unrealistic.&nbsp; Let me give some examples.&nbsp; Part 1 of the Second Schedule says that the maximum permissible noise level between 7.00 pm and 7.00 am for construction sites affecting residential buildings located less than 150 metres from the site (reckoned as an equivalent continuous noise level over a period of 12 hours) is zero.&nbsp; But for periods of one hour, 55 decibels is allowed between the hours 10.00 pm and 7.00 am.&nbsp; From 7.00 am on Sunday mornings, which is the only time, I suspect, many of us are able to sleep, the contractors are allowed 75 decibels.&nbsp; How is the public to know when the contractor has breached the regulations?&nbsp; The problem is particularly difficult if the breach is a short intermittent one which disturbs sleep or rest but it is difficult to regulate a complaint against.&nbsp; It only takes a short burst of noise to disturb rest.&nbsp; Why do we allow contractors working on a site less than 150 metres from residential buildings to start work at 7.00 am on Sundays?&nbsp; I am not suggesting we have strict rules like they have in some countries where the noise regulations are so strict that, for apartments,&nbsp;they cannot even take a shower during certain hours at night.&nbsp; But I think the pendulum has swung too far in favour of contractors and developers.&nbsp; I, therefore, ask the Minister to review the rules on noise.&nbsp; Does the Minister not agree that Singaporeans should be given at least a day or some hours of a day or a weekend of peace and quiet?&nbsp; Can we not have stricter rules about noise at construction sites, particularly those near residential areas and particularly during the usual hours of sleep?&nbsp; Is it really going to create difficulties for our contractors or developers to start work, say, at 9.00 am on Sunday?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Liang Eng Hwa--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

In addition to noise nuisance created by immediate neighbours, we receive&nbsp;frequent complaints about construction noise and vehicular noise.&nbsp; Singaporeans&rsquo; tolerance towards noise, especially around vicinity of their homes, has obviously decreased.</p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the area of construction noise, can NEA step up enforcement and monitor construction sites more closely to ensure that the noise they generate stay below the limits implemented, especially during night time, weekends and public holidays?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

While the noise nuisance at the public housing estates comes under the ambit of HDB, can NEA, as the leading agency for environment and noise pollution control, work with HDB and Town Councils to review the following:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower the noise limits in neighbourhoods during&nbsp;night-time;</p><p><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduce a more effective enforcement regime;

I would like to check whether this increase is due to short-term fluctuations or any other reasons.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Malaysia has seen a recent upsurge in the number of cases.&nbsp; Malaysian news reports state that 4,221 dengue cases with 12 deaths&nbsp;were reported in the first 23 days of this year.&nbsp; This compares with</p><p align=left>Column: 2388<p><p>2,103 cases with&nbsp;five deaths over the corresponding period in 2008.&nbsp;

Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked about our air quality and efforts to promote green vehicles.&nbsp; In 2008, Singapore continued to enjoy good air quality with the Pollutant Standards Index in the "good" range for 96% of the year.&nbsp; Our key pollutant levels, including those found in Sembawang, were within the standards set by the United States Environmental Protection Authority&nbsp;(USEPA) with the exception of very fine particulate matter or PM2.5.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diesel vehicles are a significant source of PM2.5, accounting for about half of PM2.5 levels.&nbsp; My Ministry has adopted various measures to reduce PM2.5 from diesel vehicles. &nbsp;For example, we introduced the more stringent Euro IV standards for new diesel vehicles from October 2006.&nbsp; Euro IV-compliant diesel vehicles emit as much as 70% less PM2.5 than older Euro II vehicles.&nbsp; Our aim is to bring PM2.5 levels down to the USEPA standard of 15 microgram per cubic metre. &nbsp;We are making good progress towards this goal.&nbsp; Our annual mean PM2.5 level in 2008 was 16 microgram per cubic metre.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to reduce pollution from vehicles, we have also been promoting the use of environmentally friendly vehicles, such as compressed natural gas (CNG) and hybrid vehicles through the Green Vehicle Rebate (GVR) Scheme, which narrows the cost differential between green vehicles and conventional ones.&nbsp; Since its introduction in 2001, the GVR Scheme has been reviewed on a regular basis. &nbsp;In January 2006, the rebates were enhanced from 20% of the open market value of the vehicle to 40%.&nbsp; Since then, the number of green vehicles has increased from about 200 to more than 5,400 as at end 2008.&nbsp; As a proportion of the total car population, the number of green cars here is still low, at about 1%, but this is comparable to countries such as the UK and the USA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p align=left>Column: 2390<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased to announce that the GVR scheme will be extended by another&nbsp;two years till 31st December 2011.&nbsp; The Government will continue to review the GVR scheme, taking into account changes in vehicle technology and more stringent emission standards for diesel vehicles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Charles Chong asked about our efforts to promote CNG vehicles, and Mr Edwin Khew also spoke about this during the Budget debate.&nbsp; The GVR has facilitated the initial adoption of CNG vehicles as a cleaner alternative to diesel vehicles.&nbsp; CNG vehicles have also enjoyed exemption from the special tax which is levied in lieu of a fuel tax.&nbsp; As MOF announced in the Budget this year, this exemption will be extended for another&nbsp;two years till December 2011.&nbsp; NEA has also supported private sector efforts to develop CNG refuelling infrastructure by providing co-funding for the start-up costs of&nbsp;three stations.&nbsp; There are now&nbsp;three CNG refuelling stations, and I understand that this is expected to increase to&nbsp;five by the end of this year with the opening of a station at Serangoon North and another at Toh Tuck.&nbsp; Now that the Government has facilitated the set up of the initial refuelling infrastructure, further expansion on a sustainable basis must take into account the private sector&rsquo;s business considerations.&nbsp; At some point, we hope that the private sector can pick up from where we have stopped to work together with other private sector players to build up the infrastructure.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

All construction sites must abide by noise limits set by the NEA.&nbsp; These limits vary </p> <p align=left>Column: 2391<p><p>by time period and by the type of premise affected by the construction noise.&nbsp; For instance, night-time noise limits are more stringent than day-time noise limits, and noise limits are more stringent for construction sites near hospitals and schools.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of complaints on construction noise received by NEA increased from about 9,200 in 2007 to just over 14,100 in 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the reasons for this increase is the rise in construction activity in Singapore. &nbsp;Another reason could be the higher expectations from our public, as pointed out by Mr Liang.&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure that construction activities do not unduly affect quality of life, NEA tightened the noise limits for night-time and Sundays and public holidays&nbsp;from October 2007.&nbsp; NEA also increased the maximum fine for construction noise violations from $20,000 to $40,000.&nbsp; Furthermore, contractors that repeatedly violate the noise limits will have the operation hours at their sites restricted.&nbsp; In 2008, 10 work restriction orders were issued.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we strive to improve our quality of life, we must allow construction to keep pace with our development.&nbsp; The current approach of setting noise limits to regulate the industry, instead of banning construction activities during certain times, allows the construction industry the flexibility to adopt solutions to minimise noise, and avoids imposing undue cost on the construction industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Liang Eng Hwa and Mr Charles Chong also raised the issue of traffic noise.&nbsp; NEA, together with LTA, URA and HDB, has explored measures to minimise the impact of traffic noise on residents living along expressways and roads.&nbsp; Measures which have been implemented include noise-absorptive road paving</p> <p align=left>Column: 2392<p><p>materials, buffer distances, and even siting industrial buildings, multi-storey carparks or parks between major roads and residential buildings to act as noise shields.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, new vehicles must meet noise standards before they can be registered, while in-use vehicles must comply with noise standards when they undergo their mandatory periodic inspections.&nbsp; Noise disturbances from motor vehicles arise mainly from the illegal modification of the exhaust systems.&nbsp; NEA will continue to work with LTA to take action against such vehicles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is a highly urbanised compact city with vibrant economic activities, and noise pollution cannot be eradicated completely. &nbsp;However, my Ministry will continue to work with key stakeholders to regularly review the management of construction and traffic noise, taking into account public feedback and international best practice.&nbsp; We also note&nbsp;Mr Liang's&nbsp;suggestions on community noise and NEA will look into them with HDB and the Town Councils.&nbsp; While some degree of noise is inevitable in our compact city, we agree with Mr Liang that if each of us shows consideration for our neighbours, all of us will enjoy a more pleasant living environment.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Charles Chong, Dr Mohamad Maliki and Mdm Ho Geok Choo asked about the dengue situation.&nbsp; In the absence of a vaccine, Singapore will continue to be susceptible to dengue transmission as we are located in a dengue endemic region.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historically, Singapore experienced dengue in cycles of&nbsp;six to&nbsp;seven years, with cases increasing each year and peaking in the 6th or 7th year.&nbsp; We saw the beginning of a new cycle in 2007, and further increases in annual dengue incidence were anticipated for 2008 and beyond.&nbsp; I am pleased to inform the House </p> <p align=left>Column: 2393<p><p>that we bucked the trend last year.&nbsp; Instead of a rise, there was a 20% decline in dengue cases, from about 8,800 reported cases in 2007 to just over 7,000 in 2008.&nbsp; This would not have been possible without our collective efforts to prevent mosquito breeding.&nbsp; We must build on this and strengthen our efforts to control dengue.&nbsp; As Mr Heng Chee How mentioned during the Budget debate, dengue is still a threat and we must not let our guard down and continue to remain vigilant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is a travel hub with as many as 10 million visitors a year, and with workers transiting in and out of Singapore daily, it is continually at risk of outbreaks from mosquito borne diseases contributed by imported cases, be it dengue or Chikungunya.&nbsp; &nbsp; Keeping our mosquito population low through effective source reduction will serve to minimise such risk.&nbsp; Thus, NEA will continue to sustain its integrated approach to dengue control, with pre-emptive source reduction as the key thrust, complemented by active virus and mosquito surveillance, public education, research and enforcement&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to carry out intensive source reduction exercises to reduce the mosquito population ahead of the peak dengue transmission season from June to October.&nbsp; Source reduction has been assessed by the World Health Organisation as the most effective means of controlling the mosquito vector.&nbsp; But it is also labour-intensive.&nbsp; NEA has strengthened its vector control workforce since 2007, recruiting some additional 500 personnel.&nbsp; This has also strengthened our capacity to control the risks posed by Chikungunya, which I will elaborate on later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nonetheless, we must know where to focus our limited resources.&nbsp; Using a risk assessment approach, NEA has focused </p> <p align=left>Column: 2394<p><p>its manpower in areas that are highly susceptible to outbreaks, averting large dengue clusters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA will also continue to build up vector control knowledge and capability through research at the Environmental Health Institute where new tools are developed and evaluated.&nbsp; For example, a test that can simultaneously detect the dengue and Chikungunya viruses is currently under development with the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology and Tan Tock Seng Hospital.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I agree with Er Lee Bee Wah and Dr Maliki that we must increase Singaporeans' sense of responsibility in reducing dengue and Chikungunya.&nbsp; Public education is a key element of our dengue prevention efforts. The results have been encouraging.&nbsp; An NEA survey showed that the awareness level for dengue prevention was high, more than 90%,</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

More positively, the number of homes found with Aedes mosquito breedings per 100 homes inspected, decreased from 0.53 in 2005 to 0.34 in 2008.&nbsp; I am heartened by the good support we have received from the public, but we must aim to do even better.&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping our premises mosquito-free should become a way of life for Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.45 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure&nbsp;Er Lee that NEA is very clear that our target is to suppress the mosquito population.&nbsp; Hence,&nbsp;we&nbsp;will continue to work closely with premise owners like the nursery operators,&nbsp;and educate them on best practices.&nbsp; Having </p> <p align=left>Column: 2395<p><p>said that, enforcement action must be taken against those who persist in mosquito breeding so as to ensure that we do not miss our target.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore also collaborates with other countries in the area of dengue control.&nbsp; For example, under the Asia-Pacific Dengue Partnership (APDP) we worked with the Western Pacific and South-East Asian Regional Offices of the World Health Organisation to formulate a Dengue Strategic Plan for both regions. &nbsp;The Plan was endorsed by the Health Ministers in September last year and serves as a roadmap for member states to formulate their national plans for dengue control.&nbsp; We will continue to work closely with the international community to promote greater knowledge sharing in the region.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In January last year, we detected the first local transmission of Chikungunya fever.&nbsp; A total of 718 cases were reported in 2008, about 75% locally acquired.&nbsp; Although Chikungunya is not considered endemic currently, we can expect sustained local transmission of Chikungunya this year.&nbsp; In January, 159 cases were notified, compared to 13 in the same period last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with dengue, vector control is the key strategy to prevent the transmission of Chikungunya.&nbsp; NEA and MOH are working closely in the surveillance for Chikungunya.&nbsp; As soon as a case is notified, NEA initiates vector control operations to clear the implicated areas of mosquito breeding.&nbsp; MOH also made the disease legally notifiable last December.&nbsp; This will contribute to timelier reporting of cases, and allow NEA to undertake prompt vector control measures.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As&nbsp;Er Lee pointed out,&nbsp;Chikungunya can cause morbidity and strain our healthcare system.&nbsp; The only way to minimise the individual risk and disease burden is for each of us to prevent</p>  <p align=left>Column: 2396<p><p>mosquito breeding as this is the most effective way to overcome the scourge of the disease.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Charles Chong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Littering is a threat to public health and we cannot take lightly.&nbsp; Especially in our warm and humid climate, litter attracts rodents, flies and cockroaches.&nbsp; It can be a breeding ground for mosquitoes and bacteria, spreading harmful diseases.&nbsp; Taxpayers have to bear the cost of enforcement as well as that of clearing carelessly discarded litter.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of offenders caught littering has ballooned over the years from 3,819 in 2005 to more than 30,000 people caught for littering in 2008.&nbsp; The increase has been attributed mainly to the step up in enforcement efforts by&nbsp;NEA.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in December, a newsletter reported that since 2006, NEA has had dedicated 322 man hours per day to catching litterbugs&nbsp;with 500 officers </p> <p align=left>Column: 2397<p><p>empowered to take action against them,&nbsp;while another 50 officers to catch litterbugs as well as those who caught smoking in banned places.&nbsp; There is no doubt that the extra manpower has indeed proven effective in catching litterbugs,&nbsp;judging from the number of offenders caught littering and proactive work orders issued.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the sheer number of offenders show up clearly the fact that there are still many people out there who think nothing of littering.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is impractical if we were to rely on public education and campaigns alone to tackle the problem of littering.&nbsp; As we have a large number of foreigners and visitors at any given time from different cultures and different strata of society who bring with them different standards and practices of cleanliness and environmental awareness, it is not always possible for everyone to appreciate the message of our Anti-Litter Campaigns,&nbsp;nor is it possible for law enforcement alone to fully eradicate the problem of littering.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think, like it or not, to keep our city clean, we need to get out the tongs and brooms and clean up the litter left inconsiderately behind.&nbsp; I would suggest that operators of outdoor and open air eating establishments be tasked with the responsibility of clearing up any mass or litter that their patrons leave behind within a certain perimeter of their premises.&nbsp; They should be made to comply with the stipulated cleanliness standards by certain times of the day, for example, 2.30 pm, 11.00 pm and 7.00 am.&nbsp; This way, NEA would be able to substantially cut down on the number of enforcement efforts and officers who make the daily tedious time-consuming patrols.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From what I hear, NEA's enforcement officers have also been diligently catching smokers for littering their cigarette butts.&nbsp; </p> <p align=left>Column: 2398<p><p>It is quite easy to nab such an offender.&nbsp; You see a smoker in a public place and if&nbsp;there is no ash tray nearby, chances are that&nbsp;if he finishes his cigarette, he will simply throw his cigarette butt onto the floor and most probably even stub it out with the&nbsp;sole of his shoe.&nbsp;This is quite a common sight.&nbsp; However, it takes some time for an enforcement officer to observe the would-be offender and wait for him to finish his smoke.&nbsp; I question if all these hundreds of hours are well-spent.&nbsp; Is there some way that NEA can deploy&nbsp;its limited resources more efficiently?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Er Edwin Khew Teck Fook--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But I think the task of sustaining public cleanliness will become increasingly&nbsp;challenging as Singapore's population grows over the last eight years.&nbsp; For example, from 2000 to 2008, we saw an increase in total population from 4 million to 4.8 million and this will continue to grow to 6.5 million in the next 10 to 20 years,&nbsp;as projected by the MND.&nbsp;

Next, littering still seems to be an issue in Singapore today.&nbsp; Results of the NEA's littering behaviour study showed that 13.6% of the respondents thought littering was a socially acceptable behaviour, while 8.6% said littering would not lead to hygiene problems.&nbsp; In addition, it was reported that since 2006, the number of litterbugs caught had gone up significantly,&nbsp;ie,&nbsp;in the first 11 months of 2008 alone, about 30,000 litterbugs&nbsp;have been&nbsp;caught.&nbsp;

Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> Mr Chairman,&nbsp; several Members have raised a number of questions on public cleanliness.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, maintaining high standards of public cleanliness is important, not only to protect public health. &nbsp;It is also integral to our efforts to ensure that Singapore develops sustainably and remains a clean and green city of gardens and water.&nbsp; Each of us must play our part.&nbsp; For</p> <p align=left>Column: 2403<p><p>instance, while the Government can invest in infrastructure to transform our waterways under the ABC Waters programme, which I will elaborate on later, residents must keep the waters clean.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA adopts a multi-pronged approach to sustaining public cleanliness, comprising an effective cleaning regime, public engagement, and penalties and enforcement to deter littering behaviour.&nbsp; As Mr Edwin Khew pointed out, the growing population will put more stress on our cleaning regime.&nbsp; In fact, NEA has already committed additional resources to clean up littering hotspot areas, such as Little India, Chinatown and Geylang.&nbsp; This cannot continue indefinitely.&nbsp; We must tackle the source of the problem, which is littering.&nbsp; NEA has stepped up enforcement against littering and the number of offenders caught increased from about 4,000 in 2005 to 33,000 in 2008.&nbsp; The increase clearly shows that littering remains a concern in Singapore, and we should work harder to tackle&nbsp;this problem.&nbsp; We are mindful of our enforcement limitations, as Mr Ong Kian Min pointed out, but NEA will continue to focus its enforcement efforts at littering hotspots to achieve maximum effectiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from sustained enforcement, our penalties must act as effective deterrents.&nbsp; The fines for littering offences were last revised 10 years ago.&nbsp; To ensure continued deterrence, NEA will raise the composition sum for first time minor littering offenders from $200 to $300 from&nbsp;April this year.&nbsp; NEA will continue to review the need to stiffen other punitive measures against littering.&nbsp; Having said that, every individual,&nbsp;however,&nbsp;must take ownership over public cleanliness, as&nbsp;Er Lee Bee Wah mentioned earlier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Four decades have passed since the first "Keep Singapore Clean" campaign was launched by then Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew.&nbsp; To reinforce the importance of public cleanliness, NEA</p> <p align=left>Column: 2404<p><p>plans to launch a new national cleanliness campaign this year. &nbsp;This campaign will be driven by activities involving key stakeholders, such as the grassroots, schools, the youth and businesses.&nbsp; We hope that the campaign will also instil a greater sense of community ownership and pride over the cleanliness of our city, as we prepare to host the Youth Olympic Games in 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving forward, we will also seek to deepen our understanding of littering behaviour, so that our programmes remain effective in tackling the littering problem.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Mdm Ho Geok Choo spoke about our hawker centres.&nbsp; In 2001, my Ministry launched the Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme (HUP) to improve the fa&ccedil;ade and interior of hawker centres, so that they will continue to provide a clean, hygienic and pleasant dining environment.&nbsp; To date, 71 centres have been upgraded.&nbsp; Eight centres are now undergoing upgrading and the remaining 32 centres are expected to be upgraded within the next few years, in consultation with the respective Advisers. &nbsp;In the meantime, periodic repair works will continue to be carried out at these centres, where necessary, to ensure their functionality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NEA has a stringent regulatory regime to ensure good food hygiene practices.&nbsp; All hawkers and their assistants are educated on food hygiene knowledge before they can operate. &nbsp;Food stalls are routinely assessed on their cleanliness and food hygiene standards.&nbsp; Licensees are liable for demerit points if they flout food hygiene and other rules, and recalcitrant offenders have their licences suspended or even revoked.&nbsp; In addition, the poor performers will be inspected more frequently until they have made the grade.&nbsp; The proportion of stalls that achieved at least a "B" grading improved from 46% in 2002 to 86% last year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as with other businesses, hawkers are facing a difficult time in this </p> <p align=left>Column: 2405<p><p>downturn.&nbsp; To ease the burden on hawkers, NEA will provide a monthly 15% rental rebate to market-rent paying stallholders in NEA-managed markets and food centres&nbsp;from January to December this year. &nbsp;Some 5,300 stallholders will qualify for the rebates, which will amount to about $5.6 million.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Public waste collectors (PWCs) are licensed by NEA to ensure they have the proper vehicles, equipment and trained personnel to deliver quality and reliable refuse collection services.&nbsp; For instance, the drivers and workers are trained and certified under the National Skills Recognition Scheme.&nbsp; Refuse collection trucks are required to be washed daily to ensure the vehicles are clean and free from odour. &nbsp;NEA carries out regular checks on the PWCs to ensure that their vehicles and staff meet the service standards.&nbsp; When NEA comes across any lapses, warnings and financial penalties are imposed on the PWC.&nbsp; For instance, last year, there were&nbsp;five cases where PWCs were penalised for spilling</p> <p align=left>Column: 2406<p><p>refuse or sullage water.&nbsp; NEA also re-checks the errant PWCs to ensure the lapse in service standards has been rectified.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We note Mr Chiam's feedback and assure him that NEA will continue to be vigilant in its enforcement to minimise the incidence of, say,&nbsp;dirty garbage trucks and unprofessional garbage collectors.&nbsp; I wish to address Mr Ang Mong Seng's&nbsp;concern&nbsp;on what he has described as "mountains of trash" in Jurong. &nbsp;I suppose I am answering also because I am the Mayor for Southwest District.&nbsp; Our investigations show that these items are, in fact, not trash but woodchips and horticultural waste kept within the premises of a charcoal manufacturing company in Jurong to be used as raw materials. &nbsp;The company has not caused any pollution to the environment, although the large stockpiles are unsightly and may pose a fire hazard.&nbsp; JTC and SCDF have been alerted and will be approaching the company to address these concerns.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Assoc. Prof. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim:</B> Sir,&nbsp; Mr Masagos Zulkifli asked for an update on the&nbsp;ABC Waters Programme.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;a strategic, long-term initiative to transform the urban landscape of our city.&nbsp; As Minister Mentor noted during a recent visit to the Eastern Coastal Park Connector Network, the ABC Waters Programme maximises our limited land space to give the most to everybody who wants to get out of the urban jungle.&nbsp; We will do this by carrying out 27 projects across the island by 2012.&nbsp; These will transform our drains, canals and reservoirs into beautiful and clean streams, rivers and lakes integrated into our neighbourhoods.&nbsp; By creating new community focal points and recreational spaces, the quality of living for residents will be enhanced.&nbsp; This is our vision of a "City of Gardens and Water".<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two pilot projects have been launched.&nbsp; The first project at Kolam Ayer </p> <p align=left>Column: 2407<p><p>was launched last year with strong support from the community.&nbsp; In fact, many have organised activities such as morning exercises and gardening by the waterfront, which have also served as a backdrop for community events, such as the National Day Observance Ceremony and the Mid Autumn Festival celebrations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Bedok Reservoir, work was completed on several new facilities such as a seating gallery, fishing deck and a floating stage.&nbsp; Bedok Reservoir has been transformed into an attractive venue for events, including&nbsp;water performances as part of the Singapore Arts Festival.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;also bookings to hold weddings on the floating stage and, recently, we saw the five MPs of Aljunied GRC releasing some fishes into our reservoir.<br>&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Works are underway at other projects, such as Sungei Punggol, Lower Seletar Reservoir and Pandan Reservoir.&nbsp; Works will also commence at Alexandra Canal, Sungei Serangoon@Lorong Halus, Jurong Lake, Kallang River@Bishan Park and Sungei Whampoa@St George's Lane. Let me give a sneak preview of a few of them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The concrete canal along Kallang River@Bishan Park will be transformed into a picturesque river.&nbsp; Attractions will be created by the water, such as a promenade with an amphitheatre and alfresco dining.&nbsp; Together with NParks' plans to revitalise Bishan Park, visitors will get to enjoy a whole new "green-blue" park experience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the Alexandra Canal project, a key feature is the urban wetlands, which will employ different wetland plants and their natural properties to clean the water.&nbsp; This provides an excellent opportunity for outdoor classes for the nearby schools and community learning.&nbsp; Support and buy-in from the community are key to the long-term success of the ABC Waters </p> <p align=left>Column: 2408<p><p>Programme.&nbsp; With experience gained from the pilot projects, we will continue to consult and engage grassroots, schools and residents and encourage them to organise and participate in activities in and around the projects.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lim Wee Kiak asked if projects under the ABC Waters Programme will be brought forward.&nbsp; Following a review, we have brought some of them forward by a few months.&nbsp; This is the best we can do, since the projects require detailed design and, more importantly, consultation with the community, which are important processes and should not be hastily done.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For now, we will also concentrate on implementing the initial batch of the 27 projects, before we move on to others.&nbsp; Under the long-term masterplan, over 100 potential sites, including some in Sungei Sembawang, have been identified, and we will take in ideas and requests in deciding the next batch of projects.&nbsp; So, Dr Lim, please queue up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ABC Waters projects have also offered rich opportunities for research and innovation. &nbsp;Features such as rain gardens, bio-retention swales and wetlands can be natural purification systems to improve water quality in our reservoirs and waterways.&nbsp; The PUB has embarked on a few pilot projects to test the feasibility and benefits of these features under local conditions.&nbsp; An experimental rain garden was developed with HDB at Balam Estate.&nbsp; This showed that up to 98% of suspended solids and 85% of nitrogen could be removed from stormwater runoff through natural vegetation and membrane treatment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the results from our pilot studies, we hope to encourage the adoption of such features on a larger scale.&nbsp; A few agencies have visited Balam Estate to learn about the design and benefits, and explore the introduction of similar features in their developments.&nbsp; To help them get</p> <p align=left>Column: 2409<p><p>started, PUB will develop a design guide on ABC Waters features and conduct technical talks to build up industry capabilities.&nbsp; Under a research partnership&nbsp;with PUB, NUS and Delft Hydraulics, an aquatic science centre is also being set up along Sungei Ulu Pandan.&nbsp; This living laboratory will allow hands-on and in-depth study into the interactions between biological organisms and water quality in urban water systems. &nbsp;In the longer term, there is potential to integrate the ABC Waters Design features into our urban stormwater management strategy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Efforts to ensure clean and beautiful water bodies will also be directed at the new Marina Reservoir.&nbsp; As part of continuing efforts to augment Singapore's local water supply, the Marina Barrage was completed last year and officially opened by our Prime Minister&nbsp;in October.&nbsp; The Marina Reservoir that is formed behind the Barrage will allow us to collect rainwater from the largest catchment in Singapore.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Since its opening, visitorship has been high, with nearly 200,000 visitors as at end January.&nbsp; Events held at the Barrage include the launch of Clean and Green Singapore, and the New Year&rsquo;s countdown party.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4.15 pm</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the Barrage in place, the absence of tidal flushing will result in the accumulation of pollutants in the reservoir.&nbsp; While advances in membrane technology enable us to treat the water to drinking water standards, the bigger challenge is in keeping the Marina Reservoir clean, to maintain its aesthetic quality and suitability for water-based recreational activities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p align=left>Column: 2410<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure silt from construction sites does not enter our waters, we require all major construction sites in the catchment to install erosion control measures.&nbsp; A series of programmes to rehabilitate ageing sewers was undertaken to reduce the risk of sewage leaks or overflow.&nbsp; We also tackle littering and illegal discharges into our drains through regular surveillance and enforcement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding these measures, water quality is expected to fluctuate more widely during the&nbsp;one to two-year transition before the reservoir turns into a fresh water body.&nbsp; Some silty water can still be expected after a heavy rainfall.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have similar measures to improve water quality in our other catchments, including the new reservoirs at Punggol and Serangoon that are currently undergoing construction.&nbsp; There are a few sewage treatment plants in these areas and although they comply with strict discharge standards, we will phase out as many as possible to minimise the pollution risks.&nbsp; We will also rehabilitate ageing sewers in these areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Mr Masagos pointed out, any litter thrown into&nbsp;our canals in areas as far upstream as Ang Mo Kio will end up in the Marina Reservoir.&nbsp; While we have measures such as covering drains in litter prone areas, using gratings to trap litter, and stepping up surveillance and enforcements on littering, the public needs to play its part in keeping our waters clean.&nbsp; The ABC Waters Programme challenges a mindset: to keep our waters clean, do we keep people away, or do we bring them nearer?&nbsp; We believe that by bringing water into people&rsquo;s lives, by encouraging them to come closer to the waters and interact with it, they will develop ownership and help to keep it clean.&nbsp; Ultimately, the continued preservation of our water catchments depends on the efforts of all Singaporeans to keep our waterways free from pollution.</p> <p align=left>Column: 2411<p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have a shared responsibility to ensure sustainable development.&nbsp; Companies can develop and deploy technologies and products that are more environmentally-friendly than today, and incorporate environmental considerations into their operations and procedures.&nbsp; Citizens must embrace a lifestyle that considers the environment and limits resource consumption in their daily lives.&nbsp; Government will promote sustainability by setting an example, demonstrating our commitment, and involving people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sustainable development is a long-term process with long-term objectives.&nbsp; It means focusing on the horizon, rather than quick fixes; targeting prevention now, rather than putting right later; caring for the environment as part of our choices today, rather than dealing with the consequences of neglect down the line.&nbsp; We have heard the story of the Singapore River and it took us 10 years to clean it up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By considering the longer term implications of our decisions, Government, producers and consumers can achieve economic, social and environmental objectives all at the same time.&nbsp; Environmental improvements can reinforce long-term economic and social objectives, such as better health, more efficient use of energy and competitiveness, and vice versa.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By working together, our economy, our society and our environment can grow and develop in tandem.&nbsp; In this way, we can secure a better and brighter future for our children.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Abdullah Tarmugi--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

However, there are technical and economic considerations when dealing with nuclear energy.&nbsp; Even though nuclear energy is low carbon, we have to take a look at it very carefully, at issues of safety, siting and waste disposal, given Singapore's small size and high population density.&nbsp; So it is not off the table.&nbsp; It has to be studied very carefully because there are long-term implications.&nbsp; So we want to keep all options on the table at this point in time.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Hri Kumar Nair--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

What the Member is asking is from 10.00 pm to 7.00 am.&nbsp;&nbsp;The noise limit is set for 10.00 pm to 7.00 am, which is&nbsp;night time.&nbsp;&nbsp;For Sundays, 10.00 pm to 7.00 am, sleeping time, it is actually set at a similar level, 55 dBA, and there is no difference.&nbsp;

So we have tightened the noise limit set for these periods and also increased the penalties enforced.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have noted in my reply earlier, the approach we have taken is really to set the noise limits to regulate the industry instead of enforcing a total ban at certain times, be it night time or Sundays and public holidays.&nbsp; And we are not the only country that does this.&nbsp; In fact, Hong Kong, which is equally compact and urbanised, also uses the same approach.&nbsp; As I have explained in my reply earlier, this is because we want to ensure that our construction can keep pace with the needs of the economy, in terms of infrastructure development, and so on.&nbsp; And, of course, there is also an implication on cost.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will continue to monitor the situation and continue to work with our stakeholders to review our management of construction noise, taking into account, of course, public feedback, as well as expectations and international best practice.&nbsp;

Sir, I thank the Government for allocating more funds to healthcare.&nbsp; At 4% of the GDP, our health expenditure is one of the lowest in the world but this cannot be sustained for long because of our rapidly ageing population.&nbsp; While I am happy with the increased budget, I am disappointed that there is no Medisave top-up this year, which would have helped to lighten the burden of our elderly and low-income earners with little or no</p> <p align=left>Column: 2416<p><p>Medisave balances, particularly during these very difficult times.&nbsp; I hope that the Government could still consider Medisave top-ups for this year, which would be a great relief to many.&nbsp; In the meantime, I urge our hospitals and&nbsp;polyclinics to be more passionate&nbsp;and flexible in helping retrenched and needy Singaporeans.&nbsp; I ask them not to be too rigidly tied to some prescribed criteria&nbsp;and conditions when approving appeals for financial assistance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, healthcare costs have been rising and are a major concern among Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;Average public&nbsp;hospital bills have increased across all&nbsp;ward classes.&nbsp; For instance, the Class C ward&nbsp;costs $1,112&nbsp;in 2007, up 30% from $858 in 2006.&nbsp; As for B2 wards, it went up by 17% from $1,094 in 2006 to $1,284 in 2007.&nbsp; Also, although our C Class and B2 wards are highly subsidised, the same level of subsidy does not cover the entire bill.&nbsp; For example, a&nbsp;knee transplant may be done at the C Class or B2 ward, but the patient may not get the 80% or 65% subsidy on the implant used for the knee transplant.&nbsp; I raised the same concern over the lower subsidy for stent implants some years ago, and stent implants now have a higher subsidy, but other types of implants continue to have low subsidies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me cite a specific example from a real B2 bill for a unilateral total knee transplant.&nbsp; The cost of the implant was $2,457, the Government subsidy was only $500.&nbsp; The patient, therefore, had to pay $1,957.&nbsp; The rest of the bill for ward medications and consultations continue to receive the 65% subsidy.&nbsp; I urge the Minister to review this policy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><B>[Mdm Deputy Speaker (Ms Indranee Rajah) in the Chair]</B></p><p align="center">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">4.29 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When the bills are large, even a few percentage points make a big difference in terms of the amount paid.&nbsp; Much has been done over the last few years to the credit of&nbsp;Ministry of Health to refine our 3M framework to help manage healthcare costs.&nbsp;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In view of the concerns on ever-rising healthcare cost, I would like to ask&nbsp;the Minister the following questions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, what measures are in place to ensure that healthcare continues to remain accessible and affordable to all Singaporeans? Secondly, Singaporeans favour greater flexibility in the use of the Medisave funds than currently allowed.&nbsp; A common complaint from Singaporeans is "I have money in my Medisave but yet I have to pay cash for medical bills which I do not have."&nbsp; And this causes them stress and anguish.&nbsp; So I would like to request that the Minister review the following three areas under Medisave:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Consider increasing the Medisave withdrawal limits for higher ward classes in subsidised patients so that patients will pay less out-of-pocket expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;With means testing, some people will have to pay more. And if the withdrawal limits are not raised, it will be&nbsp;a great strain on them;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; Consider allowing Medisave to be used for overseas hospitalisation. Many Singaporeans I spoke to are in favour of this as they are already heading overseas for cheaper treatments in order to cut down on their medical bills, especially our retirees. Of course, there will have to be safeguards to prevent abuse and to ensure quality care, as the Ministry&nbsp;will have less control over overseas care.&nbsp; But I am sure these are details which the </p> <p align=left>Column: 2418<p><p>Ministry can address once there is an agreement on the principle.&nbsp; Some doctors may also be unhappy over this move because there could be an outflow of patients, but I believe we should put patients' interest first; and</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; Consider allowing Medisave withdrawal for other outpatient treatments, such as for mental illness and dementia, which I also have raised on previous occasions.

Some may also be forced to seek treatment at private hospitals and incur higher cost as a result.&nbsp; Hence, could the Minister enlighten this House, now that construction costs are coming down, to what extent will the Ministry capitalise on the lower construction cost to step up building or renovation&nbsp;programmes to increase its capacity and ability?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Madam, even as the Ministry tries to control demand as a way of curbing cost, there is also a need for supply side cost control and other regulatory measures to prevent unnecessary or over-utilisation of healthcare. With the dismantling of the guidelines on fees at the SMA, there is no mechanism for the public to complain if doctors overcharge and this may cause healthcare costs to go up.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether he is monitoring the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;If patients today have any complaints against doctors for overcharging, how can they seek redress?</p></span></div> <p align=left>Column: 2419<p>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Cost of Healthcare</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zainudin Nordin (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</B> Madam, I read recently that the United States spends nearly 17% of its gross domestic product on healthcare, while Singapore spends about 4% of its&nbsp;GDP.&nbsp; However, we have been regarded as a healthcare superstar, especially when compared to the United States.&nbsp; Life expectancy at birth in the United States&nbsp; is 78 years; while in Singapore, it is 82 years.&nbsp; The Singapore infant mortality rate is at 2.3 deaths per 1,000 live births, versus 6.4 in the United States. As some have noted, these trends persist despite the fact that the United States has far more care-givers:&nbsp; 2.6 physicians per 1,000 people, compared with 1.4 physicians in Singapore.&nbsp; According to the World Health Organisation, Singapore has one of the best healthcare systems, and the 3M&nbsp;&ndash; Medisave, Medicare and Medifund schemes&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;has often been quoted as best practice in managing the costs of public healthcare.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, our healthcare policies which have been successful in meeting the needs of Singaporeans have also its limitation.&nbsp; Some of it is our efforts in encouraging self-reliance.&nbsp; Keeping healthcare affordable, promoting a healthy lifestyle and engaging the community in the provision of healthcare, have been quite lacking but have improved somewhat lately. Ensuring that Singaporeans continue to enjoy a high quality of healthcare services, to me, is one of the most important things in Singapore. I am glad that we have also put in a mechanism to ensure that healthcare resources are allocated to those in need of them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, Madam, with the rising cost of living and inflation, Singaporeans should naturally be concerned with the cost of healthcare.&nbsp; It is likely that the healthcare costs will rise in the future.</p> <p align=left>Column: 2420<p><p>This is largely because of the rise in medical treatment, equipment and medicine as well as the projected increase in the number of senior citizens in our country.&nbsp; Moreover, with the restructuring of hospitals, it could very well mean that higher hospital bills for our patients in Singapore could be a thing that is common in Singapore. And when hospitals are given more freedom to reorganise to meet the needs of Singaporeans, this could possibly lead to a reduction in the amount of subsidies given to hospitals. Medical bills would likely increase and healthcare would not be affordable for Singaporeans in longer term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this in mind, Madam, how do we ensure that we are proactively increasing the awareness of affordability of healthcare and prudence in the healthcare spending for Singaporeans? &nbsp;Secondly, will the means testing that has been put in place ensure that Singaporeans know how to manage their healthcare?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To reduce cost of healthcare, like Mdm Halimah has said, there have been requests for&nbsp;Medisave to be used for overseas treatment.&nbsp; What is MOH's position and guidelines on this?&nbsp; What are the concerns if this is allowed?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Gautam Banerjee (Nominated Member)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Human Capital in the Health Sector</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Gautam Banerjee (Nominated Member):</B> Madam, I would like to compliment the Ministry of Health for maintaining a very high standard of healthcare and medical services in Singapore.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some countries, patients have to endure long delays before they can see a specialist.&nbsp; In other countries, one needs to travel abroad when he is down with certain illnesses, because specialist healthcare services are simply not available at home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p align=left>Column: 2421<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, we can take pride in an efficient and readily accessible healthcare system.&nbsp; Here, affordable healthcare and medical services are generally available to all.&nbsp; Our hospitals are well-equipped with the necessary technology, equipment and specialists to deal with various diseases.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in view of our greying population and the increasingly high level of stress that Singaporeans face, we have to continue to invest in healthcare.&nbsp; I am therefore pleased to note that the Budget has made provisions for additional medical infrastructure in the form of new hospitals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as we build new hospitals, we also need to give sufficient attention to the software in our hospitals.&nbsp; In the quest to build more hospitals,&nbsp;provide more medical services&nbsp;and&nbsp;better serve patients, our health sector will be in need of more human capital.&nbsp; We can train and groom some of these resources locally, but this is unlikely to be enough.&nbsp; We will also need to bring in foreign doctors and nurses not just to meet basic needs but foreign specialists and consultants who can add value to the healthcare standards in Singapore.&nbsp; We should also have a programme to contact Singaporean doctors working overseas and woo them back.&nbsp; We must be wary of leakage of our home-grown talent in an increasingly connected and competitive world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we bring in new locally-trained doctors as well as foreign doctors, nurses and other hospital staff, I would like the Ministry to pay more attention to their career development.&nbsp; Due to the growing and pressing needs in our hospitals, I am concerned that our young doctors and foreign medical talents may be thrown too quickly into the thick of action and get burnt out.&nbsp; How are their progress and conditions being monitored?&nbsp; Do we have mentoring and coaching programmes?&nbsp;</p> <p align=left>Column: 2422<p><p>Are pay and conditions competitive not only locally but with other aspiring medical hubs overseas?&nbsp; Madam,&nbsp;I would like to seek an assurance from the Minister that we are doing enough to attract, develop and retain our human capital in the healthcare industry.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Employability and Job Availability</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Fatimah Lateef (Marine Parade):</B> Madam, the healthcare sector is one known to be very proactive in the provision of jobs to retirees and also to those starting up with a second career, be it after retrenchment, loss of jobs or staying out of the workforce for some time.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, it has been announced that the healthcare sector will have several thousand job openings in the next few years.

Can this Scheme be extended to</p> <p align=left>Column: 2426<p><p>the private sector as well?&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to look into this.&nbsp; Following means testing, Singaporeans will enjoy the Government subsidies on a sliding scale.&nbsp; I hope that the Ministry will be more flexible in implementing the medical insurance scheme in view of the present economic recession. Some lower and even the middle income Singaporeans may have financial difficulties&nbsp;in this economic downturn. Although we know the 3M schemes are very good, there are always some cases which are not covered by the 3M schemes. I hope that the Ministry of Health will consider having some flexible schemes to help people with special needs.&nbsp; Can our MediShield cover all our children from birth, using an opt-out scheme instead of the opt-in scheme?<br></p></P></span></div><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

An example will be the Chronic Diseases Management Programme&nbsp;(CDMP) where Medisave is allowed to be used for the cost of outpatient treatment, up to a cap of $300 per Medisave account&nbsp;per year.&nbsp; The diseases covered under the CDMP include hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia&nbsp;and stroke when the programme first started, and has since been extended to include COPD and asthma.&nbsp; However, many Singaporeans visit their doctors for a myriad of medical problems, many of which are not included in the CDMP.&nbsp; I would like to urge the Minister to consider extending this coverage to all diseases, including mental illnesses, but still subject to similar restrictions of capping the maximum withdrawal to $300 per account per year.&nbsp; This would prevent premature depletion of the Medisave savings but, at the same time, help Singaporeans decrease the out-of-pocket expenditure for medical treatment,</p> <p align=left>Column: 2427<p><p>especially in challenging economic times like this.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The cost of treating complex congenital illnesses can be expensive and financially draining for many families.&nbsp; I hope the Minister can consider the following&nbsp;&ndash; make MediShield coverage for housewives as an opt-out scheme, just like it has been facilitated for newborns and extending the MediShield coverage for congenital illnesses, to give parents a peace of mind that their newborns will still be covered by MediShield should they be born with any congenital diseases.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This list should initially only include clear-cut diagnosis, such as schizophrenia, manic depressive syndrome, etc.&nbsp; This implementation will then need to be monitored closely with feedback obtained from end users to check for feasibility and need for fine-tuning.&nbsp;

This is because we have prepared for rainy days like these over the last 25 years. There are more than $46 billion in our "healthcare reserves" in Medisave, Medifund and ElderCare Fund, most of it in Singaporeans' individual accounts.&nbsp; I think $42 billion of the $46 billion&nbsp;are in their Medisave accounts and the other $4 billion are in endowment funds which belong to everybody, which we hold in trust on behalf of Singaporeans.&nbsp; With our healthcare reserves, Singaporeans do not have to forego essential healthcare treatment during the recession.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have carefully constructed this year&rsquo;s Health Budget.&nbsp; There will be special schemes to help patients tide over the recession.&nbsp; But our eyes&nbsp;are also&nbsp;on the future when the economy recovers.&nbsp; We are paying particular attention to opportunities which are emerging as a result of the recession and we will seize these opportunities to further strengthen our healthcare system.&nbsp;&nbsp;For this afternoon, let me first elaborate on the strategies which we will implement to cope with the immediate healthcare issues that the recession has brought.&nbsp; Later today, we will discuss the longer term strategies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To battle the recession, my Ministry has already implemented a number of initiatives during the past few months and I will not repeat them.&nbsp; Instead, let me focus on the new initiatives which we will undertake&nbsp;during the new financial year.&nbsp; They will benefit the healthcare sector directly and some will also&nbsp;have a positive impact on the rest of the economy as well.</p> <p align=left>Column: 2430<p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, as noted by Mdm Halimah, we have increased the health budget substantially, by nearly $1 billion, to $3.7 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am truly grateful to Finance Minister and the colleagues in the Ministry of Finance for their understanding and support.&nbsp; The increase comprises additional operating budget of $700 million and an&nbsp;additional capital budget of $300 million.&nbsp; These are very substantial increases.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Government subvention to our restructured hospitals and institutions will&nbsp;therefore grow from $2.0 to $2.7 billion. Of this, $2.2 billion will directly subsidise the patients&rsquo; medical bills.

The total new capital commitment is about $4 billion, which we have planned to take probably&nbsp;five years to complete.&nbsp; But because of the recession,&nbsp;I am&nbsp;bringing forward some of the projects to take advantage of the softening construction cost.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we will use the expanded health budget to hire and train more professionals to enhance patient care.&nbsp; This is something we have wanted to do incrementally over the medium term.&nbsp; But given the current recession, we decided to bring forward&nbsp;part of the plan.&nbsp; Over the next two years, we shall add 4,500 more jobs.

And a&nbsp;very important area raised by several Members&nbsp;&ndash; Mdm&nbsp;Halimah,&nbsp;Dr Lily&nbsp;Neo&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;for several years,&nbsp;is to&nbsp;forge greater integration of services, ie,&nbsp;between&nbsp; hospitals, specialists,&nbsp;nursing homes,&nbsp;GPs, and others.&nbsp; In particular, we need to reshape the traditional healthcare sector built around acute hospitals and acute care and to cope better with chronic illnesses.&nbsp; And in chronic care, we need multi-disciplinary teams based on many more nurses,</p>    <p align=left>Column: 2433<p> <p>therapists and&nbsp;other allied health professionals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we will help some of the retrenched Singaporeans take up a career in healthcare.&nbsp; We are creating at least 250 mid-career conversion opportunities for those who are retrenched.&nbsp; With the right attitude, they can be trained to become nurses, therapists, radiographers, pharmacy technicians or healthcare assistants.&nbsp; We subsidise the training costs and we&nbsp;pay the trainees quite a reasonable monthly allowance and guarantee them&nbsp;a job&nbsp;at the end of the training.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are prepared to do much more if there is stronger demand, and I hope there will be.&nbsp;We will also increase the number of scholarships and bursaries for students in the&nbsp;various allied health disciplines.&nbsp; This year, we will increase it&nbsp;by&nbsp;250&nbsp;but, as I said, budget really should not be the constraint.&nbsp; I hope there will be more demand and we will just grow the number.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, we are bringing forward some capital development projects, to capitalise on softening construction cost.&nbsp; Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in Yishun is on track to open next year.&nbsp; Because my constituency is in the North.&nbsp;&nbsp;I pass the worksite almost every day and I can see it shaping up.&nbsp; For a long time, it was submerged,&nbsp;for the basement work, but now it is above ground.&nbsp; The last time I saw, it was&nbsp;about&nbsp;Level&nbsp;4 now.&nbsp; So we are on track.&nbsp; We will open next year.&nbsp; The opening will directly benefit the patients living in the north, many from my constituency, but it will also relieve&nbsp;the pressure in Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Changi General Hospital where patient load has overflowed there.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The proposed Jurong General Hospital is being planned for 700 beds.&nbsp; I think this is in Ms&nbsp;Grace Fu's constituency but I am sure it will also benefit the whole Jurong </p> <p align=left>Column: 2434<p><p>GRC.&nbsp; Elsewhere, the Duke-NUS Medical School is&nbsp;now&nbsp;almost ready, while the National Heart Centre and the SGH Pathology Building are being built at the Outram Campus.&nbsp; The Kent Ridge Campus is just as busy with the development of the National University Heart Centre and National University Cancer Institute.&nbsp; There will also be developments at the Novena Campus, including the new Communicable Diseases Centre.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is not just the&nbsp;big ticket items like hospital and Pathology Department.&nbsp;&nbsp;We continue to invest, a point made by Mr Banerjee&nbsp;and reinvest in existing facilities and to upgrade them where appropriate.&nbsp; I give you one example.&nbsp; Last year, SGH debated for quite some time&nbsp;but finally&nbsp;decided to invest $3.5 million in a new hyperbaric oxygen treatment facility to further enhance its capability in treating burns patients.&nbsp; As it turned out, our parliamentary colleague, Mr Seng Han Thong, became a beneficiary of this investment.&nbsp; Daily oxygen treatment, at a concentrated level,&nbsp;at the facility has speeded up considerably his recovery process.&nbsp; For those who have visited him more than once, we can see&nbsp;with our own eyes the speed of the recovery.&nbsp; Our burns unit in the SGH is a major asset that we all can be proud of, and is an example of the excellent healthcare that Singaporeans have access to.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, I agree with Mdm Halimah, and&nbsp;we will liberalise Medisave use to help Singaporeans further reduce their out-of-pocket expenses.&nbsp; In 2007, we raised the Medisave per diem withdrawal limit to $450.&nbsp; This has helped many patients,&nbsp;particularly the middle income Singaporeans who asked to be admitted to Class A/B1 wards&nbsp;or the private hospitals and those who do not need any surgery.&nbsp; This year, I will focus on helping those who&nbsp;need surgery.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surgeries, as Members may know,&nbsp;are classified&nbsp;into 21 tables,&nbsp;from Table 1A,</p>   <p align=left>Column: 2435<p>  <p>2A,&nbsp;3A all the way to Table 7A, 7B, 7C, in ascending&nbsp;order of complexity and, then,&nbsp;we set Medisave withdrawal limits&nbsp;associated with&nbsp;each type of surgical table.&nbsp; For example, for the lowest table (1A), we set a limit&nbsp;of&nbsp;$150 because it is the least complex, charges are the lowest&nbsp;and $150 was enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;For Table 7C, which is the highest, we set it at $5,000.&nbsp; We will raise these limits substantially by up to $7,550 for Table 7C.&nbsp; This would reduce the out-of-pocket expenses of all surgical patients,&nbsp;particularly&nbsp;those who stay&nbsp;in Class A/B1 and private hospitals.&nbsp; Subsidised patients in B2/C&nbsp;do not face a problem because the current limits are already&nbsp;enough to cover their highly subsidised bills.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me&nbsp;give some&nbsp;examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;An eye cataract operation&nbsp;is a Table 4A operation.&nbsp; Patients today can withdraw up to $1,400 for this surgery but, after the liberalisation, they can withdraw up to $2,150.&nbsp; So that will save them&nbsp;$750 out-of-the pocket.&nbsp; I think, during a time like this, it is useful.&nbsp; As another example, patients who need a knee joint replacement - an example that Mdm Halimah mentioned -&nbsp;which&nbsp;is a complex operation (Table 6B).&nbsp; They can now save nearly&nbsp;$1,950, when we raise the withdrawal limit for this operation from $3,200 to $5,150. &nbsp;I will try to get this done as soon as possible, but the computer guys need&nbsp;some time to reprogramme the computer.&nbsp; We will get this done latest by June.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Fatimah Lateef and Mrs Josephine Teo asked about our Medisave Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP).&nbsp; This programme has helped many patients with any of the&nbsp;six major chronic diseases, including diabetes and stroke.&nbsp; I am pleased with the working of the programme.&nbsp; We are now confident enough to further extend it and&nbsp;to benefit the mentally-ill patients.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah, Dr Fatimah and several other Members have asked for this extension, I know,&nbsp;for</p> <p align=left>Column: 2436<p><p>quite some time.&nbsp; Just like the other chronically ill, the mentally-ill patients also&nbsp;need continuous and often long-term outpatient treatment and the&nbsp;cumulative costs&nbsp;can be&nbsp;high. So I am sure they will find this liberalisation useful but, again,&nbsp;a word of caution.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please remember the original purpose of Medisave, which is to help Singaporeans cope with costly hospitalisations likely to be at old age.&nbsp; Otherwise we end up "feeding the doctors", as mentioned by Mr Yeo Guat Kwang earlier.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;never meant for outpatient care and we must not allow Medisave to be prematurely depleted through inappropriate outpatient services and that is why I cannot support Dr Lam's proposal to extend it to all diseases.&nbsp; We may eventually get there but I think let us take it step by step.&nbsp; To safeguard against premature depletion, we have set a Medisave withdrawal limit of $300 per account per year, rather than per patient.&nbsp; So for&nbsp;those who have several children, in fact, the withdrawal limit is quite high and we also&nbsp;impose requirements for deductible and co-payment.&nbsp; These are very&nbsp;important conditions and they will also apply to the mentally-ill. But unlike diabetes and stroke,&nbsp;mental illness,&nbsp;as noted by Dr Fatimah,&nbsp;comprises a wide range of conditions, some of which are not easy to diagnose and confirm, nor with clear consensus yet among the psychiatrists on what is the most optimal treatment regime. So if you are not careful, the money may just get depleted and a few doctors "get fat" but the Medisave Account gone and the conditions may not improve.&nbsp; I therefore accept Dr Fatimah's prescription and we will start cautiously with the major conditions of depression and schizophrenia, which affect the bulk of the mentally-ill. The Ministry of Health will also put in place a quality assurance framework with the Institute of Mental Health and the relevant tertiary institutions. This way,&nbsp;I think&nbsp;we can better ensure that Medisave is put to</p> <p align=left>Column: 2437<p><p>proper use, with clear benefits for the patients' recovery.&nbsp; We will begin detailed discussions with the GPs and the psychiatrists on how best to implement this new initiative, but I promise to get it done before October this year.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mayor Zainudin, Mdm Halimah, Dr Fatimah&nbsp;and Mrs Josephine Teo asked about the proposal to allow Medisave to be used for elective hospitalisation treatment overseas. The unionists asked for this extension when I last met them at a public dialogue.&nbsp; Good competent care for routine treatment is now available in&nbsp;our neighbouring countries, at far&nbsp;cheaper cost, given their lower cost structure.&nbsp; I therefore agree with NTUC and several Members that we should help our patients stretch their savings and reduce their cost if they opt for elective treatment in the neighbouring countries but my concern is how to ensure safety and adequate standards, while guarding against fraudulent claims.&nbsp; It is easier for me to audit&nbsp;our hospitals here but once across the border, our influence does not&nbsp;go that far.&nbsp;&nbsp;So we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;think through carefully&nbsp;the implications of this proposal.&nbsp; In fact, I made a day trip to Johor during the Chinese New Year last week to chit-chat with some of the hospitals and nursing homes there, to do my homework on how to design&nbsp;a&nbsp;stricter scheme which can achieve the purpose without being abused in any way, and I will share our analysis with Singaporeans in due course.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we will further strengthen Medifund, to make it a robust safety net for the lower income Singaporeans. Last year, we raised the amount of Medifund assistance&nbsp;to $74 million.&nbsp; This year, we will raise it further to&nbsp;$80 million.&nbsp; Medifund assistance is now double the amount of assistance provided just&nbsp;three years ago.&nbsp; I heard the call by Mdm Halimah and&nbsp;Mrs Josephine Teo for our hospitals and Medifund Committees to be</p> <p align=left>Column: 2438<p><p>compassionate and flexible during this downturn, and I am sure they will be.&nbsp; I have been reminding them.&nbsp; But even without&nbsp;the reminder,&nbsp;we selected compassionate people to be in the Committees.&nbsp; For the step-down care sector, our subventions for the elderly will also grow, by at least $25 million this year.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All in,&nbsp;my Ministry will do its best to help Singaporean patients cope with the recession.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we cannot battle the economic tsunami alone.&nbsp; The others have their parts to play too, namely, our patients and the healthcare providers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First are the patients.&nbsp; I think they have a&nbsp;major role to play.&nbsp; I heard Mr Yeo Guat Kwang say in Hokkien just now &ndash;</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"<I>lao liao&nbsp;mai chi lo kun</I> " (let us&nbsp;not end up falling sick and feeding the doctors in old age).&nbsp; I remember there is&nbsp;a <I>Teochew</I> expression which the Japanese also have it, and that is&nbsp;"<I>jia chi hoon</I> "&nbsp;which means one should only eat up to 70% of what you need, as the other 30% you eat for the doctors,&nbsp;meaning that if you overeat, you fall sick as you get obese.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, one major role of everyone is&nbsp;to remain healthy and keep a healthy lifestyle.&nbsp; But besides that, patients can do three things: contribute to Medisave and&nbsp;use it carefully, buy the right type of medical insurance, and choose the right class of ward for admission. These are the public education messages that we periodically advocate in the newspapers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As noted by Mr Zainudin, Singaporeans can stretch their healthcare dollar by being prudent, for example, by choosing the right class of ward.&nbsp; Our restructured hospitals provide financial counselling to ensure that their patients have the proper information to do so.&nbsp; Last week, I was quite glad to read in the <I>Straits&nbsp;Times</I> where it&nbsp;reported one Ms Wee who decided to switch from a private hospital to deliver her second baby in a subsidised ward in Kandang Kerbau</p>  <p align=left>Column: 2439<p><p>Hospital.&nbsp; The move, she was reported as saying, would save her about $1,800 in cash, and this is her way of coping with the current recession, and I said, "Well done, here is a smart lady!"&nbsp; Our subsidised ward does not provide a personal choice of doctor,&nbsp;meaning that you cannot&nbsp;choose your own doctor,&nbsp;but the clinical care is of a high standard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Means testing is now available in public hospitals.&nbsp; This enables the Government to be more targeted in our subsidies to lower income Singaporeans. I am glad that those who could not get the full subsidy,&nbsp;ie, they get means tested out,&nbsp;form less than 10% of the admissions.&nbsp; So more than&nbsp;90%&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;nothing has changed with the means testing&nbsp;&ndash; are unaffected by means testing.&nbsp; It shows that, by and large, Singaporeans do choose their&nbsp;wards&nbsp;appropriate to their income levels.&nbsp; But we will continue to monitor the situation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for medical insurance, I thank Dr Lam Pin Min and Mr Yeo Guat Kwang for highlighting&nbsp;the importance.&nbsp; MediShield is essential for all Singaporeans to take care of major illnesses which may lead to large hospital bills.&nbsp; Now&nbsp;MediShield coverage has reached 84%.&nbsp; When I first started, I remember it was something like 75%.&nbsp;&nbsp;So we managed to push it up&nbsp;10 percentage points, to almost 85%&nbsp;of&nbsp;the total population.&nbsp; I now set a higher target&nbsp;of 90%, and once we reach there, we will push it up further.&nbsp; I agree with Mr Yeo Guat Kwang that Singaporeans should get insured as early as possible, preferably soon after birth. We introduced opt-out MediShield coverage for children in December 2007, and 98% of parents did not opt their newborns out of the scheme.&nbsp; I thank them&nbsp;for their support.&nbsp; We are now working through the schools to catch up with those who were born before 2008.&nbsp; It will take some years but eventually we will catch up with all.&nbsp; As it is, currently, nearly 70% of Singaporeans below 21 years old are covered by MediShield.&nbsp; So, in fact, our 84%</p> <p align=left>Column: 2440<p><p>MediShield coverage for total population is brought down&nbsp;by the young Singaporeans' lower rate of 70%.&nbsp; As we catch up with the primary school kids and the secondary school kids, we will improve the overall figure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the adults, 90% of women aged 20 and above have MediShield coverage, which is actually not bad.&nbsp; Again, when I started this, there were large numbers of housewives who were uninsured and we have worked very hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I&nbsp;am personally quite happy with this figure&nbsp;&ndash; 90%,&nbsp;not bad. &nbsp;But it can be better because the men&nbsp;are slightly higher, at 93%.&nbsp; Let us raise both rates to 95%, as the immediate target.&nbsp; We are working with NTUC to make workers sign up for their non-working spouses.&nbsp; Mdm Halimah is helping me on this, and I thank her for this.&nbsp; Dr Lam suggested that we have some automatic opt-out for housewives so that unless you opt out,&nbsp;you are in.&nbsp; Actually we do.&nbsp; We have such a scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;We catch them at the time of marriage,&nbsp;when there is an automatic opt-in.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless you opt out, the husband has to pay through his Medisave for the MediShield of his wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, most women and&nbsp;housewives got covered under this approach.&nbsp; The trouble is that after a few years, some men forgot,&nbsp;which is what they said.&nbsp; So we have to remind them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang&nbsp;asked about MediShield&rsquo;s coverage of large hospital bills.&nbsp; After our reform last year, MediShield now pays up to 80% of large Class B2/C bills,&nbsp;a significant improvement from 60% previously.&nbsp; So by a few dollars&nbsp;increase in premiums, we have now greater coverage and I am quite happy with that. &nbsp;Claim limits for cancer treatment were also raised in the 2008 MediShield reform.&nbsp; However, as noted by Mr Yeo and Dr Lam, coverage for congenital conditions remains a gap in our current medical insurance scheme.&nbsp; MediShield and the private insurers do not cover congenital conditions.&nbsp; The reason</p> <p align=left>Column: 2441<p><p>is financial cost.&nbsp; Including congenital conditions will result in a large increase in the MediShield premiums which the rest of the population may not be willing to shoulder.&nbsp; We will continue to study this problem but, honestly, I do not see a quick resolution as this is clearly not the time to revise premiums.&nbsp; Until then, we will continue to rely on Medifund to help the lower-income patients with congenital conditions.&nbsp; So it is not as if they are left vulnerable.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Josephine Teo has wisely advised all Singaporeans to continue to contribute to Medisave and maintain MediShield coverage even&nbsp;during current&nbsp;bad times, and&nbsp;I echo her call.&nbsp; 3Ms is important and&nbsp; is effective,&nbsp;but provided you are within 3Ms.&nbsp; So, please, stay within 3Ms&nbsp;&ndash; do not walk out of the 3Ms' giant umbrella.&nbsp; You will be exposed, you will be vulnerable.&nbsp; Basic MediShield premiums are very affordable. Given that Singaporeans have substantial Medisave balances, most would have no problems with maintaining basic MediShield coverage.&nbsp; In cases where the individual has insufficient Medisave balance,&nbsp;that is when the immediate family members&nbsp;must chip in to take over the premium payment to ensure continued coverage.&nbsp; Family members should take care of one another, especially in times of hardship.&nbsp;&nbsp;I took a look at the latest MediShield subscription data,&nbsp;it continues to rise.&nbsp; So it is not as if people have been cancelling their policies because they are unable to do so.&nbsp; Of course, the&nbsp;main reason is because we have Medisave.&nbsp; So Medisave&nbsp;enables the payment to continue even though your salary may be cut or you may&nbsp;have even&nbsp;lost your job.</p><p><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second group pertains to the healthcare providers.&nbsp; They play an important role in helping patients save money.&nbsp; Saving patients' money is an important responsibility of all healthcare</p>    <p align=left>Column: 2442<p>   <p>providers both during good and bad times, but it is especially critical during bad times.&nbsp; They have to help deliver better health outcomes at lower cost.&nbsp; Singaporean healthcare providers have largely been productive and cost efficient.&nbsp; But there is still scope for greater efficiency and higher productivity.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us look at the computer industry.&nbsp; For years, they focus on adding more features, more capabilities&nbsp;to their products, tempting consumers to buy higher priced products, never mind if they may not&nbsp;need the frills,&nbsp;the bells and the whistles.&nbsp; This strategy of paying more for added capabilities is now under&nbsp;severe stress in the current downturn.&nbsp; And that is why the&nbsp;electronic sector is hardest hit.&nbsp; Consumers are now demanding that manufacturers go back to basics and offer lower priced products, without the frills. They are demanding new technologies that do the same for less money, rather than more for the same price.&nbsp; They prefer computers to get cheaper, rather than more powerful.&nbsp; Small, low-cost laptops, called netbooks, are now&nbsp;"good enough" for many consumers.&nbsp; The same&nbsp;"good enough" approach is also being demanded in the software and many other industries.&nbsp; The Indian manufacturers are particularly innovative on this front: they are shooting for radical breakthroughs like a US$20 laptop and a 1 lakh (US$2,500) car.&nbsp; And not just in manufacturing.&nbsp; Indian ophthalmologists have&nbsp;pioneered the provision of cataract surgeries at less than US$100 per eye when practically everywhere, including Singapore, it is above US$1,000 per eye.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need more of such disruptive innovations in the healthcare sector.&nbsp; Four years ago, I published hospital bill sizes to show the wide variation in cost among our hospitals, with a view to push our hospitals on this effort to "do more with less".&nbsp; And indeed there were some successes as lasik prices dropped by more than $1,000 per eye and the price wars</p> <p align=left>Column: 2443<p><p>continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you look at the newspaper advertisements,&nbsp;the volume&nbsp;has&nbsp;come down but&nbsp;lasik advertisements&nbsp;remain prominent.&nbsp; The competition has brought great benefits to consumers.&nbsp; But this "lasik effect" does not seem to extend to other surgeries.&nbsp; There are still many surgical procedures where prices vary widely.&nbsp; For example, the median bill size for cataract surgery varies from $2,900 to $4,200 at the high end&nbsp;&ndash; a range of more than $1,000. Why?&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people&nbsp;get it&nbsp;for $2,900&nbsp;and some,&nbsp;for $4,200.&nbsp; Even for the subsidised patients, the variation is from $875 to $1,000&nbsp;&ndash; a few hundred dollars difference&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the same thing&nbsp;for hip replacement.&nbsp; The median bill size for Class B2 varies from $4,100 to $5,100&nbsp;&ndash; a range of $1,000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These bill sizes are easily accessible by patients and we update it every month with actual&nbsp;data&nbsp;but, regrettably, we do not experience the same "lasik effect".&nbsp; Why do patients continue to go&nbsp;to higher-cost doctors and clinics when competent lower-cost providers are available?&nbsp; If patients are indifferent, then why should hospitals try hard to save money for them because there is no reward.&nbsp; I think this is partly because the "lasik effect" has been blunted by third-party payment.&nbsp;&nbsp;For lasik, most&nbsp;consumers pay out&nbsp;from their own pockets&nbsp;&ndash; insurers and employers will not cover.&nbsp;&nbsp;But for cataract, knee replacement&nbsp;&ndash; employers chip in, insurers chip in, Government chips in with heavy subsidy.&nbsp; Yes, patients do some co-payment but to many, they can afford&nbsp;a couple of hundred dollars.&nbsp; So&nbsp;they just stick with whoever&nbsp;they are comfortable with.&nbsp; There is no incentive to shop around.&nbsp; But, surely, the third-party payers, like employers and insurers, will have an incentive to require the patients they sponsor to shop around?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a major third-party payer for subsidised patients, my Ministry has a strong incentive to economise.&nbsp; We will want to create the right regulatory</p> <p align=left>Column: 2444<p><p>framework and conditions for providers to compete and innovate, like in the case of lasik operators.&nbsp; For surgeries with well-defined conditions and measurable outcomes, like delivery of babies&nbsp;(you cannot fake it),&nbsp;cataract surgeries&nbsp;(I do not know whether it is possible to fake cataract surgeries),&nbsp;&nbsp;knee joint replacement or&nbsp;hip replacement, I&nbsp;am going to&nbsp;tweak our Government subvention to reward the lower-cost providers and pressure the high-cost providers.&nbsp; We will try this out for several common surgical procedures, and see if it is effective in getting our hospitals to work harder to save money for their patients.&nbsp; This recession is a good time to apply this pressure, and will position our hospitals well in terms of offering cost-effective treatments when the economy recovers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Clayton Christensen, Harvard Business School&rsquo;s guru on disruptive innovation, has devoted his latest book "The Innovator&rsquo;s Prescription" to a thorough discussion on applying disruptive solutions in the healthcare sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is now one of&nbsp;my bedside reading materials.&nbsp; He is emphatic that the solution to the US, and indeed the global healthcare challenges, is a complete reform of the traditional healthcare system and a disruption of the business model centred on the general hospital.&nbsp; His book makes for both optimistic and pessimistic readings.&nbsp; It points a way forward that will improve quality, accessibility and affordability by changing the way hospitals and doctors work.&nbsp; In other words, healthcare can be better and also cheaper.&nbsp; Who will not want that?&nbsp; But it also highlights the many obstacles and the ingrained self interests of the stakeholders to preserve the <I>status quo</I>.&nbsp; They will fight to avoid or delay the transformation.&nbsp; Maybe President Obama can do&nbsp;some miracle and lead the world in healthcare transformation.&nbsp; We will see, even as we attempt our own disruptive innovations here.</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>Healthcare for An Ageing Population</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mdm Halimah Yacob:</B> Madam, we are facing a tsunami of healthcare challenges for the elderly.&nbsp; A 2006 NUS study shows that disability rates here are on the rise, much faster than other countries such as the US.&nbsp; Two decades ago, about 14% of those aged 75 and above could not do simple things such as move around, bathe or eat.&nbsp; By the time of the 2006 study, this had risen to 20%.&nbsp; To tackle this problem, we need policies and programmes which will provide an integrated and holistic approach in providing for the healthcare needs of our ageing population.&nbsp; We have to help our elderly live a life free from pain, be in good control of their faculties and are mobile.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rapidly growing number of our elderly are suffering from dementia.&nbsp; The MOH estimates that there are about 25,000 dementia patients in Singapore, up from 21,000 in 2003.&nbsp; Despite this increase, there are only&nbsp;five subsidised</p> <p align=left>Column: 2446<p><p>dementia centres catering to them, offering a total of 177 places although it is estimated that about 5,000 would need institutional care.&nbsp; Fewer than 10 of the 59 nursing homes have specialised dementia care wards which offer subsidised care.&nbsp; There is also a shortage of centres taking patients in the early to moderate stage of the illness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We also need to better develop our home healthcare services so that our elderly who are ill can stay at home instead of being hospitalised.&nbsp; There are nearly 70,000 people aged 65 years and above who even live alone or live with another elderly spouse.&nbsp; A Monash University study in 2000 has shown that maintaining a patient at home can lead to better quality of life and be cheaper as well by as much as 40%.&nbsp; Major concerns of home healthcare providers are lack of funds and shortage of manpower.&nbsp; MOH funding is tied to the number of visits a doctor or a nurse makes to a homebound patient, and therapy services are not funded at all.&nbsp; There is also a shortage of manpower to provide safe and competent care at home.&nbsp; Most doctors and nurses see homecare as less glamorous, less lucrative and physically more demanding than working in hospitals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As women outlive men in our society, we need to worry about their healthcare financing as they suffer a longer period of disability compared to men.&nbsp; And many women, as we also just heard, are still not covered under MediShield.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister the following questions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, what are the Ministry's plans to meet the needs of our fast growing population?&nbsp; Has the Ministry studied the experiences of other developed countries in tackling the health care needs of a greying population and what can we learn from them?</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p align=left>Column: 2447<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, what are the key areas needing critical improvement in the provision of healthcare services for the ageing, including funding and greater support for caregivers?&nbsp; Also how are the special healthcare concerns of older women being addressed?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, what steps has the Ministry taken to improve the quality of step-down services, nursing homes or community hospitals, and the various centres catering to the needs of the elderly, including also home healthcare services?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, what is the progress made in training our doctors, nurses and para-professionals for geriatric care?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifth, could all our hospitals provide free geriatric screening for elderly patients that&nbsp;are currently provided at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital so that appropriate intervention can be mapped out as part of the strategy to cut down disability among&nbsp;our elderly?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, what are the measures to ensure, on the part of MOH, that step-down care for the elderly remains affordable and accessible to low-income families?&nbsp; I think this is a major concern for many families, particularly those who have to put their elderly parents in institutional care.&nbsp; Affordability of nursing homes and other places for putting the elderly&nbsp;is a major concern.&nbsp; I hope the Ministry&nbsp;can address that as well.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mdm Cynthia Phua (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Of course, we would be worse</p> <p align=left>Column: 2448<p><p>off without MediShield and Medisave.&nbsp; We need to look at an overall plan on how we can help families to cope with unexpected needs from the elderly in the community.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the status of the Master Plan for the Elderly?&nbsp; Do we have enough hospital beds by 2020?&nbsp; I am glad that we have proceeded to build the Yishun Hospital.&nbsp; Do we need to build more to cater to our elderly?&nbsp; How about our community hospitals?&nbsp; Many a time, the appeal on the ground is to allow the elderly to stay longer so that arrangements can be made to bring them home.&nbsp; The urgency of turnover at the main hospitals and the community hospitals&nbsp;is being executed by the medical staff compassionately, so it seems, because of the way the funding of the hospital is given.&nbsp; Is the Minister reviewing the funding formula so that the end result, the medical staff does not need&nbsp;to be so compassionate&nbsp;and turn the beds around?&nbsp; Can the Minister elaborate on the funding method&nbsp;as it has&nbsp;an impact on the residents?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;devils are in the service delivery on the ground.&nbsp; Firstly, we must have enough supply of geriatric doctors on the ground who can understand the elderly patients.&nbsp; In the hospitals and clinics, the bedside manners of doctors and nurses can be improved.&nbsp; Elderly patients may only be able to speak dialects but not English or Mandarin.&nbsp; They would&nbsp;have difficulty to communicate their basic needs.&nbsp; Many who serve in our hospitals come from the Philippines, China and Myanmar.&nbsp; Coordination between clinics can be improved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other aspect is&nbsp;coordination between the hospital and within its specialist support services and the polyclinics&nbsp;is critical.&nbsp; Let&nbsp;me give&nbsp;Members a real example.&nbsp; My father-in-law was warded last year and was asked to leave the hospital on a Sunday, despite</p>  <p align=left>Column: 2449<p><p>the fact that he&nbsp;was unable to swallow properly and&nbsp;had a scheduled test to determine if he could&nbsp;swallow properly&nbsp;on the following Wednesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;If he could not, a tube had to be inserted. &nbsp;I had to make a few frantic phone calls to ensure that the test be completed before he&nbsp;was discharged because if he&nbsp;could not&nbsp;swallow, he would be dehydrated and needed to be warded again.&nbsp; Such basic coordination is important for the well-being&nbsp;of our elderly patients and not&nbsp;cause undue stress on the family units.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are we to set up more support services in the heartlands to help families&nbsp;who have to provide aftercare for the elderly?&nbsp; How many elderly daycare and medical and rehabilitative centres&nbsp;do we have in Singapore to&nbsp;support our elderly?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Assoc.

Prof. Kalyani K Mehta (Nominated Member):</B> Madam, the demographic ageing of Singapore's population and the challenges that it brings for policymakers, service providers and family caregivers have been reiterated by my hon. colleagues.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad the Ministry of Health intends to spend $500 million over the next&nbsp;five years on community-based long-term care such as new community hospitals and capabilities to run the facilities.&nbsp; However, my question is: are the services affordable for the average Singaporean?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long-term or step-down care includes a wide range of services such as day rehabilitations, hospices, home nursing, home medical and even ambulance services.&nbsp; The increasing physical disability among people above 65 years, women in particular, as revealed in census data from</p> <p align=left>Column: 2450<p><p>1990 to 2000, emphasises the importance of these services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me share some statistics that I have found.&nbsp; Sunlove-Hougang Senior Citizens Day Rehabilitation Centre and Ang Mo Kio Thye Hua Kwan Day Rehabilitation Centre charge about $40&nbsp;per day and these charges exclude transport cost which could range from $15 to $20 per trip.&nbsp; The charges are usually subject&nbsp;to means testing which is viewed as mean by clients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For community hospitals, the average monthly bill including treatment cost for an eight-bedded room without air-conditioning is $2,040 for Ang Mo&nbsp;Kio&nbsp;Community Hospital, $2,079 for Saint Luke's Hospital,&nbsp;$2,746 for Saint Andrew's Community Hospital.&nbsp; The cost works out to be about $90 per day.&nbsp; For someone from the middle and lower middle class who may have other dependants such as children, the fees are very high.&nbsp; While Medisave can be used for part payment, we must understand that the CPF account holder will need his Medisave for his own healthcare needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For ambulance services, an emergency call to SCDF is publicised&nbsp;on the internet to be free&nbsp;provided that the person is hospitalised.&nbsp; If not hospitalised, cash payment of approximately $80 to $100 is charged.&nbsp; For a non-emergency call, the charge is minimum&nbsp;$60,&nbsp;maximum&nbsp;$80, for a one-way trip.&nbsp; If the family has to call an ambulance for a frail grandfather to go for a medical checkup, I estimate that the appointment and&nbsp;the transport cost would run up to at least $400.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to link the issue of affordability with the fact that people in&nbsp; the lower-income groups are at higher risk of poor health.&nbsp; This has been researched widely in other countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, a study by the Singapore Heart Foundation concluded that almost&nbsp;50% of the people in one- and two-room rental flats had at least two chronic diseases.&nbsp; This included</p> <p align=left>Column: 2451<p><p>needy elders who had no source of regular income.&nbsp; It is logical to assume that for low-income&nbsp;people,&nbsp;steep&nbsp;costs of healthcare&nbsp;are a barrier to healthcare utilisation.&nbsp; Many of them avoid healthcare screening for fear they may find something sinister and that would create higher monthly cost.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To summarise, if community-based long-term care is made more affordable and means tests are conducted with flexibility, especially in this time of recession, many families would find immense relief.&nbsp; Of what good is the construction of more concrete structures, highly trained staff, if the ordinary man-in-the-street cannot afford to pay for the services?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would&nbsp;like the Minister to consider waiving the GST for all transport fees and community-based long-term care services.&nbsp; This could be for one year to recognise the financial difficulties families are facing, renewable after one year.&nbsp; Regarding families which have multiple serious problems, the maximalist rather than the minimalist approach towards subsidy should be applied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long-term healthcare is a necessity, not a luxury.&nbsp; Therefore, the Ministry is urged to take a humanitarian approach in this very&nbsp;extraordinary time.&nbsp;</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Ang Mong Seng--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Minister replied that the means test is reviewed from time to time.&nbsp; As the cost of nursing homecare continues to rise, I believe now is the time to look at the financial impact of such charges on families and to review how we can assist them.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, Government subsidies for step-down care are means-tested, based on household per capita income.&nbsp; The rate of subsidy is tiered at either 75%, 50% or 25% subsidy&nbsp;depending on per capita income.&nbsp; And for those whose per capita income is more than $1,000, no subsidy is given.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the current framework, the impact of nursing home bills on families can still be very drastic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know of one family whose father has dementia and&nbsp;is in a commercial nursing home.&nbsp; The household has&nbsp;four persons.&nbsp; The&nbsp;two adult children together earn&nbsp;about $4,400 in gross pay.&nbsp; According to the means test formula, the family does not qualify for subsidy because the household gross income of $4,400 divided by&nbsp;four members means that the per capita income is $1,100.&nbsp; But the net income which the children have, after deduction of CPF, totals only about $3,500.&nbsp; Each month, they are paying the nursing home fee of about $2,000, which is more than half the household income.&nbsp; The per capita income left for the remaining&nbsp;three family members is about $500 each.&nbsp; Considering that the&nbsp;two adult children need to travel to work daily, is&nbsp;this not a very high burden on the family?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One aspect of the means test that is hard to understand is why it is computed</p>  <p align=left>Column: 2454<p><p>based on the gross pay of the household, including the CPF component?&nbsp; After all, under the current policy, CPF balances cannot be withdrawn to pay nursing home charges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will the Government review the means test to take into account only the net or take home pay, or&nbsp;raise the cut-off&nbsp;incomes for Government subsidies?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earlier the Minister mentioned increased subventions to step-down care institutions of $35 million.&nbsp; I would like&nbsp;him to clarify how much of this amount is going to the nursing homes and whether it is&nbsp;meant to defray expected inflation in wages and operating costs.&nbsp; Or will there be enough money for the homes to reduce the amount payable by the non-affluent families based on the current bill size?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And lastly, Madam, what are the options&nbsp;do such families have to take care of their aged sick besides the nursing home care?</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lam Pin Min--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

This phenomenon affects not only the individual but can also have devastating effects on the family.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Former First Lady of the United States, Rosalynn Carter, once said, "There are only&nbsp;four kinds of people in the world&nbsp;&ndash; those who have been caregivers, those who are currently caregivers, those who will be caregivers, and those who will need caregivers."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The family has traditionally been the main source of support for the elderly in Asia, and Singapore is no exception.&nbsp; Singapore is not a welfare state and </p> <p align=left>Column: 2455<p><p>individual responsibility is the mantra underlying most, if not all, policymaking decisions.&nbsp; There are obviously&nbsp;two choices when the family is encountered with caring for the elderly sick and disabled.&nbsp; They can either place them in the nursing institution or provide home-based care.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many elderly sick patients would definitely prefer to stay in the comfort of their homes.&nbsp; Home care, however, will not be possible without the dedicated participation of the caregiver, who is usually a family member most of the time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, the Government has strongly upheld the belief that familial support of the elderly is ideal.&nbsp; However, are caregivers given the necessary support, both financially and emotionally by the Government?&nbsp; I think we are still far away from the ideal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Caregiving is a challenging task that can impact a caregiver physically and emotionally.&nbsp; The caregiver's role for a family with an elderly relative or persons with disability can be very demanding and could be a long-term or even lifelong responsibility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The medical fraternity is beginning to recognise the psychological and physiological changes experienced as a result of chronic stress due to on-going care giving activities.&nbsp; This condition has been coined "Caregiver Syndrome".&nbsp; Caregivers tend to be so immersed in their role that they neglect to take care of themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, caregiving can result in new financial burdens, as many have to give up their careers to look after their loved ones.&nbsp; Many families with elderly sick or disabled family members would require special care and attention.&nbsp; Home-based care not only provides the ideal cost-effective long-term care of the</p> <p align=left>Column: 2456<p><p>elderly frail and disabled in the family, it also helps free up limited vacancies in rehabilitation centres, daycare centres and old folks homes for families who genuinely require such services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the population greys, the infrastructural support such as nursing homes and step-down care facilities must grow in tandem.&nbsp; One complementary alternative would be to enhance the homecare support where the dependent elderly can receive optimal quality care and family love.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the structural support for caregivers in Singapore is insufficient, many a time, it is not available when it is needed most.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Caregiver to the elderly dependent is like the conductor to an orchestra.&nbsp; In all cases, the caregiver is the elder dependent's link to the world of a completely independent life that he or she once had.&nbsp; The caregiver is just like any one of us, a human being, with physiological and emotional needs.&nbsp; Often times, caregivers start from the deep end of the water, not knowing what lies ahead and struggling to keep their heads afloat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to suggest the following to the Ministry:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider setting up a one-stop caregiver resource centre to provide a range of supportive services, including&nbsp;information, educational programmes and emotional support for family caregivers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Formation of caregiver support groups to allow caregivers to ventilate, share and support one another.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Formation of dedicated homecare medical teams to provide medical review services of stable patients at their homes so as to minimise the hassle of frequent travels to healthcare institutions, especially when most of them are non-ambulatory.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p align=left>Column: 2457<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, lastly, consider the provision of monetary allowances for caregivers to compensate family caregivers for their unpaid effort and stress.&nbsp; This would definitely help alleviate the financial burdens faced by these families.</p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

With people living longer, this underscores the importance of effective chronic disease management programmes to prevent the worsening of the medical condition to provide quality of health and life.&nbsp; With the current economic downturn, many will find the cost of treatment and medication for their chronic illnesses challenging as they will require treatment on a long-term basis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some instances at our Meet-the-People Sessions, it is really sad to see middle-aged and older residents trading off seeing a doctor or getting early treatment for their illnesses for other more pressing needs to manage their financial situations.&nbsp; This may not be the most rational decision but, given their situation, this happens.&nbsp; The on-going course treatment for chronic illnesses will make it harder for some people to pay for needed medication and they may not stay on them or skip doses, worsening their medical problems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p align=left>Column: 2458<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we all know, the best way to manage the course of chronic illnesses and the quality of health and life is preventive management of the disease.&nbsp; Those in their 50s, 60s and 70s are in that segment that need attention.&nbsp; They have the potential for undetected chronic medical conditions and, if not managed, will lead to&nbsp;complications and disabilities.&nbsp; Many of my Parliamentary colleagues have touched on the point&nbsp;that those who do not have Medisave and&nbsp;CPF contributions, how would they manage the cost of treatment for medication for chronic illnesses as this can be unaffordable given the long-term&nbsp;treatment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must commend the Ministry for the high standard and the continued focus of the quality of healthcare in Singapore.&nbsp; But I would like the Minister to also share on what more can be done to help patients manage the cost of chronic illnesses in this difficult time.&nbsp; It is good to see that Medisave now allows&nbsp;patients to use life supplants for disease management programmes for the illnesses, including outpatient services.&nbsp; And I do also understand the concern&nbsp;of&nbsp;depleting and overusing&nbsp;the Medisave.&nbsp; But given the long-term nature of treatment and medication for chronic illness, the cost can be hefty.&nbsp; So as we talk about disruptive innovation, I would also ask us to be disruptive in thinking of how we can look at managing the cost of chronic illnesses.&nbsp; Because, seriously, I have seen too&nbsp;many trade-offs and it is really heart-wrenching to see&nbsp;people making those trade-offs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no easy answer&nbsp;to addressing the challenge of balancing the quality of healthcare and&nbsp;managing the&nbsp;escalating cost of treatment.&nbsp; However, given our ageing population and our somewhat&nbsp;sedentary lifestyle, the continued risk of chronic illnesses, proactive and&nbsp;preventive management of diseases as well as cost</p> <p align=left>Column: 2459<p><p>management will need constant attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;This difficult economic time makes this even more challenging.&nbsp;

Women tend to outnumber men.&nbsp; In the</p> <p align=left>Column: 2460<p><p>older age group, women tend to be younger than their spouses and have a higher life expectancy at birth.&nbsp;&nbsp;This has now emerged as a new challenging issue.&nbsp; This is viewed as problematic because it reflects high levels of widowhood and the various difficulties associated with it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Older widows are likely to live alone especially with the&nbsp;trend of declining number of children.&nbsp; Traditional means of family support are being steadily eroded with our&nbsp;declining fertility rate.&nbsp; Older women are more likely to suffer from weak health and have financial difficulty as women tend to have shorter working years and smaller earnings.&nbsp; They may therefore turn out to have lesser Medisave savings to support themselves at old age.&nbsp; We therefore&nbsp;may need policy to incentivise&nbsp;Medisave saving for&nbsp;this group.&nbsp; There is also a need for a better postulation and planning of the future healthcare needs that this group will require with regard to community hospitals,&nbsp;daycare centres and tertiary hospital&nbsp;beds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also a&nbsp;whole set of diseases that are more prone to older women such as obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, hip fractures, just to name a few.&nbsp; These are preventable diseases that can be reduced in incidence with the adoption of correct lifestyles and preventive medicine.&nbsp; Prevention in them will save patients pain and burden.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feminisation of the elder population poses serious challenges for economic and social support and healthcare.&nbsp; There is an adage, "our duty is not to add years into our lives but to add life into our years".&nbsp; I am sure MOH believes&nbsp;in preventive medicine and&nbsp;this is one area that needs MOH's immediate attention to mitigate future healthcare needs.&nbsp; A well planned policy calls for enhanced awareness and early intervention to try to cushion this explosive demand on the healthcare needs in the years ahead.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.00 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Khaw Boon Wan:</B> Madam, last year, the American Geriatrics Society coined the term "silver tsunami" to sound the alarm of the enormous healthcare challenges facing&nbsp;the United States as their post-war baby-boomer generation enters retirement.&nbsp; The ageing of the baby-boomers combined with a rise in life expectancy and the drop in birth&nbsp;rate will place tremendous strain on the US healthcare system which is already under a lot of pressure.&nbsp; They concluded that the US is ill-prepared to meet the silver tsunami.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As noted by Mdm Halimah, Singapore will face a silver tsunami of our own as the elderly are more likely to be hospitalised and consume&nbsp;more healthcare resources.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I noted Dr Lily Neo's point about many of these elderly patients, who will be females.&nbsp;It left a deep impression in me when I visited Okinawa&nbsp;where there were quite a few who were&nbsp;more than 100 years old; over 90%&nbsp;were females, less than 10% were men.&nbsp; And the only man who is above 100 years old is in the nursing home with dementia, and&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;communicate with me.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, our hospitals are already facing the first wave of the tsunami&nbsp;&ndash; a relatively smaller wave as our baby-boomers turn 60.&nbsp; In 10 or 15 years' time when the baby-boomers turn 70 or 75, we will feel the real pressure of the second and the larger wave of the silver tsunami.&nbsp; We have been served notice.&nbsp; We must protect Singapore against the silver tsunami and we have started the preparation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are expanding our healthcare capacity and adding beds,&nbsp;training more staff.&nbsp; But preparing for the silver tsunami goes beyond simply expanding the</p> <p align=left>Column: 2462<p><p>hospital sector.&nbsp; Most of the elderly would have health conditions that&nbsp;require long-term chronic care&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a point highlighted by Ms Jessica Tan just now&nbsp;&ndash; rather than short-term acute hospital care.&nbsp; This means that a large part of the burden will fall on the primary, intermediate and long-term care sector.&nbsp; GPs and polyclinics will play important roles in the care of the elderly sick.&nbsp; We have to grow the long-term care sector, both quantitatively and qualitatively, to meet this new and expanding demand.&nbsp; Obviously, we need many more doctors, nurses and allied health professionals.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failure to strengthen the long-term care sector will end up in the elderly patients seeking treatment in&nbsp;more costly hospital care and often with worse health outcomes, less satisfactory service level and larger bills, ending up receiving more expensive but, in many ways, inferior service level.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe one reason for the US spending 16% of the GDP on healthcare is that many of their elderly patients get treated in the wrong place, in a more expensive, costly acute&nbsp;sector, when lower cost and, in fact, better care should be rendered in the long-term care sector.&nbsp; And we must avoid this. We have 10 to 15 years to put the policy, system and infrastructure in place so that we can face the silver tsunami with confidence.&nbsp; I highlighted this issue last year.&nbsp; After a year of analysis, I now have a better sense of what we need to do. There are gaps in several important areas and we need to fix them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, we need to have enough funds to support the long-term care sector,&nbsp;of a&nbsp;quality which Singaporeans will demand.&nbsp; Unlike our parents and grandparents, the elderly baby-boomers of 2020 will demand and they will expect a&nbsp;much higher level of care.&nbsp; Many will not be&nbsp;satisfied with the current level of care</P> <p align=left>Column: 2463<p><p>&nbsp;rendered in some&nbsp;of the nursing homes.&nbsp; I think many will expect and will be able to afford, if we help them save up while they are young,&nbsp;a higher&nbsp;standard of care run by professionals and better trained staff&nbsp;&ndash; this is the future which we must prepare for.&nbsp; To help Singaporeans prepare for this future, we can take a leaf from how we prepare Singaporeans for their&nbsp;anticipated hospital care in old age.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over 25 years, we have carefully constructed a comprehensive 3Ms framework to ensure its adequate funding.&nbsp; Singaporeans save regularly in&nbsp;Medisave; MediShield ensures efficient risk pooling; and Medifund provides the ultimate safety net.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As wisely noted in this House by the&nbsp;Prime Minister's Office Minister Lim Boon Heng last week, we need to construct the equivalent of the 3Ms for the long-term care sector.&nbsp; He called it the 3Es&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Eldersave,&nbsp;ElderShield and Elderfund.&nbsp; I support&nbsp;his call.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was part of the Ministry of Health team, led by Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong when he was Health Minister, which 30 years ago&nbsp;carefully thought through and constructed the 3Ms framework for acute hospital care. 3Ms did not come about overnight.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a carefully thought through plan which we knew politically we have to take our time to slowly explain and implement it&nbsp;phase by phase.&nbsp; So, after 25 years, we now have a fairly robust 3Ms&nbsp;framework&nbsp;&ndash; not perfect and there is still room for&nbsp;improvement but, I think, largely it has ensured Singaporeans being able to afford a very high standard of acute hospital care even if you belong to a low-income group.&nbsp; And I think this is what we should do for the long-term care as well.&nbsp; We need to do the same for the long-term care sector.&nbsp; The work has actually already begun.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p align=left>Column: 2464<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Former Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang drove in a key piling&nbsp;&ndash; ElderShield&nbsp;&ndash; in 2002.&nbsp; Mr Lim Boon Heng's Elderfund is what we called Medifund Silver, and&nbsp;was introduced in 2007.&nbsp; I am now able to build on these two elements.&nbsp; We need Singaporeans to regularly save for their anticipated long-term care while they are young and working.&nbsp; We can either create an Eldersave or we save more in Medisave so that it can also be used to fund long-term care.&nbsp; The question is how much will be needed for long-term care.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are studying the experience in&nbsp;more mature societies such as the US, UK, Europe and Japan.&nbsp; And preliminary analysis suggests that they spend less than 2% of their GDP on long-term care.&nbsp; There is an outlier&nbsp;&ndash; Sweden.&nbsp; Sweden spends higher than 2% but still less than 3% of their GDP.&nbsp;&nbsp;And this gives me a lot of comfort.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was initially very worried that this sector will be a bottomless pit.&nbsp; And potentially it can be a bottomless pit and I was worried that it may suck in a lot of resources which society may not be able to afford.&nbsp; But the figures&nbsp;from these OECD countries give me some comfort&nbsp;&ndash; that the funding problem may not be insurmountable.&nbsp; But there must be&nbsp;a conscious effort to ensure that Singaporeans save regularly for their long-term needs, just as they do for their hospitalisation needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is not the time to talk about raising CPF contribution rate, and we have no plans to do so.&nbsp; But when the economy eventually fully recovers, we should re-visit this issue of saving for our long-term care.&nbsp; But meanwhile, we have allowed Medisave to be used for some aspects of long-term care&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the community hospitals, chronic sick hospitals and hospices, and also to pay for ElderShield premiums.&nbsp; But we must remember that the current Medisave contribution rate is based on the projected needs of hospitalisation.&nbsp; It has not priced</p>  <p align=left>Column: 2465<p><p>in the additional needs for long-term care.&nbsp; So, we need to compute how much Medisave should be enhanced to finance this expenditure going forward.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for ElderShield, I have restructured the industry to incorporate ElderShield supplements in their product offerings, but we need to do more.&nbsp; Half of Singaporeans above age 40 are now enrolled in basic ElderShield.&nbsp; Not bad&nbsp;&ndash; I suppose like half-empty or half-full glass.&nbsp; Now we must persuade the other half to join in and we must persuade everyone to also top up with ElderShield supplements as basic ElderShield only pays $400 per month for six years to the successful claimants.&nbsp; This will fall short of the monthly cost of about $1,800 in a private nursing home and will require a sizeable out-of-pocket monthly payment by the elderly or the family.&nbsp; Singaporeans' understanding of this insurance product remains poor.&nbsp; And we have to work harder to raise awareness of ElderShield supplements and their benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for Medifund Silver, we will continue to top it up whenever the Budget position allows it.&nbsp; This year, despite the pressure on the Government Budget, I am grateful to the Finance Minister for topping up Medifund with $100 million, of which a significant portion will be allocated to Medifund Silver.&nbsp; And we would definitely put it to good use.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Lily Neo and Mdm Halimah highlighted the larger portion of female among the elderly population.&nbsp; The reasons are straightforward because they live longer and they do have higher incidence of some chronic diseases such as arthritis and osteoporosis.&nbsp; So women would have greater need for long-term care, incurring higher medical expenditures, and that is why it is so important that all working females should stay within 3Ms and eventually 3Es, contribute regularly to </p> <p align=left>Column: 2466<p><p>Medisave and subscribe to both MediShield and ElderShield.&nbsp;&nbsp;For housewives, husbands should do their duty by contributing to their wives' Medisave accounts.&nbsp; I discussed this at some length earlier, so I will not repeat the point.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted Dr Lily Neo's point about prevention, and that applies to both female and male patients, adult or young.&nbsp; I agree totally with her that prevention is truly the best option.&nbsp; Many things are within our control but if you are not willing to do your part&nbsp;&ndash; do the exercise, eat less (eat 70% rather than 100%), and&nbsp;wait until the parts are falling apart and you start looking to us for solution, it is a bit tough.&nbsp; Really, the key to healthcare reform is, besides disruptive innovations,&nbsp;"disruption" to your lifestyle; and make sure for those with unhealthy&nbsp;lifestyle, "disrupt your lifestyle".&nbsp; It is easy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I go to the gym every lunch time.&nbsp; Before coming here, I am busy preparing the last minute speeches, but I still set aside one hour to go to the gym, did my treadmill&nbsp;&ndash; a few kilometres of it&nbsp;&ndash; and as a result, I eat less too.&nbsp; So, my BMI, I think, is all right.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But many are not, and we just have to persuade more people to do so.&nbsp; And regular screening is another.&nbsp; There are many types of screening, but we know that effective screenings are really inexpensive, such as&nbsp;simple blood test after fasting.&nbsp; And these only cost&nbsp;a few dollars; in any case, we heavily subsidise them.&nbsp; So Singaporeans need to play their part.&nbsp; The silver tsunami requires you to take part in this battle.&nbsp; It cannot be just the Government and the hospitals alone.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prof. Mehta asked if current community-based long-term care services are affordable.&nbsp; For the vast majority of Singaporeans, they are.&nbsp; The lower income patients are assisted by MOH subvention, Eldercare fund and donations raised by VWOs, and Medifund Silver provides a</p> <p align=left>Column: 2467<p><p>safety net.&nbsp; Subsidised services include home medical, home nursing, home rehabilitation, dementia day-care services and also renal dialysis.&nbsp; But as the population further ages, we&nbsp;expect&nbsp;to do more and we will.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the vast majority of the middle and higher income population, if you regularly save, as you do in Medisave for your acute hospitalisation, you do not have to worry about long-term care when you eventually reach retirement.&nbsp; Voluntarily, some people are doing that but it is not sufficient.&nbsp; That is why&nbsp;it is&nbsp;so important for this 3Es framework to be eventually in place to help Singaporeans develop the&nbsp;discipline to save,&nbsp;and ensure that they can afford their long-term care services.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.15 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms Sylvia Lim asked about the means testing framework for long-term care.&nbsp; The current formula assumes that we subsidise the lower 50% of the population.&nbsp;&nbsp;It therefore includes part of the middle-income group.&nbsp; Whether we use gross income or net income, it does not really matter because if you use gross income, then the threshold criteria must be based on the gross income percentile; if you use net income, then the income threshold will also be based on the net income percentile. So it does not really matter.&nbsp; But the important thing is to be consistent, ie,&nbsp;we cannot use gross income data and&nbsp;then, the&nbsp;threshold&nbsp;is set at net income percentile.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the increased budget that we are pumping into both acute and long-term care, I will expect that money to flow down to the patients to help them during this difficult period.&nbsp; Do not forget that&nbsp;many of these long-term care&nbsp;services are run by charities which&nbsp;also raise their own funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;They would be able to also top-up&nbsp;with whatever that the Ministry of Health routinely&nbsp;supports.&nbsp; But I know that this may be a difficult period to raise money </p> <p align=left>Column: 2468<p><p>through charities and that is why the Finance Minister has kindly set aside a special budget for both MCYS and the Ministry of Health. With that fund, we will help those charities, who, for various reasons this year, are not able to raise enough donation funds to cover their needs.&nbsp; But let me assure Ms Sylvia Lim that we will continue to refine the means testing framework and the assessment process so that it remains fair and relevant for Singaporeans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we need to build up capacity, including new community hospitals, nursing homes and train more skilled manpower. Community hospitals play an important role in helping some patients transit from their acute hospital stay to their&nbsp;return home.&nbsp; Timely and appropriate community hospital care results in lower re-admission rates and improves quality of life for patients especially our elderly.&nbsp; With an ageing population, demand for community hospital services is bound to increase further.&nbsp; We now have six community hospitals with more than 800 beds in total.&nbsp; This includes&nbsp;the new Ren Ci Community Hospital which I visited last month. It is still empty but I expect it to be filled up eventually.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the next 10 years, we will add more community hospital beds.&nbsp; We estimated the need to add an additional 60%.&nbsp; Our immediate plan, and this is confirmed, is to build two new community hospitals with 200 beds each, one next to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital by 2013 and another next to the being planned Jurong General Hospital by 2016. Our target is to raise the current ratio of one community hospital bed per eight acute beds, to one community hospital bed per five acute hospital beds by 2020.&nbsp;That should be sufficient but we have time to review and update the data.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, we are expanding the nursing homes' capacity by half, or 50%, over the next decade, from 9,200 to</p> <p align=left>Column: 2469<p><p>14,000 beds. This will be in both the private and VWO sectors. We are working with several existing nursing homes to increase their bed capacity and help those with expiring land leases relocate to larger venues. Over the next two years, we will help the private and VWO sectors to set up five new nursing homes. We will also work with URA to reserve more sites for nursing home development to meet longer-term demand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Where appropriate, we are blurring the line between VWO and private nursing homes by allowing means tested patients access to private nursing homes through the Portable Subsidy Scheme.&nbsp; This is one way to help raise professional standards across the industry.&nbsp; Last year, 750 beds in private nursing homes came under this Scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;So,&nbsp;it is quite significant. I am ready to do more if there is demand.&nbsp; In addition, from this year, the Ministry of Health will extend Medifund Silver to needy subsidised patients in private nursing homes on the Portable Subsidy Scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp; Separately, I agree with Mdm Cynthia Phua that we need to increase the number of community rehabilitation and dementia daycare centres and we will do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, we need to upgrade the capabilities of the long-term care sector.&nbsp; For example, we need to raise nursing standards in the nursing homes to deal with increasingly complex needs of the elderly, including care for elderly with dementia.&nbsp; For community hospitals, they need to develop stronger medical capabilities to manage more complex sub-acute cases so that we can discharge the patients over there, saving patients' money and also freeing up the expensive beds in acute hospitals. Similarly, the public will expect a greater degree of accountability from the healthcare VWOs as they receive more Government subsidies and public donations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond</p> <p align=left>Column: 2470<p><p>delivering good long-term care to patients, sound corporate governance and financial accountability, must be established in the VWOs. We have extended the Health Manpower Development Programme which is a Government-funded training programme to the long-term care sector.&nbsp; Many healthcare professionals from the sector have benefited from both local and overseas training. We have further revamped the programme to provide higher level of support.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Mdm Halimah, Dr Lam and Mdm Cynthia Phua that we should also enhance the homecare sector.&nbsp; My Ministry currently supports several homecare services but as a next step, we are working with the stakeholders to develop viable models to deliver more coordinated and more integrated healthcare services to the home. We certainly recognise and&nbsp;acknowledge that the caregiver is the key and the pressure on them, which Dr Lam talked about&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;the&nbsp;caregiver syndrome&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;is real.&nbsp; We have friends and relatives who experienced that,&nbsp;so&nbsp;we can see&nbsp;with our own eyes.&nbsp; It is easy for us, visiting a patient&nbsp;with dementia once in three months.&nbsp; But for somebody, day in, day out, 24 hours, living and staying with&nbsp;a loved one who does not even recognise you, and constantly forgets that you&nbsp;have just fed him.&nbsp; To call this stressful is an understatement.&nbsp; So we will certainly do as much as we can to support. Much of the time, it is&nbsp;about training, awareness, how to cope and tips on what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not so sure about caregiver allowance. This is not a topic under the Ministry of Health and is traditionally under the Ministry of Community Development and Sports (MCYS).&nbsp; My own view is, let us do as much as we can to try to support and put the 3Es in place. At the end of the day, it is money.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have carefully constructed ElderShield.&nbsp;&nbsp;Practically, in all other countries, including Japan, their insurance scheme for long-term care is&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;if&nbsp;it is&nbsp;confirmed that you require long-</p> <p align=left>Column: 2471<p><p>term care, then go to the long-term care facility approved by the insurance policy and as charged, you can stay there for as long as you can and, therefore, tremendous abuses, over consumption and over servicing. And the patients&nbsp;lose their freedom of choice. Many of them we know would prefer to age at home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we do for our ElderShield&nbsp;is quite unique; once you are confirmed an ElderShield beneficiary, we just give&nbsp;you the money.&nbsp; With the money, it is up to you on whatever you want to do&nbsp;&ndash; to keep the patient at home with additional home help or admit to a nursing home or whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ElderShield structure, I believe, we have got it right. So do not deviate from that.&nbsp; But what is a weakness today is&nbsp;the amount is too small.&nbsp; So from $300, I raised it to $400 per month.&nbsp; From five years, I raised it to six years&nbsp;&ndash; a significant increase.&nbsp; But I think we need to raise it further.&nbsp; My own view is that for basic ElderShield, maybe we should push it up to $800 for basic, and&nbsp;those in the middle-income group, they should buy a supplement, so that they can afford private nursing homes.&nbsp; We discussed earlier about&nbsp;lower cost possibilities in the neighbouring region, especially Johor Bahru.&nbsp; Let me&nbsp;talk about my day trip during the Chinese New Year to Johor Bahru.&nbsp; I visited one site where a Singaporean investor is going to&nbsp;put up 200-bed nursing home.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;asked him, "How much would&nbsp;you&nbsp;be spending on&nbsp;your capex (capital expenditure)?"&nbsp; It is mind-boggling,&nbsp;the construction cost and land cost&nbsp;are so low,&nbsp;that my cost of just putting up&nbsp;a polyclinic is probably more than his cost of putting up a 200-bed nursing home.&nbsp; So the cost of keeping a resident in a private nursing home in Singapore can easily pay&nbsp;2.5 months of nursing home care&nbsp;in Johor Baru.&nbsp; If the connection is easy and if there is any urgent problem, you can always ambulance in&nbsp;the elderly to Singapore.&nbsp; The family members can get to visit the elderly on weekends.&nbsp; As this nursing</p> <p align=left>Column: 2472<p><p>home's CEO told me, even in Singapore, when they put the elderly in the nursing home, they also only visit them once a week over the weekends. Of course, many visit daily but quite a significant percentage just visit on the weekends. So, what is the difference with putting them in Johor Baru?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But we need to recognise that there are limitations of homecare, brought about by smaller family sizes and frailty with increased life expectancy.&nbsp;We have to be realistic and recognise that homecare may not be for everyone, given that homecare can be relatively expensive and skills intensive.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mdm Cynthia Phua highlighted the major challenge posed by dementia. We need to do more on prevention, early detection and treatment.&nbsp; We will expand our programme to help improve the mental well-being of elderly and we will scale up targeted public education on signs and symptoms of dementia.&nbsp; This is an area which is bound to increase with greater numbers as we go along. We certainly need to train many more geriatricians.&nbsp; But I would like to emphasise that it is neither sufficient nor sustainable to solely&nbsp;rely on geriatricians to take care of the sick elderly.&nbsp; There needs to be general levelling&nbsp;up of&nbsp;capabilities of our healthcare professionals in caring for the elderly.&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Mr Ang Mong Seng that we must be elderly-friendly in our institutions.&nbsp; I do not think we need to set up special counters for elderly. Elderly patients are visible to us, so proper use of language that they are comfortable with, and so on, that ought to be common sense.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, we need to achieve greater integration amongst the various healthcare providers. Our objective is to enable our patients to move seamlessly across different institutions.&nbsp; Integration of care is critical so that we can care for patients in the most appropriate setting</p> <p align=left>Column: 2473<p><p>and at the lowest cost.&nbsp; To facilitate smooth patient transitions, we need to strengthen collaborative partnerships between primary care hospitals and the long-term care sector. For the frail elderly in particular, a multi-disciplinary approach, with close collaboration between doctors, nurses and allied health professionals, is essential, given their multi-faceted needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month, Tan Tock Seng Hospital signed a clinical governance agreement with the new Ren Ci Community Hospital. We&nbsp;will encourage&nbsp;more such win-win collaborations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also building up various support services and mechanism to integrate care. The Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) was set up last year to strengthen discharge planning and facilitate the movement of patients from hospitals to the various long-term care services. I have received good feedback on the good work done by AIC where discharge planning is a lot better now.&nbsp; Of course, there&nbsp;is always scope for further improvement and we will. &nbsp;Affordable drugs&nbsp;are another important means to integration as this lowers our&nbsp;financial barrier to right siting.&nbsp; In reply to Dr Fatimah, our restructured hospitals and polyclinics have established drugs supply partnerships with some VWOs running community hospitals and nursing homes. We support these partnerships and we will expand such partnerships to more VWOs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8">  	</HEAD>   	<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0033CC" vlink="#0033CC" alink="0000FF">      		      																 </span></div> 									<!--MP_NAME:--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6.30 pm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, we need to tap technology much more smartly to help us fight the silver tsunami. Information&nbsp;technology is an important infrastructure.&nbsp; President Obama's Stimulus Package includes a programme to computerise the medical records nationwide, although over the weekend, I read that this item has been</p> <p align=left>Column: 2474<p><p>cut.&nbsp;Even if it proceeds, we are already ahead of the United States because for many years,&nbsp;we have had our hospitals &ndash;public hospitals, at least, and&nbsp;private hospitals follow suit&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;computerise their records. But our problem was, and which was&nbsp;our priority&nbsp;in the last few years,&nbsp;that they remain "silos". So if you are in the same hospital, if you go back to them,&nbsp;you are fine.&nbsp; But once you cross hospitals, there is trouble.&nbsp; So in the last few years, we focused on getting the computers to talk to each other so that we can transfer records electronically even if you start off from different hospitals. And we have done it.&nbsp; It is now possible for public hospitals.&nbsp; It is quite a major achievement. That is something to celebrate.&nbsp; But that is not enough. In parallel, the Ministry of Health has begun reaching out to the general practitioners (GPs)&nbsp;so that we can exchange electronic medical records with the community hospitals and the GPs. These building blocks have provided basic capabilities and health information exchange among public hospitals, polyclinics, GPs and step-down facilities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the Finance Minister mentioned in his Budget speech, Singapore is in a unique position to&nbsp;be among the first in the world to implement electronic health records nationwide across the primary, acute and step-down care setting.&nbsp; This is made possible through the strong foundations built in our public hospitals.&nbsp; The Ministry of Health will see this initiative through, to benefit our patients.

This used to be quite a taboo subject but I am quite glad that after many months of public discussion on this morbid subject, Singaporeans are now able to discuss this with less emotion and more logic.&nbsp; I thank all Singaporeans who have offered their views and insight on this difficult subject. Some of the discussions focused on euthanasia, which was not the Ministry of Health's intention.&nbsp; What we wanted to do was to get Singaporeans think about the necessity to prepare for a good death.&nbsp; One concrete way of doing so is to introduce broader, what we call, the Advanced Care Planning (ACP) amongst healthcare professionals. We are really trying to find a middle ground between a scenario where families insist on treatment&nbsp;at all cost, contrary to clinical opinion and a situation where families opt for non-action due to ignorance on the option palliative care.&nbsp; There was a recent article in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> by three American ICU doctors on their experience with the terminally ill.&nbsp; It was a moving article on how the dying suffered unnecessary pain, akin to torture as their children insisted on fighting on and refusing to let go.&nbsp; The authors ended the articles with this rhetoric:&nbsp; "Those of us on the frontline can't but wonder for whom do we fight on and why do we do it?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; An important part of end-of-life care is the Advanced Medical Directive (AMD).&nbsp; The Directive provides an avenue for people to think about and make a choice</p> <p align=left>Column: 2476<p><p>about their end-of-life care in advance while they can.&nbsp; You just look at this poor lady in coma in a hospital in Rome, who has been so for 17 years.&nbsp; And during this long period, while in a completely vegetative stage, the family has to fight lawsuit after lawsuit with the courts to just let her die. And now, the politicians jump in.&nbsp; I suppose because they think that it win them votes.&nbsp; But you have the Prime Minister and the President on opposite sides of the debate while the poor lady remains in coma.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam, the silver tsunami is definitely coming and we must gear up so that we do not end up overwhelmed by it.&nbsp; We have some time to fix the gaps in the current system.&nbsp; There will be fundamental changes and disruptive changes which we will take care to implement progressively. Change is necessary for the long-term sustainability of our healthcare system and we should not shy away from these changes, even as we cope with the short-term challenges of the current economic tsunami.</p></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Fatimah Lateef--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><p><em>School Health Services</em></p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Fatimah Lateef:</B> <p>Madam,&nbsp;amongst medical staff many still perceive the school health services division&nbsp;as rather archaic and few young doctors voluntarily choose to work there now.

It has greatly helped the elderly as well as the low-income Singaporeans to manage their chronic illnesses much better. It has also encouraged the better use of family physicians amongst those suffering from chronic illnesses.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether he could give an update on the number of patients that have made use of their Medisave to pay for their outpatient treatment. What was the total amount withdrawn and how many doctors are now participating in the Chronic Diseases Management Programme (CDMP)?&nbsp; I have received some feedback from doctors however.&nbsp; They said that the paperwork and the process sometimes becomes a little bit too cumbersome&nbsp;and tedious, I would like to ask the Minister whether there is any way where we can try to streamline some of the procedures, make it a lot easier,&nbsp;so that the doctors will be a lot more encouraged, motivated and incentivised to take part in&nbsp;CDMP.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister whether he would consider increasing the cap of $300.&nbsp; I know he has mentioned that it is important that we do not deplete our Medisave resources.&nbsp; But bearing in mind that the Ministry has enlarged the use of outpatient treatment using Medisave, there is therefore a need to look at the annual limit. I do not think this is a popular thing, at least not currently, but at least I would like to register that point.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My final point is to urge the Ministry to step up preventive efforts because it is</p> <p align=left>Column: 2480<p><p>absolutely critical that in dealing with chronic illnesses, we just do&nbsp;not deal with the end part of it but that we deal with upstream measures and issues, which is really dealing with&nbsp;helping people to better manage their own healthcare needs.&nbsp; One very important area is the importance of healthcare screening.&nbsp; People now go for screening after they have fallen ill but not before they fall ill. So how do we encourage and raise public awareness to educate people to make them understand the importance of going for pre-illnesses screening?&nbsp; Apart from awareness, there is also this issue of affordability. A lot of the low-income Singaporeans and elderly Singaporeans I spoke to are prepared to go for screening once they are made aware of it but they are concerned about the cost. Could the Ministry look at ways to make screening a lot more affordable to low-income Singaporeans and the elderly.</p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	<html><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Also, we have not helped their families&nbsp;who look after them.&nbsp; Many have been left behind to cope with their dependants on their own.&nbsp; Many families have difficulties seeking help, as they are either embarrassed or do not want to face the stigma of the illness.&nbsp; I have checked and found that there are only three day care centres in Singapore, although the Minister had earlier revealed to me that there altogether six centres for mentally ill patients.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made a cold call and spoke to one of the occupational therapists who is taking care of one centre.&nbsp; He has two other colleagues who are helping him to take care of about 40-50 clients daily, and they are understaffed.&nbsp; The average age of the clients is 30-40 years old.&nbsp; Basically, these are healthy men and women in their prime, and yet they need long-term medication.&nbsp; I understand that</p>  <p align=left>Column: 2482<p><p>the medication is very expensive as well.&nbsp;

We have done well in&nbsp;community support for the elderly.&nbsp; Can we have similar networks for our mentally unstable patients?&nbsp; Presently, many of our community leaders and volunteers do not understand the various ailments relating to mental health, let alone how to help&nbsp;and support them and their family members.&nbsp; I really hope that the Ministry will make an effort to share this knowledge with the ground.&nbsp; I would also like to appeal for more VWOs to set up community support centres, so as to support these&nbsp;mentally ill&nbsp;residents and their families with the help&nbsp;of the Ministry of Community Development and Sports.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there is a limit to what the VWOs can do both in terms of manpower and resources, especially on trained personnel.&nbsp; I understand that it takes at least a good five years of post-graduate study to be trained in this area of medical specialty.&nbsp;

In the years from 2002 to 2006, breast cancer cases here were the highest with 6,626 patients.&nbsp; The next highest number was for colorectal cancer, the commonest cancer in men, with 3,790 patients.&nbsp; Since the start of the national screening programme in 2002, there has been a definite shift over the past few years towards discovering breast cancer at the earlier stages, when it is easy to treat and&nbsp; the chances of survival are higher.&nbsp; However, a survey last year found that only 41% of women aged 50-69 go for breast screening every two years as recommended.&nbsp; Many women are afraid to find out thinking that a diagnosis of cancer is a sure death sentence.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp;2004, a&nbsp;survey found that a third of women did not think breast screening&nbsp;was needed as they appeared healthy.&nbsp; But the fact is that there are no symptoms in early breast cancer;&nbsp;so even women who think that they are in the pink of health might have it.&nbsp; About 15% did not go for mammograms because they feared the pain, and 12% said that it was inconvenient.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is time to address all these issues and adjust our policy accordingly,</p> <p align=left>Column: 2485<p><p>especially on public education and raising awareness in order to get more women to go for screening.&nbsp;

This is set to rise, with breast cancer cases here up roughly at 4%&nbsp;a year.&nbsp; A successful national screening programme with participation by at least 70% of the female population can cut breast cancer deaths by 20%-40% after 10 years.&nbsp;
