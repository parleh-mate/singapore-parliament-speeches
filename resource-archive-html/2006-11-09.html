Keng (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion standing in the

name of the Member for Jurong GRC, Mdm Halimah Yacob to thank the President for

his Address.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President spoke about </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> to become the best place in </span><st1:place><span

 style='font-size:13.0pt'>Asia</span></st1:place><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>

to live, work and play.&nbsp; I fully support that vision, and see it relevant

not only to Singaporeans, but also Singaporeans-to-be, foreign talent, transient

residents, visitors and tourists.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> needs to be more than just the best upgraded HDB

estate, more than the most luxurious hotel, more than the state-of-the art

research centre, intelligent office tower and the most productive factory, more

than the biggest theme park or the latest night-spot.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having lived in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>London</span></st1:place></st1:City><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> for seven years, </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>London</span></st1:place></st1:City><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>, to me, is more than the <p align=left>Column: 266</p>Big Ben, the </span><st1:place><span

 style='font-size:13.0pt'>West End</span></st1:place><span style='font-size:

13.0pt'>, the </span><st1:place><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Chinatown</span></st1:place><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> or the fish and chips.&nbsp; According to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>London</span></st1:place></st1:City><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>’s official website, I quote: "</span><st1:City><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>London</span></st1:place></st1:City><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> is the place where the historic past and the vibrant

present come alive. A blend of history, ground-breaking architecture and

culture has created an amazing and constantly evolving city."&nbsp; The British

have used the tagline "Totally London", and we have come up with "Uniquely

Singapore".<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> unique for?&nbsp; What does it mean to be a

Singaporean?&nbsp; In the past, the Government has had various initiatives to

develop and market the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> identity.&nbsp; There was the creation of the

Merlion, the orchid motif Singapore Dress, we even came out with the National

Ideology, with a set of shared values and </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> 21.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government can set a vision, but I think the

national identity is best forged from the ground up.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our local Chinese pop culture is one good example of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> culture that has found a life on its own, without

much governmental support or intervention.&nbsp; I would like to give

illustration now in Mandarin.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>(In Mandarin)</i>:&nbsp;[<i>For vernacular speech,

please refer to&nbsp;<a

href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2006/20061109/20061109VS_150414.pdf">Appendix A</a>*.</i>]&nbsp;Our

Chinese pop artistes have done well.&nbsp; At the recent Global Chinese Music

Awards held in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:

  13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>, Stephanie Sun won five awards, including most

Popular Female Artiste and Best Album.&nbsp; Tanya Chua was the best female

vocalist at the prestigious Taiwan Golden Melody Award.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides singers, our composers like twin brothers Li

Weisong and Sisong, Liang Wenfu, lyricist Xiao Han and music producer Billy Koh

have groomed and worked with some of the top singers in Chinese pop.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must say 20 years ago, as a young boy infatuated

with Chinese pop, I never <p align=left>Column: 267</p>dreamed that Singaporean singers or songs would ever

make it this big.&nbsp; Pop songs do play a big part in our growing-up

experience, be it Beatles, Abba, Canto pop, J-pop or K-pop.&nbsp; For me, it

was <i>xinyao</i>, literally translated as Singapore Songs.&nbsp; They were

simple and amateurish, but it had a huge following in the eighties, and, in my

opinion, that was the foundation of the Chinese pop success we are seeing

today.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should embrace </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> pop culture more.&nbsp; Singapore Tourism Board has

appointed pop singer JJ Lin Junjie as its ambassador for the Chinese

market.&nbsp; This is a good illustration that pop culture can also help with

tourism receipts and economic returns, like what we have seen in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Hollywood</span></st1:place></st1:City><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> for the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>, Bollywood for </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>India</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> and Hallyu for </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Korea</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>.&nbsp; There is a lot more potential we can explore.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>In English</i> ):&nbsp; Another unique part of the

</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> identity is our language.&nbsp; While Singlish is

not, and should not, be our official language, it is one of the most accurate

tell-tale signs that helps us identify fellow Singaporeans in a foreign

city.&nbsp; Singlish gave us the word ‘kiasuism’, which is technically not a

‘Uniquely Singapore’ trait or behaviour, but a universal one.&nbsp; In fact, I

think Mr Bean is someone who has presented the true flavour of ‘kiasuism’

perfectly.&nbsp; While Rowan Atkinson illustrates it best in his actions and

facial expression, it is here in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>, where we have found the very word to describe it!<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, I fully applaud the Huayu Cool and

Speak Good English campaigns, as with globalisation, besides understanding

fellow countrymen, we need to communicate, and communicate well with people

around the globe.&nbsp; I used to travel to the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Netherlands</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>, and learned that the Dutch is one of the most

linguistically talented people as most of them speak at least three

languages.&nbsp; As a predominantly Chinese population, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singa<p align=left>Column: 268</p>pore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> has access to two of the most widely spoken languages

in the world.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some people may remind me that it is not&nbsp;a good

comparison as there are similarities within the Indo-European family of

languages, but English and Mandarin are fundamentally different and will be

difficult languages to be mastered at the same time.&nbsp; However, I am happy

to observe that we do have increasing numbers of bilingual talents in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>.&nbsp; A senior radio manager recently shared with me

that it is now easier to find good bilingual deejays.&nbsp; I also see many TV

reporters now filing news with equal competence and eloquence on both Channel

News Asia and Channel 8 News.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was watching </span><st1:place><i><span

 style='font-size:13.0pt'>Forbidden City</span></i></st1:place><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> two months ago, and, like many in the audience, I was

impressed by Kit Chan’s powerful vocals.&nbsp; It suddenly dawned upon me that

perhaps it is only in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>, can we find a talent who is equally at ease on the

stage of </span><st1:place><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Forbidden City</span></i></st1:place><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> and the Chinese musical </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><i><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Snow</span></i></st1:PlaceName><i><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Lake</span></i></st1:PlaceName></st1:place><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that, there is more that can be done to

leverage on the population profile of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> and make us a truly bilingual, if not trilingual or

even multi-lingual society.&nbsp; To master a language, one needs an

environment to listen, speak, read and write.&nbsp; I believe the Government

can take the lead to provide this environment.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The term &quot;East meets West&quot; is often coined

on </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>, but I think </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> is equally, if not more, a &quot;East meets

East&quot; society.&nbsp; Our forefathers brought with them their long history,

culture and traditions from </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>China</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> and </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>India</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>, and with the indigenous Malay heritage, today we

enjoy the diversity and richness of different races, religions and

languages.&nbsp; I have to admit, Sir, that I used to be a skeptical young

Singaporean who sees the faces of different races and different colours on

official materials as totally <p align=left>Column: 269</p>deliberate and artificial.&nbsp; However, in July

this year, I was treated to a spectacle of colours and vibrancy of our varied

cultures when I watched <i>Soundwaves</i> put up by the People’s

Association.&nbsp; As someone familiar with stage productions, I gave it top

marks in its tastefully integrated performance representing our cultural

mix.&nbsp; This is true creativity and artistic vision at work.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides the creative director of <i>Soundwaves</i>,

Dick Lee, who is no stranger to intercultural experiments with his <i>Fried

Rice Paradise</i> and <i>Mad Chinaman</i>, there are also many examples you can

find in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>.&nbsp; For example, the Singapore Chinese Orchestra

has shown its versatility with Malay melodies, and theatre director Ong Keng

Sen is well known in the international arts scene for his intercultural

Shakespeare-inspired trilogy which beautifully fuses various Asian performing

art forms. Recently, I watched a local Hokkien opera based on the Indian epic

Mahabharata scripted and produced by the Chinese Opera Institute.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We should encourage this special blend of

cultures.&nbsp; A tourist would be more interested in our local performances

which truly reflect our delicious &quot;rojak&quot; heritage.&nbsp; Having said

that, a blend of cultures will only be meaningful and successful if there is

first a strong foundation in the respective cultures, whether it is traditional

or contemporary.&nbsp; It is the artistic stroke of creativity that will

conjure the magic.&nbsp; We must remind ourselves that we should not be looking

for overnight or even near-term success.&nbsp; It took <i>xinyao</i> or Chinese

songs some 20 years to evolve into the successful </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> pop today.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am glad to note that besides investing in physical

arts and cultural infrastructure, the Government will be encouraging a greater

diversity of involvement in our arts and cultural <p align=left>Column: 270</p>sectors.&nbsp; I would like

to point out that good quality works is one key prerequisite to draw

audiences.&nbsp; Hence, we must not neglect the investment in capabilities to

create more original and interesting artistic and creative works.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I often lament that in land-scarce </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>, much of our physical heritage has to give way for

new developments.&nbsp; Most of my student days can only be relived in my

memory, with my teachers, ex-classmates and through old photographs, as many of

my school buildings are no longer standing.&nbsp; Some have even ceased to

exist in name.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where arts and culture can play a significant

role.&nbsp; I am not a nostalgic person, but we can use arts and culture to

inform the young generation of the past, sometimes not too distant past, and

not to take things for granted.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I read the grand plans under Intelligent Nation

2015, I cannot help but remember the days when mobile communication is not so

prevalent.&nbsp; In a play I produced in 1991, a doting mother bought a mobile

phone for her daughter who was moving to the university hostel so that she

could call her every night.&nbsp; That scene was greeted with a round of 'wows'

in the audience, but 15 years later today, even a primary school kid carries a

mobile phone!<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Movies can also serve as historical documents.&nbsp; I

remember vividly the images of our humble provision shops in Eric Khoo’s film

Be With Me.&nbsp; As the movie travels in the international film festival

circuit, audiences around the world will discover another facet of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> that may not be spanking clean and modern, but a very

real and authentic facet of our society which is fast disappearing.&nbsp; This

is more engaging than a picture in the archives or museum.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I would like to move on to the subject of new

media, another means of <p align=left>Column: 271</p>self and cultural expression.&nbsp; New media’s impact

on the young, to say the least, has been massive. Compared to traditional

media, new media is much less structured; it is more informal and also more

difficult to control.&nbsp; It is a virtual world with its own parameters,

rules and regulations.&nbsp; Its estate or space is both private and

public.&nbsp; It has both advantages and disadvantages, presenting new

opportunities and solutions as well as new problems.&nbsp; It is a force to be

reckoned with and most people in the developed world cannot envision a future

without it.&nbsp; We are beginning to see its social, political and economic

powers.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was reported recently that Google UK is poised to

overtake </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>UK</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>’s main TV stations in advertising revenue within the

year.&nbsp; It is therefore a wise choice that the Government has identified

interactive and digital media as a new sector to grow.&nbsp; We should harness

the power of both new and old media, for instance, in using them for cross

communications and marketing to different audiences.&nbsp; The popularity of

Singapore Idol and the Idol format around the world was largely due to its

ability to leverage on both the traditional TV media and the new mobile

media.&nbsp; It manages to engage the audience and turn them into fans who like

the power to be able to pick their winner. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

continue to evolve.&nbsp; From the ancient days of using smoke signals,

pigeons, to print, radio, television, fax, telephony, mobile and now the

Internet, it does not mean that the emergence of one new media will always

replace another.&nbsp; In fact, the radio continued to survive in the advent of

the television.&nbsp;&nbsp;It became even more accessible with the emergence of

the portable radio, then the car radio, followed by the mobile phone radio

today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The convergence of media can

pose problems for the conscientious censor.&nbsp; On the other hand, the good

citizens of the world can now also play a bigger role in helping us to police

our virtual space.&nbsp; For example, the <i>Wikipedia</i> is a self-regulating

resource.&nbsp; As reported in <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i> in

October 2006, Alexander M.C. Halavais, an Assistant Professor with the State

University of New York at </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-size:

slipped in 13 errors in <i>Wikipedia</i>.&nbsp; In less than three hours,

all&nbsp;his false facts had been deleted, thanks to the vigilance of <i>Wikipedia</i>

editors who regularly check recently updated entries. On Dr Halawi's &quot;user

talk&quot; page, one Wikipedian pleaded with him to &quot;refrain from writing

nonsense articles and falsifying information&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The differences between new

and traditional media call for different treatments from the authorities.&nbsp;

We can allow different platforms for responsible and maybe less responsible

expression of views, for example,&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>quan min luan jian</i>&nbsp;is

for all citizens to talk nonsense,&nbsp;<i>quan min kai jian</i>&nbsp;calls

for&nbsp;all citizens to speak their minds, and&nbsp;<i>quan min hao hao jian</i>&nbsp;calls

for all citizens to have a good discussion.&nbsp; I believe people will know

which programme is meant to serve what target audience.&nbsp; What the

Government should do is to ensure&nbsp;that there is no masquerading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government should not and

cannot hold itself responsible for what the people see or read.&nbsp; Otherwise,

Singaporeans&nbsp;lose the ability to think, evaluate and judge for

themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Mr Brown incident illustrates too clearly how new

and old media could have been engaged <p align=left>Column: 273</p>better.&nbsp; Without having driven

negative comments or untrue information about the Government underground, into

the labyrinth of virtual space, the Government loses an opportunity to engage

the propagators and dispel the erroneous statements.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I read comments in the

newspapers and compare them with those in blogs and online forums, I sometimes

wonder if they are from two different populations talking about two different

countries.&nbsp; I do not think that the reality is mostly positive like in the

traditional media or like what the new media is portraying, mostly negative and

critical.&nbsp; I believe the real world is somewhere in between.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to accept that it

will be very difficult,&nbsp;if not&nbsp;impossible, to monitor and rebut all

negative online comments against the Government.&nbsp; We should consider

relaxing regulations on traditional media to allow people to vent grouses and

frustrations, without always demanding for constructive suggestions.&nbsp;

Singaporeans can then engage openly in meaningful, level-headed discussions

without fear of prosecution.&nbsp; Erroneous assumptions, wrong ideas, narrow

mindsets, prejudices and biases, loyalties, tolerance and wisdom can all be

brought to the light of day and seen clearly for what they are.&nbsp; I believe

in the Singaporean’s ability to discern wisely.&nbsp; Even if we may not be

able to do so accurately, that is our judgment and that judgment should be

given the opportunity to be sharpened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

take the slightest of hardship.&nbsp; They are adults but they still turn to

their parents for pocket <p align=left>Column: 274</p>money.&nbsp; They have difficulties holding down a

job.&nbsp; I wonder if this reflects, on a micro level, a side effect of our

Government’s parental style towards its citizens.&nbsp; If our Government

trusts the general public’s ability to refrain from uncontrolled gambling by

allowing casinos, she should also trust its ability to tell right from wrong,

black from white, or even grey, on other issues.&nbsp; Thus, I urge the

irregular.&nbsp; He has four children, the eldest in Secondary 2, the second

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I rise to support the

Motion of Thanks to the President.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his Speech to

this House, the President stressed on the need &quot;to build an inclusive

society which leaves no one behind&quot;.&nbsp;Sir, I concur with the

President's call that we do more to assist the low-income Singaporeans and to

help them progress with the rest of society and country.&nbsp; I see this as an

important challenge facing us today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, how do we

ensure that the Government will do more - and successfully - to assist

low-income Singaporeans?&nbsp; How do we bridge the income divide? How do we

ensure that the existing vehicle we use is both helpful and effective?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the President

highlighted that &quot;because of globalisation, incomes in many countries are

stretching out&quot;. Sir, I share the President's sentiment that </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> is not spared from this. Widening of income gap is

undoubtedly going to be an ongoing challenge for us as our country strives for

economic prosperity. The &quot;Household Expenditure Survey&quot; which tracked

income changes between 1998 and 2003, highlighted that the average monthly

household income of the lower 40% of Singaporeans had declined; whereas the

household income of the top 20% increased by about 2.2% (these figures are

obtained from the <i>Singapore Statistics 2005</i> ).&nbsp;The media has also

been covering the topic of widening of our nation's&nbsp;income gap since

pre-General Election 2006; in essence, many had lamented - and more will do so

in the near future - that it is getting difficult to live in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> as our rich are getting richer and the poor remain

<p align=left>Column: 276</p>unchanged or getting poorer.&nbsp; Many have questioned whether this is healthy

for </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> despite what the Government has already done through

the numerous off-budget measures and financial assistance packages for the

low-income group. Many remain ignorant and still question the accessibility of

some of these assistance schemes and programmes. The question prevails: how can

the Government truly lend a hand to lighten the load of the poor - explicitly

those who see themselves being left behind? What are the obtainable resources

these Singaporeans can proactively - and realistically - tap on? Just how

effective is the process&nbsp;in reaching out to this vulnerable segment?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is true -

and laudable indeed - that many have benefited from the Government's financial

assistance schemes such as rebates on HDB rentals and utilities,

the&nbsp;Workfare Scheme/Bonus, ComCare Fund, Progress Package, and the

once-off Economic Restructuring Shares (ERS) which were provided by the

Government during the economic slowdown to help and improve the financial

situation of the households, especially those of the low-income group.&nbsp; It

is evident that the Government has continuously done all&nbsp;that it can to

provide a helping hand for the poor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while the

Government has so relentlessly reached out to the poor - with seemingly

never-ending new financial assistance schemes and funds, save to speak, almost

annually the past&nbsp;five years - there are still in existence real-life

cases where low-income families&nbsp;are still ignorant and at a loss of where

and how to go about seeking help.&nbsp;Uninformed and helpless they may appear

to us,&nbsp;the fact remains that these people continue to be poor and

vulnerable. It is indeed regrettable to know that though </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

  style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singapore</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> has one of the highest number of millionaires in the

world and with a per capita GDP of $44,666 - this is com<p align=left>Column: 277</p>parable with many

developed countries - we still have many low-income citizens who live

&quot;hand-to-mouth&quot;.&nbsp; How can we reach out to them more effectively

and efficiently so that they will not be left behind?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government

must not relent on our efforts to help the low-income group.&nbsp; Despite the

numerous help schemes which have been promulgated, many still fall through the

cracks and do not receive the much needed financial aid.&nbsp;Often, we are too

preoccupied with giving birth to many assistance schemes but unintentionally

neglect the &quot;follow through&quot;.&nbsp;What do I mean by this? First, do

those who are genuinely in need of those help schemes know what they are

entitled to, where to go and how to go about doing it?&nbsp; There are still

many who are illiterate or too frail or disabled to make their way to the CDC

or MPS.&nbsp;There are also cases where those who really need help are themselves

too embarrassed (and find it shameful) to approach for public assistance. This

is exactly how the family that I cited felt before they approached me.

Secondly, when help is administered, is what is dished out prompt, exacting,

adequate or even interim to &quot;hold the line&quot; and hoping things will

get better? &nbsp;The entire approach to financial assistance to the poor and

needy needs to be practical and compelling. We aim to help Singaporeans

inculcate an attitude of proactiveness in helping themselves and become

self-reliant.&nbsp;We may need to do more than merely providing the systems. It

goes to the root of the problem - mindsets, habits, attitudes which need

correcting. This will not be an easy task but still an imperative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I

would like to highlight the issue of assisting the low-income Singaporeans and,

in particular, I want to urge the Government to review <p align=left>Column: 278</p>and rationalise the

current assistance or welfare schemes.&nbsp; In addition, I also hope to look

at the two-pronged approach that is imperative in helping the poor, something

we all cannot ignore.&nbsp; One of them is the educational aspect, in

particular, to change the mindset of the young and not-so-young.&nbsp; Another

which the poor have to constantly tussle with is the roof over their heads and,

finally, how we can help them to help themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Reviewing and rationalising current

assistance/welfare schemes</span></i><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the President

highlighted that &quot;The Government will introduce more measures to help

needy Singaporeans more systematically, learning from our experience about

those measures which work and those which do not.&quot;&nbsp; I concur with the

President's Address in wanting to address the learning points from all our

previous financial schemes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, there are no

less than 36&nbsp;help and financial assistance schemes in existence.&nbsp; I

certainly urge the Government to review all the help schemes on a regular basis

to ensure their relevancy and applicability.&nbsp; Most importantly, the

schemes should be well utilised and an analysis or a survey done on how useful

these schemes have been should be carried out.&nbsp; A more in-depth

independent survey or study should also be done to gather views from the

beneficiaries, those administering them and the general public on whether these

help measures have been effective. Frankly, if you were to ask me what all

these 36 schemes are and their qualifying criteria and the extent of help

given, I would need to do some serious research.&nbsp; This is the crux of the

problem, ie, the issue of knowledge and comprehensibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I beg the

Government to do a serious review and attempt to rationalise the schemes so

that our poor and needy, including those who need interim assistance, will be

able to understand the schemes and what and how they can tap <p align=left>Column: 279</p>from them.&nbsp;

We are dealing with poor and low-income families, some are old and some

uneducated.&nbsp; To be successful with outreach, simplicity is the key

word.&nbsp; The important thing is that the right aid is given to those who

need them and in the most prompt and effective way.&nbsp; There is a strong

impetus towards better case management.&nbsp; There could also be a national

platform where all self-help groups, NGOs, CDCs and MCYS can build and forge to

ensure a more total and coordinated approach to each case.&nbsp; However, to be

well-coordinated amongst the agencies is one thing.&nbsp; To successfully reach

out to those who truly need help is another.&nbsp; Looking at the scale of the

low-income problem and ageing population, perhaps one central agency should be

beefed up to handle this growing and imminent problem.&nbsp; Perhaps, MCYS

could be divided into three separate Ministries so that the Ministry of

Community Development alone can handle social issues and the provision of

social safety nets, just like many years ago.&nbsp; This notwithstanding, in this

whole process, we must take heed not to cultivate a crutch mentality.&nbsp; Our

people should understand that they should try their best to rely on themselves

and look to the Government for help as a last resort.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>The right mindsets must start from young -

education</span></i><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have been

focusing on &quot;Teach Less Learn More&quot; as a working philosophy for the

Ministry of Education and to build &quot;Thinking Schools and a Learning

Nation&quot;.&nbsp; I suggest we take one step further and inculcate life

skills for our young.&nbsp; I am not urging MOE to introduce and add more into

the syllabus nor change examination formats, but our Government

(inter-Ministry) can create an environment and culture where Singaporeans

understand financial management, managing change and developing employability

skills.&nbsp; Some of these cannot be taught in the classroom, which is why I

urge the <p align=left>Column: 280</p>Government to create an environment and culture so that, whether at

home, in school or at work, the right mindsets are propagated.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The education and

help processes must start from all angles and at all stages.&nbsp; Financial

health planning and management may need to be something taught to our general

populace rather than leaving them to financial or insurance institutions, which

is the current phenomenon.&nbsp; The Government needs to adopt pre-emptive

measures rather than reactive measures.&nbsp; Putting out fires is one

aspect.&nbsp; The ideal is not to even allow the fire to be sparked or fuelled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, this is exactly

what the President had highlighted in his speech: &quot;We need fundamental

mindset changes - on the part of families, workers, employers and the

Government&quot;, to tackle the challenges ahead of us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But changing the

mindset is a difficult task.&nbsp; The state of mind and the way of thinking

have been rooted since young.&nbsp; To change it is clearly an uphill

task.&nbsp; There is this saying that the poor wish to be rich, the rich wish

to be happy, the single wish to be married and the married wish to be

dead.&nbsp; I am quoting this from Ann Landers, US advice columnist,

1918-2002.&nbsp; In essence, we cannot please everyone, even if the intention

is good.&nbsp; And, as in all policies, there is no one policy that can make

everyone happy.&nbsp; But in the President's Speech, Sir, the message cannot be

clearer.&nbsp; We have ahead of us a rising need of low-income and older

Singaporeans.&nbsp; The individuals have to make the effort to help themselves

and to provide for their future needs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>A roof over their heads - housing for the

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></i><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> Sir, one pressing need among the poor is a non-leaky

roof over their heads.&nbsp; We know of a trend where flat owners are <p align=left>Column: 281</p>asking

HDB for the third, fourth or more loans to downgrade to smaller flats.&nbsp; If

managing the current loan is already a huge struggle, managing a smaller loan

cannot hide their problem either.&nbsp; It will only compound their existing

problem and prolong their struggle.&nbsp; Renting could well be the next best

option.&nbsp; One of the serious impediments often faced by downgraders is the

30-month debarment period from renting a unit from HDB direct.&nbsp; MPs see

many&nbsp;such cases at our MPS seeking to appeal for HDB to lift the debarment

period due to their financial predicament.&nbsp; I urge the Government to

seriously consider taking a bold step to remove or at least shorten this

debarment for legitimate or genuine cases.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the

Government should also take the bold step to introduce the full spectrum of

rental housing, ie, including making four-room units available for rent for

those with very huge families who really need them.&nbsp; There is a need for

more rental housing for low-income Singaporeans.&nbsp; Economists have done and

shown the calculations cost-wise that renting a unit even at market prices is a

financially more viable option as compared to an outright purchase, especially

of a leasehold interest of 99 years or less.&nbsp; I see many cases of families

requesting for downgrades and rental flats.&nbsp; This includes the elderly in

their twilight years whose children have shifted out of their homes and those

who cannot continue to service their bank loans.&nbsp; Would it not be better

and more prudent for the HDB to buy back these flats at fair market value and

apportion them rental housing so that the monies can be used to tide them

through their living and healthcare expenses?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is another

similar but throbbing issue affecting the less well-off.&nbsp; With the

implementation of MUP and LUP nation-wide, there is an increase in the spate of

low-income Singaporeans being unable to <p align=left>Column: 282</p>pay for the upgrading.&nbsp; Although

there are various schemes to assist these people under the HDB's help schemes

for MUP, there are those who have monies in their CPF Special Account but none

in their&nbsp;Ordinary&nbsp;Account.&nbsp;Can the CPF Board allow withdrawal of

the Special Account monies to pay for upgrading bills or arrears?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir,

many of the new Members in this House come from the post-independence

generation with humble backgrounds.&nbsp; I am confident that, together, we can

jointly work towards this goal and to ensure all Singaporeans that we do not

leave anyone behind.&nbsp; Singaporeans have given a strong mandate to the new

leadership team, and we do not want to and must not let them down.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me conclude

by borrowing part of William Boetcker's quotation:&nbsp; &quot;We cannot

strengthen the weak by weakening the strong.&nbsp; We cannot help the poor by

destroying the rich.&quot;&nbsp; Contrary to&nbsp;many who feel that we have an

elitist government, I think the Government is serious about building an

inclusive society.&nbsp; It is a high calling; challenging nonetheless, but not

impossible.&nbsp; With clarity of mind to help every one move forward, I am

confident that we will be able to build an inclusive society and yet avoid the

mistakes other countries have made in pursuing welfare schemes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a conclusion to

the story that I have told at the beginning of my speech, I am happy to report

to this House, Sir, that many hands are now at work to help this family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I therefore

<p align=left>Column: 283</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is a privilege and an honour to be able to

speak in this House.&nbsp; Today, I speak after having spent over six months

with the residents of Braddell Heights.&nbsp; I am happy to say that the

majority of my residents do all right on their own.&nbsp; Even as I speak now,

I am sure many are planning where to go for holidays with their children.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as what my

colleague, Ms Ellen Lee, has just said, there is,&nbsp;however, a significant

minority whose problems are many and resources few.&nbsp; I am sure that, over

time, I will learn more and come up with more solutions to help them.&nbsp;

Today, however, I just want to paint a rough picture of who this group is and

where I think we can help them most.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The poorest 20% of my residents include those who

qualify for public assistance and Medifund.&nbsp; The rest of them would have a

roof over their heads, meals on their tables and, for some, a few hundred

dollars in their bank accounts.&nbsp; But their constant companion is

worry.&nbsp; If they fall sick, there is little cushion for the family.&nbsp;

Some are constantly in arrears over their utilities and conservancy

bills.&nbsp; Some cannot pay their children’s school fees on time.&nbsp; Each

month, the parents' salary is completely taken up by the necessities of

living.&nbsp; They have little joy in life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I

know that as a Member of Parliament, such things as &quot;joy of living&quot;

do not normally come into our terms of reference.&nbsp; Some people may say,

"As long as you have a place to live in, food to eat and have a job, what is

the problem?&quot;&nbsp; The problem, Sir, is that joyless families are not

strong.&nbsp; And weak families make a weak community and that, in turn, makes

a weak nation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

</span></i><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a quick

look at the bottom 20%.&nbsp; The <i>Household Survey</i> published in June

<p align=left>Column: 284</p>showed that the average monthly household income for the top 20% grew by over

2% per annum over the period 2000 to 2005.&nbsp; By contrast, household income

fell by 4.3% per annum for the second lowest 10% of the population, while the

lowest 10% had no income at all.&nbsp; The survey also showed that households

in the 11th to 20th percentile based on income saw their average monthly

earnings shrink from $1,470 in 2000 to $1,180 last year.&nbsp; In contrast, the

average income of the top 10% of households for the same period increased from

$14,360 to $16,480.&nbsp; The drop in wages for the lowest income groups is in

part due to an ageing population.&nbsp; There are now a lot more households

with more retired persons and, hence, no income.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, needless to

say, a household with $1,180 to spend lives very differently from that with

$16,480. But&nbsp;I do not want to speak of the income gap, which some of my

colleagues have earlier talked about.&nbsp; Today, I want to speak of HOPE.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most

important schemes we have for the bottom 20% is this scheme called Home

Ownership Plus Education (HOPE).&nbsp; Under HOPE, educational bursaries kick

in for the children from pre-school up to university-level education.&nbsp; The

amount varies from $250 for preschoolers to $2,000 a year for

undergraduates.&nbsp; A substantial amount of $50,000 helps the family pay for

their home mortgage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><!-- Begin CDATA tag --><!-- End CDATA tag --><!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag --><!--MP_NAME:-->&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>There is also a cash grant of $1,000 to help

the family offset utilities bills. So all in, under this scheme, families can

get about $100,000 from the Government in terms of housing and education

grants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two main

conditions to qualify for all these benefits are that the couple must have no

more than two children and earn <p align=left>Column: 285</p>less than $1,500 jointly. The wife, she must

be&nbsp;younger than 35 years old.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My proposal,

Sir, is to do away with the cap on children and the age limit. With this, HOPE

will truly be what its name signifies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me explain

my suggestions. I understand the thinking behind such a scheme - we want to

encourage lower income families to have fewer children so that they can devote

more resources to them. The original scheme was, in fact, called the Small

Families Improvement Scheme or SFIS in short. Sir, between January 1st, 2004,

when the HOPE scheme first started, and September 30th of the same year, 40% of

630 applications received were rejected. This was because applicants either

exceeded the income, education, or age criteria. Question number

one:&nbsp;&nbsp;are our&nbsp;criteria too strict?&nbsp; Another question: are

small families only families that need improvement?&nbsp; If not, why do we

care that the family has more than two children?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Two is enough</span></i><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, a monthly

income of $1,500 does not go far, especially if&nbsp;they have more than two

children. How are the parents going to upgrade themselves if they are living

from hand-to-mouth each month?&nbsp; In the past, debates in the SFIS had

centred on whether the Government had a right to decide how many children

families should have, who should have more kids, and who did not.&nbsp; I do

not intend to engage in this line of reasoning.&nbsp; Instead, I want to focus

on a pragmatic issue:&nbsp;how do we care for poor families with many children?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For many in

this group, being on the HOPE scheme will give them a much-needed leg up, out

of the poverty trap.&nbsp;Sir, I would like to ask the MCYS.&nbsp; Suppose we

do away with the cap on <p align=left>Column: 286</p>children and age,&nbsp;how many more people will we be

helping?&nbsp; Putting these families under the HOPE scheme would help them to

pay for their educational needs. It also gives a generous training grant, so

that parents can upgrade themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The HOPE scheme, the

most generous and comprehensive Government-planned menu of subsidies on family

life, does not apply to them. To be sure, there are other schemes helping these

families&nbsp;such as&nbsp;KIFAS for the kindergarten kids' education, food

rations, subsidies for computers, and so on.&nbsp; But these cannot be compared

to the systematic, generous and, most important, constructive help that HOPE

gives to the family as a whole unit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to give hope

to this group of people and families, who cannot qualify for HOPE scheme. They

are the ones who may be even worse off than the group that gets on the

scheme&nbsp;because&nbsp;besides the financial problems that they all face,

they have three, four or even five children&nbsp; to bring up and feed! Can we

give them a helping hand, please?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I find

the&nbsp;status quo currently&nbsp;a strange one, where people who

need&nbsp;more, get even less. I know there&nbsp;are those who say that these

changes will open the floodgates to even more such families who have more

children than they can afford.&nbsp; Sir, I have no statistics but I know that

people choose to have children, or not,&nbsp;based not on whether they are

eligible for the HOPE scheme. The reasons are beyond the ambit of this policy.

Given this, let us forget that HOPE was once called SFIS, and call it by its

real name.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I have a

related question. Of the 6,000 families who qualify for HOPE, only 630 have

signed up. And the MCYS is targeting only 1,000 by 2007.&nbsp; This, to me, is

an astonishingly modest target. Why are we so hesitant in offering help? Is it

because we think that this will breed <p align=left>Column: 287</p>a crutch mentality in people?&nbsp; If

so, why have the scheme in the first place? &nbsp;I think that once the policy

is set, we ought to pursue it in&nbsp;earnestness and&nbsp;we ought to market

the scheme more aggressively.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that some of this is happening

on the ground now, with the Family Service Centres playing their part. More can

and should be done.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Transport</span></i><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, still on the

low-income group, I would like to tackle the issue of transport.&nbsp; Even the

slightest increase in the cost of living, such as transport, hits them very

hard.&nbsp; Average public transport expenditure for households here is now

about $2,000&nbsp;a year, up by over 30% from $1,512 in 1993.&nbsp; For many of

us, these fare increases have been manageable. As for drivers, cars have gotten

cheaper since 1993.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But for people in the lower income group, public

transport is all that they can afford. &nbsp;It is a basic necessity, like

food. And on that score, if we look at hawker food fare prices, we can

see&nbsp;how they have changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, $2 for a packet of chicken

rice in any <i>kopitiam</i> in a heartland stall.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, it is

$2.50&nbsp;or 25% more. Such can be attributed to competition among

hawkers.&nbsp; Yes, we do give out some handouts, but I do not think it will be

able to cover the higher fares a poorer household has to bear on an annualised

basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have always opined

that our public transport industry has little competition&nbsp;- a good duopoly

with minimal overlapping of routes and modes of transportation.&nbsp; If we

truly believe that we should leave it to the market forces, then we should do

it, but if we now believe our market is too small for competition, then perhaps

we should be prepared to make it into a single operator situation like what has

happened in the media industry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p align=left>Column: 288</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The

announcement that the Government is engaging an external consultant to review

the transportation system is most welcome and timely.&nbsp; Whilst we generally

have a good transportation network infrastructure, we must continue to find

ways to help the lower income families who are spending a larger proportion of

their income on transport-related needs. We also need to help drivers

especially those who have to use the CTE.&nbsp; The pinch from regular ERP

hikes is painful and&nbsp;what is worse, the pocket hurts&nbsp;and the

congestions are still there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I would like

to address the quality of transport, one variable of which must be&nbsp;the

total time taken by commuters to reach from point to point.&nbsp; Many feel

that with the removal of various feeder routes, they now have to take a longer

time to commute from home to office and back.&nbsp; This is especially so where

they have to walk from their homes to the nearest MRT station or bus

interchange.&nbsp; Are such measurements taken into account by the Ministry of

Transport (MOT) and Public Transport Council&nbsp;(PTC)?&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To get an idea

of this, I asked my residents to help me in an informal survey. Of the about

100 residents who gave their responses, two-thirds of them took public

transport to work.&nbsp; And of the&nbsp;three modes&nbsp;- bus, MRT, or both -

the longest time taken (no prizes for getting it right) were those who had to

travel by both bus and MRT, with an average time of close to 60 minutes

and&nbsp;the longest time of about 90 minutes.&nbsp; So, on a daily basis, my

residents are spending about&nbsp;two hours and, in some cases,&nbsp;three

hours getting to and from work.&nbsp; This constitutes a significant part of

their total workday.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can this be

improved? We need to make travel seamless and fast. We need to improve

integration and rationalisation of the various transport modes. We need <p align=left>Column: 289</p>to cut

waiting time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I think this squares quite closely with the

results of the recent survey that was carried out by the PTC and which was just

released last week.&nbsp; But end of the day, notwithstanding all the surveys

that we do, the real test of the pudding is in the eating.&nbsp; And as

ridership figures show, it is not all that rosy.&nbsp; Our benchmark should be,

and we will know that we have arrived, when people who&nbsp;have cars start to

take buses and trains on a regular basis.&nbsp; Only then, will our dream of

having a world class urban transport system be

realised.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, all these

add up to one large problem that will prove to be intractable in the short

run.&nbsp; We need to address the lower income needs&nbsp;immediately. For

these vulnerable families, I support the call from my GPC Chairman for an

immediate solution that can be easily implemented - a common day pass for all

trains and buses. We can then use these passes to give direct and meaningful

subsidies to the needy families.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me

now cover some issues on family matters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From my

perspective, family needs to be the number one&nbsp;priority on everyone's

agenda. The formation of the National Family Council is a step forward - one

that offers hope for a much needed holistic approach towards strengthening of

marriages and families.&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have

always maintained that the family is the first line of defence in any situation,

whether it is caring for the disabled, the elderly, or the poor. A lot depends

on having strong families, but the structure of families is coming under more

stress than ever before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the quickest,&nbsp;and to my mind, the

easiest&nbsp;ways to relieve this&nbsp;stress is <p align=left>Column: 290</p>to review the role played by

leadership in the public, private and people sectors. Leaders must walk the

talk if we are to achieve significant improvements. &nbsp;Leadership must now

be called to action more urgently than ever, to create a better environment for

our families to blossom and for all members to enjoy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the

ground level, the problems are very real and urgent.&nbsp; Many of us know of

many people who are experiencing the enormous strain on marriages and families

of our generation.&nbsp; Divorce rates are at an all time high (6,909 in

2005)&nbsp;with some predicting&nbsp;that it&nbsp; may not&nbsp; be long before

one in every two marriages here end in divorce, a statistic which is already

true in America.&nbsp; I am thus heartened to hear the Minister for Community

Development, Youth and Sports at the East Asia Ministerial Forum on Families

held here just this Monday,&nbsp;highlighting the issue of rising divorce rates

here as being one of his Ministry’s top concerns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, I have

observed that even where marriages or families stay together, something is

usually lacking, eg, parental time and involvement with children, a fulfilling

marriage bond, or the desire to have children.&nbsp; Each of these leads on to

social and economic repercussions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a personal

level, there is a lack of awareness of how vulnerable our marriages and

families are in an increasingly competitive global era.&nbsp; It is so easy to

become caught up in the never-ending strive for career advancement and to

forget that our marriages and families need nurturing too.&nbsp; Those who are

aware of this perhaps have their hands tied by the need for survival and

unenlightened bosses.&nbsp;What can we do?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a corporate

level, we need to make family a priority, even for bosses. While there has been&nbsp;much

talk about flexible work arrangements, in reality, so many working

professionals we know who have <p align=left>Column: 291</p>young children still find it difficult, if not

impossible, to have&nbsp;part-time work arrangement.&nbsp; I am sure we all

have friends&nbsp;who made an effort not to work long hours but inevitably felt

very conscious and vulnerable when leaving the office on time, almost having to

&quot;sneak&quot; off hoping that nobody has noticed.&nbsp; Certainly, the

mindset change in Singapore has not occurred in a sufficiently critical proportion

of the population.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working mothers can

only find it feasible to work part time if this is common and not viewed as an

exception.&nbsp; The part-time scheme for teachers that MOE is enhancing to

include both male and female teachers is great, and perhaps what we need is

more steps in this direction for other professions as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, on a broader

level, we are aware that to help our families, an effort from all segments of

society is required, that those who are convinced of the need to stand up and

fight for our families have to make an effort to do so.&nbsp; There is, in the

end, no economic or corporate justification which is greater than a very

personal motivation for doing the right thing.&nbsp; As the Minister himself

has said, &quot;You should not be afraid to say that you have to attend to

family issues.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me now put on my hat

as a board member of Centre for Fathering.&nbsp; Many men do not realise or

have forgotten how important a role fathers play in the healthy growth and

development of their children.&nbsp; Sadly, somewhere along the line,

&quot;father&quot; has somehow come to be equated with &quot;breadwinner&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, recently

there were some tragic deaths involving some men.&nbsp; One of them was a

father in his 40s, like I am. Mr Tan Jee Suan was 46, married with&nbsp;two

teenage sons. They live in a three-room <p align=left>Column: 292</p>flat in Boon Lay.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only

guess at Mr Tan's thoughts, as a fellow father, and a husband who tried his

best to&nbsp; provide for his family. He has only primary school

education.&nbsp; His children do not get many toys and books. Their occasional

treat is a meal at a fast food centre.&nbsp;When he got $2,000 from the

Progress Package, he used $800 of it to buy a bed for his wife,&nbsp;their

first bed in all the time they have been married; she being&nbsp;a polio

victim, he bought the bed so that she does not have to crawl off their mattress

each time she wakes up.&nbsp;And at night, he would sit down with his boys,

watch them do their homework, and talk to them.&nbsp; His last gift to them was

$16 in his wallet, and a few words of advice to take care of their mother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we need to help fathers like the late Mr Tan.

Sir, this is a man who loved his wife, and a father who loved his sons. He

tried to be as good a provider as he knew how.&nbsp; But the problem was - he

did&nbsp;not know how. He did not know how to handle the stress of being out of

work.&nbsp; He did not know that, despite not bringing home a pay cheque, he

was a good man, and a good father.&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not know that, in

Singapore, which is a land of opportunity, a strong back and a good heart could

get his family money, food and education. Indeed, in Singapore, our Government

has in place several social assistance schemes to help needy Singaporeans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, for

out-of-work fathers, we need first to assure them that their roles as fathers

and husbands are not diminished or devalued the moment they stop bringing home

a pay cheque. That is a battle in the mind,<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><!-- Begin CDATA tag --><!-- End CDATA tag --><!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag --><!--MP_NAME:--><!-- &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p> -->



<!-- <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none'> --><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>and

when we first win that battle, we can make a start in winning the rest. No

doubt, there are many other avenues for help for the whole family - workfare,

job matching, education bursaries and so forth. But truth be told, the welfare

for the whole family <p align=left>Column: 293</p>often turns on the father, and we need to help fathers, as

fathers, as well as helping them find work.</p>



<!--<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none'>&nbsp;</p>



<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none'> --> <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Certainly, our world does not end when our work contract does, and our

self-worth should not be tied up completely with our work. I urge the

many-helping-hands to remember to pass on this message, along with practical

help such as job matching.</p>



<!-- <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none'>&nbsp;</p>



<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none'> --><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Now, speaking of society at large, what can we do to enhance and highlight the

important roles fathers play?&nbsp; I have the following suggestions:</p>



<!-- <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none'>&nbsp;</p>



<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none'> --><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

First, we cannot assume that men naturally become fathers. We need to help

equip men for the transition. So, I suggest we give subsidies for both parents

attending ante-natal and parenting programmes.</p>



<!-- <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none'>&nbsp;</p>



<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none'> --><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Second, we need to build more father-friendly workplaces. This means working on

the HR software - perhaps increasing paternity leave to one week, and giving

fathers child sick leave.</p>



<!-- <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none'>&nbsp;</p>



<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none'> --><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Third, we need to encourage fathers to be more involved in their children's

education. For example, there are&nbsp;parents who often take leave during the

children's examination.&nbsp; But why is it almost always the women who do

this? If, for example, we men feel that this is not&nbsp;our forte, perhaps we

can do other things, such as bring our&nbsp;children to school on the first day

of the new term and on as many days as possible, attend children's

parent-teacher meetings, and our children's school sports

days.&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools can &quot;force&quot; fathers to be involved too by

getting both parents' signatures on the report book.<br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Centre for Fathering is already planning a major

event as we usher in the <p align=left>Column: 294</p>New Year. It is called &quot;Back to School with Dad

2007". We are working directly with schools to encourage fathers to accompany

their school-going children to and&nbsp;from school during the first week of

school next year.&nbsp; Better still both father and mother should do it.</p>



<!-- <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none'>&nbsp;</p>



<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none'> --><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This event is a meaningful way for Singapore to start the New Year.&nbsp; MOE

and MCYS have been informed and are supportive.&nbsp; I am very much for this

project.&nbsp; For several years now, I have enjoyed driving my son and

daughter to school.&nbsp; The time that one spends with them can only help to

bond us closer to each other.&nbsp;</p>



<!-- <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none'>&nbsp;</p>



<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none'> --><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sir, we need strong resilient families in Singapore.&nbsp; Different kinds of

families need different things from the Government. &nbsp;Many think that, with

the PAP Government's aversion to welfarism, lobbying for money is the hardest

part. &nbsp;But it is actually the easiest.&nbsp; It is easy and quick to throw

money at a problem and wish it away.</p>



<!-- <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none'>&nbsp;</p>



<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none'> --><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

But as we have seen with the HOPE scheme, getting the budget to help 6,000

families in need does not fully accomplish what we had in mind. Many families

may not be receiving the help. Families who need the help more than others are

not even eligible for it. Getting the money is the easier part - spending it

wisely is far harder.</p>



<!-- <p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none'>&nbsp;</p>



<p class=MsoNormal style='mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none'> --><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sir, we need to create HOPE for all families, especially the vulnerable ones.

We need to remember, in the middle of our busy work day, full of meetings with

important people, to put our families first. Only then can we have a strong,

close and inclusive community, and for all citizens, a strong nation we are all

proud to call home.</p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his address to

outline of the challenges faced by Singapore today.&nbsp; He has set forth in

broad terms the Government's plan to tackle issues of globalisation, our ageing

population and the generational changes faced by the post-independence

generation, including a new social and political compact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am part of

that post-independence generation, what has come to be known in these times as

the P65 generation.&nbsp; These are my views on two of the challenges faced by

the P65 generation today.&nbsp; They are pre-school education and engaging our

youth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his Address to

this House, the President pointed out that one way in which the Government

would facilitate growth and prosperity would be to invest in the future of

Singapore.&nbsp; In our minds, there is no doubt that the future of Singapore

lies in our children&nbsp; -&nbsp; those that are growing up today and those

that we are encouraging couples to have to reverse the trend of our ageing

population.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the best ways

to invest in our children is to continually improve and transform our education

system.&nbsp; After all, the strength of this country is not in its money or

its weapons, but in the sum total of the education and the character of its

people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Government has

been continually upgrading our education system at the primary, secondary and

tertiary levels.&nbsp; I applaud the changes that the Ministry has made in our

education system over the years.&nbsp; The most recent ones are very

exciting.&nbsp; The focus has shifted to quality <p align=left>Column: 296</p>and diversity, with the goal

being to develop the potential of every child to the maximum, such that we

attain many peaks of excellence.&nbsp; More choices are being introduced for

students so that they can develop their strengths and interests in sports, the

arts and intellectual endeavours.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I believe

that education does not and should not begin at primary one.&nbsp; Experts in

child development believe that the most crucial period for development in

learning is the first six years of a child's life.&nbsp; Neurologists tell us

that the network of neurons or brain cells that make up the human brain

develops and grows at a staggering rate during this early period of a child's

life.&nbsp; The more stimulation and quality input a young child receives, the

more complex and dense this network of brain cells becomes.&nbsp; When you

think about how this network forms the hardware of human intelligence, it would

make sense for us to focus much more attention on building up the capacity of

each child's CPU at a time when such input has most impact.&nbsp; Some experts

say that the bulk of this growth is substantially complete by the time a child

is six years old.&nbsp; So, it is during this zero-to-six-year period that

children develop most of their neuro pathways.&nbsp; It is during this period

that the child is most eager to learn and the most open to stimulation.&nbsp;

It is during this period that children develop the ability to take part in

their own learning.&nbsp; If a child receives good quality education in

pre-school and is given the correct environment to develop, his or her path in

primary, secondary and tertiary education could be so much more fruitful and

enriching.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Research on brain

development has shown that a child's environment and experiences in the

earliest years of life are crucial for cognitive, physical, social and

emotional development.&nbsp; It has also shown that children who attend quality

pre-school programmes have more advanced <p align=left>Column: 297</p>cognitive skills, are more eager to

learn and try new things, get along better with their classmates and are better

at paying attention.&nbsp; Their ability to stay focused and follow directions

emerges in the early years, and a programme of structured learning in the early

years fosters these abilities.&nbsp; They also have more advanced development

in language, literacy, creativity, music, movement, initiative and social

skills.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The greatest

short-term and long-term gains which are a direct result of quality pre-school

education can be seen in children who are from less advantaged

backgrounds.&nbsp; Various studies that have been conducted in the United States

have shown that high-quality programmes have produced short-term gains in

cognitive functioning and long-term gains in school achievement and social

adjustment.&nbsp; Recent reviews conclude that early intervention, especially

with children from less advantaged backgrounds, have produced a variety of

positive results. Those results include higher school achievement, lower

incidence of having to repeat a grade, a reduced need for special education at

a later stage and less involvement in crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the profound

impact that a child's pre-school education can have on the growth and

development of that child, I ask whether it is not incumbent on us to ensure

that the pre-school education that we provide to our children should be as good

as, if not better, than the primary, secondary and tertiary education that we

offer our children today.&nbsp; If we are to maximise and harness the potential

of every single child, why not seize the opportunity to nurture them during the

most crucial years of development?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime in 2000,

the Ministry of Education issued a document entitled &quot;Nurturing Early

Learners&quot;, a framework <p align=left>Column: 298</p>for a kindergarten curriculum in Singapore.&nbsp;

That document sets out fairly comprehensive construct in respect of the

direction in which the Ministry felt that the kindergarten curriculum ought to

be heading in Singapore.&nbsp; But that document is merely prescriptive.&nbsp;

It is a guide.&nbsp; Kindergartens and childcare centres that have kindergarten

programmes are free to adopt as little or as much as they choose of

it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many questions remain unanswered.&nbsp; What has been done to

update that document over the last six years?&nbsp; If it has not been updated,

why not?&nbsp; Why should the Ministry not require pre-schools to achieve a

minimum standard in educating our children, the way it does the upper levels of

education?&nbsp; Why is it that only kindergartens are required to register

with the Ministry of Education, whereas childcare centres that also run

kindergarten programmes are not?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the children

who live in our HDB estates attend PCF kindergartens, and therefore PCF

kindergartens have become the largest provider of kindergarten education in

Singapore.&nbsp; When the Ministry issued its framework for a kindergarten

curriculum in 2000, most of the PCF kindergartens adopted the framework in

whole or in part.&nbsp; However, six years on, some PCF kindergartens have

found that the framework is slowly becoming outdated, and many have developed

their own curricula outside the construct recommended by the Ministry.&nbsp;

So, kindergartens are left to update and treat their programmes at their own

initiative, with little support from the Ministry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst we may

contend that this provides diversity and a good landscape -&nbsp; and I agree

that there is nothing wrong with diversity and choice&nbsp; -&nbsp; there might

be a significant disparity in the quality of what is taught in the

kindergartens and pre-schools.&nbsp; We do not really know because unlike

primary education, there is little Ministry involvement or oversight.&nbsp;

<p align=left>Column: 299</p>Should the Ministry not ensure that there is a minimum standard of education

that pre-schools and kindergartens adhere to?&nbsp; I believe that we need to

implement a core curriculum and programme of pre-school education of a standard

at least equal to that of our school system.&nbsp; Pre-schools could retain

flexibility and the methodology used in teaching the curriculum and those that

have the resources to do so may go beyond the basic curriculum.&nbsp; Having a

core curriculum would raise the bar so that we can go some way to ensuring that

at the other end of the spectrum, the less advantaged children are not left

behind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the heart of our

efforts, due consideration must be given to the teachers.&nbsp; The Government

must look at ways to improve the motivation and quality of pre-school

teachers.&nbsp; The Ministry needs to ensure that pre-school teachers receive

the right training to give our children the instruction that they require, as

well as the kind of nurturing that they deserve.&nbsp; After all, these

teachers are the people charged with the care and direction of our children at

their most impressionable age.&nbsp; But teaching children of pre-school age

requires more than just knowledge of the subjects being taught.&nbsp;

Pre-school teachers need to connect with the children and capture their attention

and imagination.&nbsp; Pre-school teachers must feel motivated in order to be

able to motivate the children they teach.&nbsp; They&nbsp; must have better

remuneration and career prospects.&nbsp; They must be given fuel to keep their

passion alive.&nbsp; I urge the Ministry to also look into ensuring that

pre-schools have the hardware and facilities to complement the quality

curriculum that we should aim to provide to our children. All of these measures

must work hand in hand towards upgrading our preschool education system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most recently, the

Ministry announced that it would be working with social <p align=left>Column: 300</p>agencies to minimise

non-attendance at pre-school.&nbsp; Mr Masagos Zulkifli mentioned this in his

speech yesterday and, in fact, he heads the committee.&nbsp; I see this as a

clear sign that the Government recognises the importance of pre-school

education.&nbsp; Getting all children in Singapore to attend pre-school is

certainly a goal to strive for.&nbsp; But we also have to ensure that once we

get them there, we use the opportunity to maximum effect by putting in place<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>a first-class curriculum, taught by teachers

who are well trained, motivated and emotionally invested in the task of

nurturing our young minds.&nbsp; I say that we can do more.&nbsp; Compare the

resources we are investing in the hardware and software of our primary,

secondary and tertiary education systems with the investment we are making in

our pre-school education system.&nbsp; We have implemented the GROW programme

for our school teachers.&nbsp; What have we done for our pre-school teachers?&nbsp;

We are building indoor sports halls for all our schools. What are we providing

for our pre-schools?<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I urge this Government not to ignore the short-term

and long-term benefits of quality pre-school education for our children.&nbsp;

The benefits of the right input during these crucial years are not limited to

just academic and intellectual gains.&nbsp; This is also the time when children

can most readily absorb and internalise positive moral values and life lessons

on social awareness, compassion and respect for others.&nbsp; Let us act now to

improve this key element of our education system.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I turn to my second topic – engaging

our youth.&nbsp; One of the challenges that the P65 generation faces is the

deepening of our sense of mission.&nbsp; We must provide and we must learn to

seize more opportunities, to take responsibility for our country and build our

future together.&nbsp; In short, we must learn to take ownership of our country

and our home.&nbsp; And this will be one of the key challenges <p align=left>Column: 301</p>that the P65 MPs

will face in the days to come.&nbsp; How do we inspire and instill that sense

of ownership and passion in our generation and the younger generation?&nbsp;

There is no one answer to this challenge and I do not stand here, Sir, and

claim to know the formula.&nbsp; I did, however, post similar questions on the

P65 blog site that Mr Teo Ser Luck mentioned yesterday.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my posting, I spoke about the passion and energy

that I saw in the youth that attended a pop concert and I asked why more of us

do not have the same passion and enthusiasm when it comes to issues relating to

our country and how it is governed.&nbsp; I found it heartening to read some of

the comments that I received in response to my posting not because they were

necessarily complimentary or expressed what I might have wanted to hear, but

because the contributors care enough to mull over the issue and&nbsp;speak

their minds.&nbsp; If our youth were indeed apathetic about our country, they

would not deem it important to try and engage the MPs in such a manner.&nbsp;

And what are&nbsp;their views?&nbsp;&nbsp;I will let the bloggers do the

talking.&nbsp; These are just two excerpts from the many comments that I have

received.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BL says, and I quote:<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In short, my answer is that in order to cultivate

passion towards issues that concern our country is to give the citizens the

feeling that they are stakeholders to the country. The conditions require the

space and freedom of speech and expression both in the social and political

circles. In any society, we often have people differing from us on certain

issues, but the fact that we are contributing our perspectives from different

sides of the house, indicate that we are passionate in them. These are the

things which money cannot buy and perhaps, it might be the first step to

generate passion in people on the issues of government and country."<br>

&nbsp;<br>

<p align=left>Column: 302</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sherrie says, and I quote:<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I’d say I’m not exactly very passionate about the

government of our country and such because there’s still the underlying feeling

that the Government doesn’t listen to us anyway.&nbsp; Granted, there’s the

Feedback Unit and such but again, one can’t help but feel it’s just a facade

….. it’s just all talk.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why am I so cynical and sceptical?<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just look at the patronising replies which the

government bodies give in <i>Forum</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as long as they continue to feel that they are

high up on a pedestal, the ground will always be detached from the Government,

and thus the government of the country."<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said that I was heartened when I received these comments because

they demonstrate that the people are fired up about what goes on in

Singapore.&nbsp; Singaporeans and the P65 generation want to express their

views and engage us.&nbsp; Sometimes, their comments, and particularly their

criticism, may be hard hitting; sometimes, they may be wrong;&nbsp;sometimes,

they may be right.&nbsp; We may not like all the comments that we get, but that

should not be a reason to avoid them.&nbsp; In this regard, I associate myself

with Mr Baey Yam Keng’s comments on opening up and being more flexible.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is important is to realise that the strength of

their criticism is a demonstration of their sense of passion and sense of

ownership in this country.&nbsp; I believe that we should encourage more of

such participation but, in doing so, I feel that we must change our mindset and

become more flexible in our approach to the views expressed.&nbsp; I am not

advocating that we take a flexible approach to all our rules and

policies.&nbsp; But there are some instances where flexibility can have a

positive result.&nbsp; Let me give you an example.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

<p align=left>Column: 303</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently attended a flagging-off of an international

adventure race.&nbsp; Singapore was but one stop from the circuit of countries

hosting the race.&nbsp; The event was being telecast on cable television in

numerous countries in Asia and the rest of the world.&nbsp; The organiser

approached me just before the start of the race and expressed his

disappointment at not being able to use the national flag to flag off the race

or even display the national flag in the backdrop.&nbsp; Here was a chance for

our little dot to shine in the eyes of the world but we missed that

opportunity.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, rules and policies are obviously important.&nbsp;

However, we must realise two things: first, in the application of some rules

and policies, we should learn to be more nimble and flexible; and secondly, in

some instances we must be alert enough to realise that certain rules and

policies may be outdated and not be afraid to change those rules and policies

swiftly to keep up with the times.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe the younger generation – the P65 generation

– have a sense of mission.&nbsp; They are willing to speak up and be

engaged.&nbsp; The question I leave this House with is this: are we ready to

hear them?<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, on that note, may I end my speech by

reaffirming my support for the motion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Motion of Thanks to the President.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

<i>Globalisation and change</i><br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore has always been and is always going to be at

the crossroads, be it at the crossroads of Asia, changes and evolution, and now

with globalisation. As Singapore is part of a regional and global landscape,

events and developments in the region and in the world will have an impact on

us. The inflow of foreign capi<p align=left>Column: 304</p>tal, technology, foreign talents, music, and

popular culture has all got resonance with globalisation. We have no choice but

to adapt and evolve. It is a volatile world out there. Certainly, every system

must evolve and must stay relevant with the times.&nbsp; Because only in

growth, reform and change, paradoxically, is there security to be found.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our National Day parade slogan this year, &quot;Our

Global city, Our Home&quot;, and the Singapore 2006 theme, "Global City, World

of Opportunities" reflect this broad outlook that we have. In fact, in 1966 our

Minister Mentor had stated: "Societies like ours can have no fat to spare. They

are either lean and healthy or they die."&nbsp; Indeed, he was a visionary,

thinking ahead of his times.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we have many of the universal requirements to

become a global city: the amenities, the human capital, the infrastructure and

network as well as linkages in businesses, human interaction and

communications. Globalisation will bring about changes and greater competition.

We cannot resist these. But we have to also partake in glocalisation, ie, local

responsiveness in a global framework where we incorporate global processes into

our local settings and make global products suited to local needs and taste. As

we globalise, we must strike a balance to preserve our culture, values and also

our tradition.<br>

A global city will be part of and be connected to the larger global community.

This must bring about a sense of shared identity, ownership and stewardship for

the planet. The world is becoming very small and our people will cross borders

as if they are crossing roads of yesteryears.&nbsp; Are we preparing them for

these crossings?<br>

&nbsp;<br>

<i>Education<br>

</i>&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we adapt to the changes, education is the common

denominator in helping society to level up. The education <p align=left>Column: 305</p>system will have to

evolve and adapt to prepare our students to become global citizens. The

Ministry of Education has been doing this gradually through implementation of

policies and also curriculum change. Singapore’s model for success has an impressive

emphasis on education.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any curriculum, there is always the formal, the

informal as well as the hidden curriculum. The formal curriculum is one that is

written and found on paper and is the one which students and teachers rush to

cover before the examinations. The informal curriculum is one where there is

indirect learning. But, importantly, there is the hidden curriculum, which has

proven to be very powerful and&nbsp;represents all the nuances, behaviour and

the non-verbal cues, etc. that are projected from teachers to students, based

on the interpretation and perception of the latter. It is thus very important

to make teachers realise the power they have to change and influence. The

primary school teacher especially is an important and influential&nbsp; adult

to the school-going child. This teacher will make the crucial difference to the

child’s academic, social, emotional and psychological growth and development.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They need to have an understanding of pedagogy, which

is the art and science of learning and teaching. They are the role models on

impressionable youths and their&nbsp; words and action can leave an indelible

impression&nbsp; on these young minds. Teachers are like ‘step-in parents’ for

their contact time with the children at school. Besides transmission of

knowledge, pupils will acquire values of compassion, responsibility, diligence,

love, courtesy and determination.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, I applaud the recent move by the Ministry of Education

to have more dedicated time and funding for teachers in terms of training,

education and upgrade <p align=left>Column: 306</p>in line with the GROW programme. For some, the suggested

sabbatical sessions which they will have, it is also going to serve as a period

of reflection on their teaching. Programmes such as the leaders in educational

programme (LEP) and Leader for Leaders’ programme (LLP) will certainly have a

significant bearing on teachers' learning, self reflection, innovation and

sharing. Therefore, I would like to urge the Ministry of Education to support

as many teachers as possible who qualify to be enrolled in these programmes for

self enhancement and development.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ability and value based education can help to bring

about students who are not only academically inclined, but also innovative,

creative and worldly in their outlook and mindset. This is in line with our

Prime Minister's call to build talent which is like a whole range of mountains

and not just single peaks.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that note, I would also like to strongly suggest

the introduction of a series of non-examinable subjects which could include

simple economics, Singapore politics, history, logic, ethics, and maybe simple

financial management for students.&nbsp; This must be done hand in hand with a

review and reduction of some of the hard-core curriculum that we have in schools.

Since these are non-examinable subjects, the students would have no stress of

studying them to pass examinations and they can enjoy these subjects better and

certainly will contribute towards their adulthood as well.&nbsp; The topics

covered will have to be practical, interesting and engaging; building and

inculcating nationalistic spirit and altruism, conducted in a participatory and

interactive fashion. Exposure at this tender age will help create understanding

and strengthen the sense of identity and belonging to Singapore.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This can also be a step in the direction towards

making our students socially, economically and politically more aware <p align=left>Column: 307</p>and

conscious, countering the many claims made recently that our youth and young

people have no interest and are very low in their awareness of issues like

these. Only when one takes ownership and pride in one’s community and country

will one strive to make it better.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

<i>Volunteerism: The young, the elderly and the community support</i><br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What better way to inculcate this than through

volunteerism and community involvement. The only way to understand the

contribution of time, effort and energy of volunteers, is by immersing oneself

in these very similar activities. The involvement can help evolve youths as

well as young adults to have a wider perspective, a more global view. It can

help shape personalities and character as well as make them more tolerant. As

it is, the post-65 generation has always been blamed for not understanding our

roots and the hardships faced by our parents and grandparents.&nbsp; Through

volunteerism, we can feel poverty, sadness, misery, desperation, fear and

hunger.&nbsp; I can personally vouch for this for having done volunteer work

and community service for over 20 years, including humanitarian activities

overseas in countries such as&nbsp; Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan,

Cambodia, China, Indonesia, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to learn how

to empathise. We have to learn that helping others is a blessing. And we learn

to also take nothing for granted, including our livelihood and security as

well.&nbsp; We can build up our ‘heartware".&nbsp; As we serve, it will help

trigger emotions on seeing, learning and feeling the unspoken hopes of many who

are disabled, disadvantaged and in need.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can volunteerism benefit Singapore?<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Volunteers are usually active citizens who have a role

in Singapore’s future. They want to be kept informed of all developments.&nbsp;

They will offer ideas which <p align=left>Column: 308</p>are productive, and their experiences and

thoughtful consideration have gone into these. Volunteers will help implement

what they envision and make that positive impact on society. They will

contribute towards the task of nation building.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, for serving humanity is indeed the

best work of life and it dishes out the best lessons for man.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Volunteerism will galvanise our multiracial

community bonding. Through expanded CIP and youth expedition programme (YEP),

our youth will get to see the real world, the&nbsp;global village, will learn

and mature. Our over 65 years population is going to increase at an alarming

rate.&nbsp; This rate is going to be at 372% from the year 2000 to 2030. This

is going to be the fastest recorded rate of elderly growth compared to Japan

(54%), Germany (63%) and&nbsp;China (170%). There must be more ways for youth

to engage and participate in our elderly community management and care. Youth

must connect and assist the elderly in society. Children must look after their

parents. But that is not volunteerism.&nbsp; That is duty.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have the potential to become the volunteer hub in

Asia.&nbsp; This could be another branding for us as well.&nbsp; It

is&nbsp;very often at Ground Zero, the&nbsp; Singapore team gets asked to

oversee and organise operations, set up hospital, etc. We carry the Singapore

flag on our vest. We&nbsp; have a reputation for being effective, organised and

certainly well structured. We get things done. We mean action&nbsp;and

certainly never underestimate the power of being small. That red shining dot

again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corporate

volunteerism as well must be encouraged and certainly formalised. Why should we

do this? Corporations operate in communities and not in a vacuum. Corporations

reflect the community in which they operate.&nbsp;Corporate performance is also

today very much tied through a triple bottom line, which is their economic,

environmental as well as&nbsp;social <p align=left>Column: 309</p>contributions.&nbsp;Corporations have

resources to share with volunteer hosting organisations to help communities.

Together they can help to meet certain objectives for the community&nbsp;which

include&nbsp;reduction of poverty, helping the low income, enhancing education,

creation of health awareness, and so on.&nbsp;Participating in volunteer and

community activities will improve the corporate image, generate goodwill and

also build teamwork.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to create awareness of volunteerism and

activities and also&nbsp;make it easier for individuals, schools, families

and&nbsp;organisations&nbsp;to adopt programmes which will enhance their

character. Issues such as volunteer leave and corporate and national

recognition as well as not losing one's seniority when one volunteers for an

overseas mission should be implemented and enhanced.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not

enough to have a handful of heroes. But what we want&nbsp;is to build&nbsp;a

community and generations of people who are responsible and caring people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With volunteerism,

awareness is created, empathy is inculcated and expectations can be better

managed. And certainly with all the social safety nets and 36 self-help schemes

that we have, I would still like to call for greater amount of integration,

coordination, speed&nbsp;and also flexibility in their execution. This is in

line with the call by Mr Seah Kian Peng and Ms Ellen Lee to help the

underprivileged.&nbsp;&nbsp;We, as a society, must learn to exude values of

graciousness from within. We can globalise as a nation and celebrate, but it

would be so much sweeter if we can put smiles on the faces of the elderly, the

destitute, the low income and also the disabled. Perhaps then, even our

happiness index as a society can&nbsp;improve because Happiness&nbsp; =

(Reality – Expectations) / Perception.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p align=left>Column: 310</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In one of my

house-to-house visits, Mr Speaker, a single lady in her 50s came up to me and

said, &quot;Can you please&nbsp;come into my house to check why there&nbsp;is

smoke and&nbsp;steam coming out of all my piping in the kitchen and

bathroom?&quot; It was a strange request. So I went in to check and of course

could not find anything wrong. I spoke to the Town Council guy and he said that

that lady had been calling&nbsp;them every single day to complain of the same

issue.&nbsp; Certainly, they, who were the experts, could not find the root

cause.&nbsp; I did not take very long to realise that she actually was

depressed&nbsp;and was hallucinating. This was the incident that spurred me

to&nbsp;actually set up and launch a POP Group!&nbsp;-&nbsp;a Psychological

Outreach Programme Group - at Geylang Serai&nbsp;where we have&nbsp;a

group&nbsp;of nurses, volunteers from IMH and also grassroots and activists

working together on house-to-house visits which are targeted, as we go

out&nbsp;and source issues related to psychological health and mental illnesses

in the community and the response had been&nbsp;overwhelming indeed. This is an

initiative by the community, for the community and certainly a perfect example

in promotion of the spirit of volunteerism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a

growing demand for more comprehensive psychological health services. In his

Addendum to the Presidential Address, our Health Minister has

already&nbsp;mentioned about upgrading the mental health programme "to make

Singapore an emotionally resilient society". Certainly, this is in line

with&nbsp;the Ministry of Health's&nbsp;eight health priorities for the future,

namely, (1)&nbsp;to build a healthy population; and (2)&nbsp;to manage diseases

holistically and not episodically.&nbsp; Let me put some perspective on this. From

the IMH and the Health Promotion Board's&nbsp;survey of 2004, the prevalence of

depression&nbsp;and anxiety related disorders was 16% in our community, and the

number is increasing everyday. However,&nbsp;only 48% of these people have

sought treatment.&nbsp;The World <p align=left>Column: 311</p>Health Organisation has estimated that 15% of

all premature deaths in Singapore as well as disability is related to

psychological illnesses. This is an alarming number because these are people

who are dying well before their time.&nbsp;Another Ministry of Health's survey

showed that the number of children less than 18 years visiting psychiatrist at

Government run outpatient clinics was 1,120 in 1990, and it had gone up to

2,499 in the year 2000, and 50% of them are of primary school age, an alarming

number indeed. Certainly, we need to do something about this because if we do

not, the numbers will be increasing.&nbsp;And will the pressure make them prone

to depression as adults?&nbsp; The long-term consequences will depend on their

psychological resilience as well as the community support.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psychological

illnesses have been stereotyped and stigmatised. The theory that the patients

are ‘dangerously mad’ must be debunked. Our mental health understanding and

also mental literacy has to be increased. That is why I am very heartened that

the Institute of Mental Health has increased its research funding from $700,000

to $1.4 million this year, and this will certainly contribute

towards&nbsp;studies and trials to help many of our patients with psychological

illnesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>In Malay</i>):&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>For

vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a

href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2006/20061109/20061109VS_150911.pdf">Appendix A</a>*.</i>]

Mr Speaker, Sir, please give me the opportunity to speak in Malay on issues

faced by the Malay-Muslim community. The Malay-Muslim community has come a long

way as compared to&nbsp;10 years ago. Many improvements have taken place. Our

leaders, institutions, organisations and mosques have been very proactive and

have shown an open mindset which is progressive and constructive, whereas in

yesteryears, the community may highlight their unhappiness with the Mandarin

requirement with certain companies. But now with the change in mindset, I am

seeing at dialogues, Malay parents <p align=left>Column: 312</p>standing up to ask for compulsory

conversational Mandarin classes in schools for their children so they will not

be left out. Well done to these parents for having that mindset. However, just

as we have been the hardest hit by the economic crisis, the Malay-Muslim

community will also face great changes with globalisation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The workforce will

be more competitive especially for the lower income and older workers. My

advice to them would be to strengthen their spirit and take up courses to

upgrade their skills and capabilities so that they will not be left behind. The

Government and grassroot organisations will help them as much as they possibly

could in providing them with the opportunities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the fast disappearing borders in the face of

globalisation and the digital age, our youths will require support and attention

to bring them away from the unhealthy impact of this influence. Within the

Malay-Muslim community, we are still seeing significant problems such as

pre-marital sex, single mothers who have many children, teenage abortions,

divorces and drug addiction. Traditional and moral values are beginning to be

eroded by globalisation.&nbsp; Our usage of Malay Language is also getting

lesser.&nbsp; There is a Malay saying which says that tradition is so important

that they would sacrifice their child as long as the tradition is protected.

This shows that tradition is very important for the Malay-Muslim community in

Singapore. Therefore, every member of the community must uphold these good and

progressive values.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Muslim community has progressed towards

excellence. The document "Building an excellent Muslim community in Singapore"

which was issued by MUIS this year is a good effort and should be a source of

reference for all of us.&nbsp; It explains Islam as a religion that promotes

education, peace and also progress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p align=left>Column: 313</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madrasahs have carried out many changes. At a recent

graduation ceremony of Muhammadiyah Kindergarten, a small boy told me that he

wanted to teach at the madrasah when he grew up.&nbsp; There was another one

child who told me that he wanted to be a Formula One car driver when he grew

up.&nbsp; Our Malay-Muslim children really have very wide-ranging career

choices. Madrasahs are in the process of making changes and refinements to

their curriculum so that by 2008, their primary schools would be ready for PSLE

to be integrated into their CE programme. This will enable the madrasah

students to be well versed and competent in Mathematics, Science and English

Language.&nbsp; Madrasah Al Maarif, for example,&nbsp; is planning on starting

a full day school and will have new value-added subjects. These are the changes

which will be taking place within the Malay-Muslim community and we await these

changes and improvements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>In English</i>):&nbsp;

Mr Speaker, in conclusion, let me quote from Professor Laurence Summers who is

from the Harvard University.&nbsp; He&nbsp;stated&nbsp;that good governments

have&nbsp;the ability to maintain order in the country and&nbsp;leaders who

have attained power do not abuse it and&nbsp;have the competence to do the job.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, in my view, our Government has all of

these and beyond. What I call for is for a more gracious society: more caring

and&nbsp;sharing, more concern for neighbours and others, more accepting as a

people, more humanitarian and volunteerism activities, less stereotyping and a

greater understanding and commitment from all levels of society. I call for a

society that does not just celebrate the festivals which we do now, but a

society that recognises in a big way the&nbsp;International Volunteers Day,

World Peace Day, Alzheimer's Day, Mental Health Wellness Day,&nbsp;World

<p align=left>Column: 314</p>Disaster Reduction Day, World Disability Day, and so on -&nbsp;a society that

balances competition and compassion as we together globalise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, just as everyone has a pair of hands,

the Government can hold but only one of your hands, the other is yours to use,

to control, to guide, to build and strengthen the muscles and, of course, to

help point you in the right direction as you go forward into the future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Singaporeans

apprehensions about the challenges ahead.&nbsp; I would like to share some of

them through my own list of &quot;Three Fears&quot; which I hope will not

happen to our future Singapore.&nbsp; I am highlighting theses

&quot;fears&quot; not because I am negative about the future, but merely

another perspective to voice our vision for Singapore’s future and throw up

questions for Singaporeans to think about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p align=left>Column: 315</p><p><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Fear 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></i><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>&quot;<i>Pai Tang Jia</i>&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first &quot;fear&quot;

touches on the employability of middle-aged Singaporeans in a fast-changing and

globalised world.&nbsp; As mentioned in the President’s Address, the

competitive landscape compels us to continually respond to structural and trend

changes to stay ahead of the curve.&nbsp; It has become a fact of life.&nbsp;

The implication is that whatever skill sets we acquire may now have a certain

shelf life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Going forward, could

our re-employment opportunities become even more limited due to accelerated

obsolescence in our acquired skills?&nbsp; One of my residents said to me in <i>Hokkien:&nbsp;</i>&quot;Nowadays,

it is '<i>Pai Tang Jia</i>'&quot;, ie,&nbsp;hard to earn a living.&nbsp; This

is my concern.&nbsp; It has already happened to many developed countries.&nbsp;

For example, I read that in US, an average American from college can expect to

change their skills base at least three times in their working life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue of

employability for our middle-aged Singaporeans warrants our deeper

attention.&nbsp; They are the &quot;sandwich generation&quot; who need to

support school-going children and take care of elderly parents.&nbsp; The

social cost will be higher for Singapore if they become victims of economic

restructuring.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The approach taken

by the Government has been two-fold.&nbsp; On the one hand, we endeavour to

create as many job opportunities as possible by revving up growth in the

economy.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Government provides the best possible

education and skills development to equip Singaporeans with the life skills to

be employable in the marketplace.&nbsp; Lifelong learning is supposed to be

part and parcel of our life, but we expect lesser spontaneity in those who are

less educated.&nbsp; The Government established the Workforce Development

Agency (WDA) in 2003 to champion re-training, <p align=left>Column: 316</p>re-skilling and job re-creation.

The Singapore Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) Framework is also a

well-structured system. &nbsp;But I hope Singaporeans are aware of and

understand the schemes well enough to take advantage of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the

comprehensive programmes offered by WDA as well as NTUC, we need to tackle the

challenge of employability in a more holistic way.&nbsp; Here are a few more

areas we could look at.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, personal

counselling and coaching sessions will be beneficial to Singaporeans who are at

risk. Often, individuals, particularly the less educated, may not be in tune

with the structural changes to the marketplace and the options available.&nbsp;

They need advice and guidance on how to re-position themselves in the

workforce. &nbsp;They also need help to develop self-confidence, the motivation

and communication techniques to market themselves.&nbsp; I suggest that the WDA

and CDCs consider establishing well-staffed regional employment centres that

not only help in the job search but also provide personal counselling sessions

on employability, skill training and employment options.&nbsp; Following WDA's

announcement earlier this week to give workers more ownership and control over

training, such services are even more necessary to guide the workers.&nbsp;

More qualified job and training counsellors are needed.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we need to

nurture the culture and mindset of lifelong learning, whether in

schools,&nbsp;the community or through public education campaigns.&nbsp; We may

not see immediate results, but we should work for progressive changes in our

attitudes, particularly, targeting at the less educated workforce. &nbsp;I

always find Jack Neo’s movie very persuasive.&nbsp; Perhaps, he or MediaCorp

can also make a comical movie to inspire Singaporeans to make learning a way of

life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p align=left>Column: 317</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On average, each

Singaporean spends about 10 to 15 of their early years to acquire formal

education and then seeks to be employed for the rest of his working life, which

lasts about 40 years, until the retirement age of 62. &nbsp;With the pace of

change these days, we need to challenge this basic premise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Singaporeans should be encouraged to

re-educate themselves with courses at our learning institutions, besides the

skills-based training offered by WDA and NTUC.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all agree that

lifelong learning is fast becoming a necessity.&nbsp; Hence, my third point is

that the Government could consider allowing middle-aged Singaporeans to use a

small part of their CPF savings to pay for courses or training that would

improve their employability.&nbsp; They will be in a better position to save

for a more secure retirement if their employability is enhanced.&nbsp; This is

not against the objective of CPF.&nbsp; For example, one of my grassroots

leaders in the logistics business said that they are always short of Class 4

and prime-mover drivers and have had to turn to Malaysians for such

drivers.&nbsp; He suggested that more Singaporeans would come forward to

upgrade their skills if they can use their CPF to pay for part of the cost.

&nbsp;In the case of a Class 4 licence, it can amount to about a S1,000.&nbsp; To

quite a number of lower-income Singaporeans, CPF is probably their only source

of savings and probably the only means they can&nbsp;pay for such skills

upgrading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we could be a

learning workforce, agile and responsive to global trends, if our workers take

ownership of their own employability.&nbsp; Once we achieve that state of mind,

I think it will not be a case of &quot;<i>Pai Tang Jia</i>&quot; but rather

&quot;<i>Hoe Tang Jia</i> &quot;, ie,&nbsp;good to earn a living. &nbsp;That

should be our desired outcome.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p align=left>Column: 318</p><p><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Fear 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></i><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>&quot;<i>Branch Office</i>&quot; <i>economy</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second fear is of

Singapore becoming a &quot;Branch Office&quot; economy,&nbsp;a term I picked up

from reading a New Zealand article discussing hollowing out in the economy

there.&nbsp; What do I mean by&nbsp;a &quot;Branch Office&quot; economy?&nbsp;

Companies and their operations are the bedrock of our productive capacity.

Their work enables our citizens to be gainfully employed.&nbsp; Our economy

would be in trouble if a large number of major corporations decide to pull out

within a short period of time, relocating to other more attractive locations,&nbsp;leaving

behind only a branch office to take care of local sales.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have talked a lot

about the importance of having Singaporeans to be more rooted here.&nbsp; But

to be an enduring nation, we need more than just that.&nbsp; We also need our

companies to be rooted here, particularly our home-bred companies.&nbsp;

Singapore continues to be an attractive location for HQs and operations because

of our skilled labour, attractive tax schemes, superior infrastructure,

competitive costs and our pro-business Government.&nbsp; EDB and the other

economic agencies have done a great job attracting investments to

Singapore.&nbsp; In the years ahead, I believe cities in the region and the

Middle-East will compete even more keenly to attract companies and investments

to their shore.&nbsp; The favourable factors we created for ourselves can be

replicated over time, if these countries overcome their political and social

obstacles. Some are already making great progress.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to expect

that profit-making organisations will be constantly reviewing the&nbsp;new

locations.&nbsp; This is particularly critical for a small country like

Singapore where we do not have a large domestic market to anchor companies

here.&nbsp; We also do not have a long history as a nation and the strong cultural

identity to invoke the emotional attachments that we see in <p align=left>Column: 319</p>many

countries.&nbsp; Let me say that I have no doubt our home-bred companies today

are rooted in Singapore and that&nbsp;they will stay in both good&nbsp;and

trying times.&nbsp; However, 10 years from now, business dynamics could be very

different.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we encourage our

local companies to globalise and go international, there is always a risk of

hollowing out.&nbsp; We need to continually create the motivation for them to

remain rooted in Singapore.&nbsp; I envisage that in the next 10-20 years, our

regional competitors will catch up with us or narrow the gap in terms of their

attractiveness.&nbsp; In addition to closely matching what Singapore can offer,

these jurisdictions have their vast hinterlands and big pools of cheaper talents

as compelling draws.&nbsp; What should we do?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, Singapore

needs to remain as the choice location for business.&nbsp; World-class

infrastructure and an effective system of government are givens and

musts.&nbsp; Beyond these, Singapore has to become one of the most livable

cities in the world where business decision-makers and talents would want to

live in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we need to

set aside more resources to help our home-bred companies. &nbsp;EDB has a

focused approach attracting and servicing the MNCs. &nbsp;Perhaps, we could

have a similar one-stop approach for our home-bred companies, large or small,

so that they can feel as at home here in Singapore as the MNCs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, we need to

strengthen the Singapore connection for our companies that are expanding in the

overseas markets.&nbsp; We have a good network of business and trade

organisations in Singapore and many of them started as ground-up efforts to

champion the interests of their various trades and professions. Some of these

organisations also help our companies to go global by way of trade missions and

information sharing.&nbsp; A "by the business community, for the business

community" approach <p align=left>Column: 320</p>augmented with the IE Singapore network would strengthen

this Singapore connection. &nbsp;Among others, the agencies could help our

home-grown companies and these organisations to leverage on our FTAs for more

business opportunities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, as a

country, we need to maintain a high savings rate. &nbsp;Domestic savings are

essential to strengthen Singapore’s capital markets, which could be tapped by

home-grown companies to fund their businesses and investments.&nbsp; This would

lead to more local share ownership in these companies and increase the

likelihood of them remaining rooted in Singapore.&nbsp; One of the reasons

attributed to the hollowing out in the New Zealand economy is its low savings

rate.&nbsp; Domestic capital invested in local companies does play a part to

anchor their headquarters in Singapore even if they go global.&nbsp; We should

encourage more private pension schemes and expand our Supplementary Retirement

Schemes to encourage more domestic savings for retirement.&nbsp; I also urge

the Government to bring back the inculcating of savings as a virtue in our

schools, like what we did three decades ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifthly, I want to

be honest here that I would be very concerned if most of our key local

corporations are foreign-owned or foreign-controlled.&nbsp; I am not against

foreign investments, but I do feel that the local economic stakeholders,

including some form of Government ownership, are needed in our economy and in

our national interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, I read that in the aftermath

of the September 11th terrorist attacks in New York, US investors were the ones

who&nbsp;boosted the US stocks higher due to the so-called &quot;emotional

patriotic response&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my point of

painting this hypothetical scenario is that we need to proactively nurture

corporate citizenry among our home-grown companies, given our

limitations.&nbsp; We are well ahead in this <p align=left>Column: 321</p>game, but we cannot take things

for granted.&nbsp; The stakes are high to be the &quot;Headquarter

economy&quot; of the region.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Fear 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></i><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>&quot;<i>Amazing Race</i>&quot; <i>Singapore</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third fear is

that we would become an &quot;Amazing Race&quot; Singapore.&nbsp; Many of

us&nbsp;have watched the reality TV show &quot;Amazing Race&quot;.&nbsp; It is

a race where couples race from point to point, seeking for clues to reach their

final destination in the shortest possible time.&nbsp; The race is usually set

in very scenic locations in different parts of the world.&nbsp; What amazes me

about the &quot;Amazing Race&quot; is that the participants, in their rush to

get to the next point, never enjoy the breathtaking views of their

surroundings.&nbsp; The paths to the final destinations are also all

pre-determined.&nbsp; And often in the race, we could even see the team members

quarrelling among themselves.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope life as a

Singaporean in our future Singapore will not turn out similarly.&nbsp; Do not

get me wrong.&nbsp; I am not advocating that we slow down too much to enjoy the

view, because in our context, we may end up with no view at all.&nbsp; My point

is that the economic race is a marathon, not like the short sprints and dashes

which we see on TV in the &quot;Amazing Race&quot;. &nbsp;We are in this for

the long haul. &nbsp;And, increasingly, we want to work towards an ideal where

everyone loves his or her work and enjoys what he or she is doing. &nbsp;This

is where Singaporeans can add most value to the economy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We often hear

Singaporeans talking about stress, primarily from work or from our education

system. One of the common reasons for our low birth rate, which I gathered from

young parents who have few kids or no kids, is also stress. &nbsp;An

&quot;Amazing Race&quot; Singapore will only leave us with unhappy citizens and

<p align=left>Column: 322</p>diminish our competitiveness in the long run.&nbsp; We therefore need to pay

attention to work-life balance amidst our economic pursuits.&nbsp; To me, a

more balanced Singaporean is a more rooted Singaporean.&nbsp; It will also

nurture creativity and innovativeness, which are what we need in a developed

economy like ours.&nbsp; In fact, a more balanced work-life environment will

also help to retain talents<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, as has been

mentioned on many occasions, we need to widen the definition of success.&nbsp; This

is as much a social issue as it is a Government issue. Our parents today still

place a lot of emphasis on academic success.&nbsp; I am glad that MOS Lui Tuck

Yew thinks alike.&nbsp; Materialistic success should not be our sole goal in

life either. There should be room for&nbsp;different paths to success, unlike

the pre-determined route as we see in the&nbsp;&quot;Amazing Race&quot;.&nbsp;

A society with a narrow definition will lose its idealism and vitality and I

applaud the recent changes by MOE to reduce emphasis on examinations and to do

away with streaming in primary schools. More can be done in the education

system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we need to

have a culture of well-timed rest and breaks to recharge ourselves, to sharpen

the sword, so to speak. The&nbsp; Government could encourage companies to

introduce sabbatical leave for their employees after a long period of

employment. &nbsp;It is common in countries with highly competitive

economies.&nbsp; It is also consistent with enhancing our long-term

employability and making Singapore a more livable city.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read that the

McDonald's corporation in US allows its eligible employees to take an

eight-week sabbatical for every 10 years of full-time continuous service. You

find similar schemes in Fortune 500 <p align=left>Column: 323</p>companies like Intel and Nike. Employees

can take these as&nbsp;a learning break to re-skill or to re-energise

themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, we also

need to promote more flexible working arrangements in the workplace.&nbsp; MOM

statistics show that this is still not a common practice, with only about 4.1%

of private sector employees on such arrangements in 2004 and mostly coming from

the restaurants’ service staff.&nbsp; We&nbsp;definitely can do better.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sure we do not

want Singapore to become an amazing race where spectators look at us with

amusement and for entertainment.&nbsp; Instead of an &quot;Amazing Race&quot;

Singapore, let us&nbsp;work to become an &quot;Amazingly Graceful

Singapore&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our challenge

today is to transform ourselves from good to great.&nbsp; We still want to win

the marathon but we have to expand our horizon beyond the level of sheer

competition.&nbsp; As the Chinese saying goes, &quot;<i>xi shui chang liu</i>

&quot;, let us strengthen our hearts and lighten our spirits so as to make the

Amazing Race of Nation Building as cherished and lasting as a river stream.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope the

three fears I described will be unfounded.&nbsp; I am confident it will be if

we apply our mind to it. The future is ours to make.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally,

I urge Singaporeans and our parliamentarians here to strive for a Singapore

that is filled with happy Singaporeans!<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I support

the motion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><!--MP_NAME:The Minister of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yi Shyan)-->&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>3.33 pm<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister

of State for Trade and Industry (Mr Lee Yi Shyan):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

consider it a great honour to be able to address this House. Although this is

my first speech in the House, I have already been assured that the proposals

and <p align=left>Column: 324</p>thoughts of this House are closely followed by the media and the members of

the public.&nbsp; In fact, my 10-year-old daughter appealed to my wife last

night, quoting my esteemed colleague, Lui Tuck Yew's speech yesterday, not to

be too obsessed with examination results. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also think

that our young are not apathetic&nbsp;in politics. As the President commented

in his speech, Singapore now stands at another turning point.&nbsp; As we gaze

into the horizon, we see vast opportunities but&nbsp;look out for undercurrents

and perils.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This afternoon, like

others, I would like to discuss two emerging trends that will have profound

implications on Singaporeans.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the trend of

structural unemployment. The September 14th issue of <i>The Economist</i>

reported that&nbsp;&quot;the entry of China, India and the former

Soviet&nbsp;Union into market capitalism has doubled the world's supply of

workers, from 1.5 billion to 3 billion.&quot;&nbsp; The outcome of this

enlarged supply is what we have been seeing:&nbsp;&nbsp;international firms

relocate labour-intensive operations to these low-cost countries, transferring

many blue collar jobs from the developed to the developing countries in the

process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know the

relocation of labour-intensive operations very well because we experienced them

ourselves. For us, it was the timber industry, textile, furniture, consumer

electronics, and so on.&nbsp; The same <i>Economist</i> report also indicated

that &quot;every year, 1.2 million engineers and scientists graduate from

Chinese and Indian universities, as many as in America, the European Union and

Japan combined.&quot; &nbsp;This new supply of scientific talents will tilt the

balance of the technological prowess between the east and the west in the long

term.&nbsp; But in the short term, it has enabled international firms to

outsource and transfer even more <p align=left>Column: 325</p>jobs to these countries.&nbsp; What were once

deemed to be secure and &quot;unmovable&quot; jobs in the developed economies

are now at risk of being relocated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As developing

economies such as China and India improve and debottleneck their education

systems, we have reasons to believe that they will increase even further the

supply of science&nbsp;and technology graduates in the future.&nbsp; Apart from

the new supply of the inexpensive scientific talents from these

countries,&nbsp;technical innovations and information technology have also

permanently changed some industries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The classic case is

India's rapid rise to be a preferred hosting location for business process

outsourcing for many international firms.&nbsp; However, it is not just basic

data processing and call centres that are being outsourced to low-wage

countries, but also software programming, medical diagnostics, engineering

design, law, accounting, finance and business consulting.&nbsp; These can now

be delivered electronically from anywhere in the world, exposing skilled

white-collar workers to greater competition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, what this means

is that globalisation is flattening the world and technology is levelling the

playing field. Blue and white-collar workers are equally at risk with

retrenchment and job elimination.&nbsp; In fact, many jobs are being constantly

redefined. Some jobs, such as shorthand typists, remisiers, stock traders and

librarians are disappearing from the payroll and our vocabulary.&nbsp; New

businesses, such as Dell and eBay thrive&nbsp;on cutting out the middleman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, our workforce must

realise that their jobs will be redefined at some point in time.&nbsp; They

must be prepared and be able to take on other jobs. They can do so provided

they want to and have access to <p align=left>Column: 326</p>retraining.&nbsp; In fact, their learning ought

to be ongoing, or at least keep pace with, if&nbsp;not, outpace the speed of

job eliminations and creations brought about by globalisation.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me move on to the

second worrisome trend, the issue of widening income gap.&nbsp; Just how bad is

this issue of income gap? Will it get worse?&nbsp; According to <i>The</i> <i>Economist</i>,

the first obvious beneficiary of globalisation is the corporate sector. The

magazine reported that profits of companies as a share of GDP in Corporate

America, Japan and EU are at or near an all-time high.&nbsp; For instance, the

share of national income from Corporate America has increased from 7% in

mid-2001 to 13% this year.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second obvious

beneficiary of globalisation is the top wage earner. America's top 1% earners

now receive 16% of all income, up from 8% in 1980.&nbsp; By comparison, less

skilled workers are seeing their wages stagnate or steadily decline.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Over long periods of

time, real wages tend to attract average productivity growth.&nbsp; But so far

for this decade, workers' real pay in many developed economies has increased

more slowly than labour productivity.&nbsp;&nbsp; The real weekly wage of a

typical American worker in the middle of the income distribution has fallen by

4% since the start of the recovery in 2001.&nbsp; Over the same period, labour

productivity has risen by 15%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after allowing for health and

pension benefits, total compensation has risen by only 1.5% in real

terms.&nbsp; Real wages in Germany and Japan have also been flat&nbsp;or

falling.&nbsp; Thus, the usual argument in favour of globalisation -&nbsp;that

it will make most workers better off,&nbsp;with only a few low-skilled ones

losing out - has not so far been borne out by the facts.&nbsp; Most workers are

being squeezed.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>The&nbsp;Economist</span></i><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> reports.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, we see

similar but milder trends.&nbsp; I like to believe that our trends are <p align=left>Column: 327</p>milder

because the Government has taken more proactive programmes in reskilling our

workers, job redesign and through wealth re-distribution, mitigate the impact

of income stagnation of the affected groups.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you refer to

Chart 1, which was given out earlier, we will see that at the upper-middle

level, professional and skilled workers have been able to register strong

income growth compared to the unskilled workers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While&nbsp;Singapore

residents in the managerial, professional and technical occupations enjoyed

nominal wage growth of 4.7% per annum between 1990 and&nbsp;2005, the middle level

experienced lower income growth of 3.7%.&nbsp; In particular, the monthly

income of the lowest paid group declined between 2000 and 2005.&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the household level,

between 1990 and 2005, households in the top 20% experienced the fastest per

capita income growth of 6% per annum.&nbsp; The lowest 20% actually see their

household income decline over the same period between 2000 and 2005.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we can see the

effect of globalisation here.&nbsp; It is pulling both ends further apart. The

end result?&nbsp;&nbsp;The top is soaring ahead, the bottom is falling behind

and the middle feeling the pressure.&nbsp; But is this the end?&nbsp; Will the

income gap be further widened?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, a private

banking consultancy firm estimated that Singapore needs 1,000 relationship

managers. This is not surprising as we aspire to be a leading financial hub

with sizeable operations in wealth management. Because of MAS' active promotion,

most large private banks have their Asian headquarters in Singapore.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Industry analysts observe

that Singapore's private banks are drawing private <p align=left>Column: 328</p>bankers from wherever they

can.&nbsp; &quot;Private banks are looking at lawyers, management consultants,

corporate bankers and investment bankers&quot;,&nbsp; he says:&nbsp;

&quot;Pretty much anyone with a good level of education and a history of

relationship management can pick up the nuts and bolts of private

banking.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unsurprisingly

therefore, pay in this country is rising. A few years ago, Tilloston says

private banking relationship&nbsp;managers working in Singapore will command

US$150,000 in total pay. Today, according to the consultant, pay packages

between US$250,000&nbsp;and US$350,000 are the norm.&nbsp; Sir, this is but one

industry we are trying to create well-paying jobs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the

latest IRAS' report, let us&nbsp;look at the top end of the income

earners,&nbsp;2004 saw the increase of 257 millionaires to a record 1,738

millionaires, a 20% increase over the year 2003. The average income of these

millionaires is about S$1.98 million. The <i>Straits Times</i> commented that

&quot;the millionaires club is becoming less exclusive by the day&quot;.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As our economy aspires to

be a more vibrant and larger hub for commerce, banking, R&amp;D, innovation,

logistics and tourism, we want to create many high-paying jobs.&nbsp; When

firms cannot find enough Singaporeans to fill them, they will go out to hire

from the international market.&nbsp; They will need to pay competitive wages to

get them.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As our economy grows,

therefore, our top earners will increase in number.&nbsp; Their income will

also increase much faster according to international demands.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But to have a

high-income group earner earning more is not a bad thing because, after all,

only 17% of our population pays income tax.&nbsp; Our high income earners are

contributing to the <p align=left>Column: 329</p>Government revenue through income taxes.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp;a widening

income gap can lead to tensions between the &quot;haves&quot; and the

&quot;have-nots&quot;.&nbsp; Of course, we are far from America's wide

gap.&nbsp; One indication is to compare the average CEO's salary versus an

ordinary worker's salary.&nbsp; In America, this is 300:1.&nbsp;&nbsp; I

believe our ratio is closer to 100:1.&nbsp; Nor are we about to have a

&quot;one Singapore, two worlds&quot; kind of income-divide syndrome.&nbsp; But

we should worry about this so that we will not end up having our social

cohesion stretched and tested.&nbsp; Even&nbsp;a developing China is concerned

with their&nbsp;&quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot; despite the fact

they are at a much early stage of growth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am trying to

convince the House with international and local data that structural

unemployment will be a permanent fixture in our job scene as we progress, that

our workforce must upgrade and reskill continually to cushion

otherwise&nbsp;rude shocks.&nbsp; I am also submitting to the House that the

income divide we see is just the beginning. Our high-wage earners will tend to

draw salaries set by large economies of the world such as America and EU and

also later, by China and India.&nbsp;&nbsp;For top talents are limited in supply.&nbsp;

They are&nbsp;coveted everywhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recognising this

underlying trend is important for us to anticipate and prescribe right

solutions. Sir, I would like to propose three approaches in our policy

formulation and programme initiatives.&nbsp; The President has emphasised in

his Address that education is the best way to level up our society and the

Government already invests heavily in human resources. To help low income

workers, the Government will provide them with more skills training and

upgrading in cooperation with unions and employers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><!-- Begin CDATA tag --><!-- End CDATA tag --><!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag --><!--MP_NAME:-->&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p align=left>Column: 330</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Sir, I believe we are on the right

track.&nbsp; Education and skills upgrading are the life line for our displaced

workers.&nbsp; They have been tossed out from the main vessel by strong waves

and gale, and we need to extend them this life line so that they can get back

on board with us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I would

like to be convinced that we can do more.&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp; The

Government is already investing more than $100,000 per child in the form of

subsidies given to take this child from primary to tertiary education.&nbsp; At

the national level, we are spending close to 4% of our GDP or about $7 billion

per annum on education, to provide them with the skills and mental capacity to

take on good employment.&nbsp; But let me ask Members of the House: how long do

you think this investment would last?&nbsp; Is there an expiry date to what we

learnt yesterday for tomorrow's application?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this era of

relentless innovation and pervasive communication, new knowledge is created by

the million bytes every second.&nbsp; Graduates from some disciplines, such as

electronics and IT, know very well that the half life of their university

studies may be good for only the next two years before they become

obsolete.&nbsp; Yes, half of what you learn in four years in polytechnics and

universities can become obsolete in two years, and they get halved every two

years.&nbsp; Of course, for most of our tertiary students, by the time they

graduate from the polytechnics and universities, they would have mastered the

skills of continual education and learning.&nbsp; And if they are not

complacent, they would continue to acquire new skills on the job.&nbsp; This

would ensure their employability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For workers without

tertiary education, I think they have to rely heavily on guided learning by

their employers and the unions.&nbsp; In fact, I believe we have one of the

best tripartite skills upgrading systems in the world to make sure that our

workers continue to learn.&nbsp; Just last week, <p align=left>Column: 331</p>the WDA organised a series of

talks at the Toa Payoh Hub on the 10 skills to stay employable.&nbsp; It is

Singapore Learning Festival 2006.&nbsp; I applaud WDA's vision and passion and

the workers' determination to acquire new skills needed for growth industries

on the horizon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But considering that

most of us will face the prospect of changing careers five to six times in our

adult life, sometimes taking on a new job and sometimes starting all over

again, I think the paradigm that a basic education will last for a life time

has to be changed.&nbsp; Indeed, we need to adopt a new paradigm that learning

is life long and employability needs to be renewed at every stage of life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This leads to the

question of whether we have done enough in our system to encourage life-long

learning.&nbsp; Sir, if we spend 4% or $7 billion of our GDP on education in

the first 10 to 16 years of each child's life to prepare him or her for the

immediate work life that follows, how much should the investment be to prepare

all our workers when they reach 25-30 and&nbsp;when they reach 45-50 into the

future?&nbsp; What should be the order or magnitude of the budget, even though

a good part of it can come from the employer?&nbsp; Of course, we hope that

most of our young workers gainfully employed will receive training from

employers to update their skills.&nbsp; But the reality is that some employers

do not.&nbsp; We only get to know when they suddenly relocate and shut down the

plant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would therefore

suggest that WDA&nbsp;consider the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) re-examine

the&nbsp;size of the skills upgrading budget, considering that a short half

life of the knowledge of our fresh school leavers;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) consider ways

where employers can be incentivised to conduct upgrading training on a

continual basis; and<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p align=left>Column: 332</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) consider

aggressive tax reliefs to encourage individuals who may be in between jobs and

without employers to take on useful skills upgrading programmes or

courses.&nbsp; This will also emphasise individual responsibility on

employability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My next point is

about providing a life raft in a storm.&nbsp; When people get forced out of

their jobs all of a sudden, they&nbsp;panick and their family members&nbsp;are

stressed.&nbsp; With the trend of structural unemployment, white collar and

blue collar workers are equally at risk.&nbsp; As we have seen in our own MPS,

some who are jobless might not be able to find jobs even after more than six

months, and the others have to take a longer time to acquire new skills before

they can change to a different job.&nbsp; So the question is: could we offer

them a life raft that gets them out of the choppy waters so that they can get

back on board the main vessel?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first nine

months of 2006, 9,000 jobs were eliminated, and this was offset by a record

number of 123,000 jobs created.&nbsp; So our seasonally adjusted unemployment

rate declined to 2.7%.&nbsp; But if we look beneath the top line, we will

realise that the re-employment rate of resident retrenched workers had hovered

around 60% for the past four years.&nbsp; In other words, 40% of the displaced

workers remained unemployed after six months.&nbsp; Why are they unemployed for

so long?&nbsp; Are they choosy, as some employers have vehemently

claimed?&nbsp; Or do they lack the skills needed for new jobs created?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we will need to

study structural unemployment problems as if they were a growing permanent part

of the globalised economy.&nbsp; Our well-conceived $1 billion Workfare

programme had been launched to help the low-wage workers earning less <p align=left>Column: 333</p>than

$1,500 per month.&nbsp; This was a good programme because it addresses most

people's needs. But we know that workers above the $1,500 mark to $3,000 range

are not immune to retrenchments and income stagnation.&nbsp; As we have seen in

our MPS, some of them lost their jobs for good, and needed time to learn and

take on a different line of job.&nbsp; Some of them faced negative housing

equity and cash flow problems.&nbsp; For this squeezed middle class, they will

need to rework their finances, sometimes liquidating their assets and starting

anew.&nbsp; They need a life raft in time of distress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the squeezed

middle class, I think we should continue to explore ways to extend them a life

raft to get them back on track.&nbsp; Many of our current financial aid

programmes have a low cut off point. This is correct because they are

grant-based and we do not want to dish out large handouts to the extent that it

destroys the motivation to work.&nbsp; But for the squeezed middle-class, I

think we should think of some non-grant loan-based programme to help them tide

through the difficult but transitionary time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a previous

sitting, Mr Inderjit Singh proposed the idea of unemployment insurance.&nbsp;

Some insurance companies tried this but it did not take off.&nbsp; Recently, we

saw how Nobel Laureate Prof Muhammad Yunus was honoured for his contributions

in poverty alleviation by making micro loans work in Bangladesh.&nbsp; The

micro loan programme worked very well because the loans were given out on a

group basis to a village or community.&nbsp; Community obligations and social

pressures have kept bad debt to below 1.5%.&nbsp; Programmes like this and some

of the principles behind them could be adapted in our social support systems to

help cushion the shock on families.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past, our

clan associations offered such help programmes.&nbsp; Going <p align=left>Column: 334</p>forward, I think

our grassroots organisations and clan associations could work together to

revive some of these sound practices.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third proposal is

about maintaining low cost alternatives.&nbsp; Figuratively speaking, it is

like we provide shallow water or low-tide zone in our system.&nbsp; Sir, for

those of us who can swim, we have, at least,&nbsp;overcome the fear of water,

and if we are tossed out into the sea unexpectedly, we have enough skill and

nerve to stay afloat and think of ways to get to the life raft float or life

line.&nbsp; But for the non-swimmers, falling into water of more than human

height is a drowning experience.&nbsp; I say this because I think there are

non-swimmers in our midst.&nbsp; So, the message, &quot;Don't worry, jump into

the water and we will throw you a float&quot; does not really assure

them.&nbsp; As much as we want them to learn to swim and sail, some of them

will find it hard or physically unable&nbsp;to do so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In our system, we

already have some low-tide zones&nbsp; -&nbsp; our hawker centres serving

low-cost food, our rental flats providing shelter at token rent, polyclinics

providing good healthcare at affordable cost and PCF kindergartens providing

good quality but low-cost education for pre-school kids.&nbsp; Because of our

small size,&nbsp;there is always a great pressure to equalise the value of

resources, such as land and&nbsp;rentals, in order to maximise market

value.&nbsp; But if we take everything&nbsp;to the market rate and do

everything according to market principles, we might end up pushing up cost,

even in delivering public goods and services.&nbsp; Yes, we can subsequently

intervene by way of grants and subsidies.&nbsp; But, in practice, deciding who

needs what and the delivery to them can prove administratively expensive and

even ineffective.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would

therefore argue for us to identify and define areas of shallow-water zones, and

provide low-cost alternatives.&nbsp; <p align=left>Column: 335</p>Not every public good we provide needs to

be upgraded.&nbsp; If people want low-cost transport, let more private buses

without air-conditioning ply the estate.&nbsp; So long as we deliberately

design&nbsp;low-cost alternatives in the four areas of our

living&nbsp;-&nbsp;meaning the &quot;<i>yi</i>&quot;<i>,</i> &quot;<i>shi</i>&quot;,

&quot;<i>zu</i>&quot;<i>,</i> &quot;<i>xing</i>&quot;<i>,</i> the clothing, the

food, the roof over our head and transportation&nbsp;- we would have addressed

the needs of many.&nbsp; We need to view grassroots issues from the land of

grassroots itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I

have spoken at length about the challenges of structural unemployment and the

widening income gap.&nbsp; I have also suggested that we strengthen our support

networks in the three areas of life line, life raft and shallow-water

zone.&nbsp; In case some Members of the House get away with the idea that I am

a doomsayer, I want to categorically state that I am not.&nbsp; In fact, I am

very optimistic about our future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The objective of the

Government is to find ways to create a better future for Singaporeans.&nbsp;

And because we are having a record number of jobs created and because our

economy is growing at 7% or more this year, all the more we have to think about

the&nbsp;traps and under currents that can derail us or toss us out of

course.&nbsp; As the Chinese saying goes, we should anticipate dangers when we

have safety - <i>ci an si wei.&nbsp;</i> And people who have no long-term

worries will have short-term troubles - <i>ren wu yen li, pi yu cing yeo.</i>&nbsp;

It is imperative that this House exhaust every thought to deliberate the best

ways forward for our country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

]&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, as we stand here looking at our vision, let us face the

future with full confidence.&nbsp; Although I am a persistent <p align=left>Column: 336</p>optimist, there

are times when I see the reaction of Singaporeans on certain issues and matters

around us, I cannot help feeling&nbsp; helpless and ludicrous.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, we read in the newspapers that Singapore

was voted as the second best city for dining and night life in the world, after

Italy. This morning, on the 93.8 &quot;Beyond Words&quot; programme, listeners

were asked to give their views on the matter. This was a survey that has been

done.&nbsp; Most callers from Singapore were shocked and skeptical at this

honour bestowed by an international consultancy firm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am surprised by the shock expressed by the

listeners. Why are we declining the honour given to us by&nbsp;an international

consultancy company?&nbsp; One female caller said that the merchandise in

Singapore was too expensive, unlike the value-for-money shopping experience in

the other cities in the region.&nbsp; Another male caller&nbsp;criticised the

finding and claimed that it would be more reasonable for Singapore to be ranked

34th or 36th, rather than second.&nbsp; He also doubted the method in which the

survey was carried out, and added that wrong questions could have been asked or

the wrong people targeted for interview.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there were two listeners who had different

views. One female caller said that she had been travelling overseas very frequently.

In comparison, Singapore offers a large variety of choices and the shopping

hours are longer – some are even open 24 hours, like&nbsp;Mustafa.&nbsp; The

conditions for shopping in Singapore are better than those in the

European&nbsp; cities. Another male caller who sounded like a foreigner said

that Singaporeans are not giving enough affirmation to their own achievements.

He, himself, had witnessed the investments and efforts put in by the Government

and the enterprises in creating a vibrant and prosperous food and beverage and

recrea<p align=left>Column: 337</p>tional industry in Singapore. He feels that Singapore's scene has already

been changed substantially of late.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is it that the ones praising us are always

foreigners, while the ones complaining are inevitably Singaporeans? I think

Singaporeans are just not contented with what they have. We are living in

bliss, yet we do not realise it.<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On&nbsp;25th October this year,&nbsp;<i>Lianhe Zaobao</i>

carried a letter entitled <i>Never Enough of Singapore</i> by a&nbsp; reader by

the name of Jiang Qi (</span><span lang=ZH-CN style='font-size:13.0pt;

font-family:宋体;mso-ascii-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-hansi-font-family:

"Times New Roman"'>姜�?�</span><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>).&nbsp; She said

that after staying in Singapore for a year, she still brings her daughter out

every weekend to discover Singapore.&nbsp; She said, contrary to many people's

belief that Singapore has only limited attractions, she found her weekends

filled with new sites to visit and new events to participate in, such as the

opening of the Istana grounds or the open house of the Air Force Base on an

ordinary Saturday.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gave another example.&nbsp; On 23rd September, she

originally intended to watch the musical Empress Dowager at the Esplanade

Theatre. However, she was too late and could not be admitted to the show. To

her pleasant surprise, there was this Japan-ASEAN Children's Art Exhibition

which was held at the open space in the Esplanade. They were inducted into the

world of the children's creativity.&nbsp; After that, they went on to view the

world's famous Surrealist Master, Spanish sculptor Selvatore Dali's 35 pieces

of works displayed at the Ngee Ann City.&nbsp; Thereafter, they crossed Orchard

Road to view a Taiwanese Glass Works Exhibition at the Paragon. As the dusk set

in and the lights went up, she suddenly found President Nathan officiating at

the lighting-up ceremony to welcome Deepavali.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The writer Jiang Qi concluded by

saying: &quot;Singapore is so full of life and <p align=left>Column: 338</p>constantly radiating

energy.&quot;&nbsp; She delights us again with another surprise.&nbsp; She

said, &quot;The vibrant and vigorous Singapore is always coming out with

something new every moment. I could visit her a thousand times and never feel a

moment of boredom.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jiang Qi relied on the section of <i>Lianhe Zaobao</i>

known as &quot;Today's Kaleidoscope&quot; to seek out new events and find&nbsp;

things to do in Singapore. To her, Singapore is always full of surprises.&nbsp;

I am sure there are many others who share her same feelings for Singapore. As

we gaze into our own kaleidoscope and pursue the Singapore Dream, may we too

find unlimited possibilities before us.&nbsp; Let us approach the future with

confidence and pride.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

]&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion standing in the name of the Member

for Jurong GRC, Mdm Halimah Yacob, to thank the President for this Address. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The President's Address centres on how our Government

is going to deal with the challenges and other problems in the <p align=left>Column: 339</p>next five years

and how to satisfy the desires of our people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the Government's most significant contributions

is on public housing.&nbsp; In Singapore, we have an excellent 'home for

everyone' scheme.&nbsp; Last year, we provided public housing for 880,000

residents.&nbsp; This is a great achievement.&nbsp; The public housing system

has all along been the pride of Singapore.&nbsp; We have ongoing HDB upgrading

programmes, but these programmes will effectively benefit our people only if we

could execute them quickly and promptly. Therefore, I urge the Government to

step up the Lift Upgrading Programme for the older residential areas; otherwise

it will prolong the period of inconvenience to the residents and may also cost

more.<br>

&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that some flats

will not be given the Lift Upgrading Programme for some reasons.&nbsp; I urge

HDB to announce the list of such flats and inform the affected residents as

soon as possible.&nbsp; Otherwise, these residents would have waited for a long

time just to be told that their flats will not be upgraded. Therefore, I hope

that the Government will draw up a masterplan of Lift Upgrading Programme for

the remaining flats.&nbsp; In this way, the residents will be able to know

whether or not the lifts in their flats will be upgraded and when it will be

upgraded. This will help the residents to plan for their future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government should also look at how they could

provide alternative means for senior citizens to cross the road safely instead

of getting up and down the overhead pedestrian bridges.&nbsp; A very good

example is the one at the Khatib MRT Station.&nbsp; My senior citizens have

made requests again and again for escalators to be installed or an underpass so

that they could cross the road to the MRT station on the other side of the

road.&nbsp; Even at this time, we are still waiting for a reply from the Land

Transport Authority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p align=left>Column: 340</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the demand for medical services for our ageing

population, the Ministry of Health has already sounded the alarm. This shows

that we cannot neglect the problems that will come with our ageing

population.&nbsp; The Minister for Health, Mr Khaw Boon Wan, has introduced a

series of reforms which prove to be very popular with the people.&nbsp; My

residents hope that Minister Khaw would further relax the use of the Medisave

account.&nbsp; One of my residents told me that he has unfortunately contracted

nose cancer that requires radiotherapy but he could not use the only savings he

has, ie, the Medisave account, causing him great hardship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of National

Development has a Community Improvement Projects Committee to deal with the

funds for upgrading of amenities in HDB estates.&nbsp; Can the Ministry of

National Development also set up a CIPC fund for the private residential

estates?&nbsp; At the moment, the private residential estates have to wait for

the estate upgrading programme.&nbsp; Very often, residents in my private

estates have made some suggestions on how to improve their amenities in their

estates, such as building outdoor sports and recreational facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;

If the Government could also set up a similar Community Improvement Projects

Committee or fund for upgrading works of the private estates, it will be of

great benefit to our residents in the private estates.&nbsp; I know that the

Government has some plans to improve the public areas in the private

residential estates, but much more can be done. At the same time, I would also

suggest that the Government consider setting up a one-stop service centre

equivalent of&nbsp;town council to look after the needs of the residents in the

private residential estates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the cost of living in Singapore has

risen.&nbsp; Many families have to work harder to cope with the inflated cost

of living, particularly those who are in the lower-<p align=left>Column: 341</p>income group and also those

who are elderly and retrenched.&nbsp; They are now earning much less income.

When they want to return to the workforce, they have to work longer hours, very

often from 9 to 12 hours a day and six days a week. Even then, there is no

promise that they will earn more income. At the same time, essential expenses

such as utilities, public transport, etc, have all gone up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me quote our traffic problem as an example.&nbsp;

First of all, I must be fair to all the public transport operators.&nbsp; They

are very cooperative.&nbsp; We raised some requests to them. Generally, they

would listen to us. Of course, I hope that they would do more. I have

successfully petitioned for a shuttle bus service between the Teachers Estate

and Yio Chu Kang MRT for the residents of the Teachers Estate.&nbsp; I would

like to take this opportunity to thank the SMRT. After operating for just three

months, SMRT told me that they were running a loss with this route and it is

very possible that this route would be discontinued.&nbsp; Teachers Estate is

situated at a valley and many of the residents are retirees. Without this

shuttle bus service, these elderly residents would have to walk 500 to 600

metres and to climb some 60 steps of the stairs to reach the nearest bus stop -

500 to 600 metres and on top of that, they have to go up 60 steps of the

stairs. Is this the way we want to treat all these senior citizens, these

retired people, who have in their prime time contributed to our social,

economic and education fields?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from the

Teachers Estate, I have three other residential estates in my

constituency.&nbsp; They are Springleaf Garden, Springside and Lentor

Avenue.&nbsp; The residents also have a lot of complaints about the public

transport facilities there.&nbsp; I have approached LTA, SMRT and SBS with the

hope that they would take into consideration the interests of their <p align=left>Column: 342</p>commuters

and residents to resolve their problems as soon as possible. Should it be

necessary to make changes to the policy, they should be carried out

vigorously.&nbsp; Only then can we attract more Singaporeans to switch to

public transport.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, my next point is on the traffic operations.&nbsp;

From the financial report, comparing the half yearly results of this year to

the same period last year, we can see that ComfortDelgro's profit has gone up

by 2.4% and the SMRT, in its 2006 financial year, has made a net profit of $120

million.&nbsp; In its financial report for 2006, the group's profit has gone up

by 5.7%, accounting for $711.07 million. On the second quarter ending in June

this year, ComfortDelgro reported that SBC under the group, the profit has gone

up by 3.8%, accounting for $129.9 million.&nbsp; I know that companies cannot

operate like charitable organisations.&nbsp; I also know that the shareholders

are asking for reasonable returns. I have also read the statements by the

Ministry of Transport.&nbsp; It says that the capital investment of these

companies is very high and their returns are inferior as compared to other

companies with similar capital investment.&nbsp; However, I feel that the fare

adjustment policy needs to be improved upon. While many people are having

problems coping with the rises in the utility charges, the traffic operators

are raising their fares much to the distress of the low income people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the traffic operators can claim that they

have set aside some part of their funds to help the poor families. But is that

enough?&nbsp; I understand that the recently introduced $20 transport

assistance vouchers have all been handed out. Many residents have complained

that they have not benefited from this scheme.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the 2006 Census, there are some 283,400

families with monthly income of less than $2,000. Among them, 36,000 families

earn less than $1,000 and there are 106,400 families which have no income at

all.&nbsp; These two <p align=left>Column: 343</p>groups of households accounted for 14.9% of the total

number of households in Singapore. The Government has launched many schemes to

help the people who are in financial difficulties. These include the setting up

of the ComCare Fund, the distribution of the Progress Package and to provide

the training and retraining schemes for the people. The Government wants to

help its people so that they could cope with the cost of living. While the

Government is extending a helping hand to these people, the traffic operators and

the utility and energy operators are sticking out their invading hands to take

away some of the due benefits from the people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in transport,

we all know that a new gantry point has been set up at the north side of the

CTE.&nbsp; The serious traffic congestion situation is still a daily

occurrence.&nbsp; This means that residents in the northern part of Singapore

have to pay more money.&nbsp; Yet, they do not seem to derive any benefit from

there, although there is a theory that says that a higher road pricing will

reduce the volume of traffic. The LTA has already set up six ERP gantry points

at the CTE, Braddell Road, Serangoon Road, PIE link road to the CTE and also

the exit of CTE.&nbsp; There are altogether six more gantry points.&nbsp; With

so many gantry points, has there been any improvement to the traffic situation?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We can read from the newspapers that there were lots

and lots of complaints. The <i>Straits Times</i> also carried a report on this

matter on 25th September this year.&nbsp; The fact remains that my residents who

are driving will have to pay higher transport expenses. If the ERP is unable to

serve its designed purpose in solving the traffic congestion problem, then why

are we putting up more and more gantry points along the Central Expressway -

collect money in the morning, collect money at night?&nbsp; Although our

traffic congestion situation is relatively <p align=left>Column: 344</p>better than the other countries in

our region, what we asked for is for the authorities to explore other better

alternatives to better manage our traffic problems and not just keep on adding

more and more unpopular gantry points.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his Address, the President

pointed out that our country is facing a new turning point.&nbsp; Today, the

international competition is getting greater and the global situation and

business conditions are unpredictable.&nbsp; Therefore, our Government and

people must work together to seize the opportunities to raise the productivity

of our economy. In order to achieve this objective and to have a safe, secure,

more inclusive, harmonious and united society, an outstanding Government and

public sector are most essential.&nbsp; With a strong foundation for our

economy, the Government will be able to improve and strengthen our social

safety nets and help Singaporeans with difficulties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The economy has brought about

many opportunities.&nbsp; But for the lowly educated, there are new challenges

and problems. To the lower income groups, in order to meet the challenges of

life, they are facing great difficulties. They always feel that no matter how

hard they try, it appears that it is impossible to keep pace with

society.&nbsp; Whether it is learning new skills, acquiring new knowledge,

looking for new jobs, managing their personal finances or looking after their

families, they face difficulties in many aspects of their lives.&nbsp; This

is&nbsp; especially so for the older workers. To them, to receive <p align=left>Column: 345</p>retraining is

not easy because as they get older, the ability to absorb and understand new

things is reduced. If we do not pay attention and help them, they and their

families will fall further and further behind, and the cohesiveness of our

society will face a new challenge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Prime Minister Lee

introduced the ComCare Fund which is an excellent programme and has given much

help to our groups with difficulties. However, for a more holistic approach to

helping them, it is not enough for us to depend solely on the Government. Of

course, the Government will do more and introduce many more assistance schemes.

But I hope that those who are better off will have a more generous mindset and

stretch out their hands to help those in difficulties.&nbsp; We must work

together to do our part in helping those who have fallen behind. . We must pay

special attention to the older citizens who have contributed to the country in

the founding years, having toiled and sweated to build up this nation, and help

them tide over their crises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Let me give four

specific instances. The first example. There is a man in his 50s. He was very

active in the past. Whenever we had activities organised by RC, he would

participate in them. He was very healthy. But there was one year that I missed

him.&nbsp; And last week, when he came, he had a cap on.&nbsp; He looked pale.

I asked him what had happened to him. He removed his cap and he was bald - all

his hair had dropped off. He said, he was a cancer patient. In the last few

months, he had already spent more than $30,000 to treat his cancer. I believe

that in future, he would have to pay even more medical bills. He told me that

he had depleted his savings and cash. The only asset he has is the four-room

flat. He has considered selling his four-room flat and raised money to treat

his illness. But when he went to HDB to make enquiries, the officer told <p align=left>Column: 346</p>him

that he could sell the flat but within 30 months, he could not apply for a new

flat. He told him that he should try his best to rent a flat from his contacts

elsewhere. The market rental is very high.&nbsp; For people with illness, it is

not easy to rent a room. So he came to me for help. I have written in to HDB,

hoping that the HDB officer, while implementing the policy, will treat these

people with compassion and help Singaporeans in need.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The second example is

that of a Malay citizen.&nbsp; He has seven children.&nbsp; His income is about

$1,000 and his take-home pay is about $800.&nbsp; And because of his financial

difficulties, he was in arrears in his monthly housing instalment to HDB, conservancy

charges to the Town Council and PUB bills.&nbsp; So I have written in for an

instalment payment plan.&nbsp; But because his debt is so high, even with the

instalment plan, he could not meet the instalment payments.&nbsp; So his water

and electricity supplies were cut off.&nbsp; We applied for a special

&quot;pay-as-you-use&quot; meter for him.&nbsp; But after a few months,

Singapore Power Services asked him to pay by instalments again.&nbsp; So,

really, he could not do much else.&nbsp; There is one bundle of these letters

from SP Services.&nbsp; SP Services has the policy that he has to pay 20% of

his arrears from his cashcard.&nbsp; This is a good policy to help the poor to

tide over their difficulties.&nbsp; But I do not understand why SP Services

officials continue to press them to pay up the arrears.&nbsp; These poor

citizens are facing real problems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some residents tell me

that when oil prices went up, the tariffs went up. But when oil prices dropped,

they did not see SP Services lowering the water and electricity tariffs to help

our Singaporeans.&nbsp; Our motorists will understand.&nbsp; When oil prices

dropped, petrol stations and oil companies very quickly adjusted petrol prices

downwards by 5%-10%.&nbsp; On the way to Parliament today, I saw that the price

for diesel was reduced by 21% and that for petrol it was reduced by 11%.&nbsp;

It <p align=left>Column: 347</p>is an excellent policy.&nbsp; I hope SP Services would learn from the

example of the petrol companies.&nbsp; When oil prices are lower, they must

quickly adjust the tariffs so that the people will be able to enjoy the lower

water and electricity tariffs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that of a lady in her 30s.&nbsp; She told me that her husband was retrenched,

his health was not good and he had difficulty in getting a job.&nbsp; In the

end, her husband committed suicide, she herself had cancer and her daughter was

suffering from depression.&nbsp; When she came to see me, she did not make any

great demand but she was hoping that I would write a letter to the Ministry of

Education so that the school fees could be reduced.&nbsp; I have written to MOE

and the CDC to help her to apply for financial assistance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the case of a young lady.&nbsp; She told me that her husband was recently

retrenched and looking for a job.&nbsp; They have a daughter at school and the

youngest child is not even one-year-old.&nbsp; After listening to her problems,

I wrote a letter to the CDC to apply for financial assistance.&nbsp; But she

asked, &quot;How long would it take?&quot;&nbsp; I said, &quot;Maybe a few

days&quot;.&nbsp; She burst out in tears.&nbsp; She said, &quot;Tomorrow I have

no money to buy milk powder for my child.&quot;&nbsp; I took out $50 and gave

it to her.&nbsp; She refused to take it because she said, &quot;I cannot take

MP's money.&quot;&nbsp; I told her, &quot;This is not for you.&nbsp; It is for

your daughter to buy the milk powder.&quot;&nbsp; So, gratefully, she took the

$50 and she said that she would always remember me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

just happening at my branch.&nbsp; I am sure in many branches, many other MPs

to help these people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In order to help more

poor Singaporeans, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I make a very bold suggestion?&nbsp; I

hope, through the MCYS and the leadership of the Minister, to organise a

nation-wide fund-raising campaign.&nbsp; This fund-raising campaign will not

involve any perfornmance of high danger or risk or lucky draws.&nbsp; This

fund-raising project will move all Singaporeans to contribute what they can, to

give whatever they can afford, whether it is $5, $10, $100, $1,000 or

$10,000.&nbsp; We hope, through the accumulation of many small sums, a big

amount will be raised. So we can also look forward to getting support from our

companies and enterprises.&nbsp; I hope they will remember to distribute and to

return to society the benefits they have accrued from society.&nbsp; I hope the

Government will also consider giving these donations, whether from corporations

or individuals, double tax deductions, as well as to match the donations

dollar-for-dollar to boost the amount raised.&nbsp; If we can raise $10

million, together with the Government's one-for-one matching donation, we will

be able to raise $20 million.&nbsp; We can then distribute this $20 million

equitably amongst the 84 Citizens Consultative Constituencies so that every

constituency will get about $230,000.&nbsp; This amount will be spent to help

those who are in real need, to allow them to solve their problems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I further suggest that

every constituency should set up a special task force to carry out the

necessary investigations into each needy family and to manage and distribute

the funds raised.&nbsp; This is to ensure that those who are in real need will

be able to receive help quickly.&nbsp; In my Bukit Gombak constituency, I have

a committee to investigate the financial needs and circumstances of these

families.&nbsp; Once we confirm that they are in real need, we disburse the

funds immediately.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that with this

measure, we will really be able to help families in need.&nbsp; We hope to

avoid another tragedy, such as the one last month where a Singaporean committed

suicide at the Chinese Garden MRT station because he was unable to solve his

financial problems.&nbsp; It is regrettable that this should happen.&nbsp; But

even as our hearts are pained and we are regretting what happened, we should,

more importantly, recognise that this is a wake-up call for our community and

is something that deserves our attention.&nbsp; This national effort to raise

funds, if successfully and smoothly carried out jointly by the people and the

Government, will be a heart-to-heart and hand-in-hand effort, and will further

promote a sense of belonging and increase the cohesion of our society.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

will have the support of the Government.&nbsp; I will do my best and do my part.&nbsp;

I am willing to contribute one month of my MP's allowance as a small

talk about the issues relating to medical treatments for the elderly.&nbsp; The

Minister for Health, Mr Khaw Boon Wan, said that in the next five years, his

Ministry will carry out measures such as expansions on the use of Medisave and

adjustments to MediShield to help the sick who are in need.&nbsp; I believe

this will be very good for the elderly citizens.&nbsp; I am concerned that with

the ageing of our population, if we have sufficient facilities for the medium

and long-term medical care of our senior citizens.&nbsp; Can we maintain our

medical services at a high standard?&nbsp; These are problems that deserve our

attention.&nbsp; I hope the Ministry of Health will consider increasing the

number of Class C beds in every hospital to ensure that older citizens and

poorer Singaporeans will be taken <p align=left>Column: 350</p>care of.&nbsp; I also hope that the Minister

will consider establishing hospitals in every region and improve the facilities

in these hospitals all over Singapore so that we can reduce the travelling time

of our patients seeking treatment and spread out the number of patients over

Singapore.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I understand we are

short of specialist doctors, nurses and staff in geriatrics and

gerontology.&nbsp; I would like to ask the Minister for Health whether he would

introduce new measures to attract and retain specialists in looking after these

elderly patients.&nbsp; In addition, the hospitals can improve their work

processes and the standard of infrastructure within the hospitals so that older

citizens who do not know English or Mandarin will be able to find their way in

our hospitals.&nbsp; We hope they would have a special counter.&nbsp; As far as

I know, senior citizens have told me that DBS has set up a special counter

within the bank to look after senior citizens.&nbsp; I think this measure has

been welcomed by them.&nbsp; So, in hospitals, it is even more important that

we have a special counter so that we can have staff who can speak dialects to

serve the elderly citizens and provide better services to them.&nbsp; I hope we

can all empathise better with our elderly folk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, during the last

term of Parliament, Singapore and Singaporeans were subjected to so many

challenges, from 9/11 to the JI arrests, from SARS to the threat of the avian

flu.&nbsp; Our economy took several roller-coaster rides during that

period.&nbsp; Singaporeans lost their jobs and felt the pressure of a severe economic

downturn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p align=left>Column: 351</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to many

Singaporeans, the experience over the last five years was a rude wake-up call,

yet a humbling experience.&nbsp; Even professionals were not spared.&nbsp;

Aspirations were dashed when they lost their jobs, and some felt compelled to

sell their flats and downgrade to smaller flats, as savings were

depleted.&nbsp; Yet others felt depressed and demoralised when they remained

unemployed for periods longer than they had ever experienced before.&nbsp; One

word that emerges regularly as we look at Singaporeans' experience is

&quot;resilience&quot;.&nbsp; We know that resilience means to spring back or

the ability to readily recover from shock.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, indeed, we have

shown that we have the ability to be a resilient society.&nbsp; We have sprung

back from the slump of the economic downturn to be where we are.&nbsp; Today,

our economy looks brighter than ever.&nbsp; The number of jobs created is at

its all-time high.&nbsp; Property prices are also picking up.&nbsp; Various

industries are struggling to keep up with expansion.&nbsp; The sun is shining again.&nbsp;

But, Sir, as in any order of nature, the clouds and the rains are

some&nbsp;things that we cannot avoid.&nbsp; Sometimes, they are accompanied by

thunder and lightning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the nature of

globalisation subjects us to the idiosyncrasies of global forces often beyond

our control.&nbsp; The reality is that we will have to go through the economic

downturn yet again.&nbsp; The question is: are our people more mature and savvy

to face it?&nbsp; Have they reflected sufficiently on their learning points,

having gone through what they did recently?&nbsp; Are they able to weather the

storm again and come out an even stronger people?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as we continue

to encourage our people to face the challenges of globalisation head-on, we

must also recall that globalisation also brings with it potential crisis

trigger points, such as avian flu, SARS, just to name a few.&nbsp; When these

crises set in, we need strong <p align=left>Column: 352</p>leadership to show the way out, as we have

done.&nbsp; Singaporeans rallied behind the leadership and we overcame these

crises.&nbsp; Sir, indeed, the Government has rightfully provided the necessary

leadership to steer Singapore through every crisis that we faced in the last 41

years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But have we looked

back and reflected on what this has done to Singaporeans?&nbsp; Sir, we pride

ourselves as having a very efficient system, including our civil service and

its related agencies, one of the most efficient in the world.&nbsp; I think

this efficiency has led to a certain character and attitude amongst

Singaporeans that I think need some reflection and soul-searching.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, are we turning

Singaporeans to a people whose problem-solving skills solely rest on the

mechanism of asking someone else to solve their problems and, in most cases,

the Government agencies to solve these problems?&nbsp; It seems that the

attitude is, while the problem exists, and I may be directly affected by it,

the problem is not mine.&nbsp; The owner of the problem is the Government

agencies as they are responsible for it and it is their job to serve the people

and, in most instances, solve the problems the people face!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

well-maintained.&nbsp; Can we blame Singaporeans for expecting service for what

they have <p align=left>Column: 353</p>paid for?&nbsp; In the same vein, they would argue that they pay

taxes and thus expect the different agencies to do just that - serve the

taxpayers and solve the problems presented to them. Sir, are we slowly breeding

a culture of complaining amongst our people?&nbsp;Of course, some may call it

providing &quot;feedback&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, while we are

glad that Singaporeans are not apathetic and are looking into such issues, to

confront the challenges of globalisation, our people need to be problem

solvers, not merely problem identifiers or problem referrers. More

fundamentally, Sir, what values are we imparting to our children?&nbsp; It is

not uncommon for adults to launch these &quot;feedback&quot; in the presence of

young children.&nbsp; How can we expect the next generation of Singaporeans to

be resilient when they are growing up in an environment where their adult role

models solve problems without taking ownership of the problem themselves?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the President

in his Address highlighted the need for the Government to have a new social and

political compact with Singaporeans, especially the P65 generation.&nbsp; I

think we also need a new social contract with Singaporeans on ownership and

community problem-solving.&nbsp; It is important for us to ensure that we

continue to build that resilience that is sorely needed to face the challenges

of globalisation.&nbsp; Indeed, we need to fundamentally ask ourselves what

kind of society do we want in the future? Are we happy and satisfied with what

we have today?&nbsp; Or do we want a Singapore where Singaporeans acknowledge

that problems exist, prepared to take ownership of the problem, and find

solutions to them?&nbsp; Of course, I am not saying that the Government is

totally taken out of the equation. What I am highlighting is the issue of values

within our people.&nbsp; Do we want a people with drive and passion, <p align=left>Column: 354</p>who will

see opportunities in the face of adversity, or a people who will not be happy

but wait for others to make things happen better for them?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, during this

current debate, many Members of the House have spoken about the digital divide

as the President had highlighted the Government's commitment to low-income

Singaporeans, ensuring that they are included and not left behind as we move

forward as a society.&nbsp; Of course, there have been many calls for the

Government to do more for this group.&nbsp; But we all know more will never be

enough.&nbsp; There will always be calls for more. Yet, we caveat our

statements with the caution that we should not go down the slippery road of

turning Singapore into a welfare state.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, when we look at our

own welfare system, key phrases like &quot;many helping hands&quot;,

&quot;community care&quot; come to mind.&nbsp; Our welfare system is also

premised on the fundamental value that the family is the first line of defence,

as it is the building block of society.&nbsp; Many of our other policies are

also premised on this fundamental value - be it our housing policies or our

health policies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, have we asked

ourselves what we really mean by this, that the family is the first line of defence?&nbsp;

Who is the family?&nbsp; The nuclear family made up of two generations living

in one household,&nbsp;the extended family of siblings and relatives. At what

point do the &quot;many helping hands&quot; come in to help? When do we say,

yes, the family as the first line of defence has failed and thus the community

and the State must now come in? Do we recognise that some families are so

dynamic and complex that they may fail to perform their functions?&nbsp; What

is society's threshold level for family failures?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, on the one hand, we

have legislation to enforce families to be <p align=left>Column: 355</p>responsible for their members, for

example, we have the&nbsp;Maintenance of Parents Bill to ensure that parents

can claim maintenance for their children.&nbsp; Children of divorced parents&nbsp;have

legal rights to maintenance from their fathers under the Women's Charter.&nbsp;

On the other hand, we are challenged when a low income family comes to us and

seek assistance.&nbsp; We see they have siblings who are well-off enough to

support them. Do we give help or not?&nbsp; When elderly couples come to see us

for help, we see they have children who can support them but they say their

relations are strained, do we help or not?&nbsp; When single mothers with their

little children come to see us for help and their fathers failed to provide

maintenance because he has a new family now, do we help or not?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, ever so often, such

cases will be highlighted in the media, whether it is the case of a family

whose flat was repossessed by the banks or dependants of individuals who decide

to take their own lives. And almost immediately when the story is reported in

the media, society begins to point fingers at the &quot;many helping

hands&quot;, asking where are these &quot;helping hands&quot;.&nbsp; And where

is the biggest &quot;helping hand&quot; of them all, that of the Government?&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if indeed,

self-reliance and family support ought to be the cornerstone of our welfare

ethic, should we begin to reflect on the realities today?&nbsp; Social trends

seem to be running against our preferred ideal. We are told marriages are weakening,

divorces are rising - thus issues of single parenthood and challenges of

maintenance of children will become a more serious problem.&nbsp; We know

families are getting smaller, and with a graying population, what is the extent

that children and family members can provide or should provide for their

seniors?&nbsp; With stresses of urban living and challenges of globalisation

and economic <p align=left>Column: 356</p>aspirations, family relations seem to be weakening too. At our MPS

cases, I am sure we have seen elderly couples appealing to HDB for rental flats

citing poor relations with their children.&nbsp; If the elderly choose to be

&quot;homeless&quot;, what do we do?&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A case I saw

recently may illustrate the point. A couple are in their 60s. The husband is 66

years old and the wife is 60 years old. They have nine adult children, five of

whom have their own flats. They have received Government subsidies in the form

of two direct purchased flats and have &quot;profited&quot; substantially from

the sale of these flats. The flat they are staying in with one of their

daughters is at risk of being repossessed due to default in mortgage payments.

They have sought help to be given subsidised rental from HDB.&nbsp; As a

society, how do we view such a case? With nine children, five of them having

their&nbsp;own homes, one would accept the value that the children should take

them in. Should the State come in and provide with the subsidised accommodation

if they say relations with their children are strained?&nbsp; What if they were

insistent and choose to squat at Changi Beach?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am not saying that

Singaporeans are abandoning their elderly.&nbsp; There are families out there

who are filial and continue to provide for their elderly parents, against all

odds.&nbsp; Indeed, MCYS' survey in 2005 had shown that, by and large,

Singaporean children are still filial and caring for their elderly.&nbsp;

However, on the ground, we are slowly beginning to see some cracks in the

familial relations. The CDCs have their fair share of stories to tell,

reflecting such trends.&nbsp; Our MPS cases are yet another indication.&nbsp;

Just before me, we heard four heart-breaking stories from Mr Ang Mong

Seng.&nbsp; And in this House, in the past two days, every MP has his own fair

share of stories to tell. These are really living hard cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p align=left>Column: 357</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the question I would

like to raise is for us, as a society, to begin to ask ourselves these

fundamental questions.&nbsp; Who is my brother's keeper? We have to ask

ourselves whether we want to continue to hold on to the ideals or recognise

realities.&nbsp; This will have significant implication on our Government

policies, as representing the voices of the people. The public will also then

have to accept and recognise these realities and their implications.&nbsp; If we

want to hold on to these ideals, what do we do as a society?&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Much has been said about

the need to strengthen the family.&nbsp; In the spirit of taking ownership, I

would like to ask Singaporeans to ask themselves, what have they done to

strengthen their families?&nbsp; What is their commitment to their families and

how have they responded to calls to strengthen their own families? Do they

recognise the importance of the family and want to make their family work? Do

they blame the system or&nbsp;lack of opportunity for work-life balance

resulting in breakdown in their families? Will they ask the Government for more

incentives for them to make their families work? What is their role?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I leave this

House today with these questions in the hope that we begin to ponder and search

within ourselves and understand that whatever we choose as a society, it is

ours.&nbsp; The responsibility to make the society works rests not only in the

hands of those in this Chamber alone but rather, together the collective

interlocking hands of the four million Singaporeans out there. That should be

the social contract between the Government and the people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this Motion of Thanks to our President. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the heading of

the President's Address when he opened this Eleventh Parliament was &quot;A

Competitive Economy, An Inclusive Society&quot;.&nbsp; I am very glad indeed

that the two issues I had in mind to speak on,&nbsp;Singapore as an education

hub and intervention in early childhood education, are relevant to his agenda

in his Address.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in the

President's Address, under the topic of growing Singapore's economy, he said

that to achieve our full potential in this ever-changing environment, we must

be nimble, flexible and alert.&nbsp; In this respect, I do agree with him fully

especially when it concerns growing Singapore as a global education hub. Global

education is a huge and growing industry and is estimated to be worth in the

region of almost US$2.2 trillion. In order to achieve our vision, it is

imperative that we maintain our hard-earned reputation as a provider of quality

education, especially at this early stage.&nbsp; We are currently on course to

achieve our target of 150,000 foreign students by 2015, which will boost the

education sector's GDP contribution from 1.9&nbsp;% to 5 %. Singapore's

attractiveness lies in our competencies in the English language, the provision

of quality education, and a safe and secure environment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Educational opportunities

in Singapore have risen exponentially.&nbsp; The number of private schools in

Singapore grew from 720 in 2003 to 1,100 by end 2005.&nbsp; These 1,100 private

schools cater to about 420,000 local students and 72,000 foreign students.&nbsp;

With this rapid rise in numbers, it is important that we ensure the quality of

our private schools so that both local and foreign students receive quality

education.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p align=left>Column: 359</p><p><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Quality of education</span></i><span

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quality of education

in private educational institutions is an important issue.&nbsp; It has often

been said in local context that in education, quality is everything and that

parents and students only trust the Government's stamp of approval.&nbsp; The

second phrase presents a set of problems. Some private education organisations

have abused the MOE-certified tag to oversell their

credibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to MOE, registration with MOE is not

tantamount to accreditation or endorsement of quality of the private schools or

their teaching staff.&nbsp; It is vital for our Government to set up a national

accreditation body to assess and monitor the quality of private schools here.

The present stance of letting the market decide on quality of private

institutions, even with recent interventions by Spring Singapore and CASE,

leaves much to be desired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensuring reliability

and sustainability of private education in institutions is important.&nbsp; On

average, it would cost each foreign student about $80,000 to $100,000 spread

out over four years to obtain a degree from one of the many private education

institutions here. The recent closure of a few private schools, including the

closure of AIT Academy last year, has affected a good number of students, many

of whom were unable to get refunds.&nbsp; It was a case of too little, too late

for many local and foreign students.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>In addition, an operator was fined for

starting a private school while still an undischarged bankrupt.&nbsp; Apart

from the obvious damage done to both local and foreign students, these events

would have caused significant damage to Singapore's reputation as an education

hub, particularly in the foreign media.&nbsp; More must be done in addition to

what CaseTrust is already doing.&nbsp; More stringent criteria should be in

place for private school registration to prevent similar incidents from

repeating.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The credibility of

student agents is also of great concern.&nbsp; The number of student agents has

increased from about 15 a few years ago to about 100 agencies, including

numerous freelance operators.&nbsp; There are estimates that the student agency

industry is worth about $70 million to $100 million, based on the present

number of foreign students here.&nbsp; Student agents charge between $2,000 and

$8,000 per foreign student.&nbsp; Presently, anyone can be a student agent

without even belonging to a registered company.&nbsp; There is a need for an

accreditation scheme for student agents in order to safeguard foreign students'

interest, especially from rogue agencies.&nbsp; There must be some

standardisation of student agents to ensure reliability and credibility in

school placing, getting visas&nbsp; and accommodation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></i><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'> There are reports suggesting that foreign students

are not adapting as well as believed.&nbsp; Many are homesick and lonely.&nbsp;

Some have lamented that they have no Singaporean friends and have even been

shunned by Singaporeans in general.&nbsp; This is especially so for those in

the private schools.&nbsp; Unlike those in the universities and polytechnics,

there are few programmes or clubs which cater for social activities for foreign

students attending private schools.&nbsp; It will thus be helpful to provide

some avenues so that we can engage them.&nbsp; This will cater to some of their

social needs and, at the same time, provide them with opportunities to integrate

with locals.&nbsp; In our efforts to being generous and gracious hosts, our

attention to detail in this regard may persuade some of them to settle down in

Singapore after graduation.&nbsp; This will complement our aim of attracting

foreign talents.&nbsp; In the very least, this will go a long way in leaving

them with good <p align=left>Column: 361</p>impressions, for them to serve as our goodwill ambassadors back

home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Early intervention for childhood education</span></i><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I totally agree

with the President on the emphasis of an inclusive society in his

Address.&nbsp; Under the topic of building an inclusive society, he said that

education is the best way to level up our society.&nbsp; My second topic is on

early intervention for childhood education, particularly those from

disadvantaged families.&nbsp; There is a greater challenge for children from

lower-income families to participate in the education process.&nbsp; Latest

available figures show that some 5% of each Primary 1 cohort of about 42,000

has not attended pre-school at all.&nbsp; Many of them are, unfortunately, from

the lower-income families.&nbsp; The advantages that children from middle and

higher-income families enjoy make it even more difficult for their counterparts

in the lower-income bracket to catch up.&nbsp; This source of disparity may

contribute to class polarisation in our society.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Longitudinal studies

show that when children begin education at a young age, they do not only do

better in school but also become more productive as adults, and are less likely

to require public assistance.&nbsp; Latest research on brain development also

demonstrates that a child's environment and experience in the earliest years of

life are critical for cognitive, physical, social and emotional development,

and have profound life-long benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parents of

lower-income families may not have the resources and knowledge to provide a

conducive early learning environment for the child.&nbsp; During my

meet-the-people sessions, there were residents who had come with their children

for consultation.&nbsp; Once, I had asked a six-year old child, who came with

<p align=left>Column: 362</p>her father, which kindergarten she was attending.&nbsp; When I found out that

she was not attending any, I asked her father, who told me that the family did

not have the means to do so.&nbsp; On our part, my grassroots members and I

have assisted by placing children like these in neighbouring educational

centres, and have engaged Central Singapore CDC to match their parents with

jobs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greater effort must

be put in to identify similarly disadvantaged families and to assist them, so

that children from these families can be given a chance to compete on equal

terms.&nbsp; I am glad that Education Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam had said

that his Ministry will work with various agencies, including MCYS, to get as

many children as possible into pre-school or kindergarten.&nbsp; I would like

to propose that a sustainable and holistic approach to be adopted by MOE.&nbsp;

A database collection system and follow-up will help those in need of early

intervention.&nbsp; Community involvement and collaboration, especially with

grassroots organisations, have been proven useful for pre-school placing.&nbsp;

Ideally, students from these families could be monitored in their course of

learning, and be provided with assistance should the need arise to keep them in

the right path in their primary and secondary education, thus providing them

with favourable condition for levelling up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A holistic approach

may have to be taken for each family.&nbsp; These families may need varied

assistance in the form of childcare, student care, pre-school education, formal

education, tutoring and mentoring, transport allowance, financial assistance,

books and uniforms.&nbsp; Many of these families may not be aware of the

available assistance to them.&nbsp; In addition, there are some who lack the initiative

and motivation to do so, and others who attribute the lack of financial means

for not sending their children to schools.&nbsp; We need a scheme that is able

to systematically identify these families to ensure <p align=left>Column: 363</p>that no child is deprived

for whatever reason.&nbsp; We must provide the facility and manpower to monitor

and follow up on these children to ensure that assistance is rendered for as

long as required.&nbsp; Current programmes, such as the Early Learning Support

Programme, which is an early intervention initiative to help Primary 1 and 2

pupils at risk of failing in school could and must target neighbourhoods with a

higher concentration of disadvantaged groups.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In these two days,

several of my parliamentary colleagues have raised the concern of dropouts in

school.&nbsp; This has always been my concern and I spoke at length at the last

Budget debate.&nbsp; I gave the possible reasons for our dropouts and suggested

ways on reducing the dropout rates from our schools.&nbsp; I feel strongly that

early intervention in pre-school education is another way of reducing our

school dropouts.&nbsp; The reason is that we target vulnerable children to give

them the head start early, so that they can cope better subsequently in

schools, and thus preventing them to become dropouts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, early learning

programmes and intervention for children from disadvantaged families should be

prioritised.&nbsp; It should be central to a new strategy aimed at closing the

income gap in our society, and to enable those from lower-income groups to

compete on an equal level with those from middle to higher income groups.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in conclusion,

I would like to touch a little on healthcare.&nbsp; The healthcare changes over

the last few years have been on the right track and have been for the

better.&nbsp; One example is the revision of MediShield and the emphasis on

preventive healthcare.&nbsp; MediShield has been revised to give a higher

pay-out to ease the burden on patients with major illnesses.&nbsp; However,

there are&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 364</p>still a few improvements that can be made.&nbsp; There are,

presently, a few hundred thousand Singaporeans who are not covered under

MediShield, and more can be done to reduce this number.&nbsp; In addition,

although MediShield claim limits have recently been increased, it is a

requirement that periodic and regular adjustments to match rising healthcare

costs are made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, on the right

track is the effective 3-M Healthcare Financing System.&nbsp; However, in spite

of the successes of the system, many Singaporeans who are not fully aware of

3-M's coverage continue to live in fear of falling seriously ill and of rising

hospitalisation costs.&nbsp; Increased public education to inform and promote

the 3-M Healthcare Financing System may help reassure Singaporeans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is recent

emphasis for patients with stable chronic illnesses to be cared for in a

community setting rather than in a more expensive hospital setting.&nbsp; This

will better control chronic diseases and thus reduce the dreaded complications

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With greater

concerns over rising healthcare costs, all efforts must be taken in the areas

of disease prevention, preventive healthcare, cost management by public

institutions and the maximisation of resources.&nbsp; Right implementation of

policies with these targets in mind will steer us in the right course.&nbsp; I

concur with the Minister for Health when he said recently that we should avoid

financial incentives and remuneration for medical providers that may work

against the right placement of care.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Chuan (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I speak in support of the <p align=left>Column: 365</p>Motion to

thank the President for his Speech. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am indeed

encouraged by the Government's focus on building an inclusive society, the

promise to leave no one behind and the call to strengthen social

cohesion.&nbsp; However, I notice that the Government has focused on the more

tangible matters of strengthening social cohesion, like investing in education,

skills training and&nbsp;strengthening of social safety nets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I wish to

suggest that another area which can improve social cohesion is the inculcation

of basic character values in Singaporeans.&nbsp; There are many core character

values which I feel that we should encourage and develop so as to become second

nature amongst Singaporeans.&nbsp; These values, like kindness, consideration

for others, being grateful and being humble are universal in nature.&nbsp; But

for some reason or other, they seem to be lacking in Singaporeans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime back, I

read in the <i>Straits Times</i> a letter to the Forum provocatively titled

&quot;Must Singaporeans behave like pigs?&quot;&nbsp; The letter contained an observation

by an Australian about the behaviour of Singaporeans.&nbsp; Although the writer

of the letter, Mr Martin Goh, tried to prove his Australian friend wrong about

the behaviour of Singaporeans, eventually, he conceded and he admitted defeat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Goh

wrote&nbsp;his observations about Singaporeans who rushed into trains without

giving way, about Singaporeans who did not give up their seats to a mother

caring a child, about Singaporeans rushing to take lifts, about Singaporeans

rushing for table space during lunch, and about the litter left on the table by

Singaporeans.&nbsp; The letter struck a raw nerve in me.&nbsp; Instinctively, I

felt indignant and upset.&nbsp; I challenged the writer and his Australian

friend mentally&nbsp; -&nbsp; who are you to pass such judgments on Singaporeans

<p align=left>Column: 366</p>and to call us pigs?&nbsp; But on reflection, I realised that there was some

truth in what the writer had described about the behaviour of

Singaporeans.&nbsp; For the record, I disagree with the use of the word

&quot;pigs&quot;.&nbsp; In fact, in the very next week, a few other writers

joined in the Forum discussion, and quite a few of them concurred that indeed

there were several occasions when the behaviour of Singaporeans was found

wanting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am concerned about this lack of social grace amongst Singaporeans.&nbsp;

Perhaps a better description is the lack of consideration.&nbsp; Time and

again, in the local newspaper, there are daily comments about the poor or

boorish behaviour<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><!-- Begin CDATA tag --><!-- End CDATA tag --><!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag --><!--MP_NAME:-->&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>of Singaporeans, and many of us would have

witnessed this poor behaviour one time or another in our daily life.&nbsp; I

once had an accident in Malaysia along the North-South highway.&nbsp; Within

moments, a few Malaysian vehicles stopped to offer their help.&nbsp; I am not

sure in Singapore, if you had an accident, would&nbsp;any vehicle within a

short moment of time&nbsp;stop to help.&nbsp; Maybe they would.&nbsp; But, more

likely, they will be there to see your vehicle number so that they can buy

4D.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is not just

social grace that is lacking.&nbsp; There seems to be a lack of civility, a

lack of consideration, a lack of tolerance amongst Singaporeans.&nbsp; We are

quick to complain and quick to demand for our rights.&nbsp; If we were to fall,

and no one comes to our help, we are quick to contempt others for their lack of

care.&nbsp; But, yet, if we see others fall, many of us are also slow to

stretch out our hands to help others.&nbsp; To me, this lack of social grace

reflects on the poor character development of Singaporeans.&nbsp; In fact, like

what Dr Maliki said, sometimes I think we have become a nation of complainants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past five

years, perhaps due to the poor economic outlook and&nbsp;the intensity of

economic development, we have lost sight of what is important to us <p align=left>Column: 367</p>in

life.&nbsp; In 1996, the then Prime Minister and now Senior Minister, Mr Goh

Chok Tong, highlighted the need for Singaporeans to be a more gracious society

by the 21st century.&nbsp; We are into the tenth year since that speech.&nbsp;

Have we really become a more gracious society?&nbsp; Maybe, when we go overseas

for humanitarian assistance.&nbsp; But back in Singapore, in our daily lives,

how do we fare?&nbsp; Judging from daily critical reports in the newspapers, I

fear we are not doing well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel that for

Singapore to develop as a more gracious society, we have to continually exhort

our citizens to rise to the occasion.&nbsp; We have to continually focus on the

fundamental values which would be good for Singaporeans to possess.&nbsp; After

all, what makes a country great is not just the laws of the country; it is not

just the efficiency of the system; it is not just the meritocracy nor the

beautiful buildings. But what makes Singapore great is the people of Singapore

and the values of its citizens.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have to remind

Singaporeans to be kinder, to be grateful to others, to be more considerate, to

be humble, and to constantly be an encourager of our fellow citizens.&nbsp; In

July this year, at the Victoria School's 130th anniversary cum official opening

ceremony, the guest-of-honour made a speech where he spoke of the need to be

kind and grateful.&nbsp; I felt it was a good reminder and I quote part of his

speech as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President Nathan,

the guest-of-honour, said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;First, I ask

all of you whatever you do in your lives, be kind towards others.&nbsp; Always

find the time and space to do good for the community.&nbsp; Your actions and efforts

may not make the news headlines nor make you a household name, but every single

effort counts towards making Singapore being recognised by others for

humanitarian concerns.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p align=left>Column: 368</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Next, he said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Be grateful.

Cultivate what someone called the discipline of gratitude.&nbsp; Be grateful to

your family, teachers, friends, neighbours and those who make your life better,

and make you a better person.&nbsp; It is easy to ask what other people can do

for us, but it is more difficult to ask how we can do more for others.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if we can make

kindness and gratefulness part of our daily mantra in our lives, I believe that

Singaporeans will become a better and more gracious society.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Sir, I turn to the

other values which I feel could be improved upon in Singapore.&nbsp; One of

them is to be considerate to our fellow Singaporeans.&nbsp; The Christians have

it in the golden rule, which is: do unto others what you have them do unto

you.&nbsp; And this is similar to Confucius saying of &quot;do not do unto

others what you&nbsp;do not want others do unto you&quot;.&nbsp; As a simple

illustration, if you do not want others to block you when you are coming out

from the MRT train exit, then do not block others when you are trying to enter

the train.&nbsp; If you want the table at the hawker centre to be clean, then

do not leave chicken bones and used tissue on the same table.&nbsp; If every

Singaporean can be a bit more considerate towards their fellow Singaporeans,

then life will become more pleasant and social bonds amongst your neighbours

will become stronger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another value which

I feel that we can improve upon is that of being humble.&nbsp; Many people have

spoken about how elitist Singaporeans have become.&nbsp; And this is especially

so because of the way we segregate those students who have done well in their

academic studies from a young age.&nbsp; In short, once you are identified as

being a gifted student, a scholar material, you are set apart from the others

and put on a fast track so that you can be groomed to excel.&nbsp; Invariably,

there is this sense that these people who <p align=left>Column: 369</p>have been earmarked to become

scholars are amongst the best of the best, the so-called elite.&nbsp;

Unfortunately, this same system has also created a barrier amongst those who

are considered the elite and those who are not.&nbsp; Mr Sin Boon Ann called

them &quot;farmers&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is thus important for

us to remind those Singaporeans who have done well in their lives that we must

remain humble.&nbsp; It does not matter that you have become richer.&nbsp; It

does not matter that you have become more successful or that you have reached

high positions in your life.&nbsp; We must not be arrogant but we must remain

humble in our outlook in life.&nbsp; Recently, Prof. Lee Wei Leng wrote an

opinion piece in the newspaper in which she opined that a super elitist system

may not necessarily be good for society as a whole.&nbsp; I share her

sentiments.&nbsp; In fact, I would say that if our schools produce a top

student with many &quot;As&quot; but who lacks humility and apathy for his

fellow students, then the schools would have failed in their role as an

educator as they have failed in building up the students.&nbsp; A student who

thinks that he has obtained a scholarship because he is super intelligent and

does not attribute his scholarship to his parents, his friends and his teachers

should not get the scholarship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Sir, I

would like the Government to look into how we can promote the virtue of being

an encourager.&nbsp; We should constantly look for ways and means to encourage

those who have done well in any part of their lives.&nbsp; A kind word, a boost

to the morale, would go a long way towards making life more pleasant for

everyone.&nbsp; For those who are down, we should look for ways to tell them to

keep their chins up, that it is not the end of the world, that there is light

at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp; Each time I read in the newspaper about someone

who has committed suicide, I felt terribly sad and I <p align=left>Column: 370</p>asked myself -&nbsp;if

only someone had taken the time and the effort to give some comforting words to

lift up the weak, some words of encouragement to that person, to be kind to

that person, to show compassion - would it have made a difference to that

person, would it have prevented the suicide?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the

lack of social graces, the lack of that amount of basic character values will

not augur well for us as a nation and for us as Singaporeans.&nbsp; We should

not allow our rush to excel in our careers,&nbsp;to become richer or to become

more influential affect these values as they will affect the social

cohesion.&nbsp; The Government can set the tone in its policies and we too, as

MPs, as leaders of the country,&nbsp; can make it our policy that we will

strive to be kinder, more grateful, humble, considerate, and that we will be an

encourager of our fellow Singaporeans.&nbsp; If we can get more and more Singaporeans

to adopt&nbsp; and practise these values in their daily lives, I am certain

that social cohesion will be much strengthened and we would be able to make

Singapore a country that Singaporeans can be proud of and Singaporeans will

love.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel privileged to

points highlighted in the President's Address.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I ponder on the

common threads of discussion that I had from my house-to-<p align=left>Column: 371</p>house visits, dialogue

sessions, meet-the-people sessions, the key theme that keeps coming back to me

is what does it mean to be Singaporeans and why is Singapore home.&nbsp; This

relates to the point that President Nathan highlighted on the need to build an

inclusive society and that every citizen must contribute to our shared

well-being. To this point, I would like to touch on the Singapore identity and

belonging and what I term &quot;home&quot; and &quot;hope&quot;.&nbsp; In order

to have an inclusive society and one that every citizen feels committed to

contribute for the well-being of fellow Singaporeans, there really needs to be

a strong sense of identity and belonging where we as citizens are not just

intellectually but also emotionally engaged in policies, practices and goals of

the country.&nbsp; This Singapore identity is something, I believe, which is

still elusive, and that we as a nation are grappling with.&nbsp; There seems to

be this underlying cry for hope and, if I dare say, dream.&nbsp; And what do I

mean?&nbsp; It is not that residents I meet say to me, &quot;Give me

hope&quot;, or &quot;Help me make Singapore home&quot;. Rather, what I have

heard is, life is hard, work hours are long, it is very competitive, cost of

living is high, the list goes on.&nbsp; These grouses are not unique to

Singapore.&nbsp; But why is that Singaporeans seem to complain more about

that?&nbsp; It can be attributed in part to the size of our country and the

high dependency on the global economy.&nbsp; But I think it goes beyond.&nbsp; There

is really a continuum of Singaporean view on the subject. There are those that

regard Singapore as their home and see hope for a future for themselves and

their families, and we need to get them involved and engaged and enable them to

contribute to the Singapore Dream and enable them to also continue the

Singapore Dream. Then there are those who want to make Singapore home and who

are looking for hope but are finding it difficult to do so.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Is

it because of a perception gap or communication or execution of policies?&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p align=left>Column: 372</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read recently in <i>The</i>

<i>Economist</i> in a special report in June this year on the inequality in

America and core to the American dream as cited is the hope that if you work

hard,&nbsp;you can succeed, regardless of the strata of society that you are

in, and that you can ride the tide and the tide of growth will lift many

boats.&nbsp; However, it also cited that since year 2000, this hope however

seems to be dampening as the tide seems to be lifting fewer

boats.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same scenario in Singapore where although we have

strong economic growth, it seems to be benefiting a small group whilst

squeezing the large numbers in the middle and widening the gap between those at

the top and the bottom.&nbsp; The point of income distribution and the widening

gap is an important one.&nbsp; But I will not be discussing it today as this

has been well elaborated by my colleagues who have spoken before me.&nbsp;

Instead, I would like to highlight another area which I feel needs to be

addressed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of us will

agree that Singapore, as a society, has a very high degree of efficiency and,

to that end, that quest for efficiency has resulted in flawless execution and

implementation.&nbsp; In some sense, people may feel that the focus on the

process and efficiency has led to the loss of the focus on the

individuals.&nbsp; Minister Raymond Lim, in his comments in the recent review

of the Singapore Land Transport policy, made an important point, and I quote:

&quot;The transport system must be planned and built to benefit people movement

rather than vehicle movement.&nbsp; The two are related but not the same.&nbsp;

Understanding the difference is critical if we want&nbsp;a system that meets

the needs of the users.&quot;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an increasingly global

competitive economy, one cannot argue that economic growth is fundamental to

Singapore's continued success.&nbsp; We must make every <p align=left>Column: 373</p>effort to embrace the

necessary changes and continue to generate economic growth.&nbsp; But as

President Nathan has said in his Address, Singapore is poised for success but

now stands at a turning point.&nbsp; With globalisation and as our population

ages, we must adapt.&nbsp; But how we respond to globalisation and address the

challenges of our ageing population will shape the future of Singapore.&nbsp; I

believe that a subtle but important focus must be that of ensuring that we do

not forget people. Singapore is known for characteristics, such as being green,

clean, efficient, disciplined, reliable, of high quality and dynamic.&nbsp;

While we continue to work on the branding of Singapore, as a trusted and

reliable place for investment and business, making every effort to attract

foreign talent, we must also continue to pay attention to our local talent and

what Singapore branding means for us.&nbsp; This is important if we are to

build a sense of belonging, identity and enthuse the desire to stay and to

build Singapore's future.&nbsp; Paradoxically, the best ambassadors to attract

talent and to sell the Singapore brand are Singaporeans who have a strong

identity and pride in Singapore and are able to consistently project

that.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One area of policy

change required is the need to increase our foreign talent and migration as

Singapore's current population is small and replacement rates will limit our

ability to support economic growth for our future.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;not an

easy policy change as it brings with it fears and competition and other social

integration concerns.&nbsp; How we manage this and how our citizens understand

the importance of foreign talent while addressing their fears and concerns will

determine our future success, not only to attract foreign talent but to retain

and to grow local talent.&nbsp; The question in the minds of many Singaporeans,

at least those that I have met through my engagement<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Singapore count on me when the moment of truth is here?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Economic success is

necessary but insufficient as an ingredient for long-term identity and why

Singapore is home for us.&nbsp; If economic success is the only criterion, our

people will just leave Singapore and go wherever economic opportunities present

themselves. &nbsp;I am not just referring to those physically residing in

Singapore, but Singaporean overseas as well.&nbsp; What will make Singaporeans

stay or come back? Or why would a foreigner give up his citizenship somewhere

else in the world to be a Singaporean?&nbsp; It has got to be that Singapore

offers them and their families not only economic opportunities and success, but

a place where they feel that they can make an impact and a place that, being

Singaporean, makes a difference to them.&nbsp; This is what one of our founding

fathers, the late Mr Rajaratnam,&nbsp;so aptly said, being Singaporean is not a

matter of ancestry but of conviction and choice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During a

recent&nbsp;house-to-house visit, one of my residents said to me when I met

with him and his wife, &quot;I don't mean to complain.&nbsp;[He was really

apologetic about this.]&nbsp; I must say that the Government is good, but the

policies are bad.&nbsp;And I feel like a second-class citizen.&quot;&nbsp;

Although I do not agree with him that our national policies are bad, the fact

remains that he still feels this way.&nbsp; Ironically, the very policies that

are meant to support Singapore's future and viability are instilling in some a

sense of uncertainty and fear, for example,&nbsp;attraction of foreign

talent,&nbsp;development of new high technology industries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the

intellectual understanding and imperative of our national policies, many are

finding it hard to fully accept the impact of these policies.&nbsp; There are

some who will disagree with me on&nbsp;my focus on these areas&nbsp;as&nbsp;we

look at it from <p align=left>Column: 375</p>a very practical point of view and some can say, &quot;Change

is required and we must just bite the bullet and drive the transition, live the

reality and the situation.&quot;&nbsp; I differ on this point.&nbsp;Study has

shown that the critical success factor for sustainable change and acceptance

must take into account the impact of change on the various stakeholders and

ensure that there is a strong communication plan and an action to address the

transition pain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this, we

need to create an environment that Singaporeans feel that their views matter

and that they can make a difference in the areas of their lives that are

important to them.&nbsp; We must nurture an environment where people feel that

their differing views are heard and where they will also accept that there will

be views that are different from theirs and hence greater acceptance for

differing approaches to achieving our outcome.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the role of

government.&nbsp; As countries develop and as conditions for people in

countries improve,&nbsp;expectations generally are higher and governments take

on additional responsibilities to provide for citizens.&nbsp; To this point, it

also does take control from the citizens and therefore raises a sense of risk,

and the citizens actually feel this heightened sense of risk.&nbsp; We are in a

dilemma.&nbsp; We want the Government to do more but, at the same time, we feel

that we are not in control.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we feel that we have a lesser

say and hence demand more from the Government. This becomes a vicious cycle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings to mind

an analogy of the umbrella.&nbsp; When you provide an umbrella, some may view

it as shelter and be grateful for it.&nbsp; Others may say this is blocking

their view.&nbsp; The challenge is therefore how do you strike a balance.&nbsp;

To give hope, we must involve Singaporeans from the cynics to the sceptics, to

the converted.&nbsp; Take, for example, the recent reaction to the preview of

our P65 MPs <p align=left>Column: 376</p>making a special appearance for the coming <i>Chingay</i> &nbsp;

procession.&nbsp; Some of my colleagues are already smiling.&nbsp; We have from

violent criticisms, surprise, to encouragement from all walks of life and from

young and old.&nbsp; And I do not think it is because of our dancing

skills&nbsp;or&nbsp;lack&nbsp;of dancing skills. But what I have learned from

the incident is that Singaporeans actually care about how and what their MPs

do.&nbsp; But we must be prepared to take both positive comments

and&nbsp;criticisms as these help with better understanding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically, the

reaction to our hip-hop is an example of the&nbsp;importance of how we

engage.&nbsp; Even as post-65 MPs want to engage the young, we are also

learning that we must be cognizant of the fact that there is a broad spectrum

of concerns and needs, and it is not a homogeneous group.&nbsp;At the end of

the day, the very things that have made Singapore successful are sometimes

taken for granted because it is so much a part of our life, for example,

multi-racialism and meritocracy.&nbsp; I feel that this is the very fabric of

being Singaporean, albeit a very subtle one. This is not easy to be replicated

or transportable globally and make Singapore unique.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is these very

values that give me hope and why I consider Singapore home. Yes, I like

the&nbsp;efficiency and effectiveness of Singapore and the fact that things

work here and I hope we will never&nbsp;slacken in that aspect. But what I hold

special and value for myself and my children in Singapore is the knowledge that

they will have the opportunity to participate and succeed in Singapore.&nbsp;

An important vehicle of this is education which I have benefited myself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am heartened to

see also the recent developments in our education system to further encourage

and focus on diversity.&nbsp; Although I am a firm believer that we are authors

of our destinies and success, our chances of success are stronger and the

<p align=left>Column: 377</p>journey a lot more enjoyable when we have hope and encouragement.&nbsp; So let

me share with you my experience -&nbsp;please indulge me&nbsp;on this - on

running. I have been a member of this running group for about two years now,

and it does baffle me every time I think about it, how all the members in this

group make it a point every Sunday morning, week after week, to get up early to

meet at 6.30 in the morning to run.&nbsp; Why do we keep at it?&nbsp; Apart

from the fact that we all do enjoy running, the very camaraderie and the

support that the running group provides is what keeps us going.&nbsp; I must

confess that the reward of a good breakfast after that is also the other

incentive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are all of

different&nbsp;fitness levels, age and running ability and, if I may say,

shapes and sizes as well.&nbsp; We have folks that walk, others who walk and

run, and there are those who are really strong runners.&nbsp; However, our end

goal is the same - to complete the run and to reach the end

point.&nbsp;&nbsp;An important point to note is that every person needs to do

the run himself.&nbsp; The motivation and the support of the group however

provide a key element that keeps folks running week after week and, in fact,

has helped members of the group improve on their running skills. We have folks

like me who have never run more than&nbsp;four kilometres before I joined this

group being able to&nbsp;complete the marathon this year.&nbsp; There are

others, who barely could run the 10 kilometres, now completing the half

marathon in about two hours.&nbsp; What is interesting is that it does not stop

there.&nbsp; I have noticed that each member of the team continues to improve

in&nbsp;his performance over time. And for myself, although I do not have the

speed, what I found is that I now find the run a lot easier and more

enjoyable.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The point I am

making here is that&nbsp;in our pursuit&nbsp;for Singapore's future, <p align=left>Column: 378</p>providing

an environment where individuals identify, not only with the goals, but are

able to participate and to run their own race,&nbsp;this will help build an

inclusive society that we are striving for.&nbsp; Put it simply, we should have

an environment where people feel that they can be themselves, run their own

race and still be successful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am glad to see in the

Addendum to the President's Address the emphasis on better inter-agency cooperation

in the public service to provide more rounded policies as agencies strive to

work more closely together to tackle complex issues.&nbsp; While the

whole-of-government approach is critical to addressing issues more coherently

for individuals and businesses, I feel that more can be done to ensure that we

do not forget the very people these policies are meant to support.&nbsp; I will

give you a very simple example.&nbsp; I had feedback from someone recently

trying to register her business.&nbsp; It was great that the various

agencies&nbsp; provided her the ability to go online to register her

business.&nbsp; However, she proceeded to go online to register.&nbsp; She was

prompted that she had to apply for a business licence from another agency

before she could complete the business registration.&nbsp; She then went to the

other agency's website&nbsp;to submit her application via the online business

licensing service.&nbsp; As she proceeded, she was then prompted that she

needed to provide her registration or RGB No. which was what she had originally

been attempting to obtain.&nbsp; So you can imagine her frustration as she was

now stuck on both online applications requiring&nbsp;input from each other in

order to complete her registration online.&nbsp; While I am glad to say that

-&nbsp;I did ask her and she said, &quot;Yes, I set up my business.&quot;

-&nbsp;it took a lot of follow-up, emails and phone calls before she got the

matter resolved.&nbsp; So a person with less perseverance would have given

up.&nbsp; The whole-of-government approach would definitely have made a

difference to her in this experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p align=left>Column: 379</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I recently went

online myself to try out this experience.&nbsp;I am also very glad to say that

it is already put into practice because what I saw was an announcement in that

same website, informing online users that they can now proceed with either of

the applications without worrying&nbsp;about the dependency between the two

agencies and processes.&nbsp; So what has changed?&nbsp; The announcement

actually explains why.&nbsp; It says, &quot;The changes have been made because

applicants have often been puzzled when they read the fields required for the

application.&quot;&nbsp; And I applaud the agency for taking the feedback and

acting on it, as they have now allowed users to skip the fields of where these

gaps existed.&nbsp; So it is a good example of this one Government approach and

meeting the original intent of the online service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to

just say&nbsp;that service should be a way of life for us, and not a campaign

or a transaction.&nbsp; This will make a big difference to the experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, in concluding,

I would say, stay the course but&nbsp;remember that people are the core of

Singapore's future.&nbsp; As many have pointed out, Singapore is an improbable

nation.&nbsp; Our success as a nation is&nbsp;the result of the will of

people.&nbsp; Therefore, keeping the will of people alive and strong will

determine the success and the future of this nation.&nbsp; We should be bold

and willing to compete with the best in the world.&nbsp; This will not change

overnight.&nbsp; But it is important that we stay the course and continue to

encourage active&nbsp;citizenry and participation grounded &nbsp;in our

fundamental values of&nbsp;multi-racialism and meritocracy.&nbsp; In order to

achieve the vision of an inclusive society and every Singaporean contributing

to the success of Singapore, we need to ensure that we do not forget the very

people that we are trying to serve.&nbsp; This is a subtle difference but an

important one as we strive to build the Singapore identity to give hope to

those who choose to make <p align=left>Column: 380</p>this little red dot home and to continue on the

journey to building Singapore's future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that,&nbsp;Sir,

I support the motion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Tan, but I believe I can try to speak as fast, if not faster than her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to add to the chorus in support of the motion of thanks moved by Mdm

Halimah Yacob, MP for Jurong GRC.&nbsp; The President has envisaged an

inclusive Singaporean society which leaves no one behind even as the economy

grows.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First and foremost,

I would like to applaud MCYS and all the other Ministries involved for having

contributed largely to our community, especially towards our less privileged

fellow Singaporeans. The Ministry believes that the 'many helping hands'

offered by the people, the private and the public sectors provide a safety net

for those in need.&nbsp; Yes, I believe so myself that our actions and

decisions make a difference in the lives of those who are, to some extent,

dependent on us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, allow me to

bring us back in time to 2002, when the speech by Dr Balakrishnan, the Minister

of State for National Development, left a long-lasting impression on me.&nbsp;

He mentioned the increased income disparities and the issue of what we can do for

those who are falling behind.&nbsp; He also talked about the social safety nets

to catch people who fall.&nbsp; He asked at what stage could people convert a

safety net into a trampoline that has an inherent spring in it that the people

can use to bounce back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, my

concern today is for those in need, the people who are, in <p align=left>Column: 381</p>some ways, dependent

on us, the people who are helplessly falling behind - my&nbsp;concern is for

our people with physical disabilities.&nbsp; I&nbsp;would like to ask: can we,

instead of a safety net, provide a trampoline with an inherent spring in it for

the disabled so that they could bounce like the rest of us? In addition, can

this spring in the trampoline that we provide have its elasticity sustained for

the people with disabilities, who need our support and understanding to lead as

normal a life as possible?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To address these

concerns, we need to look into what we have and what we are doing now for

people with disabilities.&nbsp; More importantly, we need to look at how else

we could improve to better the lives of these people who live by our support.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at what we

have and what we are doing for our people with disabilities, I wish to commend

the efforts of our Ministries for working hand in hand to provide assistance

schemes in various areas for those in need.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to years

before, we currently have many assistance schemes to help Singaporeans with

disabilities to acquire education and employment.&nbsp; Just to name a few, we

have the ComCare EnAble fund, education bursary, student care fee assistance

scheme and the taxi subsidy scheme.&nbsp; In addition, there are three recent

initiatives that are worth mentioning:&nbsp; Firstly, HDB's commitment to build

all its new flats with disabled and elderly-friendly features.&nbsp; Secondly,

the Ministry of Transport's announcement to roll out 150 wheelchair accessible

buses this year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><!-- Begin CDATA tag --><!-- End CDATA tag --><!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag --><!--MP_NAME:-->&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Thirdly, the $520,000 Government fund,

Engaging Persons with Disabilities in Employment, is a worthwhile movement that

should be sustained.&nbsp; This fund will be disbursed over the next two years

to help firms redesign workplace to make it disabled-friendly, thereby enabling

<p align=left>Column: 382</p>more people with disabilities to join the workforce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these

initiatives and efforts are noteworthy, and are great examples of our

Government's action plan for an inclusive society.&nbsp; However, as we never

rest on our laurels to improve ourselves to becoming the world's best seaport

and airport or to achieve first-class quality and service, we cannot be

complacent with our efforts in supporting our fellow Singaporeans with

disabilities.&nbsp; With the President calling for an inclusive society that

leaves no one behind, we need to set higher expectations as we rally the

country to achieve the vision of a first-world nation.&nbsp; We do not want to

be known as a first-world nation with&nbsp;third-world assistance and welfare

for our less fortunate fellow citizens.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we have well

covered various areas to assist our people with disabilities, we need to look

across the board on the depth of each area.&nbsp; Are we providing enough in

each area to help those who are in need?&nbsp; Can we do more in each area to

assist these people, in terms of their financial needs,&nbsp;accessibilities

and&nbsp;rights in the society?&nbsp; I believe we can.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the number

of disabled persons due to congenital birth defects and other preventable

diseases has decreased over the past decades due to our excellent healthcare

system, it is a well-known fact that by 2030, one in every five persons in

Singapore will be above the age of 60.&nbsp; Interestingly, statistics have

also shown that as people age, their chances of developing some form

of&nbsp;mobility problem are as high as 33%.&nbsp; By simple arithmetic, this

will work out to about 300,000 affected Singaporeans.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, with an ageing

population, the challenges faced by the elderly and the physically-challenged

will merge and aggravate.&nbsp; We need to dedicate adequate provisions of

policies and resources to the <p align=left>Column: 383</p>disabled community in order to prepare for the

challenges that would be faced by the elderly in the years to come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As mentioned

earlier, we have numerous services and programmes to assist our people with

disabilities.&nbsp; These services and programmes are carried out by many VWOs,

with the support of MCYS.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>With these various agencies and social

enterprises, many people with disabilities in Singapore receive assistance in

their daily lives in terms of activities and financially.&nbsp; Nonetheless,

how can we ensure that every individual with disabilities receives the help and

support that they need?&nbsp; While we now adopt the &quot;many helping

hands&quot; approach, with many-doors-open-and-no-wrong-door policy, can we

again reconsider the feasibility of a one-stop umbrella body focusing on the

people with special needs so that they know the common one door to knock on for

any assistance they require?&nbsp; This is in line with one of the key

proposals by the parents' workgroup on enhancing the financial needs of persons

with special needs led by MP Denise Phua.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Australia, there

is &quot;Centrelink&quot;, a government agency that delivers a range of

services to the Australian community.&nbsp; Australians can turn to Centrelink

for any assistance relating to human services, including disability support

pension and connections to other disability support agencies.&nbsp; Australians

who are in need only need to knock on one door to receive support from many

other agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;We could adopt such a policy to provide our less

privileged fellow Singaporeans the one open door that would lead them to receiving

support from &quot;many helping hands&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, this will

mean that we become more involved and responsible for the assistance provided

to our people with disabilities.&nbsp; To mild this effect, we could look into

encouraging more caregivers to assist the individual disabled person.&nbsp;

<p align=left>Column: 384</p>However, we do recognise that not every person with disabilities has family

members who are able to care and support them.&nbsp; Some are without any

family members to start with, while others have family members who need their jobs

to support other members of the family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the high

standards of living in Singapore, most of us need a regular paying job to

support our families and ourselves.&nbsp; It is probably not practical anymore

to rely just on volunteers to care for those with disabilities.&nbsp; At this

point, I am suggesting that we, like in the United Kingdom, adopt the

caregiver's allowance.&nbsp; The caregiver's allowance is not only limited to

the family members, but anyone who is spending a reasonable amount of time to

look after the disabled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the United

Kingdom, the caregiver would receive a weekly allowance of about 47 pounds when

he spends over 35 hours a week, ie, five hours a day, to take care of a person

with disabilities.&nbsp; This is a fair implementation as these caregivers

spend time, care and money to assist the disabled individuals.&nbsp; In Osaka

City, Japan, caregivers are paid an allowance of 100,000 yen a year for providing

nursing care to the elderly family members.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we know, many

caring individuals out there, some&nbsp;who are retired, are looking after the

non-related people with disabilities out of their own pockets.&nbsp; With the

caregiver's allowance, we would offer these caregivers greater means to reach

out to more people who are in need of their time and attention.&nbsp; I believe

such a policy could also suggest an alternative part-time work to some.&nbsp; I

also believe active participation in such community services would help to nurture

and mould a better character of Singaporeans, especially the young.&nbsp; Of

course, we need to determine the acceptable criteria to be eligible for such

allowances, and the allowance need not be a hefty payout.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p align=left>Column: 385</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I also wish to

highlight that while there are already plans to improve the barrier-free

accessibility in communities and in&nbsp;public transportation as mentioned

earlier, their implementation takes time, even years, to be completed.&nbsp;

For example, the expectation for buildings in Orchard Road and Shenton Way to

become disabled-friendly stretches out to five years.&nbsp; Also, with a ratio

of 150 wheelchair-accessible buses to over 2,700 buses it owns, it will

probably take another five to 10 years before SBS Transit could provide the wheelchair-accessible

features in all its buses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every effort must be

put into ensuring an integrated system of barrier-free accessibility, one that

links from point A to point B, without any intervening obstacles.&nbsp; There

is&nbsp;no point in having wheelchair accessible buses if the surrounding

environment is not barrier-free.&nbsp; The challenge now is to upgrade and

build the rest of the transport system and transport infrastructure, such as

bus shelters, taxi stands and roads, to be accessible and compatible simultaneously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this period,

while we look forward to better living and accessibilities for the people with

disabilities, they continue to be sentenced to imprisonment in their own

homes.&nbsp; Are we able to do more for these people during this period?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;

As we incorporate new projects in this area, I think we could also relook at

our current regulations and make appropriate changes to accommodate more

innovative policies and schemes to enhance the current lives of our people with

disabilities.&nbsp; A good example of innovation is the wheelchair gap enabler,

an affordable innovative device jointly developed by the SPD and NTU School of

Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.&nbsp; It is easily retrofitted onto any

standard wheelchair and it allows the wheelchair user to cross gaps up to 30 cm

wide, such as small drains.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p align=left>Column: 386</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was an

interesting article published in&nbsp;<i>The New Paper</i> on 26th October 2006

about a middle-aged gentleman who was born with a deformed right hand.&nbsp; He

sought help from Bizlink four years ago.&nbsp; The job hunt was not successful,

not only because of his disability but also his age.&nbsp; Some years ago, he

went for a job interview as a cleaner, together with 15 other applicants of all

ages.&nbsp; The employer looked at his hands and asked if he was up to

it.&nbsp; He replied that he could use his left hand to mop and sweep.&nbsp; In

the end, the entire group was hired except him.&nbsp; The thought of seeking

financial aid did not cross his mind.&nbsp; He said, &quot;If I can work and

support myself, why ask for help?&quot;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, to

help our people with disabilities to be self-reliant and more independent,

first, we may need to allow them the same opportunities that the others in the

society are entitled to.&nbsp; Like in many countries, people with disabilities

in Singapore should be entitled to the human rights of persons with

disabilities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interestingly,

Singapore has remained one of the few countries in the world not to adopt some

form of legislation for the disabled population.&nbsp; Many neighbouring

countries and the Western world have a Disability Act that spells out policies

in key areas, such as education, employment, welfare support, accessibility and

transport, for the disabled.&nbsp; By including in the &quot;disabilities

rights&quot; that employers cannot deny an individual with disabilities of a

job as long as he or she is capable of performing the standard responsibilities

of the job requirements will certainly help to open more job opportunities for

these people.&nbsp; While such a policy may stir some commotion at its initial

implementation amongst those in the employer market, we are heeding the

President's vision of an all-inclusive society for all Singaporeans.&nbsp;

There is a need to have a change in mindset and behaviour.&nbsp; If these are

what <p align=left>Column: 387</p>it takes to ensure fair and open opportunities amongst every individual in

the society, we, as regulators, need to initiate policies to uphold such a

system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said all

that, what is equally important is our &quot;mental accessibility&quot;, our

attitude to accommodate the physically-disabled.&nbsp; A story is told about a

soldier who was finally coming home after having fought in the Vietnam

war.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He called his

parents from San Francisco:&nbsp; &quot;Mum and dad, I am coming home, but I

have a favour to ask.&nbsp; I have a friend I would like to bring home with

me.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure&quot;, they replied.&nbsp; &quot;We would love

to meet him.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;There is something you should know&quot;, the

son continued.&nbsp; &quot;He was hurt pretty badly in the fighting.&nbsp; He

stepped on a land mine and lost an arm and a leg.&nbsp; He has nowhere else to

go, and I want him to come live with us.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I am sorry to hear

that, son.&nbsp; Maybe we can help him find somewhere else to live.&quot;&nbsp;

&quot;No, mum and dad, I want him to live with us.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Son,&quot;

said the father, &quot;you do not know what you are asking.&nbsp; Someone with

such a handicap would be a terrible burden on us.&nbsp; We have our own lives

to live, and we cannot let something like this interfere with our lives.&nbsp;

I think you should just come home and forget about this guy.&nbsp; He will find

a way to live on his own.&quot;&nbsp; At that point, the son hung up the

phone.&nbsp; The parents heard nothing more from him.&nbsp; A few days later,

however, they received a call from the San Francisco police.&nbsp; Their son

had died after falling from a building, they were told. &nbsp;The police believed

it was suicide.&nbsp; The grief-stricken parents flew to San Francisco and were

taken to the city morgue to identify the body of their son.&nbsp; They

recognised him but, to their horror, they also discovered something they did

not know.&nbsp; Their son had only one arm and one leg.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parents in this

story are like many of us.&nbsp; We find it easy to work and relate <p align=left>Column: 388</p>to people

who are normal and able-bodied, and there is a tendency to discriminate and

shunt away from people who are &quot;different&quot; from us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, we

need to cultivate in the minds of our people to be compassionate towards the

minority of our society with disabilities.&nbsp; The public has to realise and

accept that the physically-disabled and, similarly, the elderly, have equal

rights to public transportation, education, employment and other basic

necessities.&nbsp; As the President has mentioned, we need to urge our better

off Singaporeans to help the less well off fellow citizens.&nbsp; We need to

ensure that our people and our future leaders are imparted with the right

values towards humanity in their mindset.&nbsp; The responsibility of making

Singapore an inclusive society does not fall squarely in the hands of the

Government&nbsp;alone.&nbsp; To really build an inclusive and gracious society,

we must involve the people, the private sector and certainly the people with

disability, to all work in unison.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To conclude, I wish

to reiterate that, as we strive forward together towards being a secure,

prosperous and inclusive society, we need to unite as one Singapore, to put our

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his Address, the

President outlined the challenges that globalisation poses today in creating an

income divide within societies.&nbsp; He added that &quot;while most

Singaporeans will benefit from the opportunities that globalisation brings,

some segments of our population are finding it more difficult to

cope.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; He called for Singapore to respond boldly to this

challenge, as a nation divided by wealth would create undesirable effects on

our social cohesion that we have painstakingly cultivated during the last 41

years of nation-building.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is on this

note that the focus of my speech hinges upon, and by bridging this divide,

Singapore would be a more inclusive society that leaves no one <p align=left>Column: 390</p>behind.&nbsp; If

I may, Sir, let me divide my speech into two areas - one through &quot;people

investment&quot; and the other &quot;physical development of

Singapore&quot;.&nbsp; But first, please allow me to dwell on my brief

experiences as a first-time Member of Parliament, my perspectives on this issue

through the eyes of my constituents.&nbsp;However, before I proceed with my

speech in English, let me say a few words in Malay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>In Malay</i>):&nbsp;[<i>For

vernacular speech, please refer to&nbsp;<a

href="/search/search/download?value=PDFs/2006/20061109/20061109VS_151455.pdf">Appendix A</a>*.</i>

]&nbsp;Sir, along with the other communities, the Malay community has

showed&nbsp;good progress in the past 41 years.&nbsp; However, we have to work

hard to make further progress in this trend of&nbsp; globalisation.&nbsp; Along

with the Government and the other people of Singapore, we have to give

opportunities and a wide avenue or platform for those who can and have the

ability to achieve success.<br>

With globalisation, there will be sections of our community who will be left

behind and face difficulties in achieving success.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his speech,

President Nathan has called upon us to work together to achieve success and

face the challenges of globalisation.&nbsp; In this speech, I will present two

issues which are related to Singapore's development in future. The first issue

would be on people investment and, secondly, on the physical development of the

country.&nbsp; I will continue my speech now in English.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>In English</i>):&nbsp; A report from Merril Lynch

- Capgemini found that 1.5% of adult Singaporeans have assets exceeding US$1

million. The report added that our country's concentration of the wealthy is

far higher than global. With the Integrated Resorts and our quest to be a

vibrant global city poised to position Singapore in the forefront of the race

to attract greater foreign investments and capital flows, the percentage of the

wealthy is likely to increase in the coming years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p align=left>Column: 391</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, Sir, during my

meet-the-people sessions, walkabouts and block visits, I often meet a segment

of my residents humbling themselves to seek financial assistance and emotional

support.&nbsp; These are the humble yet hardworking and resilient people, ever

wanting to contribute to the development and progress of Singapore.&nbsp;

Further probing and understanding of the demographics of my constituents showed

that a segment of them, as the President has highlighted in his Address, are

grappling to manage the effects of globalisation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my earnestness to

alleviate their sorrows by disbursing the funds and schemes from the recent

initiatives of the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports, such as

the ComCare Fund and the Public Transport Fund, from SMRT and ComfortDelgro, I

often asked myself what we could do more to make a difference in the long run

to stem a greater widening of the current income gap.&nbsp; However, how could

I, as a professional and an academic, together with other Singaporeans,

contribute to this process of bridging this divide?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, examining the

data on migrating trends and economic development in a global city like London,

one could observe the high rate of internal migration in the United Kingdom as

people seek greener pastures when they face an economic downturn.&nbsp; Having

a large land mass and the availability of many alternative cities within the

United Kingdom provides more options for the residents of London to move and

search for greener pastures elsewhere.&nbsp; However, Singapore's spatial

constraints may pose a great challenge for the lower segment of the

society.&nbsp; This places greater responsibility on us - Singaporeans and the

Government -&nbsp;to work together and implement effective policies to ensure

that this segment of our population would benefit from our nation's

success.&nbsp; However, having grown in this unique land of Singapore, I am

<p align=left>Column: 392</p>confident that Singaporeans will be able to address this issue together and in

an uniquely Singapore way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>People development</span></i><span

style='font-size:13.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, I fully

support the President's call for investing in our future.&nbsp; The call to

level up Singaporeans through education is a proven long-term approach, but I

believe what we need in the intermediate term are increased investments in

people development.&nbsp;Although a portion of our funds for the needy is still

needed in providing relief for those with financial difficulties, we should

continue providing opportunities for the unemployed to become self-employed,

such as opening up small businesses and enterprises.&nbsp; An example would be

to further enhance our effort to create opportunities for seed start-ups and

allowing small businesses to grow in the HDB heartlands. We should consider

fine-tuning our urban planning and licensing parameters to provide a conducive

environment for such efforts to take off. This would provide favourable

conditions for local businesses to spring up, empowering our people to be

self-reliant, self-employed individuals, especially those who lost their jobs

or have reached an age difficult to start new careers.&nbsp; However, to avoid

misuse and mismanagement of these funds, sound regulatory measures should be

put in place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, I believe,

would be more relevant for this group of Singaporeans.&nbsp; While the

Micro-Loan Programme by Spring Singapore offers up to $50,000 for small

business set-ups, its criteria and application process may not be that friendly

to the poor and uneducated.&nbsp; I wonder if we could develop or fine-tune an

existing scheme that meets the needs of the uneducated with talents and skills

to set up small scale&nbsp;1-2 man family enterprises.&nbsp; I believe we, as a

society, should provide opportunities for those who have the <p align=left>Column: 393</p>potential to make

it, but do not have the means, such that those who can follow the tide should

be given the chance to dive into the deep ocean.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, one of the

greatest gifts we could give to our children is education.&nbsp; However, in

facing the challenges of globalisation and information age, there is still a

need for some re-definition and re-interpretation of this role.&nbsp; I am

pleased to note that this is signified in the efforts of the Ministry of

Education's &quot;teach less, learn more&quot;, which aims to engage our

learners and prepare them for life.&nbsp; I understand that this initiative to

re-define the way teaching methodologies are taught in schools&nbsp;is widely

practised with encouraging results today. There is also now greater focus on

character development and the inculcation of social emotional skills.&nbsp;

Twinning programmes with overseas schools have also exposed our young with the

experiences to better understand and relate to their peers from the region.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, it is

important to note that our young are growing up to the challenges of a new

generation with different sets of values. As such, there is still a need for

schools to continue inculcating our shared values so that our young would have

a firm resolution of mission and responsibility for their country, are

sensitive and tolerant to the needs of a multi-racial and religious citizenry

and a sense of compassion for others.&nbsp; At the same time, this would also

serve as a form of social defence for our nation and inevitably, put our young

in a good state to face the challenges ahead.&nbsp; It is my hope, however,

that these initiatives would be cascaded effectively to our schools with our

fully internalising its intent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, to support the

Ministry of Education's efforts, the community could <p align=left>Column: 394</p>also invest in programmes

that fully utilise the local infrastructure, such as care centres, study

corners and sports halls, for the young to study and discover their talents in

a safe, secure and nurturing environment.&nbsp; For example, in my Division, a

youth network has been set up to provide a platform for stakeholders within the

Division to initiate programmes to engage the young.&nbsp; Besides investing in

the development of skills and academic ability, I feel that we should also

invest in projects and programmes that aim to fully unlock the vicious cycle of

poverty that these people face and provide a longer term solution to their

problems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as part of

being an inclusive society, we should continue to engage the elderly,

especially those who are still economically active. We should recognise this

segment of our population who have contributed much to our nation-building

process.&nbsp; We should encourage a holistic approach in elderly engagement

and management in providing our elderly with a platform to be more engaged with

the community through forums that discuss on elderly issues, networking

sessions and job placement programmes for the economically active. At the same

time, we should try our best to provide an environment that promotes a

meaningful and well-deserved retirement for our elderly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides investing in

our people, the task ahead of us is to continue to search, in partnership with

the community and Government, for new forms of responses to problems of the

ever complex and changing world.&nbsp; In bridging the income divide, I believe

that the physical development of our nation is just also as crucial a process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I would like to

applaud the Ministry of National Development's recent <p align=left>Column: 395</p>plans to remake our city

skyline. The efforts to rejuvenate and re-transform the Orchard Road and Marina

Bay areas would give both tourists and Singaporeans a more wholesome

environment and experience, thus allowing Singapore, the &quot;red dot&quot; on

the map, to shine even brighter.&nbsp; The above could be summarised in the

words of Minister Mah Bow Tan, who I quote, &quot;to make Singapore a home for

our people and a global city of distinction&quot;.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I would

like to share with the House my observations of a growing difference in the

transformation of the development landscape, taking place within the prime

areas of the city, its periphery and those of the old heartland&nbsp;estates in

the suburban areas.&nbsp; To date, the Ministry of National Development has

also in place masterplans to transform the heartlands to improve the quality of

life and increase the equity value of these areas so that no segment of our

society is left behind.&nbsp; The Ministry of National Development's Addendum

also outlines plans to renew and rejuvenate our HDB estates to improve on our

first-class living environment.&nbsp; But in developing the heartlands, I

believe we must also go beyond the various upgrading projects like IUP, MUP and

LUP.&nbsp; While older and mature estates in the suburban areas have its

charms, bigger unit per flat space and great food outlets, I believe a holistic

estate renewal process would certainly enhance its attractiveness.&nbsp; This

would call for greater efforts in injecting life and creating identity in areas

such as streets, parks and shopping malls as well as retail stores so that the

landscape could be further enhanced and is relevant to the residents of various

social demographics.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A recent study which

involved discussions amongst youths by a group of NUS undergraduates reflected

some of the prevailing sentiments and aspirations of our youths for shopping

scenes in Singapore and the heartlands.&nbsp; The <p align=left>Column: 396</p>majority of the youths who

participated in the discussion felt that the retail landscape in the heartlands

as relatively homogeneous in terms of its tenant mix and identity.&nbsp; They

called for greater attractive facades and more unique architecture in the

design of malls as well as creating greater variety and identity in the

heartlands, thus inferring a need to remake the heartlands and add vibrancy to

it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, it is with

great passion, I stress, that in order to remake this city of ours and attract

talents here, a more wholesome development and marketing of both the urban and

heartland areas are needed.&nbsp; This would make our HDB estates a

distinctively unique feature, attractive enough for tourists to visit during

their stay here.&nbsp; In a recent interview by <i>Pioneer</i> magazine, Kaira

Gong,&nbsp;a young local singer who had spent some time overseas mentioned, and

I quote, &quot;I feel that the HDB is a very unique aspect of Singapore because

other countries do not have high-rise residences where people live so closely

together.&quot;&nbsp; In fact, I received similar feedback from many fellow

Singaporeans and foreign delegates who had the experiences of visiting our

heartlands.&nbsp; In fact, many foreigners often suggested to me that we should

have the Travel Card Pass system,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>like those in Europe, to encourage tourists

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the uniquely

Singaporean culture culminated with a strong communal spirit in a vibrant

heartland landscape is showcased, I believe we would become a greater

attraction to tourists to visit.&nbsp; This would also improve the local

economy and contribute to the wealth of the people, especially in the older

heartlands.&nbsp; Other effects would include greater increase in the value of

property, and this would subtly increase the asset wealth of residents in these

areas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p align=left>Column: 397</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the call for a

greater estate renewal process is imperative in suburban older estates like

mine.&nbsp; I observe a growing trend of young people leaving for newer

estates.&nbsp; Most of the youths I spoke to felt that the developments in the

former are not fast enough to meet their needs and aspirations.&nbsp; During my

block visits, residents often asked when lift upgrading would come and what

other developments are&nbsp;taking place in the neighbourhood, as they had

hoped that upgrading would enhance their accessibility and quality of

life.&nbsp; In addition, the elderly constituents also look forward for more

diverse composition of residents in the estate.&nbsp; I am pleased to note that

the Ministry of National Development's Addendum stated plans that will enhance

the living environment in the HDB estates to foster vibrant and cohesive

communities.&nbsp; This point is supported by the Ministry of Law's Addendum

which will devise new schemes and innovative mechanisms to let out State land

to promote the development of a vibrant cityscape and revitalisation of our

neighbourhoods.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another noticeable

trend from my meet-the-people sessions is that downgrading and searching for

HDB rental flats seems to be a popular decision when residents face financial

difficulties.&nbsp; These residents come from a range of categories, such as

single parents, single working adults, low-income families, and those affected

by a sudden financial crisis.&nbsp; However, many are caught unprepared in the

web of committing themselves to long-term loans when they downgrade and this

adds on to their financial burdens.&nbsp; Perhaps we could consider policies

that would reduce their financial burdens, enhance their financial prudence,

increase their disposable income after paying for housing loans and still

having some savings in their CPF for their retirement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p align=left>Column: 398</p><p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, if I may, the

above are sufficient calls for us to continue to look for more real estate

ownership options to meet the ever changing needs of our society.&nbsp; For

example, we should look for more housing options, be it short-term or long-term

alternatives, that would alleviate the suffering of the low income.&nbsp; In

the long run, Singapore would be a more forgiving and flexible society through

policies that allow people to recover from failures or out of the poverty

cycle.&nbsp; I say all these not to challenge or call for amendments to

existing policies but to find new forms of responses to problems that have

arisen from the ever complex and changing new world that have caused an income

<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Speaker, Sir, the

President in his Address mentioned that the people have given us a strong

mandate to take them forward.&nbsp; The real work has long begun for us to find

ways to make new connections, to join the ongoing dialogue with our electors to

realise their aspirations and dreams.&nbsp; Despite the challenges ahead, I

believe we will stand united as one people of different races living in

harmony.&nbsp; I believe our people will continue to work hard to succeed and

prosper together in the years ahead, making this red dot, in the words of

Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, &quot;brighter, redder&quot;, a gracious and

inclusive society for all.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On that note, I

support the motion and I thank the House in earnest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
