FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B> &nbsp;Many MPs have filed questions on the recent power failures. The power failure on 29th June, in particular, caused great inconvenience to many Singaporeans and harmed our international reputation. The Economic Development Board (EDB) has reported serious negative comments from our existing and potential investors. We take a very serious view of such power failures, and will do everything possible to minimise the possibility of their recurrence.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, power failures can occur because of two major factors: first,&nbsp;due to a disruption of the generating facilities; and second, due to a disruption at the transmission or distribution grid level.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with each of these two scenarios in turn.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The power failure on 29th June 2004 was caused by a disruption in the&nbsp;gas supply from the Natuna gas pipeline.&nbsp; This led to a sudden loss of about 30% of online generation capacity and a blackout that lasted up to one hour and 50 minutes. 300,000 customer accounts were affected. The supply disruption was traced to a defective pressure regulating valve in the onshore gas receiving facility (or ORF) operated by ConocoPhillips at Jurong Island. The valve malfunctioned because the solenoid, which is an electrical device that controls its movements, was water-logged and short circuited.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pressure regulating valve first malfunctioned at 9.56 pm that night, and this was&nbsp;followed eight minutes later by a total closure of the emergency shutdown valve at 10.04 pm. The generation companies were alerted at their premises that<p align=left>Column: 175<p> the gas pressure at the ORF was dropping. When the emergency shutdown valve closes, the gas plants are supposed to&nbsp;"hotswitch" to their backup fuel (in this case, diesel), without affecting the continuity of electricity supply. Unfortunately, on that night, only one of the six gas plants in operation successfully made that &nbsp;"hotswitch".&nbsp; Two gas plants failed because of a problem with their diesel filter.&nbsp; And the other three ran out of gas before completing the "hotswitch" process. This resulted in the widespread power blackout that occurred at about 10.10 pm that night.</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just go through some of the findings and the immediate follow-up actions that the Energy Market Authority (EMA) has been engaged in since.&nbsp; As the emergency shutdown valve was not initially triggered, it was not immediately obvious at that point in time that&nbsp;"hotswitching" should have been commenced straightaway&nbsp;since, in such circumstances, some mild pressure fluctuations are part and parcel of&nbsp;a normal system.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;the unanticipated abnormal behaviour of the valve system at the ORF misled the operators that night. In retrospect, we now know that critical time was lost arising from this. EMA has instructed the generation companies to change their standard operating procedures&nbsp;so that they "hotswitch" earlier in the event of any pressure drop. The generation companies are also exploring ways to shorten the "hotswitching" process further.&nbsp; In addition, they have also stepped up maintenance of the diesel pump system, and will do "hotswitch" drills more frequently.&nbsp; I want to emphasise that we are talking about a response that takes a few minutes.&nbsp; They have to make this "hotswitch" between four and 12 minutes.&nbsp; And in the case of the failure that night, events occurred <p align=left>Column: 176<p>very quickly between 9.56 pm and 10.04 pm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me move on now to the valve system at the ConocoPhillips facility.&nbsp; This system, unfortunately,&nbsp;has failed on five separate occasions for five different reasons since August 2002. I think Members of this House will agree that this is clearly not&nbsp;acceptable. EMA has instructed ConocoPhillips to do a comprehensive technical re-evaluation of its system design and operations, including&nbsp;maintenance and operational procedures. It must submit&nbsp;its report to EMA within three months. Furthermore, EMA will bring ConocoPhillips under licensing control by the end of the year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to address concerns expressed by many that we are apparently relying too much on a single source of fuel. Today, we have a good balance of steam plants using fuel oil and gas plants generating electricity. About 60% of our installed capacity consists of steam plants and 40% comes from&nbsp;gas plants. Fuel oil for the steam plants is available from multiple sources. For gas plants, the backup is diesel, which is also widely available. Every power station is required to stockpile at least 90 days&nbsp;of fuel reserves, with at least 45 days worth&nbsp;of these reserves&nbsp;being&nbsp;kept on site. Overall, our total supply capacity is almost twice our peak demand. In short, we can actually operate without gas indefinitely if we have to, albeit at a slightly higher price.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EMA is exploring with the generation companies how to&nbsp;back-up gas from dual sources for operational continuity. These dual pipeline feeds&nbsp;will give power stations those precious extra minutes&nbsp;to make a successful "hotswitch".&nbsp; In addition, EMA is also studying the feasibility of having compressed gas storage. This would, in effect, provide another additional source of redundancy.&nbsp; Over the longer term, we are also<p align=left>Column: 177<p> exploring the possibility of&nbsp;Singapore&nbsp;having a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility. We will be conducting a feasibility study, and if the findings are positive, the LNG facility should be operational soon after 2010.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now touch on the second group of power failures due to grid infrastructure and accidents at worksites.&nbsp; Other power failures may be caused by faults within the grid infrastructure or damage to electricity cables.&nbsp; For instance, on 13th April 2004, a cable fault developed at the Choa Chu Kang substation, which caused a blackout that lasted about 60 minutes and affected 80,000 customer accounts. On 2nd July 2004, electricity supply to 28 HDB blocks at Pasir Ris was interrupted for about 30 minutes, and this was due to a&nbsp;tripping of substation equipment during a testing of the remote control equipment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our power infrastructure must have top class standards of reliability. This requires continual investment and maintenance of equipment. EMA will be imposing higher standards on all the companies involved in this entire system.&nbsp; These companies&nbsp;will have to meet these stringent standards or face financial penalties of up to $2 million for each performance failure. These changes will take effect from 1st August 2004. EMA will release details of these shortly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Warren Lee has&nbsp;asked how often construction accidents caused damage to major electrical cables. In 2003, there were 15 such incidents. Since 2001, 21 contractors have been brought to court, of which 12 have been fined and nine cases are pending. Errant contractors found guilty by the court can be fined up to $1 million.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Khor has asked whether adequate measures have been taken to ensure that we minimise the risks of sabotage of our gas and utility supply by terrorists. I <p align=left>Column: 178<p>would like to emphasise that the recent power outages were not due to terrorist sabotage. Nevertheless, under our law, power stations and major transmission substations are gazetted as protected areas. Security measures were reviewed and augmented after the September 11 incident. There are tight access control, vehicle road barriers and armed guards at critical installations. Security patrols and surveillance are undertaken round the clock to reduce the likelihood of sabotage and intrusion.&nbsp; We will continue to be vigilant and will take all necessary actions to safeguard such critical infrastructure.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I would like to announce that the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) will be setting up a high-level Energy System Review Committee, which will include international experts, to take a fresh look at our electricity and gas systems in totality and recommend how we can improve them further. This will ensure that our systems are sufficiently robust against accident or disaster.</p></span></div>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a very important topic of much public interest.&nbsp; I have a few questions, and&nbsp; I shall be brief.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard the Minister of State say that the penalties will be increased up to $2 million.&nbsp; For parties that are found responsible for causing major blackouts where&nbsp;the fallout and the damages could be very high, should the Government not consider imposing higher penalties than $2 million, so as to serve as a deterrent?&nbsp; Also, should&nbsp;further higher penalties be imposed for repeat offenders?&nbsp; In the case of the ConocoPhillips, I just heard that it was the fifth time that it has caused a blackout.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question is this.&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain instances where there is a commercial arrangement between, say, ConocoPhillips and SembGas, I was told that the<p align=left>Column: 179<p> Government has no power to control such commercial arrangements.&nbsp; Is it true, and if it is true, would the law be amended to allow the Government to have more powers to monitor and&nbsp;control the market, and find out the causes for the blackout?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third&nbsp;question is whether the Government actually has a central&nbsp;body or authority with the expert knowledge to constantly review various alternative sources for gas or oil, and even for other forms of energy like solar or&nbsp;tidal, so that we can have more sources for our supply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, during a blackout, many people made phone calls and the phone line was jammed, especially the important lines like 999 and 995.&nbsp; Should the Government not consider setting up another line, for example, 911 - sorry for the pun, but it is a number which is very easy to remember - for the public to call on such emergencies, not fire or police matters but national emergencies like a blackout, so that people get information and know what is happening?</p></span></div>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</B>:&nbsp; I thank the Member for his supplementary questions.&nbsp; The first issue is on penalties.&nbsp; There is an escalating scale of penalties.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a company repeatedly fails in achieving the required standards, the cumulative penalties will exceed $2 million,&nbsp;just by adding it up.&nbsp; But having said that, it is not just a matter of penalties imposed by EMA.&nbsp; Do not forget that</p></span></div>		          <!-- Begin CDATA tag --></div>   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

The next point is about jurisdiction over commercial operators.&nbsp; That is partly the reason why we have decided to bring ConocoPhillips facility under our licensing <p align=left>Column: 180<p>requirements, to give us more regulatory teeth to ensure that all players in the energy system perform their roles according to specifications.&nbsp; As far as having a&nbsp;Government agency to oversee energy, we have the Energy Market Authority which has the experts to keep an eye&nbsp;on&nbsp;the entire energy system, including alternative sources of supply, new technology changes and, in turn, EMA is supervised by the Ministry of Trade and Industry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final point is on information flow.&nbsp; I do not believe having another line will solve it because that other line will also become clogged with everyone calling in.&nbsp; I think the most practical means of information flow during emergencies like that would be to use the radio and, in particular, battery-operated radios which will work in almost all circumstances, and to ask the public to make phone calls to emergency services only if they actually need it, and not just to make phone calls to seek more information.&nbsp; Of course, we understand that these are times when there will be high anxiety and the authorities,&nbsp;EMA and everyone will be scrambling to do two things, ie,&nbsp;to fix the problem immediately&nbsp;and also&nbsp;to push the information out to the public.&nbsp; So I hope the public will cooperate in times like these and use more passive ways of information retrieval which will not clog up the telephone lines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Tan Soo Khoon (East Coast):</B>&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, I have several questions for the Minister of State.&nbsp; First of all, are we not making ourselves vulnerable by just depending on one sole supply of gas?&nbsp; Do we have a back-up plan for alternative supply of gas?&nbsp; In fact, more pointedly, I would like to ask why is it that we have never thought of a back-up plan although we had several cases of power failures in the last two years.&nbsp; Why have we not thought of such a back-up plan long ago so as to avoid a systemic failure like the one we experienced on&nbsp;29th&nbsp;June?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 181<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the next point I would like to raise is the question of damage which has been caused to a lot of electronic equipment.&nbsp; In fact, a very angry constituent of mine told me that during the failure on&nbsp;29th June, his TV set was badly damaged and he had to pay $200 to get it repaired, and he asked me if this keeps happening, who is going to be responsible.&nbsp; So my question is, while it is very well to have increasing penalties imposed on the power supply companies -&nbsp;but this money goes to the Government -&nbsp;could not somebody, whether the power companies or the Energy Market Authority, be made responsible in some way or other for the damage that is being caused to equipment which is owned by consumers and&nbsp; Singaporeans at large?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span></div>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</B>:&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, we do not have only a single supplier of gas.&nbsp; There are three pipelines bringing in natural gas to Singapore -&nbsp;one from&nbsp;Natunas, another one from Asamera, and the third one&nbsp;comes from Peninsular Malaysia and lands at Senoko.&nbsp; Having said that,&nbsp;his question is a valid question, ie, what is the&nbsp;back-up when, for any reason, the gas fails?&nbsp; As I explained earlier in my answer, the back-up in such circumstances is for our gas plants to switch to diesel of which we have more than adequate reserve stocks of, and for which we can replenish from multiple sources.&nbsp; The problem on that particular day was that the "hotswitch" process failed in five out of six gas plants.&nbsp; If the "hotswitch" process had not failed and, in fact, this occurred in December 2002 when, despite disruption of gas supply, the gas plants made a successful transition on to the back-up field.&nbsp; The result of that is that, I think, practically all Singaporeans were not even aware that there was a problem with the gas supply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I want to emphasise that there is a back-up, and it&nbsp;uses diesel as a back-up.&nbsp; But having said that,&nbsp;his next question then should be, is there anything else we <p align=left>Column: 182<p>can do to further harden the system.&nbsp;Our answer to that is yes, and we are working on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we have been encouraging the generation companies to do so.&nbsp; They,&nbsp;in fact, on their own initiative, have now gone on to have dual pipelines, ie, each company will have two feeds of natural gas.&nbsp; In addition to that, exploring whether we should have&nbsp;on-site or even off-site storage of compressed natural gas gives us another back-up plan and&nbsp;ultimately, of course, would be to consider&nbsp;even LNG, which then immediately increases our potential&nbsp;suppliers of gas.&nbsp; So I want to just reiterate that we have both immediate, short-term and long-term plans to back-up this essential infrastructure.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the question&nbsp;about damage to TV sets,&nbsp;my understanding is that several people noticed some discoloration&nbsp;on their TV screens after the power was restored.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been informed by the technical people involved &nbsp;that this was due to problems with the degausser within the TV set coming back on when it was still warm, and that the fix for it really was to switch off the TV set and disconnect it, and let it cool down for an hour or two.&nbsp; This is what&nbsp;most people did and most people would by now have realised&nbsp;their TV sets are working fine.&nbsp; But having said that, I recognise that there are some people who may have sustained more long-term damage to their equipment.&nbsp; I believe that, as far as consequential damage to the equipment is concerned, this becomes a legal issue, a contractual issue, which, if they wish to pursue, they can take upon on their own volition.&nbsp; But the Government and EMA cannot warrant that all equipment will never be damaged by any incident,&nbsp;accident or problem like this.</p></span></div>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Minister of State, in his reply, says that Singapore's international reputation is seriously affected.&nbsp; I would like to know how serious it is.&nbsp; Does this mean that it<p align=left>Column: 183<p> will affect foreign direct investments in Singapore?&nbsp; And what is the Government's plan to mitigate the situation?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir,&nbsp;the second question is on ConocoPhillips.&nbsp;I would like to know on what consideration has the Government given the contract to ConocoPhillips to control the supply of gas to Singapore,&nbsp;why has&nbsp;the Government not considered it necessary to bring the company under the licensing requirement earlier, and what is the relationship of the company with&nbsp;our GLCs.&nbsp; Is it a GLC by itself?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My third question is a follow-up from the answer from the Minister of State.&nbsp; He says that there is a back-up plan, but the back-up plan has not worked or failed.&nbsp; My question is: has the back-up plan been tried before?&nbsp;&nbsp;Or was it just a back-up plan and it has never been tried to see whether it&nbsp;works?&nbsp; If it had been tried before,&nbsp;why has it failed&nbsp;this time?</p></span></div>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B>&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, damage to the reputation is difficult to quantify in exact terms.&nbsp; So I cannot give&nbsp;him a dollar amount.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will this affect investors' confidence in us or attractiveness&nbsp;as&nbsp;a destination?&nbsp; I think the answer to that is that if we do not show&nbsp;resolve and we do not show that we have got a clear and proper plan to fix the problems, then we will really reap the bitter harvest of this.&nbsp; So our approach has been to identify what was wrong and to take all immediate steps to fix operational problems on the ground, and to look at the system, harden the system, build back-up to back-up plans, if need be&nbsp;and, ultimately, to restore confidence on both the part of locals as well as investors who depend on a stable and reliable electricity supply.&nbsp; I think it will be pointless to try to calculate the dollar sums for&nbsp;the damage to the reputation that we have incurred.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 184<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ConocoPhillips is a commercial company.&nbsp; It has commercial arrangements with the gas suppliers and with the generators that take gas from it.&nbsp; The Government is not involved in it.&nbsp; Has the back-up plan been tried before?&nbsp; The answer is yes.&nbsp; As I alluded to it earlier, in December 2002, despite the valve system at ConocoPhillips failing, the back-up plan kicked in and the generation companies successfully made that transition to diesel, and there was no power disruption.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it failed this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, what our take-home point now is that we need to harden the back-up plan further.&nbsp; And as I have said earlier, by resetting the SOP, so you react earlier, and you reduce your gas consumption at an earlier point in time so that there is more gas left in the system.&nbsp; You make sure that all&nbsp;the ancillary equipment needed to "hotswitch" the diesel pumps, filters, and all that, are working, and that your people are practised.&nbsp; The power companies' mandatory practice or drill was once every three months.&nbsp; But if we actually look at the records, they were actually doing it much more often than that.&nbsp; I have personally gone down&nbsp;to a power station and seen with my own eyes that the people are well-trained and they know what to do.&nbsp; But in all these situations, when something really does go wrong, it is often a series of small problems which added up and ended in a catastrophic situation, like what we experienced on&nbsp;29th&nbsp;June.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will it happen again?&nbsp; I can tell you quite categorically that&nbsp;if the same sequence of events on 29th&nbsp;June, ie, the problem with the valve, occurred today, it would not lead to a blackout.&nbsp; But that is with the advantage of hindsight.&nbsp; In retrospect, we know where the problems are and we will fix them.&nbsp; What we are focused on now is to prospectively look at the system and harden it further.&nbsp; I think we will certainly get better with time, but our target ultimately must be one in which the possibility of failure is infinitely small.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 185<p> It can never be zero&nbsp;and, even if it fails,&nbsp;the impact would be minimised.</p></span></div>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Mr R Ravindran (Marine Parade)</B>:&nbsp; Sir, I recollect when there was a major blackout in the USA, a&nbsp;question was raised in this House as to whether we could have such a blackout, and I do remember the answer was that it should not happen in Singapore.&nbsp; It has happened, and I am very sad, and I would like to ask three questions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly,&nbsp;will the Ministry be looking within the Ministry and the regulators of the industry to see whether there were some incompetent decisions made and whether&nbsp;there was complacency among some of these key scenario planners or regulators?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, when a major blackout happens in Malaysia, they are able to tap into our grid and take electricity supply immediately.&nbsp; In the instance when we had a blackout, why were we not able to tap into the neighbouring country's electricity grid and at least get some supply of electricity from the country?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, many people were affected by this blackout.&nbsp; Not only were consumers&nbsp;affected, but a lot of companies were also affected.&nbsp; Could we have in place a body which could, in a way, look at the claims of these people who were affected by such a&nbsp;blackout and&nbsp;try to see whether we could consider&nbsp;giving damages or compensation for various losses or damages suffered by both consumers and the companies involved?</p></span></div>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</B>:&nbsp; During the on-going investigation by EMA, and indeed<p align=left>Column: 187<p> subsequently by the Energy System Review Committee, if we discover any incompetence, negligence or, as you have alluded to, complacency, the Government will take action.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second question was on our inter-connection to Malaysia.&nbsp; There is an inter-connection between the Singapore and Malaysian electricity systems.&nbsp; But this pipeline, so to speak, is basically meant to assist in load balancing for small degrees of fluctuation.&nbsp; On a night when you lose 30% of the capacity, this inter-connect must shut down, and the reason it must shut down is that, otherwise, you will get a sequential collapse of whole regions and, possibly, even extending across countries.&nbsp; So, Malaysia does not want to have a blackout because we have a problem, nor do we want to have a blackout in Singapore because of a sudden catastrophic failure in Malaysia.&nbsp; So, although there is an inter-connect, it is not designed to respond to losses of 30%, as what we experienced on 29th June 2004.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third point on whether we should have a body to award damages, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am very reluctant to go down that route.&nbsp; I would rather focus on making sure our system is as robust as possible, and that the impact of such&nbsp;failures is minimised.&nbsp; Over and above that, if companies wish to pursue their legal options or&nbsp;exercise their contractual rights, I think they are free to do so and to go down the legal route.</p></span></div>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Lily Neo (Jalan Besar)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But among the answers given were that we also carried out regular exercises in Singapore to check the integrity of our electrical system.&nbsp; When was the last check done before this recent major blackout?&nbsp; If the audit of the system did reveal any weaknesses, or the scenarios<p align=left>Column: 189<p> that Mr Ravindran talked about, could it have helped us prevent this last blackout?</p></span></div>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan</B>:&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot give a detailed answer as to exactly when the last system-wide test was performed.&nbsp; But last night I was going through the records of the "hotswitching" drills that the companies had gone through and, within the month of June itself, there was at least one company which had done it twice.&nbsp; So, it is not for lack of going through the drill, and it is not for lack of education or training on the part of the operators.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I just want to say that on the 29th&nbsp;June, it was a hitherto unexpected and unanticipated problem.&nbsp; If it had been a simple shutdown of the emergency valve or a repeat of incidents which occurred in 2002, we would not have experienced this blackout.&nbsp; Instead, we had a pressure valve malfunctioning, first closing and then suddenly opening, overcoming the back-up system, and then the emergency shutdown valve having to kick in because of safety concerns.&nbsp; In that space of eight minutes, we lost precious time, and that precious time then cost us the ability to "hotswitch" in time before the gas ran out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, I am not offering this as an excuse.&nbsp; I am just offering an explanation for what went wrong.&nbsp; It was an unanticipated sequence of events.&nbsp; But we can fix this, and we intend to fix this.&nbsp; If we look at our plans both in the short and long-term, we will have additional back-up measures, additional robustness within our system, and I think we will all emerge ultimately stronger for this experience.</p></span></div>					<!--MP_NAME:Mr Deputy Speaker--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Prof. Ho Peng Kee--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee</B>:&nbsp; Sir, emergency preparedness is the joint<p align=left>Column: 191<p> responsibility of the Government and Singaporeans.&nbsp; The Government has undertaken many outreach programmes, as part of Total Defence, to educate and train the public on how to cope with various emergencies, including blackouts.&nbsp; These include the island-wide distribution of the Civil Defence Emergency Handbook, Exercise Community Spirit and Emergency Preparedness Day events, and the Community Emergency Preparedness Programme.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure community emergency preparedness, the SCDF has strongly advised all households in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> to stock up essential household items, such as portable battery-operated radios, torchlights, candles, matches and first-aid kits.&nbsp; As we all know, these items will come in useful in any emergency, including blackouts.&nbsp; As they can be easily bought in neighbourhood shops, there is no need for the Government to issue them to all households.&nbsp; Sir, I take this opportunity to remind&nbsp;Singaporeans who have yet to do so, to stock up on these common and essential items, as they should take emergency preparedness seriously.&nbsp; Having these items in hand will enable them to cope with emergencies.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, today, all public housing lifts are equipped with an Automatic Rescue Device (ARD) that will bring the lift car to the next lift landing and open its door in the event of a power cut-off.&nbsp; Proper maintenance is essential to ensure that the ARD works as designed, so that there is no lift entrapment.&nbsp; This is the responsibility of Town Councils and management corporations.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if members of the public come across persons trapped in lifts, it is not advisable for them to attempt any lift rescue on their own.&nbsp; As they are not familiar with the lift systems and do not have the proper equipment, they may<p align=left>Column: 192<p> pose a threat to the safety of the trapped persons and, indeed, to&nbsp;themselves.&nbsp; Instead, anyone who knows of persons being trapped in lifts should call the Emergency Maintenance Service Unit (EMSU) that is engaged by the Town Councils or management corporations to attend to such situations. &nbsp;Those who are trapped should not try to force open the lift door or the ceiling hatch, as such escape attempts may result in fatal accidents. &nbsp;Instead, they should remain calm and wait for the arrival of response crews.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, as for the police and SCDF hotlines, as Dr Balakrishnan has said, these are not public information hotlines.&nbsp; They are meant for the public to call when they are facing life-threatening situations or are in real need of emergency ambulance assistance.&nbsp; When a blackout occurs, the public should turn on their battery-operated or car radios for information, as radio broadcasts will be the most effective means for the public to obtain up-to-date information on the blackout. &nbsp;Hence, really, one key lesson from the recent blackout is for all Singaporean households to have ready for use, battery-operated radios, as part of emergency preparedness efforts.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me assure Dr Ong that the police has sound contingency plans in place to maintain law and order and to ensure smooth flow of traffic during a blackout.&nbsp; In essence, resources are redeployed to enhance police presence in affected locations.&nbsp; In a prolonged and extensive island-wide power failure, additional resources will be mobilised from off-duty teams.&nbsp; Police operations will not be compromised in a prolonged power failure, as its critical installations and facilities have backup power supply for operational continuity.&nbsp; Police officers are also equipped with torchlights and searchlights in their vehicles, so that they can carry out their duties even during a power failure.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 193<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for traffic control at major junctions during a power failure, what police does is to deploy its officers to direct and manage traffic.&nbsp; Our public radio stations will also be given prompt and regular traffic updates to keep the motoring public informed of the road situation.&nbsp; These measures, including the release of public advisories through the media, were carried out in the recent incidents of power failure.&nbsp; Nonetheless, motorists should take special care to drive or ride safely and be considerate to other road users during blackouts.&nbsp; Pedestrians should also exercise more caution when crossing roads, as they may be less visible to the motorists.</p></span></div>					<!--MP_NAME:Ms Irene Ng Phek Hoong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

However, Prime Minister&nbsp;Abdullah wanted to give talks another try, and Prime Minister&nbsp;Goh agreed. The understanding reached was that Prime Minister Abdullah would reply to Prime&nbsp;Minister Goh with specific proposals on how to resolve the various bilateral issues.&nbsp; It was also agreed that these proposals would be first discussed at the Prime Ministers' level.&nbsp; Prime Minister&nbsp;Abdullah has yet to respond with these specific proposals.&nbsp; And, Sir, that is where matters still stand.</p></span></div>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Ong Chit Chung (Jurong)</B>:&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;I am puzzled that this misimpression has been created, that we are in actual discussion when this is not the case.&nbsp; May I ask the Minister what is their intention?&nbsp; Is it to pressurise Singapore to agree or is it all part of politicking?&nbsp; What will happen if, at the end of the day, no agreement is reached on this issue?</p></span></div>					<!--MP_NAME:Prof. Jayakumar--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Prof. Jayakumar</B>:&nbsp; Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will respond by saying that we should not speculate.&nbsp; As I have always said in this House, we should not be distracted by media reports, and we will respond to the proposals made officially by their government.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the Malaysians know our position on the bridge issue and that position is quite simple. As I&nbsp;said&nbsp;at our sittings here on 5th January and again on 6th February,&nbsp;when we reluctantly agreed to the demolition of the Causeway and to build our part of the bridge, it was as&nbsp;part of a package deal that covered several bilateral issues.&nbsp; Malaysia, however, called<p align=left>Column: 196<p> off the package in October 2002.&nbsp; To build our part of a full bridge along with CIQ-related revisions would cost us over $500 million and will also sterilise the use of land under the bridge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the package off, we really need to know what is being proposed by Malaysia that would justify our agreeing to build our side of the bridge at such a considerable cost.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So therefore, Sir, we have to first receive the specific proposals from Malaysia.&nbsp; Once we get them, we will study them in good faith&nbsp;and we&nbsp;will come up with our response.&nbsp; But as I have&nbsp;said before also, we can reach&nbsp;agreement only if the proposal is fair and there is a balance of benefits on both sides.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong asked what will happen if there is no agreement reached at the end of the day. Well, as both Prime Ministers had agreed - and their Foreign Minister also said so in their Parliament on 25th January -&nbsp;"if no agreement is reached", he said, "we will seek&nbsp;third party help".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I come back to this point.&nbsp; Let us not speculate. The position is that there&nbsp;have been no talks at the moment between the two Ministries, and we&nbsp;have not received any proposals.&nbsp;Meanwhile, we should not prejudge anything.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I would add that what is important is that bilateral relations have indeed improved and there is a warmer tone when Ministers and officials meet.&nbsp; And recently, on 13th July, Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi said that "relations between the two neighbours are good, and (we) have an understanding that (we) will resolve (our) bilateral difficulties."&nbsp; And he said that "the feeling is good" and&nbsp;that he&nbsp;had not seen any public statement or indication in recent months that suggested any bilateral problems.&nbsp; He said&nbsp;he was optimistic that progress would be&nbsp;made and that "it would be in the&nbsp;interest&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 197<p>of both Singapore and Malaysia to resolve these issues".&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would say that I share the optimism of Prime Minister Abdullah. We do want to get on with our bilateral relations with Malaysia. We are prepared to consider the proposals when we receive them.&nbsp; But I think we have to be patient.&nbsp; And we must not underestimate the difficulties in unravelling these left-over dead knots.&nbsp; We also understand&nbsp;therefore that they need some time and, as stated in their Parliament recently on 7th July, their Malaysian Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs said, and I quote,&nbsp;"the Malaysian government needs time to make&nbsp;detailed preparations to give appropriate consideration over any decision to be made before these [outstanding bilateral] issues are ready to be brought up again to the negotiating table with Singapore", and he&nbsp;added that "negotiations between both countries about these matters will be held as soon as both sides are ready and we agree to start them".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So let us wait for their proposals.</p></span></div>		       		<!--TITLE_NAME:ASSISTANCE TO FOREIGN WORKERS--><p align=left>Column: 197<p><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>ASSISTANCE TO FOREIGN WORKERS</b></span></div><BR>		<!--SUBTITLE_NAME:Claims for unpaid wages--><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

I would like to ask the Acting Minister whether the Ministry would be considering increasing the penalties for employers who failed to pay wages to their workers because the current penalties in the law, obviously,&nbsp;are not a sufficient deterrent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second question&nbsp;is: how many employers have been prosecuted over the years for non-payment of wages and salaries?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Acting Minister has described the procedure that workers could make use of in order to claim the arrears of wages, particularly after the Labour Court has made an order.&nbsp; If that is not paid, the worker could then apply for a Writ of Seizure and Sale in order to enforce the Labour Court's award.&nbsp; My third question is that usually in order to apply for a Writ of Seizure and Sale, the worker has to incur additional costs and he does not have the money to do that because, if he does not even have the money&nbsp;to purchase food for himself, he does not have the money to pay in order to apply for a Writ of Seizure and Sale.&nbsp; Would the Ministry&nbsp;be prepared to work with other agencies to see whether it is possible to have a waiver of these fees for a worker to apply for a Writ of Seizure and Sale when it comes to&nbsp;arrears in salary?</p><p>&nbsp;</p></span></div>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

The Minister mentioned instances of tediosity where the Labour Court process&nbsp;is concerned, because it is a convoluted process perhaps in its own way.&nbsp; Could there be some form of discussion or dialogue&nbsp;to streamline this process, because while the workers are not being paid, waiting for a legal outcome, we could have a short cut through that whole process?</p></span></div>					<!--MP_NAME:Dr Ng Eng Hen--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

As I said, this is 6-7% of companies that are in arrears and, in terms of settlement, 99% of foreign workers' claims were settled through conciliation.&nbsp; So we should not get away with the impression that this is a tedious process.&nbsp; In fact, the process is working.&nbsp; But, as I have said, the number of episodes recently has caused us to look at the system and see whether we could see ways in which we could improve and strengthen it.&nbsp; The Member has asked if we could consider e-schemes.&nbsp; Yes, we are doing that.&nbsp; She also asked how many of the claims were settled when the workers&nbsp;went back.&nbsp; I do not have the figure but the overall number is that, as I <p align=left>Column: 206<p>have said, 99% of foreign workers' claims were settled through conciliation.&nbsp;

So, as we can see, an overwhelming majority of the un-refunded cases involve foreigners.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRAS has not been able to make the tax refunds as most of these foreigners did not leave their foreign addresses with<p align=left>Column: 207<p> IRAS, though IRAS nevertheless puts in its best effort to track them down.&nbsp; For instance, in 2000, a taxpayer in Korea wrote to the <I>Korean Herald</I>, their newspaper,&nbsp;praising IRAS' exemplary efforts to track him down in Korea so as to provide him with his tax refund.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Showing just how difficult it is to make these refunds to foreigners, having been alerted about these arrears, IRAS made an extra effort and even&nbsp;by end-June 2004, $22.11 million belonging to 48,180 foreigners still remains un-refunded.&nbsp; IRAS has been able to track only 2.6% of the foreigners and returned 3.8% of the total amount belonging to foreigners.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, IRAS has had much more success with the Singaporeans.&nbsp; By the end of June 2004, IRAS has settled 76.5% of the cases involving 75.7% of the total unrefunded taxes belonging to Singaporeans, with the sums being sent to the Official Assignee in the case of undischarged bankrupts.&nbsp; The 3,399 cases still unrefunded, involve a total sum of $1.23 million, and these are Singaporeans who are not contactable.&nbsp; Many of these may be taxpayers who have emigrated without leaving their foreign addresses.&nbsp; A number are Singaporeans who have passed away.&nbsp; IRAS has written to the families of the deceased but has not received replies.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, all in all, of the $28.05 million of unrefunded taxes as at February 2003, $23.34 million remained unrefunded in June 2004, not because IRAS has not been trying, but simply because the taxpayers or their beneficiaries are not contactable.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In many tax jurisdictions, if the taxpayer does not make his claim, the tax authority will simply hold on to the money.&nbsp;

TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Dr Balaji Sadasivan:</B> Sir, healthcare is an expensive service to provide because it involves resources such as trained professionals, high technology equipment, and medical implants and pharmaceuticals. Of these, pharmaceuticals form 10-15% of healthcare cost. We do not control the price of these resources. Nevertheless, the Ministry is working to keep healthcare affordable.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1979, the Ministry developed a list of standard and non-standard drugs with the help of expert physicians. The Standard Drug List (SDL) was modelled after the WHO Essential Drug List, with modifications to suit local disease profiles and practice. It consists of drugs assessed by the MOH Drug Advisory Committee to be cost-effective and essential to the<p align=left>Column: 213<p> provision of medical care to all Singaporeans. The SDL is further categorised into lists 1 and 2. SDL 1 consists of mainly first-line drugs required for the treatment of common diseases of mild to moderate severity. SDL 2 was established in 1992 to allow essential but more expensive drugs (eg, cancer drugs) to be included.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOH reviews the SDL regularly to take into account changes in clinical practice and advances in medical science. Revisions to the SDL are made with the input of the MOH Drug Advisory Committee and the respective national specialty committees. Evidence from the medical literature and comments from medical practitioners of the respective specialties are also taken into consideration. Where necessary, new drugs are added to the SDL.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure that the cost of medicines remains affordable, our hospitals and polyclinics have taken the following measures. They include:</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; Ensuring that drugs are prescribed appropriately: MOH has been working with the relevant specialists to develop clinical practice guidelines for various common diseases to help doctors provide the appropriate treatments that are evidence based.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; Using cheaper alternatives where available: With the introduction of electronic prescription systems, doctors are now kept informed about the costs of drugs and available alternatives. Doctors are encouraged, where possible, to use generic instead of patented drugs.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; Central procurement through the Group Purchasing Office: The Group Purchasing Office (GPO) was set up in the year 2000 to support the institutions under the two clusters to perform central procurement. The GPO obtains competitive prices through purchasing tools <p align=left>Column: 214<p>such as open tenders for bulk purchases. Savings obtained by this economy of scale are passed directly to patients.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To succeed in our efforts to keep healthcare costs affordable, we need the support of both the doctors and the public. Medical care in Singapore can remain affordable if we ensure that we spend our healthcare dollars in a sensible manner. Many older medicines, which are generic, are effective and have a well proven track record of curing or controlling a disease. It does not always mean that a newer patented drug is better than an older generic drug. Often, the latest medical treatments only provide a theoretical benefit but at a significantly higher cost. The long-term benefits and risks of these new treatments are often unknown. Doctors therefore need to look at medical treatments objectively and not be swayed by the subjective influences of advertising and marketing efforts. The public should also not think that expensive or newer medicine is always better.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; MOH has recently reviewed the inpatient subsidy system and introduced the Medical Service Package (MSP) for heart diseases on 5th July 2004.&nbsp; The main objective of the MSP is to ensure that patients receive the appropriate subsidies for all cardiac services according to their ward class. The need for services is strictly based on medical indication. Under the MSP, medical services are classified into basic and extended. Basic medical services refer to treatments where the treatment indications are standard. These services will not be subject to peer review. Extended medical services refer to treatments where treatment indications are still evolving or controversial. Doctors will conduct peer reviews on the use of extended medical services to ensure that the most appropriate treatment is provided to their patients. This will serve as a form of <p align=left>Column: 215<p>quality control where the cardiology profession monitors the work of the individual cardiologist. This is to ensure that neither under-treatment of patients nor over-provision of services occurs. Experimental treatments like placement of an artificial heart or stem cell therapy will be considered as excluded services and will require MOH's approval before doctors can proceed with such treatments.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously, there was minimal subsidy for implants like stents, pace-makers and defibrillators. Stents can cost between $1,800 and $5,000. Defibrillators can cost about $25,000. With the introduction of the MSP, patients who need these implants will receive a subsidy of 65% for the implants if they are in B2 class and 80% if they are in C class. The MSP has also added&nbsp;nine new cardiac drugs to the list of drugs on the standard list and these drugs will be subsidised at 65% for B2 patients and 80% for C class patients. We will monitor closely the utilisation of cardiac services and the quality of care provided.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The development of the MSP for the other specialties will involve defining the list of services and evaluating the benefits to patients. It will also involve making the necessary changes to the hospitals' billing and IT systems. MOH will be monitoring closely the impact of the MSP on cardiac services over the next&nbsp;three to&nbsp;six months. Based on the results of this pilot, MOH will take a phased approach in extending the MSP to other specialties. With the subsidies under the MSP, healthcare services for heart diseases, which are expensive services to provide, will remain affordable for Singaporeans.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt;

First, what does<p align=left>Column: 218<p> National Security mean in an age in which transnational terrorism is the biggest security threat facing all countries in the world, including Singapore?&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, how can we best organise ourselves to continue to keep Singapore safe and secure against the threat of terrorism which threatens our economy and society?<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these two questions are simple to state but the answers are complex and difficult to formulate. The questions are not unique to Singapore.&nbsp; Every country in the world today is confronted with these two questions and is struggling to shape responses which are appropriate to their circumstances and situation. Over the past twelve months, I have discussed the subject at length with my colleagues, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister for Defence in the Security Policy Review Committee,&nbsp;with our Government officials and also with analysts and commentators who are knowledgeable in the subject.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also led a number of study visits to various countries (including the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Germany,&nbsp;Spain and some of our neighbouring countries) to meet with my counterparts in the defence and security fields in order to gather a range of perspectives on how other countries deal with their security concerns and how they have organised themselves to ensure their national security in this new security landscape.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After almost a year of deliberation, study, discussions and many meetings, I have arrived at two main conclusions:&nbsp; First, national security in an age of transnational terrorism cannot be divided into separate tasks, eg, external defence against a military threat and internal security against terrorists and criminals. Rather, all countries, including Singapore, have to deal with a continuum of security challenges ranging from state-directed military threats to low-intensity conflicts to ideologically inspired and globally<p align=left>Column: 219<p> pervasive terrorism.&nbsp; And the second conclusion is that to cope with the new security challenges, we need to deal with security threats today on a "whole of government" basis, instead of dividing the tasks into watertight compartments to be dealt with by separate Ministries. Formulating and implementing an integrated and coordinated security policy is best done today by setting up a Coordination Unit at the centre of Government which, of course, is the Prime Minister's Office, which will coordinate strategic planning, policy formulation and capability development in security and intelligence to cope with the threat of transnational terrorism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above conclusions have been accepted by the Cabinet.&nbsp; The purpose of my Ministerial Statement today is to explain how we have come to these conclusions and the measures which we will take to restructure our Government machinery to meet Singapore's new security needs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>Transnational terrorism</I><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, transnational terrorism has become a central concern for all countries in the world today. Transnational terrorism poses a serious and immediate threat to Singapore's national security. Singapore is a prime target for terrorists and we have to live with the real prospect of a terrorist attack. This threat will be with us for a long time.&nbsp; We must be prepared for a long-drawn campaign against an enemy capable of conducting organised, deliberate and prolonged attacks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, transnational terrorism is terrorism that is globalised.&nbsp; It has a global network with a global reach. It has an agenda that is unconstrained by geographical or political boundaries.&nbsp; Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda does not only target the United States.&nbsp; It also seeks to destroy&nbsp;America's<p align=left>Column: 220<p> allies in the West and throughout the world, overturning the international political order in the process, in order to establish pan-Islamic caliphates.&nbsp; Al-Qaeda has a network of affiliated terrorist groups across the globe, including, of course, the Jemaah Islamiyah in this region, who subscribe not only to Al-Qaeda's deviant ideology, but also to its extreme methods of terror.&nbsp; The attacks are more lethal and dangerous than ever before.&nbsp;If the terrorists are ever able to get their hands on weapons of mass destruction, I have no doubt that they will use them.&nbsp; Their ruthlessness leaves no room for negotiation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More dangerously, these terrorists are not mere criminals.&nbsp; They have shown a degree of strategic sophistication that belies the extremism of their methods.&nbsp; The Madrid bombing is a clear example of a terrorist attack designed to achieve the strategic effect of changing a government, and dividing the US and its allies.&nbsp; Similarly, the kidnapping of hostages in Iraq going on almost on a daily basis is designed to affect the responses of countries in supporting the Iraqi government and the US-led coalition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 9-11, many commentators, analysts and security officials have discussed extensively about the nature of terrorist threats facing countries in the world today.&nbsp; I&nbsp;do not intend to burden Members with recounting the innumerable opinions, books, reports and speeches which have dealt on this topic.&nbsp; In my view, the nature and significance of what transnational terrorism means to the world today is aptly summed up in a speech given by Mr George Shultz, the former Secretary of State of the United States, and delivered in May this year.&nbsp; Mr Shultz said, and I quote from his speech:<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "(Transnational terrorism) is the method of choice of an extensive internationally connected ideological movement dedicated to the destruction of our international system of<p align=left>Column: 221<p> co-operation and progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;... The movement's objectives are in four layers or phases:<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i)&nbsp;to drive the international community's people and influences out of the Middle-East (the religious core of the Muslim world);</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii)&nbsp;to overthrow all Arab regimes that are in a working relationship with the international community;</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;to gain a more entrenched and threatening foothold in the most populous parts of the Muslim world which have traditionally been different in their outlook from Muslims on the Arabian peninsula&nbsp;- these would include South East Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia - and inside the Western world (which is Europe);&nbsp;and</p><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv)&nbsp;eventually to eliminate all vestiges of the international state system from a unified Islamic theocratic rule.&nbsp; ..."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And Mr Shultz concluded that today:<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The international state system is under determined attack by a religiously motivated movement using terrorist attacks of dramatic lethality as its weapon of choice.&nbsp; The war is against this movement, not just the weapon of terror."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this new security environment, the danger to us comes from an enemy without shape or country, and with the capacity to continually threaten Singapore and Singaporean interests.&nbsp; Today, national security means that we must be prepared not just to deal with the contingency of a conventional military conflict, but also to be always alert and ready to confront threats at the other end of the security spectrum, particularly those posed by transnational terrorism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we have already enhanced homeland security by implementing various measures to safeguard Singapore.&nbsp; But the impact of transnational terrorism will be felt in many areas, and the<p align=left>Column: 222<p> responses to the threat will be provided by many agencies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With transnational terrorism, the traditional approach of delineating the boundaries between Ministries and agencies, so that each is solely responsible for a particular area, will no longer work.&nbsp; The experience of other countries since the 9-11 attacks, as well as our own, shows the inadequacy of&nbsp;a stovepipe approach.&nbsp; The separation of responsibilities between the Ministry of Home Affairs for internal security and the Ministry of Defence for external defence leaves gaps in the defence of Singapore against transnational terrorism.&nbsp; Furthermore, no Ministry or Government department has developed the full range of competencies or capabilities to deal with this threat.&nbsp; The resources needed to deal with terrorism reside in many agencies.&nbsp; For example, aviation security draws on the resources of MINDEF for air defence, and of MHA for implementing the air marshal programme.&nbsp; Maritime security depends on the Police Coast Guard and the Navy working together with the Maritime and Port Authority to secure our port and territorial waters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the key to ensuring national security today lies in strengthening co-ordination and integration among Government agencies involved in national security, particularly between the external and domestic intelligence agencies, because intelligence is a crucial weapon in the fight against transnational terrorism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In times of crisis, eg, when we were fighting SARS last year, there is no doubt that all Government agencies will work together to deal with the problems at hand.&nbsp; However, we should not wait for a crisis to happen.&nbsp; We must anticipate such problems and deal upfront with inter-agency issues that relate to national security policy and plans where there is no clear ownership among the various Government Ministries and agencies.&nbsp; We<p align=left>Column: 223<p> need to ensure that the policies and plans of individual agencies are aligned to and consistent with the national mandate.&nbsp; To this end, co-ordination in the development of national security strategy, policy and plans is most effective if it is driven from the centre of Government, which is the Prime Minister's Office.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><I>National Security Coordination Secretariat</I><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, the Government has therefore decided to set up a new National Security Coordination Secretariat (NSCS) in the Prime Minister's Office.&nbsp; The NSCS will be overseen by a Permanent Secretary for National Security and Intelligence Coordination (NSIC) who will report directly to the Prime Minister through the Coordinating Minister for Security and Defence.&nbsp;

Sir, even before 9-11, we have been concerned with the issue of terrorism.&nbsp; Several of our Ministries and agencies, particularly the Ministry of Home Affairs,&nbsp;have been developing capabilities to deal with specific threats, eg, chemical and biological threats.&nbsp; But 9-11 has reinforced the urgency and importance of dealing with terrorism and, where necessary, we have put in place several ad hoc coordinating arrangements to protect <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and Singaporeans from terrorist attacks.&nbsp; The Security Policy Review Committee that I chair has provided strategic policy direction and guidance.&nbsp; Ad-hoc committees of Permanent Secretaries have been set up to co-ordinate the development and implementation of strategic responses to various threats, including aviation security, land transport security and maritime security.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through these ad hoc arrangements, much has already been achieved in hardening <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> against terrorist attacks.&nbsp; Since 9-11, we have put in place enhanced security measures that cover our land entry points, airport, seaports, critical installations and key public areas.&nbsp; We have also improved our capabilities to deal with explosives, and chemical and biological threats.&nbsp; The work we have done over the last three years has raised our overall vigilance and readiness, and helped to close obvious capability gaps that were identified.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, Sir, it is unwise to depend on such ad hoc arrangements in the long run.&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 226<p> They must be replaced with&nbsp;robust institutional structures.&nbsp; The Strategic Framework for National Security will address the issues I have discussed, close the gaps which we have identified, and put in place the machinery to enable the Government to systemically deal with the security issues which confront our nation today.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt"><I>National resilience</I></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, enhancing <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s national security cannot be left to the Government alone.&nbsp;

Sir, the most fundamental duty of Government is to protect the lives of our citizens and their property and interests.&nbsp; Fulfilling this duty requires constant vigilance and bold thinking to pre-empt and prevent terrorist attacks.&nbsp; In this connection, Sir, I - and I think the whole of Singapore - should&nbsp;pay a tribute to our security and defence agencies, particularly&nbsp;MINDEF, MHA and their agencies, and also SID and ISD, for their sterling efforts and hard work to keep <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> safe from terrorist attacks, despite the turbulent and dangerous security environment in the last few years.&nbsp; The Strategic Framework for National Security will now establish the baseline which will enable us to further evolve our security strategy to deal even<p align=left>Column: 227<p> more effectively with the long term threat of terrorism that is constantly evolving and adapting.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the National Security Coordination Secretariat and its two agencies, ie,&nbsp;the NSCC and JCTC, are properly staffed and fully operational, our Government Ministries and agencies will be better placed to work even more closely and effectively with the people and the business community to keep Singapore safe and secure.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0mm 0mm 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

I think, on&nbsp;balance, it is better to actually start with more programmes of such kind whereby the public can be educated, as Mr Tan Soo Khoon said, on television, by publications and various means, so that we know how to prepare ourselves and how to react when such instances do happen.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Although now that you have a Permanent Secretary based in this Coordinating Secretariat, I wonder how influential this Permanent Secretary will be in motivating the other Ministries and agencies to come and work together.&nbsp;

I thought I would answer these questions first.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Tan Soo Khoon and Mr Leong Horn Kee have brought up this question about involving the public to ensure national security for Singapore. Sir, this is a most important point.&nbsp; As I said in my speech just now, national security cannot be left to the Government alone.&nbsp; National security is the responsibility of every Singaporean. This has to be&nbsp;brought home to grassroots organisations,&nbsp;schools and to the general public. That is why we are preparing a public document to explain the ideas in the statement which I have just made, but in a much more friendly and accessible manner with illustrations, photographs and in simpler language.&nbsp; We will disseminate this publication at&nbsp;a national security seminar to be held in late August and make it available to schools and households. We would appreciate the help of Members of Parliament to distribute it to their constituencies. We will also make available a CD presentation which Members can use when they talk to their grassroots leaders.&nbsp; We also need to publicise this through the media,&nbsp;the newspapers,&nbsp;the television and the radio.&nbsp; We will arrange for discussions and interviews in order to put these points across. It is difficult to put across the main points and all these nuances in one presentation.&nbsp; I have set out the main points today. We will elaborate on these in the coming months.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, Members can do a great service to Singapore by working with the National Security Coordinating Committee and the Secretariat in order to put across these ideas and to explain the significance of<p align=left>Column: 231<p> these measures to the man-in-the-street and to the public.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Ong Chit Chung has asked whether the National Security Coordination Secretariat will be given an additional budget in order to influence other Ministries.&nbsp; I think the same question has also been asked by Ms Irene Ng&nbsp;about how&nbsp;we ensure that there is cooperation between the Ministries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, let me say, first of all, that we should be proud of our security agencies -&nbsp;MINDEF, MHA, SCDF, the Police, SID and ISD.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are first-class organisations. They are staffed by dedicated professionals, led by competent leaders who have the vision and determination to keep Singapore safe.&nbsp; And because they are good organisations, it is to be expected that they would have different views about how to handle issues and&nbsp;different perspectives on how to ensure national security.&nbsp; If they were people without strong convictions, it would have been much easier to get agreement on the measures which I have just outlined.&nbsp; But because they are strong individuals with strong views, we have had to trash out these issues over many meetings and over many months, and that is good.&nbsp; I welcome that because I am assured by that process that they have applied their minds and&nbsp;where we have been able to get agreement, it has not compromised their core interests.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But to ensure coordination, the most effective way is through the budgeting process. The Ministry of Finance has made available to the Security Policy Review Committee a&nbsp;revolving budget of $50 million which they top up from time to time, as and when we need to launch urgently some national security programmes. For example, we were very concerned over the last few months with the security of some of our embassies<p align=left>Column: 232<p> overseas. With the measures which we have taken in Singapore, we are&nbsp;confident that we have hardened Singapore.&nbsp; And, therefore,&nbsp;if any terrorists were to attack Singapore or Singaporeans' interest, it would most probably be overseas rather than at home. The SPRC discussed with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), pointed out the danger, and MFA has now launched a programme to ensure that all our embassies are safe.&nbsp; Of course, that requires money.&nbsp; And through the normal process of budgeting, it may take some time.&nbsp; But this is an urgent issue.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SPRC made available the necessary money to MFA so that they could get the programme started as soon as possible because we cannot waste time when lives are at stake.&nbsp; Our officials, our Ambassadors, our foreign service officials in our embassies live and work abroad to serve Singapore, and we must ensure that their working environment is safe and that they will not be blown up by a car bomb or by a suicide attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;And through this process of a revolving budget, it has been most helpful in getting such programmes quickly off the ground and we will make the same arrangements, with the cooperation of the&nbsp;Ministry of Finance, for the National Security Coordination Secretariat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we ensure coordination between the domestic intelligence and the external intelligence agencies?&nbsp; It is very difficult.&nbsp; The&nbsp;difficulty of getting, for example, in the United States, the CIA and the FBI to work together&nbsp;is well-known.&nbsp; If&nbsp;you open any newspaper today,&nbsp;their problems are manifest.&nbsp; I hope that through the arrangement which we have set, through the good sense and cooperation of the individuals and the leaders in our intelligence agencies,&nbsp;we will be able to foster this cooperation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The British have the same problem and they have a lot of experience with terrorism because they have been fighting&nbsp;<p align=left>Column: 233<p>the IRA terrorists for&nbsp;many decades.&nbsp; Their intelligence arms are MI5 (which is their domestic intelligence arm) and MI6 (which is their external intelligence arm).&nbsp; MI5 reports to the Secretary of State&nbsp;for Home Affairs, MI6 reports to the Secretary&nbsp;of State&nbsp;for Foreign Affairs&nbsp;and GCHQ, which is their signal&nbsp;intelligence arm, reports to the&nbsp;Secretary of State for Defence. Ultimately, to ensure that these three intelligence arms work together, they have only one intelligence budget which is under the control&nbsp;of the Permanent Secretary for Coordination and he allocates it&nbsp;between the three&nbsp;intelligence&nbsp;arms and therefore compels them to work together.&nbsp; We have not gone&nbsp;as far as the British in our proposal.&nbsp; I do not expect that we will need to do so, but at the end of the day, we have&nbsp;to have an arrangement whereby SID and ISD will work together to enable the Government to&nbsp;have an integrated intelligence picture.&nbsp; If intelligence is not there, if the intention is flawed, then we can get into big problems, as the British and US governments are now finding over the situation in Iraq. That is fundamental.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;National Security&nbsp;Coordination Secretariat is a work in progress.&nbsp; It is a start.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to see how it goes on.&nbsp;And we may have to make modifications along the way. We may have to strengthen the powers and authority of the Permanent Secretary for National Security and Intelligence Coordination, and we will do so.&nbsp; But, I think, give it a try.&nbsp;&nbsp;The discussions which I have&nbsp;had with the Ministers,&nbsp;our Permanent Secretaries and other officials in our security agencies give me confidence that&nbsp;whatever be the difficulty, we will eventually get this coordinated intelligence and policy planning which is necessary to keep Singapore safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman (Sembawang):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,&nbsp;it is clear that the new structure will focus on protecting Singapore from terrorist<p align=left>Column: 234<p> attacks.&nbsp; But&nbsp;in view of the ways that terrorist groups are using hostage-taking of civilians as their weapon in terrorising nations in Iraq today and potentially beyond, will the new security structure consider the potential threat of such methods to Singaporeans overseas?

Sir, it is not possible for us to protect every Singaporean who works or lives overseas.&nbsp; Everyone has to take a sensible approach to his or her own security.&nbsp; Where it is necessary, like for example in Iraq, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has put out&nbsp;a travel advisory, advising Singaporeans against travelling to Iraq or living there, because the danger of being kidnapped by the militants in Iraq is very high.&nbsp; And we do not want to have a repetition of the Filipino situation in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to take sensible precautions.&nbsp; That is why, where necessary, we would advise Singaporeans about the dangers of travelling to different countries.&nbsp;But it is not possible, unless we prevent Singaporeans from going overseas, to make sure that no Singaporean would get into trouble.&nbsp; I would urge all Singaporeans, who go to places which may be dangerous, to at least&nbsp;let our embassy know of their <p align=left>Column: 237<p>whereabouts and arrange to be contactable by&nbsp;the embassy, if and when there is trouble.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Sin Boon Ann has asked whether we could be assured that the failures in intelligence, which have been so well publicised in the West, would not happen in Singapore.&nbsp; Sir, I cannot in all honesty give an absolute guarantee that it would not happen here.&nbsp; With the structure that I have outlined, and with the hard work of our people, I think that the danger is much less.&nbsp; At least, we have made a start, while other countries are still talking about how to coordinate their intelligence agencies.&nbsp; But there is no 100% fool-proof method.&nbsp; Intelligence is a delicate subject.&nbsp; Somebody has said that intelligence does mean connecting the dots from point A to point B.&nbsp; Intelligence means looking at the pattern of dots and being able to figure out a relevant structure.&nbsp; And that is very difficult because different people looking at the same group of dots would come to different conclusions.&nbsp; So it is never 100% sure.&nbsp; But if we can integrate our domestic and external intelligence, I think we will have a better chance of getting the right answers.&nbsp; But I cannot guarantee that we will be right all the time.<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Low Thia Khiang has brought up a very important point.&nbsp; How do we balance protection and security for Singapore and Singaporeans, without at the same time curtailing the freedom and the rights of our people?&nbsp; This is a question which is relevant not only to Singapore but to all countries, and we have to strike a balance here.&nbsp; We have to live with terrorism.&nbsp; We cannot allow terrorism to dictate our lives.&nbsp; We cannot allow the possibility of terrorist attacks to prevent us from going about our normal lives, doing our own work.&nbsp; So, there is a limit to how much protection or preventive measures that one could put in place.&nbsp; Otherwise, we would not even go out of our houses!&nbsp; It is a question of balance.&nbsp; When we harden Singapore, for example, by preventing customers of<p align=left>Column: 238<p> restaurants and bars from parking in front of these establishments, we know that we are creating inconvenience and&nbsp;affecting the business of these bars and restaurants.&nbsp; But, if we do not do it, then the possibility of someone packing a car with explosives, parking in front of&nbsp;a bar or restaurant, blowing it up, causing hundreds of casualties, as had happened in Bali, is very real.&nbsp; So that is something we have to do.&nbsp; It causes inconveniences to people, but it is necessary.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no magic formula to decide what is necessary or what is not necessary.&nbsp; We have to have good sense.&nbsp; We have to depend on the intelligence of our officials and, where possible, we will only do what is absolutely necessary because it is not possible to keep Singapore completely safe, and to assure Singaporeans that there will never be a terrorist attack in Singapore.&nbsp; And this brings me to the point brought up by Prof. Ngiam.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, we have to develop resilience in Singaporeans.&nbsp; The possibility of terrorist attacks will be here for a very long time and it could come in many fashions.&nbsp; Apart from a car-bomb going off in front of a hotel or a restaurant, one thing we are very worried about is people hijacking a ship with chemicals and crashing it against our port.&nbsp; And our port is located in a part of Singapore which is densely populated.&nbsp; That could cause hundreds, if not thousands, of casualties.&nbsp; These are dangers which we have to guard against.&nbsp;For the more extreme ones, we have to take all measures to make sure that they cannot occur.&nbsp; But, one day, some terrorists may get through.&nbsp; There may be a bomb attack.&nbsp; The thing to do, Sir, is to assure Singaporeans that even if there is a terrorist attack in Singapore, it is not the end of the world.&nbsp; Singapore will go on;&nbsp;we will overcome!&nbsp; But we must have the resilience to overcome these attacks.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Ravindran brought out a very difficult point -&nbsp;how to ensure co<p align=left>Column: 239<p>operation right down the line, not only at the top but among the officials.&nbsp; And that is very difficult.&nbsp; Sir, we must realise that for intelligence agencies, information is their life-blood.&nbsp; That is what they live for.&nbsp; And for an intelligence agency, whether in Singapore or overseas, to share intelligence is going against their very nature, and that is why it is so difficult to integrate and coordinate these agencies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The example has to be set from the top, from the Heads of SID, ISD and all our other agencies, in order to show that we are prepared to work together.&nbsp; We have the Intelligence Coordinating Committee under this set-up, which comprises the four Permanent Secretaries, together with the Heads of SID, ISD and JCTC, and they would have to work out ways in order to make sure that this cooperation takes place.&nbsp; It would be difficult but it has to be done.&nbsp; All I can say to Members is that at least we are trying to make a start here.&nbsp; Other countries have not even come to the starting point.</p><p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied)--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed (Aljunied):</B> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, unlike Mr Low Thia Khiang, when it comes to safety and security, I feel that we should even be prepared to err on the conservative.&nbsp; I think we should put as much resources into making sure that our place and our citizens are safe.&nbsp; So while we pay tribute to our security agencies and personnel, I would like to even urge the Government to ensure that they are given the best of resources.&nbsp; It is also a question of spirit.&nbsp; I think we all know that it is also about the battle of the mind.&nbsp; So I am glad to see that the DPM and Coordinating Minister for Security and Defence has spoken about the need to build a better level of intellectual capital, for example, research into political Islam, violence and terrorism.&nbsp; I think we also need to ensure that we build up a greater sense of goodwill <p align=left>Column: 240<p>among our people.&nbsp; There is a lot of misunderstanding about Islam, Muslims, terrorism and violence.&nbsp; So I think better research into political Islam, violence and terrorism would also bring about better understanding so that we could get the majority of Muslims who are moderate to be on our side to fight the evils in terrorism and violence.<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, finally, Sir, on the question about international and regional cooperation, I am glad to also hear the Coordinating Minister speak about threats in aviation and maritime.&nbsp; I would like to ask the DPM what is the level of cooperation that we are getting from our neighbours, particularly in the areas of maritime cooperation.</p><p></P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

"It's not complete without you".&nbsp; Our discussion is that everyone has to play a part.&nbsp; The structures seem, if you would be patient with me, a little bit too defensive.&nbsp; I think the best way to go about security issues is to bring the citizenry in and, at the same time, not to throw the baby out with the bath-water.&nbsp; We have strong community bonding.&nbsp; My fear is that as we go on in this way, the alienation might set in if we are not careful.&nbsp; From that perspective, I would like to suggest that perhaps the theme could be "It's only complete with you", which is more positive and inclusive.</P></span></div>									<!--MP_NAME:Dr Tony Tan Keng Yam--><div align=left><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

Sir, one of the most troubling things about the extremists whom we arrested in December 2001 was that they were ordinary Singaporeans.&nbsp; They were not ideologues.&nbsp; They were people who had jobs and were educated, and yet they could be inspired by their erroneous beliefs.&nbsp; If we had not arrested them and disrupted their plot to carry out attacks, it would have killed not only Americans or foreigners, but their friends and perhaps even members of their families.&nbsp; How do you account for that?</p><p></P></span></div>									          <!-- Begin CDATA tag -->   <!-- End CDATA tag -->	  	<!-- HTML stuff is enclosed in CDATA tag -->	  	<HEAD>	<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;

and religion involves the deepest motivations of human beings.&nbsp; At the end of the day, the western world and governments cannot defeat radical Islamic terrorism.&nbsp; It can only be done by the Muslim community themselves, by moderate Muslims speaking out against the deviant teachings of Osama Bin Laden and his group, and point out that this is wrong.<p>&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 242<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir, Islam is a religion of peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinary Muslims do not go about trying to kill people.&nbsp; But there are groups out there who subscribe to this ideology and inspire other people to follow them, and&nbsp;that&nbsp;is why there were&nbsp;bombings in Madrid, Bali, and other attacks.&nbsp; It is a very long term problem.&nbsp; As Mr Zainul has rightly pointed out, one of the most important tasks of the National Security Coordination Centre is to build up this knowledge about ideology and belief, so that we can better understand the motivation of these terrorists.&nbsp; In that way, we could work with moderate Muslim leaders, and at least for our own people here, enable them to get a better understanding and to prevent Muslims from going the wrong way.&nbsp; Here, we would appreciate very much the help of Muslim Members of Parliament, grassroots leaders and&nbsp;mosque committees&nbsp;to work with us in order to get this message across.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Steve Chia has asked whether we will make more regular reports, I suppose,&nbsp;to Parliament.&nbsp; Sir, intelligence is not something we talk about all the time.&nbsp; It is only when it is necessary.&nbsp; And defence is not a subject which is regularly brought up.&nbsp; We will do so when it is necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will also not amend the Internal Security Act. It is necessary for Singapore now.&nbsp; Without the ISA, we would not have been able to disrupt the plot in December 2001.&nbsp; Seven car bombs&nbsp;-&nbsp;each of them with three tonnes of ammonia nitrate&nbsp;-&nbsp;would have been detonated instantly against the US, British, Australian&nbsp;and other embassies, some of our military camps and&nbsp;MRT stations.&nbsp; Singapore will not recover from such an attack.&nbsp; So, to do away with the ISA would be an extreme act of foolishness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr Warren Lee&nbsp;asked what would be the Singapore Government's stand if a hostage were to be taken and we are subject to the same situation that the<p align=left>Column: 243<p> Philippine government is now facing.&nbsp; First of all, we must try and make sure that we never get into that situation.&nbsp; Once we&nbsp;get into that situation, it is very difficult to resolve the situation. But I just want to make one point that&nbsp;we cannot negotiate with terrorists.&nbsp; If&nbsp;we give in, and in the case of&nbsp;hostage-taking, it is a heart rending situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are dealing with people who cannot be persuaded by normal human interests.&nbsp; Let us not get into that situation first.&nbsp; But if we do, then the Singapore Government cannot and should never negotiate with terrorists.&nbsp; It will encourage more terrorists to take more of our people as hostages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ms&nbsp;Olivia Lum brought up the point about the burden on businesses.&nbsp; We do realise that because it is a fact of life today.&nbsp; It is unfortunate that it means more cost.&nbsp; We will try and lessen it as much as we can.&nbsp; Whenever we have to impose any measures, we try and discuss with the business community, but some measures are inevitable and I think businesses will have to bear with these measures at least for the time being.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, Ms Braema has said that we should involve the community and she has got a&nbsp;tag line&nbsp; -&nbsp; it's&nbsp;only complete with you.&nbsp; I think it is not bad.&nbsp; We will think about it.&nbsp; But it is true that we have to involve everyone.&nbsp; National security in Singapore cannot be left to the Government alone.&nbsp; It involves every Singaporean.&nbsp; It involves our own safety.&nbsp; But with the support of Members of Parliament, grassroots leaders,&nbsp;the public&nbsp; and schools, I am confident that we can keep Singapore safe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></P></span></div>									       		<!--SECTION_NAME:BILLS--><p align=left>Column: 243<p><P><div align=center><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt;

But later on, when we took in the feedback from the various comments, there were some amendments to the various sections and, in particular, the drafting error came about when section 188 was amended as part of the amendment Act to require a company to keep minute books containing all resolutions passed by written means,&nbsp;declarations and resolutions made by the company.&nbsp; Then a subsequent amendment was also made to section 189, and in that amendment,&nbsp;it required certain documents kept in the minute books to be made available to shareholders for inspection or purchase.&nbsp; However, because section 189 also made reference to section 188, therefore an unintended result of the amendment was that&nbsp;section 188 now required the company to also make available for inspection by any member<p align=left>Column: 251<p> minutes of all proceedings of general meetings as well as meetings of the directors and managers.&nbsp;

As at 31st March 2004, the outstanding amount of Treasury Bills issued is $18,000,000,000.&nbsp; There is a need to raise the limit.&nbsp; The small issue size of the three-month Treasury Bills is hampering trading activities in the short end of the Singapore Government Securities curve as most of the Treasury Bills are locked up as&nbsp;minimum liquid asset requirements of financial institutions.&nbsp; The average issue size of three-month Treasury Bills is about $950,000,000, which is smaller than the average issue size of around $2-$2.5 billion for the longer term securities, and the average daily trading volume of Treasury Bills in 2003 was only $161,000,000, compared to $2.5 billion for Singapore Government Securities.&nbsp;

I would like to assure Members that as the licensing authority for childcare centres, my Ministry gives our highest priority to the safety and best interest of children.&nbsp; MCDS would take action against any child care centre that is found to be negligent or carrying out inappropriate practices.&nbsp;

The majority of the 138 complaints received in 2003 concerned administrative issues arising from centre closure due to SARS.&nbsp; Many of the complaints relate to centres not refunding deposit and fees even though they were temporarily shut during the SARS period.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Of these, 13 are feedback on inappropriate management of children.&nbsp; This increase could be attributed to increased public awareness due to the recent reports on the subject in the media.&nbsp; This is not necessarily a negative trend as the public and parents play an equally, if not more important role in helping to ensure the quality of care in our childcare centres.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All licensed childcare centres are required to meet the minimum standards stipulated by MCDS with respect to their operations, environment, safety and hygiene procedures, staffing and programme.&nbsp; All centres are aware of these standards.&nbsp; To check for compliance, MCDS officers conduct unannounced visits to all centres to ensure that these quality standards are met.&nbsp; We have also provided all centres with a copy of the 'Good Practices Handbook', to guide the centres along.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Investors who are able to be commercially competitive using solar energy are welcome to enter the electricity market to be a power producer. Studies have shown that the cost of electricity generated from solar (also called photovoltaic or PV) energy is currently about 2.5 times higher than the current electricity tariff. At the current level of PV costs and efficiencies, PV systems for electricity generation do not appear economically viable.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cost aside, solar energy may still not be suitable for wide-scale implementation because, even if the useable roof areas of all HDB blocks are installed with PV panels, the total amount of electricity that can be generated from solar energy is about 3% of the total electricity demand of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite these factors, improvement in PV efficiency and reduction of PV costs, as well as volatility of oil prices could tilt the balance in favour of PV energy. The Government is closely monitoring developments in this area, which could also provide opportunities to develop a PV industry serving the region. Also, PV systems integrated into buildings as roofs or facade walls could serve dual functions of building construction and energy conservation. There is scope to explore this further. For example, JTC is working with NEA and a PV company on a project that integrates PV into a building at the Biopolis.</p><p></p></span>	<p align=left>Column: 267<p>	<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:ELECTRICITY TARIFFS--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>ELECTRICITY TARIFFS</P></span>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Low Thia Khiang--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Mr Low Thia Khiang </B>asked the Minister for Trade and Industry (a) what is the reason for the continuous upward adjustment of the electricity tariff since April this year; and (b) whether he is aware that the escalating electricity charges have become a financial burden to many households.</span></P>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:--><p align=left></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span>		<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P></P></span>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Mr Steve Chia Kiah Hong </B>asked the Minister for Trade and Industry what is the basis for allowing an increase in the electricity tariffs when Singapore is using more natural gas than diesel to generate electricity.</span></P>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Dr Vivian Balakrishnan--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will answer MP Mr Low Thia Khiang and NMP Mr Steve Chia's questions on electricity tariffs together.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approximately 60% of our electricity supply is generated from gas plants, with the remaining 40% from oil-fired steam plants*.

While <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> does not claim to be absolutely free from human trafficking for sexual exploitation, the instances of forced prostitution are few and far in between.&nbsp; There were only 11 and seven reports of forced prostitution in 2002 and 2003 respectively.&nbsp; Sixteen of these 18 reports could not be substantiated.&nbsp; There was only one case substantiated in each of the two years.&nbsp; We are therefore puzzled by the US TIP 2004 Report's conclusion that there are likely more than 100 cases per year of girls and women trafficked into <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> for the purpose of sexual exploitation.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The TIP Report also alleged that <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> has no national action plan to address human trafficking.&nbsp; This is far from the truth.&nbsp; It is widely known that we take a tough stance against illegal immigrants, whether they were trafficked or had entered <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> on their own volition, and against those involved in human trafficking and human smuggling.&nbsp; We adopt a multi-pronged approach comprising enforcement actions and security checks at the various checkpoints to deter and detect the movement of illegal immigrants in and out of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>.&nbsp; Mobile x-ray machines are deployed at the land checkpoints to provide x-ray screening of goods vehicles.&nbsp; <st1:City><st1:place>ICA</st1:place></st1:City> also makes use of mobile gamma-ray machines to detect illegal immigrants hidden in containers.&nbsp; In addition, the Police Coast Guard's presence is strongly felt with its intensive patrols around <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> territorial waters.&nbsp; These enforcement actions are complemented by the stringent laws against immigration offenders and those who traffic, harbour or employ them.&nbsp; Indeed,<p align=left>Column: 279<p> these measures are widely publicised in parliamentary debates, in the media and in various other public education efforts aimed at raising public awareness.&nbsp; These efforts have borne fruits as seen from the improving Immigration Offender (IO) situation in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> in recent years.&nbsp; For instance, more stringent checks at the checkpoints resulted in a 30% decrease in the number of illegal immigrants arrested in 2003 compared to the year before.&nbsp; Therefore, the TIP Report's placement of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> in Tier 2 appears to be a sweeping generalisation and certainly does not accurately reflect <st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s concerted efforts to combat human trafficking.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In fact, the gas plants are required to have a dual-fuel design feature, and are able to quickly switch to diesel in the event of a gas disruption.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p align=left>Column: 285<p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gas plants have the capability to switch to diesel, without turning off the turbines. This allows them to "hotswitch" seamlessly to an alternative fuel in the event of a gas disruption, without cutting electricity supply. The switching takes time to execute and has to be done before the gas in the pipelines runs out. The residual gas in the pipeline typically runs out in about 10 minutes, depending on the physical location of the shutdown and the rate at which gas is being drawn.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the gas runs out before the plants successfully hotswitch, the gas turbines would trip and would take about one and a half hours to restart with diesel. This will lead to a temporary loss of power and cause a blackout. Power restoration takes time as supply and demand have to be kept in balance at all times. After each area is restored, the system has to be allowed to stabilise before restoration continues. For the power failure on <st1:date Month="6" Day="29" Year="2004">29th June 2004</st1:date>, full system recovery was achieved in about one hour and 50 minutes.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Energy security is a prime consideration for us as having reliable and competitive electricity supply is vital. Today, we are in a strong energy supply position. The installed generation capacity comprises a good balance of fuel types, with 60% capacity in oil-fired steam plants and 40% in gas plants. Our electricity market has excess capacity. The power stations are also required to stockpile at least 90 days worth of fuel reserves in the event of supply disruption, with 45 days storage on site.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even in the event of a prolonged disruption in gas supply, our energy security will not be compromised. However, if we switch to oil-fired steam plants, or run the gas plants on diesel, there will be a cost impact as the price of electricity from oil and diesel will be 10% to 20% higher than gas.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further measures are being taken to improve system robustness. EMA is working with the power stations to build gas supply redundancy into their operations so that they have access to gas from at least two separate sources to reduce their vulnerability to a gas disruption from one pipeline. Senoko Power already has two pipelines feeding into its station. PowerSeraya is commissioning its second pipeline. Tuas Power plans to have its second pipeline by mid 2005. Engineering studies are being done to work out how one pipeline can seamlessly support the other if it fails. The back-up pipeline will give power stations more time to switch from gas to diesel and make the system more robust.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EMA is also studying the viability of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility. From the security perspective, the facility will open access to natural gas from anywhere in the world and will provide LNG stockpile. EMA is finalising the tender specifications for a feasibility study, which will be called in July 2004. If approved, the LNG facility should be operational after 2010.</p><p></p></span>	<p align=left>Column: 285<p>	<div align=center><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'\"><B>		<!--TITLE_NAME:LOWER PRIMARY CLASSES--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><P>LOWER PRIMARY CLASSES</P></span>		</B></span></div>		<div align=left>		<P><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;	        <!--MP_NAME:Mdm Ho Geok Choo--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><B>Mdm Ho Geok Choo </B>asked the Acting Minister for Education in view of the announcement on the reduction of student intake for lower primary classes for 70 schools, (a) why is there a long duration to year 2014 for the other remaining schools to eventually cut over; (b) how will the selection or registration process for students in these schools be affected; (c) whether there will be a change in the syllabus of the lower class enrolment and, if so, how will this affect the syllabus of the other schools with a higher class enrolment; (d) why is the reduction in class enrolment not compulsory for Government-aided, mission and dialect-related schools when these schools are getting a share of the<p align=left>Column: 287<p> additional 700 extra teachers and how many of these additional teachers will be allotted to these schools.</span></P>                <span style="FONT-SIZE: 13pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'"><!--MP_NAME:Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam--><p align=left>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam:</B></p><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005, all 132 Government schools will reduce their Primary One class size from the current 40 to 30.&nbsp; This reduced class size will extend to Primary Two in 2006.&nbsp; Forty-four out of the forty-six Government-aided schools have also decided to reduce class size.&nbsp; The last two schools are undergoing PRIME and have decided to defer the implementation.<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concurrently, schools will move towards partial single session, where the Primary Three to Primary Six classes will be in one session and the Primary One and Primary Two classes will be in the other session.&nbsp; Together with the reduced class size, the implementation of partial single session will mean some reduction in Primary One places in certain primary schools.&nbsp; Schools located in areas of high demand will phase in their implementation of partial single session to ensure that there will be sufficient school places for all eligible P1 students in each planning area and across the entire primary school system.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2005, about two-thirds (65%) of all our primary schools will be able to implement partial single session or full single session.&nbsp; The other one third will introduce partial single session over the next 10 years.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is appropriate to let the Management Boards of the Government-aided schools make the decision on whether their schools should implement smaller class sizes, taking into account the impact on their intake and the needs of their respective communities.&nbsp; MOE will provide them with the teacher resources similar to the Government schools.&nbsp; If they choose not to implement smaller classes, they can deploy these teachers in other ways to add education value for their students.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The introduction of smaller class size at Primary One and Primary Two, and the partial single session has no impact on the Primary One registration process or eligibility criteria for priority registration.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schools will continue to be given the flexibility to customise their syllabus to cater to their pupils' needs.
