<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Chief Minister if

the Government will consider introducing amending

legislation to enable seamen and students abroad,

who are eligible voters, to vote by proxy in

<div align="center"><b>PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Controlling legislation)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for

Labour and Welfare what progress he has made in

his examination of the possibility of introducing

new legislation whereby private employment

agencies can be effectively regulated and controlled.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga (for the Minister for Labour and Welfare, Dr Lim Yew Hock):</b> An Employment Agency Bill is now in its final

stage of preparation and it is intended that this

will be introduced at the next sitting of the Assembly.

<div align="center"><b>QUADRUPLET OF CHE MARKANAH BINTE AHMAT</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Government Assistance)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for

Labour and Welfare if he will state what

assistance the Government has provided for the

quadruplet of Che Markanah binte Ahmat, apart from

the monthly allowance of $30 from the Silver

Jubilee Fund for a period of six months.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I would like to know where the hon.

Member got his information from because it is

incorrect that any monthly allowance of $30 was

made to the lady in question from the Silver Jubilee Fund.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the birth of the quadruplets on 23rd December, 1957, a single grant of

$40 was made from Government funds to Inche Kasban bin Sabet, the father of the quadruplets.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, is the Government going to

help  this  poor  lady in the maintenance  of  the quadruplets?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> As the public assistance scheme does

not  provide for the payment of monthly allowances

to  persons in full-time employment, no further assistance can be made to Inche Kasban's family.

<div align="center"><b>APPLICATIONS FOR ENTRY INTO COLONY</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Furnishing of grounds for refusals)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Minister for

Labour  and Welfare if he is aware that no grounds

for  refusals  are  given  by  the  Controller  of

Immigration  to sponsors of applicants  for  entry

into  the  Colony; and if he will direct  the  Controller  of  Immigration  to  furnish  grounds  in

future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> The Controller of Immigration is

empowered to refuse any application for  an  entry

permit if he is satisfied that the applicant is  a

prohibited  immigrant. Where he has refused  entry

to  any  person he shall if so requested  by  such

person  inform  him  of the  class  of  prohibited

immigrant   of  which  in  the  opinion   of   the

Controller he is a member - and this has always been complied with.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, is the Minister aware

that  a sponsor has to wait sometimes three  years

for  the result of his application and that  after

the  result  has  been given  no  reason  for  the refusal is stated?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I am not aware of that.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 325</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>NEWLY REGISTERED SINGAPORE CITIZENS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Waiving of visa fees)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr William Tan</b> asked the Minister for Labour

and  Welfare whether the Government will  consider

waiving  the  visa fees charged by the Immigration

Department   in   respect  of   newly   registered

Singapore citizens applying for travel documents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 326</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> No, Sir. Until the amendment to the

British Nationality Act of 1948 is made which will

give  Singapore citizenship international  status,

visas  are required for newly registered Singapore

citizens.  When  the  amendment  to  the   British

Nationality Act is made, Singapore passports  will

be  issued to newly registered citizens and  visas

will then no longer be required.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Is the Minister aware that under

the Fees Ordinance the Government has the power to

waive  visa  fees  in respect of re-entry  permits

submitted by these residents?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I am quite aware of that and this

question will be considered when the amendment  is

made to the British Nationality Act.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> When is the amendment expected?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> I am not a prophet.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy:</b> Is it not the duty of the

Government to press for the amendment in order  to

give   all   the  facilities  to  the  people   of Singapore?

<div align="center"><b>REVIEW OF ORDER OF DETENTION OF MR JEK YUEN THONG</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following Question stood in the name of Mr Lee Kuan Yew-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. To ask the Chief Secretary when a review of

the  order of detention under the Preservation  of

Public  Security Ordinance, 1955, of Mr Jek  Yuen

Thong is to be made; and whether, for that review,

there  will  be  made available to  the  Reviewing

Officer   for   his  consideration   the   written

statement which has been submitted by or on behalf

of Mr Jek Yuen Thong to the Appeal Tribunal.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Lee Kuan Yew.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There being no response-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr. Soh Ghee Soon.

<div align="center"><h4><div align="center"><b>LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY BY-ELECTION MEETING</b></div></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Holding of)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon</b> asked the Chief Secretary

to state which political party or parties held a

public Legislative Assembly by-election meeting in Tank Road on 24th June, 1957.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr E. B. David:</b> None, Sir, so far as I am aware of.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 327</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>ALLEGED ILL-TREATMENT OF TAN HONG PIEW IN REMAND PRISON</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Chief Secretary

whether he has received a copy of a letter from

the General Secretary of the Singapore Peasants'

Union regarding the alleged ill-treatment in the

Remand Prison of Tan Hong Piew, detained under the

Banishment Ordinance; and if he will make a

statement on the matter.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Yes, Sir, I have received a copy of

the letter in question and in view of the wide

circulation it has been given by the Union, I

welcome the opportunity to make a statement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is alleged in the letter dated 8th May that

since his arrest on 30th April this blind man had

been locked in a cell by himself for the night at 4 p.m. each day and that he had been denied any

solid food.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facts are that on his committal to the Remand

Prison on 30th April, this man was immediately

admitted to a ward in the Prison hospital. This

ward contained some 15 other patients and is

provided with modern latrine and washing

facilities in an adjoining alcove. Hospital

orderlies are on duty night and day to attend to

the needs of the patients and there is a resident

medical officer close at hand. On admission to the

hospital, this man was found to be suffering from

pyelitis and on the doctors orders he has been

given three extra meals a day in addition to the

normal diet. This extra food includes two eggs a day.

<div align="center"><b>REGISTRATION OF HINDU MARRIAGES</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Introduction of legislation)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the Chief Secretary,

with  reference to the Report of the Committee  on

Hindu  Marriage Registration (Sessional Paper  No.

Cmd.   37   of  1957),  whether,  and  when,   the

Government  will  introduce  legislation  for  the

registration of Hindu marriages.



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, the Government does not propose at present to introduce such legislation.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, can the Chief Secretary

tell  us  why the Government does not  propose  to

introduce such legislation?



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, this is a matter in which we

consider  it  necessary to keep in line  with  the

Federation Government and I understand  that  they

have recently appointed a committee to examine the

necessity for enacting legislation of this kind.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Sir, is the Government going

to  wait  until the findings of that Committee  of

the Federation Government are published?



<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> I have already said, Sir, that this is

a matter in which we think it is necessary to keep

in  line with the Federation Government, otherwise

any  legislation  we enact here could  clearly  be stultified.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 328</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>EXCHANGE CONTROL ORDINANCE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10. <b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> asked the Financial

Secretary,  in  view  of the comments  made  on  a

recent  case heard in the High Court under section 9  (1)  of  the  Exchange Control Ordinance  (Cap. 216),   whether   he  will  consider   introducing

amending  legislation or take any other  steps  to

exclude payments of moneys in which the Colony has

no  interest  at all from the scope  of  the  said section 9 (1).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr T. M. Hart:</b> No, Sir, It is still considered

essential  as  an effective check on evasion  that

the existing provision should be retained. It will

be  appreciated  that section 9 of  the  Ordinance

does  not impose an absolute prohibition  on  acts

preparatory to the making of payments outside  the

Colony  for the credit of persons resident outside

the  scheduled territories. It only makes such  an

act an offence if the permission of the Controller

is  not  obtained but such permission  is  readily

given  if  the Controller is satisfied that  there

will not be a loss of foreign exchange.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 329</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>EXCHANGE CONTROL ORDINANCE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11. <b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> asked the Financial

Secretary how many applications have been made  to

the  Controller of Foreign Exchange for permission

to do any of the acts referred to in section 9 (1)

of the Exchange Control Ordinance (Cap. 216) since

the  commencement of the Ordinance up to a  latest

convenient  date; in how many cases has permission

been  granted; and whether he will state  what  is

the policy and what are the principles adopted  in

the granting or refusal of such permission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> Sir, I regret that it has not been

considered practicable, having regard to the other

commitments   of   the  limited   staff   of   the

Controller's office, to search through the  11,000

files which have been opened during the past  four

years  to  obtain the information  requested.  The

number  of  applications of the kind to which  the

hon.  Member refers has amounted to many hundreds.

It   can  safely  be  said  that  almost  all  the

applications  covered transactions which  did  not

involve foreign currency loss under any section of

the  Ordinance and in such cases the  applications

were approved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis on which an application is judged is

whether or not, in all the circumstances involved,

the  transaction  will entail  a  direct  loss  of

foreign  currency or an indirect loss by  omitting

to bring to the scheduled territories



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



foreign   currency  earned  overseas.   Where   on

complete  disclosure  of  all  the  details  of  a

transaction the Controller is satisfied that there

would  be  no direct or indirect loss  of  foreign

exchange, the application is granted.

<div align="center"><b>IMPORTATION OF AMERICAN GOODS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Purchase of American currency in Hong Kong)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. <b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> asked the Financial Secretary

if  he is aware that Singapore firms, which import

American goods through Hong Kong, usually  arrange

through banks in Singapore for the purchase of the

necessary  American currency  in  Hong  Kong;  and

whether  this procedure is sanctioned by  the  Controller of Foreign Exchange, and how.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> No, Sir, I am not aware of this practice. It is not sanctioned by the Controller.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 330</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>EXCHANGE CONTROL ORDINANCE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13. <b>Mr R. Jumabhoy</b> asked the Financial Secretary

if  he  is  aware that in the Colony's trade  with

Indonesia and Hong Kong it has been impossible for

merchants to avoid contravening section 9  (1)  of

the  Exchange  Control Ordinance (Cap.  216);  and

whether  he  will  consider  introducing  amending

legislation or take any other steps to narrow  the

scope of the said section 9 (1), in particular  in

regard  to  preparatory acts done in  relation  to

trade with non-sterling areas.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I am not aware that it is impossible

for merchants trading with Indonesia and Hong Kong

to   avoid  contravening  section  9  (1)  of  the

Ordinance. They can always ask the Controller  for

the necessary permission.

<div align="center"><b>VETERINARY DEPARTMENT OF CITY COUNCIL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Taking over by Government)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14. <b>Mr Lee Choon Eng</b> asked the

Minister  for Local Government, Lands and  Housing

whether,  and when, the Government will take  over

the Veterinary Department of the City Council.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 331</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat:</b> In the White Paper on the Report of the Committee

on   Local   Government  No.  Cmd.  30  of   1956,

Government  indicated its acceptance in  principle

that certain services should be the responsibility

of Government. These services include not only all

veterinary   services  but  also,   for   example,

personal  health services and the registration  of

births, marriages and deaths.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transfer of the veterinary services cannot

be  considered  in isolation but  must  be  taken

together with the transfer of other services. This

involves  the solution of problems such  as  those

concerning the terms and conditions of  transfers

of   the  staff  involved  and  compensation   for

property and other assets. These matters are being

discussed  with  the City Council. When  agreement

has been reached, the transfers will be effected.

<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15. <b>Mr Goh Tong Liang</b> asked the Minister for Education-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) when is it intended to begin registering

children  for admission to grant-in-aid  vernacular schools for 1959; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) what is the reason for not holding this

registration  simultaneously with  that  for English schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Swee Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Swee Kee:</b> Sir, the answers to the two

points raised by the Member for Bukit Panjang are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) registration of children for admission to

grant-in-aid vernacular schools  is  carried

out    independently   by   the   principals

concerned; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the reason for not including this

registration simultaneously with that for English

schools is to give grant-in-aid vernacular schools

as much liberty as possible in the matter.

<div align="center"><b>(Amount)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16. <b>Mr Goh Tong Liang</b> asked the Minister for

Commerce and Industry what is the total amount  of

family  remittances sent to Communist  China  from

Singapore  from  1st April, 1957, to  31st  March,

1958.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> Sir, the total amount of

money  recorded by the Exchange Control Department

as  having been remitted from Singapore  to  China

during  the period 1st April, 1957, to 31st March, 1958,   in  respect  of  family  remittances   was $16,822,867. Current figures in respect of  family

remittances  are  released  to  the  Director   of

Information Services monthly and appear  regularly

in the press.



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Tong Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Goh Tong Liang:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, does the

Minister agree with me that for every dollar  sent

to  the  relatives  of these people  in  Communist

<div align="center"><b>POLICE FORCE BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.21 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency's consent to proceed with this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as explained in the statement at the end of

the   Bill,  this  is  primarily  a  consolidating

measure.   At   present,  the  Police   Force   is

administered and organised in accordance with  the

provisions  of  the Police Force Ordinance,  1941,

read  together  with  the Singapore  Police  Force

Ordinance,  1949, and it is clearly time  that  we

had  a  single  up-to-date statute  regulating  the

Force.  This Bill, Sir, is based not only  on  the

1941 and 1949 Ordinances but also borrows



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 335</b></font><br><br>



or  adapts  certain provisions from the Federation

of  Malaya Police Ordinance, 1952. Details are set

out  in  the comparative table at the end  of  the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main innovation in the Bill is in clause 21

which  provides for the establishment  of  one  or

more  Police  associations  to  be  operated   and

administered    in    accordance    with    Police

regulations.   It   is   intended    that    these

associations should form the medium through  which

members  of  the  Force can bring  to  notice  any

grievances  regarding their pay or  conditions  of

service and can seek satisfactory remedies through

appropriate forms of negotiating machinery.  Since

the  Police is a disciplined Force, this machinery

cannot appropriately take the ordinary form  of  a

trade union with the right to strike in support of

demands.  The provision of associations  on  these

lines  accords with the practice in force both  in

the   Federation  of  Malaya  and  in  the  United Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this Bill was published, Sir, certain

representations have been made by the inspectorate

in  regard  to  the provisions of  clause  20  and

clause  28 of the Bill which provide for  the  discharge   or   dismissal   of   inspectors.   These

representations can properly be considered at  the

Committee stage of the Bill when those clauses are

considered and it is my intention to move that the

Bill should be committed to a Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representations have also been received

regarding  the period of time allowed  for  appeal

under clauses 27 and 28 of the Bill and it will be

my  intention at the Committee stage to move  that

the  ten  days  provided in  the  Bill  should  be

changed to 30 days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are certain other amendments to the

Bill to be moved at the Committee stage of which I

have given notice but these are mostly of a formal

nature   and   do   not  affect  the   substantive

provisions  of the Bill. The only one on  which  I

would  like to comment at this stage is clause  51

of the Bill which deals with the administration of

intestate  estates. As the clause  is  at  present

drafted, it is doubtful whether the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 336</b></font><br><br>



Deputy Commissioner will have powers to deal  with

money  as  well  as  with goods and  chattels.  To

clarify the position, it is proposed to substitute

the  expression "movable property" for "goods  and

chattels" and to redraft the clause accordingly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think I need say any more at this stage and I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of Mr Speaker as Chairman and five Members to be nominated by the Committee of Selection. (Mr David).

<div align="center"><b>PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENTS BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>10.26 a.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr David -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr David:</b> Sir, I have His Excellency's consent to proceed with this Bill.



<br><br><!-- Mr M. P. D. Nair (Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Assistant Minister to the Chief Secretary (Mr M. P. D. Nair):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee on Local Government appointed in

July  1955  recommended amongst other things  that

the  safety and amenity aspects of the control  of

places of public entertainment, both temporary and

permanent,  should be administered  by  the  local

authorities,  the moral aspect by the  police  and

the   welfare   aspect  by  the   Social   Welfare

Department.  The  Government  agreed  with   these

recommendations in the White Paper  on  Government

policy relating to local government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Local Government Bill, 1957, which has been

passed by the Legislative Assembly, makes enabling

provision for local authorities to make bylaws now

for  the  control, regulation and  supervision  by

registration,  licensing or  otherwise  of  places

used  for  real  performances, theatres,  wayangs,

concerts  and other public exhibitions  and  enter

tainments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A considerable part of the Theatres Ordinance

(Cap.   229)   which   assigned   some   of   this

responsibility to the police consequently  becomes

obsolete and fit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 337</b></font><br><br>



for  repeal. In addition, other provisions of  the

same  Ordinance  have become out of  date  through

changes in the social life of the community  since

it  was enacted in 1909. It is timely therefore to

repeal the whole of the Theatres Ordinance and  to

replace  it  by  a new Ordinance directed  to  the

regulation  of public entertainments  in  general.

This  Bill  has  accordingly been framed  so as  to

require  that the Licensing Authority  constituted

under  it  should  have regard  primarily  to  the

nature of public entertainments for which licences

are  sought; while also concerned that  these  are

held only in places suitable to their nature,  the

Licensing  Authority is permitted to  presume  the

suitability of buildings and other premises to the

extent to which this has been certified by a local

government authority.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, which repeals the present

Theatres  Ordinance  and the  Billiards  Ordinance

which is equally out of date and will no longer be

necessary if this Bill is enacted, is based on the

following  considerations  and  requirements:  the

interest    of    the   State    in    controlling

entertainments to which the public has  access  is

fourfold - to preserve peace and good order:

to prevent moral, social and political degeneracy:

to  prevent physical injury and suffering  whether

to  performers or to audiences: to secure  revenue

sufficient  at  least  to offset  the  expense  of

control;  the definition of "public entertainment"

which   should   be  as  clear  as  possible   and

comprehensive enough to take account of  the  much

greater  range  of  popular  amusements  available

nowadays  so  that  loopholes  in  the  system  of

control  could be prevented as much  as  possible;

the  statutory exemptions of some kinds of  public

entertainment   because  their   sponsorship   and

circumstances  adequately  guarantee  the  State's

interest  being  safeguarded; the  exemption  from

control either wholly or in part of other kinds of

"public entertainment" the nature of which  cannot

readily  be  perverted  to ends  contrary  to  the

State's interest; the introduction of a system  of

licensing of "public entertainment" which provides

for the identification of all persons on whom lies

the onus of compliance with the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 338</b></font><br><br>



conditions of licences; the declaration in advance

of   the  precise  nature  of  the  entertainment;

approval  of the place in which it is intended  to

provide    entertainment;    the    refusal    and

cancellation   of  licences;  the  suspension   of

licences on reasonable suspicion that they will be

abused or will result in breaches of the peace  or

injury  or  suffering to animals or performers  or

members  of  the  audience;  recourse  to   expert

opinion in cases of doubt whether an entertainment

should be licensed or not; the collection of fees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is the intention of the Government that

after  the Second Reading of this important  Bill,

it should be committed to a Select Committee. I do

not  propose therefore to go into great detail  at

this  juncture. Hon. Members will also  have  read

the  explanatory statement at the end of the Bill.

I  would  like however to dwell at this  stage  on

some  of  the  more  important clauses  and  implications of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition of "public entertainment" under

the  14  headings  is intended  to  be  absolutely

comprehensive  of  all existing and  all  probable

forms   of   public  entertainment,  without   any

implication  as  to the inherent  desirability  or

otherwise  of  the  particular  types  of   public

entertainment  mentioned. The final  part  of  the

definition excludes absolutely from the  operation

of  the  Ordinance  certain categories  of  public

entertainment associated with the State, official,

religious, business and political occasions, it is

considered not only necessary for the avoidance of

embarrassment  and administrative congestion,  but

also  essential to preserve freedom of association

for  those  categories to be statutorily  exempted

from  the  application of this  Bill.  As  I  have

already  indicated above, it is contemplated  that

other  exemptions will also be granted and  clause

15  of  the  Bill  gives the  Minister  unfettered

discretion to make orders for this purpose.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members will wish to be made aware  of  the

provisions of clause 10 (2) of the Bill which will

enable  the Licensing Officer to prohibit  at  his

discretion the admission of children under the age

of sixteen years to the licensed public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 339</b></font><br><br>



entertainment.   There  is   ample   occasion   in

Singapore  today  for the use of  every  available

means  of  protecting the younger generation  from

bad    influence   in   the   field   of    public

entertainment.  The  onus  of  responsibility  for

seeing  that this prohibition is carried out  will

fall  on the licensee of the public entertainment.

This would apply even to cinemas. If this Bill  is

passed,  classification of films  as  suitable  or

unsuitable for children to see could be made under

the  Cinematograph Films Ordinance. The  Licensing

Officer under this Bill could then impose  on  the

licensees of cinemas that one of the conditions of

a licence should be that no children under the age

of  sixteen years should be admitted to see  films

classified as unsuitable for children by the  Film

Censor.  This provision, Sir, is a very  important

one  and  it  is  my intention to ask  the  Select

Committee to examine the implications of this  provision in particular.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 13 and 14 deal, as the explanatory

statement  shows,  with the refusal,  cancellation

and   suspension  of  licences.  The  clauses  are

straightforward and are in keeping with  the  main

considerations  and requirements on  which,  as  I

stated earlier, the Bill is based.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 19 is for the resolution of doubt whether

any entertainment was "public" or not. Attempts to

rebut  changes under the Bill on the grounds  that

entertainments   were   not   "public"   must   be

anticipated. In placing the onus of proof  on  the

person  alleging  that  the entertainment  is  not

"public", regard has been given  to  the  circumstance  that such doubt will be material only  when

an  offence  under the Ordinance has  prima  facie

been  committed, and to the extensive  exemptions

allowed  for statutorily and expected  to  be  conferred by the Minister under the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, another important clause is clause 22 which

introduces   a  provision  long  sought   by   the

Licensing  Authority under the Theatres  Ordinance

to  allow effective recourse to the best available

expert  advice in determining whether a particular

public entertainment, especially if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 340</b></font><br><br>



of  the nature of a professional sporting contest,

for  example, boxing or wrestling contests, should

be  licensed or not. The clause provides that  "it

shall  be  sufficient  reason  for  refusing"   to

license such an entertainment if the expert advice

given  is that it should be refused but final  discretion  is given to the Licensing Officer whether

he  wishes to act in accordance with the advice he

has received.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I have indicated earlier, I do not

propose  to go into matters of detail which  could

of  course  be dealt with in the ordinary  way  in

Committee  but  it  is the Government's  intention

after  its  Second Reading to have  the  Bill  committed to a Select Committee. I am confident, Sir,

that  the  purpose of this Bill and the principles

on  which it is based will commend itself to  hon.

Members  and  that they will give  it  its  Second

Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>10.37 a.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we welcome this Bill

as a reasonable and sensible measure to improve on

an  outdated Theatres Ordinance enacted nearly  40

years  ago. We also welcome the decision  to  send

the Bill to a Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that all entertainments from tiddly-winks to

coconut-shies in a fun-fair are brought within its

scope,  it is clearly necessary to give it  closer

examination before it becomes law and I hope  very

much that the proprietors and sponsors of all the

multifarious  forms of entertainment available  in

this  modern  age in Singapore will  come  forward

before  the  Select Committee to give evidence  so

that  this Bill is not only comprehensive  but  as

fair  as  possible to all concerned. Speaking  for

myself,  I  am  acquainted  with  some  forms   of

entertainment - some    professional    and     some

amateur - and I would therefore like to touch  on  a

few    points    which   will   require    careful

consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, there is the question as to

whether  public entertainment should be controlled

by  a Licensing Officer and assistants as provided

by  the  Bill or by a Licensing Board.  The  advantages of a Licensing Board would be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 341</b></font><br><br>



that  the  approval  of entertainments  or  their

disapproval  could be carried  out  according  to

reliably  and  reasonably fixed  standards  which

would vary very little from place to place in the

island.  The system at present is that  an  entertainment  has  to be approved by the  officer  in

charge of the police station in the area in which

the  entertainment is to be held. The  result  is

that a more liberal interpretation of what may be

shown can differ in one district than in another.

Let   me   take  perhaps  the  somewhat   obvious

example - striptease acts and shows of that nature.

I  know  of  establishments where the  police  definitely  do not permit any form of striptease - in

our  opinion,  on this side of the  House,  quite

rightly   too.  I  also  know  of  one   or   two

establishments operating in the city  at  present

where  striptease acts are being presented  night

after  night.  In  other  words,  Sir,  different

standards  are being followed in different  areas

by different police stations. I sometimes look at

the  Chinese  newspapers. I cannot  read  Chinese

unfortunately,  but I do not  have  to  know  the

language  to  understand the pictures advertising

places  of entertainment and some of these  leave

nothing  to  the imagination. The question  today

arises  as to whether Government permits or  does

not  permit striptease acts. In theory, it claims

that  it does not, but in practice, it winks  the

other  eye. In this very youthful community which

is  Singapore  today, striptease  acts  and  nude

shows  should surely not be permitted. There  are

plenty  of other forms of entertainment  for  our

population and for our tourists. I would like the

Government   to   come  out   with   a   definite

declaration as to where they stand in this matter

and  what their policy is. It is not for them  to

say  that  it is a police matter; the  Government

control  the  police. I hope that  the  Hon. the

Assistant  Minister to the Chief  Secretary  will

make  the  position clear during  his  reply.  My

argument  therefore  is, Sir,  that  a  Licensing

Board  would  have  an advantage  over  Licensing

Officers as they would be in a better position to

maintain  consistent standards of what should  or

should not constitute "public"



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 342</b></font><br><br>



entertainment  and to interpret regulations  laid

down  by  the  Government. On the other  hand,  a

Board,  it  is true, would present disadvantages:

the  main one being the speed with which licences

could  be  obtained.  A Board  cannot  remain  in

continual session whereas a Licensing Officer  is

or   should  be  permanently  available.   Often,

licences  are  needed  at a moment's  notice  nor

should  they be denied a promoter at  a  moment's

notice  if reasonably possible. The possibilities

of  combining  the  system of both  a  Board  and

Licensing Officers are worth considering: a Board

to see that consistent standards of licensing are

carried  out in the more difficult categories  of

entertainment and Licensing Officers empowered to

authorise  at short notice the routine  forms  of

entertainment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I next come to clause 14 regarding the

cancellation  or suspension of a licence.  Clause

11,  in  certain circumstances, goes with it.  An

aggrieved  person whose licence is  cancelled  or

suspended



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"may, within fourteen days of the service

on  him  of  the grounds of such cancellation  or

suspension,  appeal in writing to  the  Minister,

whose decision thereon shall be final. Where  the

Minister  decides to restore a  licence,  he  may

impose such conditions as he thinks fit."



<br><br>Sir,  I think the procedure laid down here  needs

to  be examined extremely carefully. Cancellation

of   a  licence  in  certain  cases  may  involve

forfeiture  of security under clause 11.  If  the

Minister  is  to  hear the  appeal,  I  feel  the

aggrieved  party should be given the  opportunity

to  appear  in  person  or with  his  lawyer  and

witnesses  and evidence on oath should be  taken,

the  Licensing  Officer  and  his  witnesses   to

support  the cancellation of the licence and  the

forfeiture of the security, the licensee and  his

witnesses  to  show cause why the licence  should

not  be  cancelled  and the  security  forfeited.

Unless   evidence  is  given  on  oath,  I   fear

witnesses  may  take advantage  and  issue  false

reports or statements to the Licensing Officer or

to  the  Minister. The licensee  should  also  be

given  the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses

who give evidence for the Licensing Officer.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 343</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be inclined to go even further. I would

question  whether, in fact, it is  right  for  the

Minister  to hear appeals against the cancellation

of  licences.  Why not appoint a  district  judge,

civil  or criminal, to hear such appeals?  To  compare   sections  416  and  417  of  the   Criminal

Procedure Code, there is, for example, sub-section

(1) which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whenever it is proved to the satisfaction of a

court that any bond taken under this Code has been

forfeited,  the court shall record the grounds  of

such  proof  and may summon before it  any  person

bound  by such bond and call upon him to  pay  the

penaliy thereof or to show cause why it should not

be paid."



<br><br>Section 417 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All orders made under section 416 by any

Magistrate's  Court  or District  Court  shall  be

appealable."



<br><br>Either  some such procedure should be followed  or

it  should be made much clearer in the Bill or  in

Rules   published  under  the  Bill  as  to   what

procedure the Minister will adopt when considering

the appeal of an aggrieved person.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next point is this. Under clause 8 of the existing Ordinance, police officers not

under the rank of sergeants may enter premises  to

see  that  the conditions of a licence are  being

observed. In the Bill before us, clause 16 reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any Licensing Officer or police officer may

enter   any   place   where  a   licensed   public

entertainment  is being provided with  a  view  to

ascertaining whether the conditions of the licence

and  the  provisions of this Ordinance  are  being

complied with."



<br><br>This,  in our opinion, is going too far. We  think

that  the  qualification not  below  the  rank  of

inspector would be reasonable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I would refer to the very difficult point already touched on by my hon.

Friend    opposite   which   will   need   careful

consideration in Select Committee,  that  is,  the

proposal under clause 10 (2) which prescribes that

children under the age of sixteen years shall  not

be admitted to certain forms of entertainment. The

theory  of it is an admirable one and I would  not

quarrel with it, but the practical application  of

it is quite another matter. On whom is the onus to

be placed of preventing admission: the promoter of the

entertainment  whose  only  recourse  will  be  to

demand  the production of identity cards from  the

majority of his would-be patrons - if identity cards

can be accepted as evidence of age; or the parents

or  guardians  who should in fact be  responsible?

"X"  films  for  adults only are approved  in  the

United Kingdom and I know cinema proprietors  have

great  difficulty in deciding whether a  child  is

above  or below the prescribed age. In this multi-racial  community, I would challenge the Hon. the

Assistant Minister, if 100 children aged either 15

or  16  years were ranged up in front of  him,  to

place  them in the right category from looking  at

them. And should the dividing line be 16? Why  not

15  or  17? How did the Government arrive at  this

figure? These are some of the questions which, we

will agree in this House I think, need further and

very careful consideration and I would say, in all

honesty,  that  on most of them, I  have  an  open

mind. But the basis of a Bill of this kind is  not

in  the  clauses  of the Bill itself  but  in  the

machinery  and  the  rules  which  the  Government

advances  to  make them work. That  is  the  vital

responsibility of the Government of the day rather

than of this Assembly.



<br><br>10.50 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng (Queenstown):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the introduction of this Bill is

most  welcome. As a matter of fact, in my opinion,

I  think  that  this  Bill seeks  to  control  the

"Funland"  operators of juke-boxes and pin-tables.

This  is  far  long overdue and it has  taken  the

Government  six years to consider the introduction

of  this  Bill.  However, it is better  late  than

never. The shops in which these pin-tables or juke-boxes  are operated do not only disturb  or  annoy

the  neighbours  but they also at  the  same  time

encourage the proper trading shops to change their

businesses  and  set themselves  up  as  "Funland"

operators.  Most  of  the shops  which  find  that

business  is slackening nowadays prefer  to  close

down  their  businesses and set themselves  up  as

"Funland"  or "Gayland" operators. Some  of  these

Funland operators of "games", as they are called,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 345</b></font><br><br>



are  in  fact  encouraging gambling  within  their

premises, like a certain case that was decided  in

court recently.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In principle, the Bill is good but there are some

clauses  in  this  Bill which can  be  subject  to

abuse,  for example, the clause which gives powers

to  only  one single man - a Licensing Officer.  The

discretion of one single man is apt to  be  abused

by  either the Licensing Officer himself or any of

his  junior  officers  who  investigate  before  a

licence  is considered. I also know that there  is

another  clause in this Bill which allows  appeals

to  the Minister but whatever appeals are made  to

the  Minister, they are always considered  on  the

recommendation of the Licensing Officer.  When  an

application for a licence is made to the Licensing

Officer, he sends out his investigators or  junior

officers  to  investigate and make a  report.  The

report  is submitted to the Licensing Officer  and

he  makes his decision. Should the appeal  against

the  refusal of granting a licence come before the

Minister,  the Minister has to base his discretion

on  the report from the Licensing Officer and  his

junior officers. So it is rather difficult for the

Minister  to  decide favourably and he  will  then

have   to   stand   by   his  Licensing   Officer.

Furthermore, Sir, the powers vested in one  single

man  will  also encourage corruption.  Members  of

this  Assembly and the City Council have  promised

that they will wipe out corruption. The passing of

this  Bill  at any time today or after its  Second

Reading  will  certainly make us a  party  to  the

encouragement of corruption. What is  there,  Sir,

to  prevent the Licensing Officer from being tempted  into  corruption? He can try his very best  to

make  the granting of an application for a licence

as  difficult  as  possible.  Naturally,  when  an

applicant submits an application, he wants  it  to

be approved and if difficulties arise, there is no

other   alternative  than  to  seek  the  backdoor

source - and  I  am quite sure that  the  Government

know  what  that backdoor source is. On the  other

hand, Sir, if the Licensing Officer is a friend of

one  applicant  and  is not  friendly  to  another

applicant he could certainly show more favours  to

his  friend  than to the other man. Is this  fair,

Sir? I will quote an instance. Mr A



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 346</b></font><br><br>



is  the Licensing Officer and Mr B is friendly to

him.  Mr  B  submits his application  and  it  is

approved but Mr C may have his application turned

down  by  Mr A through the influence  of  Mr  B,

although his shop may be very near to that of  Mr

B.  Is  this fair to one and all? I do  not  think

that this is so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the case of licences for hotels and bars,

I  understand that the authority is  vested  in  a

Board  of Licensing Justices comprising a Chairman

and  a  few members of the Justices of the  Peace.

Even  restaurants  or eating-houses,  which  is  a

matter  for  the City Council, are also considered

by  the  Health  Committee of  the  City  Council.

Though the Health Officer has a good say in it, he

has got  to  submit  his  report  to  the   Health

Committee and the Health Committee after  deciding

on  the  application has to submit it to the  full

Board or Council for confirmation. So you can  see

very well in this case that it is not one man  who

makes his decision but a number of persons forming

a Board or a Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a new piece of legislation and I

fully agree with the Member for Tanglin (Mr John Ede)

that  there are advantages and disadvantages in  a

Board  of Licensing Justices when compared with  a

Licensing  Officer.  There  may  be  cases   where

immediate attention is needed such as small shows,

and so on. Well, in those cases, they can then  be

decided  by the Licensing Officer but where  these

juke-boxes or pin-tables are concerned,  there  is

no necessity for a rush or urgent case-sitting. It

can  certainly be referred to a Board of Licensing

Justices.  We should consider the applications  in

the   same   way   as  those  for  bars,   hotels,

restaurants,  coffee-shops  or  eating-houses.   I

think   that  Government  should  specify  certain

categories   which  can  be  considered   by   the

Licensing  Officer and certain categories  by  the

Board  of  Licensing  Justices  because,  if   you

classify or band the whole thing into one, it will

be  rather difficult for the Licensing Officer  or

the  Board of Justices to make decisions.  As  the

Member  for Tanglin rightly pointed out, we should

have  two separate bodies and I am quite sure that

the  Government  could specify certain  categories

in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 347</b></font><br><br>



this Bill for each body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad that the Government is going to send

this  Bill to Select Committee as we have  got  to

take  public  opinion. The Member for Tanglin  him

self  is  a  man  who  is closely  connected  with

entertainment professionally and as an amateur and

I  am  quite sure that he would like to  give  his

views  to the Select Committee. There may be  juke

box  or pin-table operators who also want to  give

their  views. We should not be accused of  rushing

through or forcing upon the people a Bill of  this

nature. So I welcome the statement that this  Bill

is to be referred to Select Committee.



<br><br>10.55 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy (Minister for Commerce and Industry) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr J. M. Jumabhoy):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I did not intend to

speak  on  this Bill and I have not  much  opinion

either way on the matters that were raised by  the

two Members of the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there was one matter that was raised by

both of them and that was the question of abuse of

certain  powers given to one man: maybe he  is  an

official or when it comes to an appeal it  is  the

Minister.  Sir, the question raises  an  issue  on

principle  and  that  is that in  the  present-day

life,  there are thousands of matters, Sir,  which

require  to  be regulated in order that  relations

between citizen and citizen of the State and  also

between  the  citizen and the State  are  properly

conducted,  and also that the obligations  of  the

citizen  to  the State are properly  carried  out.

Now,  in  every-day life today, there are hundreds

of   matters  which  require  approval  from  some

authority or other and therefore the question does

arise  as to who should be responsible for  giving

the necessary approval for all these small things,

like  hawkers' licences - in this case, the licences

given by the Licensing Officer - and also who should

be  responsible for refusal to grant such licences

or  who  should  be responsible for revoking  such

licences   and  where  the  appeal   should   lie.

Normally,  in a democratic society,  Sir,  one  is

very chary of giving away to individuals powers



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 348</b></font><br><br>



which   could  be  exercised  by  the   individual

unfairly  and  could be abused. In a  totalitarian

society  and  in communist countries,  of  course,

there  is  no question of abuse of powers  because

all the powers are vested with certain individuals

and  nobody  dares to query as to the  rights  and

wrongs  of decisions of those individuals because,

if  they  do, well they get locked up.  There  are

hundreds  of  matters that arise every  day  which

require   approvals  and  disapprovals,  but   the

question arises: how far should those persons who make the laws  of

the  country go in order to create machinery which

would  be  the machinery responsible for  granting

such  approvals;  whether the  Legislature  should

want in every case that approvals and disapprovals

and appeals should go to a tribunal or a court  or

a  judge and if that is so, Sir, how far can  such

machinery  be  workable when  thousands  of  petty

cases  are concerned? That is a question that  the

Legislature has got to think about. If the Legislature  thinks that every case should go to  a  very

high  authority because injustice or  abuse  might

take  place, well then the State will have to  set

up a very complex judiciary machinery, which means

that   the   State  will  have  to   incur   heavy

expenditure. If the Legislature thinks that  these

matters  are not big enough to go to such  a  high

level  and  that  the official and,  in  cases  of

appeal, the Minister, could be competent to decide

and  could  decide, shall we say,  in  most  cases

impartially - because after all human nature has got

certain   failings -  well  then,   I   think   the

Legislature should say, "Right, we draw the  limit

here  and beyond this, we think individuals should

be  responsible." I think that is a question which

Members will have to consider carefully because it

means  involving the State in a lot of expenditure later.



<br><br>11 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I welcome this Bill being

committed to a Select Committee. I am not  talking

from  the  point of view of entertainment  in  the

form  of strip-tease shows, cinemas or other kinds

of  shows; but I am drawing the attention  of  all

sports organisations and youth clubs to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 349</b></font><br><br>



the    definition    of     "public entertainment" under clause 2 (i).  We  know  that

Government intends to control public entertainment

for  the benefit and protection of the people,  to

see  that  what is good is shown to  them;  but  I

certainly  feel that it is also the  duty  of  the

Government not to retard healthy activities  which

come under this definition. If this Bill should go

through, then all forms of activities indulged  in

by  sports  organisations, youth clubs,  and  even

cultural associations will have to come under this

definition. No matter what they do, they will have

to  seek permission to get a licence. Under clause

15 the Minister doubtless may by order exempt them

from  obtaining a licence, but until such promises

are  incorporated into the law, all  organisations

which run sporting contests such as boxing matches

and  football  matches to which  the  public  have

access  will  have  to come  for  a  licence.  The

tournaments  which  the  youth  clubs  run   among

themselves  are,  according  to  this  definition,

public  entertainment, and if we are going to  put

difficulties  in  their  way,  then  we  will   be

retarding  their healthy growth. I hope  that  the

Select Committee, when they come to consider  this

Bill, will take this into consideration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also hope that the lectures, talks, debates,

plays  and  concerts staged by such  organisations

solely  for the purpose of adding to the knowledge

of  the members and their friends should also come

under  the  category  to  be  exempted  from  this

provision of the law, or else we may, on  the  one

hand,  protect  the public from undesirable  shows

but,  on  the  other hand, retard  the  growth  of

healthy and useful activities.



<br><br>11.02 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Nair, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Nair -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Nair:</b> Yes, Sir, I think the main argument

against  having a Licensing Board is the  question

of time in coming to a decision. The definition of

"public  entertainment" is  so  wide  that  it  is

necessary to come to a decision quickly,  and  the

formality and delays incurred by a Licensing Board

would, in my opinion, make it unsuitable.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 350</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same argument also applies to an Appeals

Board.  Here  again  the  argument  is  that   the

formality and delays of an Appeals Board would  be

unsuitable  to deal with public entertainment.  We

did   consider   having  a  board  for   licensing

entertainments, but we felt that in the  interests

of  both the Government and the applicants  for  a

licence, the system as suggested in the Bill would

be more satisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of cancellation and the

forfeiture  of bond has been raised by the  Member

for  Tanglin. It is not desirable in the interests

of  implementing this Bill that we  should  invite

lawyers,  etc, to appear before the Minister  when

appeals  are heard, but there is nothing  to  stop

the Minister from calling the applicant should  he

require  further information to be  placed  before

him before a final decision is taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the standards of shows like strip-tease, as mentioned by the hon. Member, I do not

think  there will be much difficulty, Sir, because

we  have  to  make  rules.  We  could  either  put

something  into the rules or the Government  could

have some sort of policy which could be applied in

the case of applications for shows. I do not think

we have had many complaints about this in the past

and  I  hope that in the event of this Bill  being

implemented  there  will not  be  many  complaints

regarding the standardisation of these shows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of the powers of the police

under  clauses 16 and 17 has been raised. We  gave

very careful consideration to this question and we

came  to  the conclusion that it is not  right  to

mention in this Bill that the powers of the police

should  be restricted to the rank of an inspector.

It  may well be that at the time of the commission

of  an  offence,  namely,  the  violation  of  any

conditions,  a  police constable is  on  duty  and

therefore  no action can be taken until  a  police

inspector  arrives; and it is not  easy,  Sir,  to

have  so many inspectors supervising these  shows.

But,  however, if at any time it is found  that  a

police  constable or any other police officer  has been so



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



foolish  as  to act, I can assure the hon.  Member

that appropriate action will be taken against  him

for his action.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of admission of children under

the  age  of  16 has been raised and,  as  I  have

mentioned  earlier  in  my  speech,  the  specific

reason  for  committing this Bill to a Select  Committee is to discuss the matter in more detail.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Serangoon has mentioned

youth club activities. In my speech earlier on,  I

have  specifically mentioned that  exemption  from

control,  either  in whole or in  part,  of  other

kinds  of public entertainment the nature of which

cannot  be  readily perverted to ends contrary  to

the  state  interests will  be  made.  It  is  the

Government's  policy, Sir, to  exempt  all  normal

healthy activities of the community - schools, youth

clubs, athletic associations and so on - and I  can

assure  the  hon.  Member that there  will  be  no

restriction at all on any entertainment  which  is

of   a  healthy  nature  and  beneficial  to   the

community.  Here  again,  under  clause   15   the

Minister has unfettered discretion, and I am  sure

he  will  use  it  in the best  interests  of  the

community.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not think I have anything more to say

except  to mention that all the main points raised

by  hon. Members will be duly considered in Select Committee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of

Mr  Speaker as Chairman and seven Members  to  be

nominated  by  the  Committee of  Selection.  (Mr Nair).



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 351</b></font><br><br>



<div align="center"><b>FACTORIES BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>11.08 a.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr  A.  J. Braga (on behalf of the Minister  for Labour and Welfare, Dr Lim  Yew  Hock)</b>:  Mr Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  His

Excellency the Governor's consent to proceed  with

this  Bill and move, "That the Bill be now read  a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 352</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has for some time considered the

minimum standards of health, safety and welfare of

workers  in factories, and a factory is the  place

where  workmen  spend the greater  part  of  their

lives. Up to now the standards of safety have been

laid  down  in  the  Machinery Ordinance  (Chapter

223),  which was brought into operation  in  1921,

and amended by Ordinances No. 11 of 1931, No. 34 of 1935, No. 14 of 1937, No. 33 of 1952, No. 37 of 1952, and No. 4 of 1954.  That  Ordinance provides for the inspection

of boilers, engines and other machinery and the re

gulation,  control and working of such  machinery.

It  has  however no provision relating to electric

or portable machinery.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Protection of Workers Ordinance (Chapter 152), amended by Ordinance No. 37 of 1952, provided for protection against disease and

accidents   of   workers  engaged   in   dangerous

occupations, but it has never been implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither of these two Ordinances is really

suitable   for  present-day  conditions.   It   is

considered,   therefore,  that  they   should   be

repealed and the Factories Bill introduced to make

working   conditions  in  factories  in  Singapore

conform  with internationally recognised standards

as   laid   down  by  the  Inter-rational   Labour Organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be realised that in passing such a Bill

we  are  looking after the interests of more  than

120,000  persons, who represent about  one-quarter

of   the   total  population  who  are   gainfully

employed.  This  Bill is primarily  based  on  the

United  Kingdom legislation which follows  closely

the International Labour Organisation's convention

and  recommendations. It is necessary in  a  legislation of this magnitude to have some modification

to  suit  local conditions. This has been done  in

consultation  with the Singapore  Labour  Advisory

Board,  the  City  Council and representatives  of

consulting engineers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Representatives of the armed services are in

agreement  with  the proposed application  of  the

provisions of the Bill to their establishment,  as

sub-clause  (4) of clause 73 has been incorporated

at their request.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 353</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of this Bill is to set down the

minimum standards of health, safety and welfare of workers in factories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The operation of the Bill will involve

Government  in  an expenditure  of  the  order  of

$146,000  per  annum of which $59,000  is  largely

made  up  of  the salaries of extra  staff  which,

together  with the present staff in the  Factories

Inspectorate  of  the Labour Department,  will  be

needed to implement the provisions of the Bill. To

a  large  extent, however, this is  offset  by  an

anticipated revenue of $98,000 per annum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interpretation of the expression "factory"

covers premises in which manual labour is used for

a  wide  number  of purposes. The remaining  parts

cover  provisions  for  health,  safety,  welfare,

administration and penalties for offences  against

any   provisions  of  the  Bill.  The  explanatory

statements  briefly  cover  the  purposes  of  the

various clauses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is proposed, Sir, should this motion be

carried, to submit the Bill to a Select Committee,

it  is hardly necessary for me to go through it in

detail. I now move that the Bill be read a  Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>11.13 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, while we welcome the introduction of the

Factories Bill, I must draw attention to the large

number  of  premises  or trades  which  will  come

within the definition of "factory". We must always

remember  that in Singapore there are niany  small

traders who have a little place where they earn  a

living for themselves and their families. In  many

such  places  you  will  probably  find  that  the

workmen consist of members of the family and maybe

one  or  two  more other workers. I refer  to  the

premises  as  defined in clause 6  (1)  (a).  Sir,

tailor shops and dress shops, whether they are big

or  small,  come  within this  category.  Sundries

shops - they do a bit of packing of articles  to  be

sold - will  also  come  under this  category.  Even

fishermen repairing their nets seem to come within



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 354</b></font><br><br>



this  definition. If this Bill is going  to  cover

such  a wide range of trades, I believe it is  not

going to encourage people to expand their business

or try to earn a living.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What people hate most, I think, especially the

small  people, is to have a health officer  coming

along  and  poking his nose into their houses  and

saying,  "Look, you may be carrying on a  business

on  your own, but this is under the definition  of

`factory' and you must not have this done here  or

that   done  there.  Also,  you  do  not  have   a

sufficient amount of safeguards." These  pinpricks

should be removed. We all know that health, safety

and  welfare  are very important  factors,  but  I

certainly feel that we must not overdo it. This is

the  East  and it has to learn. We are adapting  a

great  deal of things from the West, but until  we

progress to a certain standard where we can be compared  with  the West, it should be  our  duty  to

encourage  the small businessmen to  expand  their

business  and  help them along. If this  Bill  has

this  in view, I am for it, but if it is going  to

be  another source of nuisance for the  people  of

Singapore, then I think we will have to  fight  it

out  in  the  Select Comniittee to see that  small

businessmen are allowed to carry on their business

without interference from the Nosy Parkers.



<br><br>11.17 a.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Siak Kew -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Siak Kew (Nominated):</b> Sir, on a broad

principle,  there is not very much  in  this  Bill

that  we  can  quarrel with. It  is  properly  the

concern of Government that factory conditions  are

such that the workers' health and safety should be

properly  protected.  But we  must  remember  that

Government is at the same time trying to encourage

industry, and therefore care must be taken to  see

that  the small industries especially are not  too

much  affected,  and  that not  much  hardship  is

involved  in the implementation of the regulations

of  the  Bill.  The  cost to the small  industries

would  increase  if  they have  to  observe  these

regulations, and there are some regulations  where

they  cannot even afford to put up the capital  in

order  to comply with them. I think it is  clearly

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 355</b></font><br><br>



intention  of  the  Government to  exempt  certain

small industries from these hardships.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that clause 6 (4) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No premises shall be deemed to be a

factory  in  which less than six  persons  are  employed ...".



<br><br>Therefore,  the figure that will come  within  the

scope  of  this  Bill  is  six.  Imagine  a  small

business employing six persons of mixed sexes - male

and female. Under the Bill it will have to provide

items like separate sanitation, washing facilities

and  so forth, as laid down in clauses 17 and  51.

In a small business there might easily be no space

for  these  facilities, and even  if  there  were,

these  could  easily  cost quite  a  few  thousand

dollars  in  order to qualify for the  meaning  of

"proper separate accommodation".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the solution is that until we can clear

the  major portion of our slums in Singapore,  the

average working place is still a better place from

the  health  point  of  view  than  the  congested

cubicles in which the major portion of the workers

have  to  live, and we certainly will be depriving

the  worker  of a job if there is no common  sense

balance  struck  between the  conditions  existing

here and the conditions as envisaged in the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether the Government has taken a

careful  survey  of the small industries  and  the

number of people employed in each of them, but  in

order   to  avoid  possible  hardships  to   these

industries  which  the  Government  is  trying  to

encourage,  I would strongly urge that the  number

to   be   exempted  from  the  interpretation   of

<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Minister, in reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the sole intention

of  this Bill is to protect cottage industries and

the workers who work there. As was pointed out  by

the hon. Member who spoke last, clause 6 (4) says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"No premises shall be deemed to be a factory in

which  less  than six persons are employed  or  in

which no mechanical power,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 356</b></font><br><br>



steam  boiler,  steam container,  steam  receiver,

cast  iron  underfired vulcaniser, air  receiver,

refrigerating  plant  pressure  receiver,  or  gas

plant  is  used, or in which no highly inflammable

or  noxious  substance  is  manipulated,  used  or

created."



<br><br>That in itself indicates Government's intention to

protect the small industries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to clause 17, Sir, which again was raised by the last speaker, it says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sufficient and suitable sanitary conveniences

for the persons employed in the factory

shall  be provided, . . . such conveniences  shall

afford  proper separate accommodation for  persons of each sex."



<br><br>If the latter is objectionable, it can be taken up

by the Select Committee. All the points which have

been  brought up by the two speakers will no doubt

be  considered by the Select Committee. Sir, I beg

to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of

Mr  Speaker as Chairman and seven Members  to  be

nominated  by  the  Committee of  Selection.  (Mr Braga).

<div align="center"><b>BETTING (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>11.24 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under the existing provisions of the

Betting Ordinance the police can make an entry and

search only upon the authority of a warrant signed

by  a Justice of the Peace after the submission of

written  information  on oath  and  after  further

enquiry which the Justice of the Peace may deem to

be  necessary  has been conducted.  Speedy  police

investigation  and  the  apprehension   of   those

breaking  the law are often impossible  when  such

investigation has to be preceded by the contacting

of   a  Justice  of  the  Peace,  the  laying   of

information before him and the formal issue of the

necessary   warrant.   Secondly,   those    giving

information are often unwilling to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 357</b></font><br><br>



appear  and  repeat their information  before  a

stranger  in the person of the Justice. Finally,

the  time  involved in arranging for depositions

to  be sworn before a Justice of the Peace  adds

to  the delay in initiating action against those

breaking the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, owing to the frequent necessity of

obtaining  such  warrants  to  search   premises

without  delay,  the practice arose  some  years

ago,  following that in the United  Kingdom,  of

appointing  police officers as Justices  of  the

Peace.  This  practice is open to objection  and

has in fact been stopped now for some time past,

since the exercise of judicial or quasi-judicial

functions   and   the  exercise   of   executive

functions  should properly be kept separate  and

distinct, and because it is undesirable  that  a

police  officer issuing search warrants  on  his

own  information  or that of some  other  person

closely associated with him should appear to  be

exercising  a judicial discretion in  doing  so.

Nevertheless,  Sir, it is highly desirable  that

police  investigations should begin  immediately

on   receipt   of  information  concerning   the

commission  or intended commission of  a  crime,

and  the  purpose of clauses 2  and  3  of  this

amending  Bill, and of the two further Bills  of

which  I  shall  be  moving the  Second  Reading

immediately, is to remedy this present  position

and  to grant police officers not below the rank

of   Assistant  Superintendent  of  Police   the

necessary    authority    to    issue    written

authorisation for entry and search  of  premises

upon  written  information with which  they  are

satisfied  and  after any further  investigation

they deem to be necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I should point out that these

amendments  do  not  confer  any  indiscriminate

right   of  entry  and  search  on  the  police.

Warrants  to  search  or  written  authority  to

search  are  still a prerequisite to  the  entry

into  premises  and such warrants  can  only  be

issued  by  a  Justice of  the  Peace,  and  the

written  authority  by senior  police  officers,

that is, Assistant Superintendents and above.  I

should  add  that the powers now suggested  have

always  been  vested  in the  police  under  the

equivalent  legislation  in  the  Federation  of

Malaya.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is a further measure to strengthen

the  hands  of  the  police in  controlling  the

activities  of gangsters and members  of  secret

societies.  Amongst  the  activities  of  secret

societies, the organisation of gambling holds an

important  place,  and not only  do  members  of

secret societies organise gambling for their own

profit,  but  through  the  operation  of  their

methods  of extortion, they prey upon all  those

who make their living from gambling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Common gaming houses are, in fact, common

resorts  for gangsters, robbers and thieves  who

are   prone  to  gambling  and  often  find  the

wherewithal  for  their gambling  through  their

criminal activities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rest, Sir, the reasons which I gave in

moving the amendments to the Betting Ordinance a

few  minutes  ago hold good in  respect  of  the

amendments to this Ordinance too.

of a secret society are holding a meeting, without

the   necessity  of  having  to  swear   out   the

<div align="center"><b>SOUTHERN ISLANDS LOCAL COUNCIL BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>11.40 a.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat (Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Local Government, Lands and Housing (Inche Abdul Hamid Bin Haji Jumat):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency the Governor's

consent to proceed with this Bill. I beg to  move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the main purpose of this Bill is to provide

for  the creation of a statutory board which  will

be  called the Southern Islands Local Council  for

the  local government administration of the  group

of  islands  to  the south and south-west  of  the

Island  of  Singapore,  described  in  the   First

Schedule  to  the  Bill,  which  are  at   present

administered  by the Rural Board. As hon.  Members

will be aware, the McNeice Committee on Local  Government  in  its Report recommended that,  on  the

reorganisation of the local government  system  in

Singapore,  the  administration of  these  islands

should be the responsibility of the central govern

ment under the Ministry of Local Government, Lands

and  Housing. This recommendation was accepted  by

the Government, as is stated in the White Paper on

Government Policy, Sessional Paper Cmd. No. 30  of 1956.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Local Council will have a simple

constitution  consisting of the  District  Officer

(Islands),  as Chairman with a number  of  elected ketuas and three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 361</b></font><br><br>



other persons to be appointed. It is the intention

that  there  will be nine ketuas to be elected  in

accordance with the division of these islands into

nine  groups, each group constituting an electoral

division, with the population of each more or less

evenly distributed among the groups. Provision  is

made  for  the election of ketuas by ballot,  each

electoral division returning one candidate to  the

Board.  The  franchise will  be  extended  to  all

residents in the islands who are of full age  and

capacity  and  have been resident there  for  five

years and are able to speak either English, Malay,

Tamil or any of the Chinese dialects commonly used

and  understood by the people on the islands.  The

three  appointed members will be unofficials  who

will be chosen from prominent residents living  in these islands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Local Council, as the local authority for

the Southern Islands, will be multilingual and its

proceedings  may  be conducted in English,  Malay,

Tamil  or any commonly understood Chinese dialect.

It will be given powers to carry out works for the

improvement  of communications, the  promotion  of

sanitation  and cleanliness and the  abatement  of nuisances.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General powers will also be given to the Council

to   make   by-laws  for  good  local   government

administration,  and it will be noted,  Sir,  from

clause  16  (3) of the Bill that these powers  are quite wide.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Local Council will have further powers to

levy  rates on properties and collect other  taxes

and  fees,  and  the deficit between  revenue  and

expenditure  will  be met by annual  contributions

from   the   Government  on  the  same  lines   as

government  contributions  to  the  present  Rural Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the Bill will ensure that

these  islands will receive, through their elected

representatives  sitting on the Local  Council,  a

more  adequate and closer attention in  regard  to

the needs and the provision of amenities, as these

islands,  by reason of their detachment  from  the

mainland  and  the poverty in which the  islanders

are living, present special problems. The creation

of this Local Council will meet a long-felt



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 362</b></font><br><br>



need to better the living conditions of  the people living in the Southern Islands.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill proposes to amend section 58 of the

principal  Ordinance for the purpose of  providing

adequate penalties for offences committed  by  co-operative insurance societies. There is now  a  co-operative insurance society called the Malayan Co-operative   Insurance   Society   functioning   in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The penalties provided for by section 58 of the

principal   Ordinance,  which  are  a   fine   not

exceeding   $50  for  any  offence   against   the

Ordinance,  are obviously inadequate for  offences

relating  to  insurance business. It is  therefore

proposed  by  this amending Bill to  increase  the

penalties  to  bring  them into  line  with  those

provided  for  in  the  Life  Assurance  Companies

Ordinance. Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 364</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 provides for the supervision of such

societies from complying with sections 12  and  19

Societies Ordinance already provides for stringent

measures relating to audit and the dissolution  of

the  Governor to proceed with this Bill, and  move "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill, Sir, deals with a large number of

amendments  to  the  Merchant Shipping  Ordinance.

Some of these amendments are required to bring our

Ordinance    into   line   with   its   Federation

counterpart.  Others are required to meet  changed

conditions today. The nature of the amendments  is

such  that  none  of them should  arouse  any  controversy.  As each amendment is explained  in  the

Explanatory Note appended to the Bill, I will  now

deal with only the more salient features.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 365</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 12 of the Merchant Shipping Ordinance

exempts  fishing  boats  exclusively  employed  in

fishing  on the Colony and Federation coasts  from

the  provisions of Part II of the Ordinance  which

relates  to master mariners and seamen  and  which

includes  the manning scales of vessels. Clause  3

of  the Bill seeks to extend this exemption to  in

clude  vessels  solely transporting fish,  vessels

towing  nibong  poles  for  fishing  stakes,   and

vessels  engaged in the repair of fishing  stakes.

At  the  same time, it removes the restriction  of

the  area of exemption which is now limited to the

Colony and Federation coasts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 raises from 10 tons to 25 tons the

minimum tonnage of vessels required to be  manned

by   third-class  engine-drivers  and  gives   the

Minister  power  to exempt vessels  from  this  requirement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 transfers from a Court of Inquiry to

the  Minister  the  power to  deal  with  a  local

certificate of competency, the holder of which has

been  convicted  of  a criminal offence  connected

with  his work. To assist the Minister in  dealing

expeditiously  with  collisions  between   harbour

craft,  this clause enables the Minister  to  deal

with   certificates  of  competency  of  helmsmen,

steersmen and engine-drivers, thereby avoiding the

complicated  procedure of a Court  of  Inquiry  in

minor cases such as these.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 29 enables a Court of Investigation

convened  in Singapore to cancel or suspend  local

certificates   of   competency   issued   in   the

Federation of Malaya or in Sarawak. This has  been

agreed to with the Governments concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ships owned by foreign states are exempted under

the  Ordinance  from the payment of Sunday  labour

fees.  This  exemption was originally intended  to

apply to ships of war, but certain states now  run

merchant  vessels. Clauses 41 and 46  qualify  the

existing   exemption  to  make   the   state-owned

merchant vessels liable to pay Sunday labour  fees

while   leaving  the  other  state-owned   vessels

exempt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a provision in the Singapore Port Rules, 1957, which prohibits the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 366</b></font><br><br>



discharge  of  oil into the waters  of  the  port.

Clause  44  extends this prohibition  to  all  the

waters  of the Colony and will ,assist in  dealing

with  complaints that bathing beaches, marine life

and  coastal  flora and fauna have been  adversely

affected by, the discharge of oil from vessels  in

Colony waters.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this amending Bill and the three following

Bills    are   primarily   necessitated    by    a

reorganisation of the Royal Navy and the Royal Air

Force,  which  is in turn largely consequent  upon

the  Federation  of  Malaya becoming  independent.

Certain  appointments  the holders  of  which  are

vested  with statutory functions under these  laws

have  now  been abolished, and it is necessary  to

transfer the functions to the holders of the appro

priate appointments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill is a short and formal measure, Sir, and

there is little to add to the explanation given in

the Bill. Following the reorganisation to which  I

have  referred,  the appointments of  Air  Officer

Commanding,   R.A.F.  Malaya,  and   Air   Officer

Commanding, R.A.F. Singapore, have been abolished,

and  this Bill therefore seeks to transfer to  the

appropriate officers the authority previously exer

cised by the two Air Officers Commanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have already indicated, Sir, in moving the

Military  Maneuvers  (Amendment)  Bill,  the  main

purpose  of  this  Bill is also to  recognise  the

change  in organisation of both the R.A.F. in  the

Far East and the Malayan Auxiliary Air Force as  a

consequence of the independence of the  Federation

of Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formerly the Commander of the Auxiliary Air Force

as  a  whole was appointed jointly by the Governor

and  the High Commissioner in the Federation,  the

Ordinance  providing that the person so appointed,

if  he were not the Air Officer Commanding, R.A.F.

Malaya  in  person,  should be under  his  orders.

Since  the  Federation  became  independent,   the

appointment of Air Officer Commanding, Malaya, has

been  abolished and a joint Commander is therefore

no  longer appropriate. The Bill accordingly seeks

to  provide for the appointment by the Governor of

a Commander of the Singapore section only who will

exercise, in regard to the Singapore section,  the

powers  formerly  exercised  by  the  Air  Officer

Commanding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken to make

certain  further amendments to the Ordinance.  The

first  of these is that the Bill seeks to  provide

for  a  Reserve  of  Airmen  in  addition  to  the

existing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 368</b></font><br><br>



Reserve  of Officers. Previously the functions  of

the  Malayan  Auxiliary Air Force  were  primarily

concerned with flying, and it is perhaps for  that

reason that the Ordinance originally provided only

for  a  Reserve of Officers. The primary role  has

now  however changed to the provision  of  fighter

control  units whose members undergo  lengthy  and

scientific training and whose task is to man radar

reporting  stations in the event of war or  threat

of  war.  It  is therefore desirable that  trained

members  of  such units should be available  in  a

reserve,  more especially since of all  the  local

forces it is the fighter control unit which  would

almost certainly be required to be mobilised in an

emergency at the shortest possible notice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Bill seeks to give recognition to

the  new status of Singapore citizenship by making

Singapore citizens eligible to join the force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Bill seeks to clarify a provision in

the  Ordinance regarding the payment  of  pensions

and  gratuities to widows and families of  members

who  die  from  injuries as well  as  from  wounds

received  in  the  course of  service.  Since  the

Ordinance  was  amended to permit members  of  the

Auxiliary  Air  Force  to  be  used  on   internal

security    duties,    this    clarification    is

particularly desirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency's consent

to  proceed  with this Bill. I beg to move,  "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this is the third of the amending Bills

required  to  reflect changes made in the  Service

organisations as a consequence of the independence

of  the  Federation  of Malaya. Certain  functions

under the parent Ordinance are vested in the  Flag

Officer,  Malayan Area, an appointment  which  has

now  been  abolished, the functions  of  the  post

having  been taken over by the Commander-in-Chief,

Far  East.  This Bill accordingly  seeks  to  give

legal recognition to this transfer of functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, Sir, opportunity has been taken to

make  certain further amendments to the Ordinance.

Firstly,  the Bill also recognises the new  status

of Singapore citizenship. Secondly, the Bill seeks

to give effect to a promise made by the Government

at  the  time  when the M.R.N.V.R.  Ordinance  was

amended last year to enable volunteers to be  used

on  internal security duties. Clause 8 of the Bill

seeks  to  provide for the award  of  pensions  or

gratuities to volunteers wounded or injured in the

course of their service, including service on



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



internal security duties, and also for the payment

of  pensions  or  gratuities  to  the  widows  and

families of such members who are killed or who die

of  wounds received in the course of, or  from  an

illness directly attributable to, their service as

such  members.  This clause brings the  M.R.N.V.R.

into line with the other volunteer forces.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken in the Bill

to  make various minor amendments to the Ordinance

in order to clarify, and in some cases to amplify,

its   provisions.  These  are  set  out   in   the

Explanatory  Statement to which I do not  think  I

need add. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee Wednesday, 16th July, 1958.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. B. David (Chief Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chief Secretary (Mr E. B. David):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have His Excellency's consent to

proceed  with this Bill. I beg to move, "That  the

Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it has always been customary in the

provisions  of  the Widows' and  Orphans'  Pension

Ordinance  to  keep in line with the corresponding

law  in  the Federation of Malaya, for the  reason

that  a  number of officers have at  times  served

under  both Governments and it has with some  been

largely  a  matter of chance to which scheme  they

have  been required to contribute throughout their

service. During the last few years there has  been

considerable consultation with the authorities  in

the Federation on the provisions of this Ordinance

following  an  actuarial examination  of  the  two

schemes  and the report of a Committee  which  was

set  up  before the war. As a result of these  consultations  and  subsequent discussions  with  the

Staff  Side  of the Singapore Civil Service  Joint

Council,   which   have  taken  some   time,   the

amendments   now  proposed  in   this   Bill   are

introduced to accord with the amending legislation

which has already been enacted in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 2 of this Bill seeks to regularise the

position  of  officers on probation  or  agreement

with prospects of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



permanency  in a pensionable office  between  11th

December, 1950, and 1st January, 1955. Before  the

earlier  date,  only  persons on  the  pensionable

establishment were admitted into the scheme.  With

effect  from  that date, however,  the  Federation

extended  the  application  of  their  scheme   to

persons  on probation or agreement with  prospects

of  permanency. One of the aims of  the  Singapore

Amendment  Ordinance,  1952,  was  to   keep   the

Singapore Ordinance in line with the Federation in

this  respect.  This  was not,  however,  achieved

owing  to  the  failure to provide  that  the  new

definition of "public servant" introduced  by  the

1952  amending Ordinance should have retrospective

application  to  December 1950. Insertion  of  the

words  "on  or  after the 11th  day  of  December,

1950",  proposed  in clause 2,  will  repair  this

omission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making provision in the 1952 amending

Ordinance, for officers on probation or  agreement

to  be  required to contribute to this scheme,  it

was  also  provided that they could elect  not  to

become, or to cease to be, contributors during the

period  of  probation  or  agreement,  within  six

months  of the date of publication of the amending

Ordinance. The Ordinance was published in  October

1952  but  it  was unfortunately not brought  into

effect  until  17th  August,  1956,  when  it  was

brought into force retrospectively to 1st January,

1955,  by  which time the period of election  had

long  expired. Officers on probation or  agreement

appointed  between 1950 and August 1956 were  thus

denied  the  right to elect not to  become  or  to

cease  to be contributors to the scheme, with  the

result  that they are now regarded as contributors

during  the period of their probation or agreement

and  have  been required by the Directors  of  the

scheme to pay arrears of contribution. In order to

afford  them  the opportunity for  election  which

they have hitherto been denied, clause 3 seeks  to

provide for the necessary extension of the  period

of notice under subsection (1) of section 5 of the

main Ordinance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 373</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 of the amending Bill deals with the

refund  of contributions to bachelors or  widowers

without dependent children. At present, when  such

officers retire, they cease to contribute and  are

paid  a  refund  of  only  50  per  cent  of   the

contributions made up to 31st December, 1954, and,

by  the amendment made in the 1952 Ordinance,  the

total  contributions  made  between  1st  January,

1955,  and the date of retirement. Clause 4  seeks

to   provide   for   the  full   refund   of   all

contributions  made  to  bachelors   or   widowers

without  dependent  children on their  retirement,

together with the payment of compound interest  at

the  rate  of  21  per cent. This will  bring  the

Singapore   legislation   into   line   with   the

Federation Ordinance, and has been agreed with the Staff Side.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Committee stage I shall be moving an

amendment to section 12 of the principal Ordinance

to  make  provision in respect  of  bachelors  and

widowers  without  dependent  children   who   are

removed from the service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 of the Bill regularises the position of

officers  who  are  contributors  to  the   United

Kingdom  Overseas Superannuation Scheme which  was

established on 1st January, 1955 and which  is  an

approved scheme for the purposes of section 17  of

the   principal  Ordinance.  Under  this   clause,

contributors to the superannuation scheme will  be

exempt  from making contributions under  the  main

Ordinance  so long as they continue to  contribute

to  the superannuation scheme. This amendment also

will  bring the Singapore Ordinance into line with

the Federation Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 6 and 7 make certain consequential

amendments  as  a result of the amendment  of  the

definition  of pensionable age introduced  by  the

amending Ordinance in 1952.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 seeks to provide for benefits in

certain circumstances to adopted children who have

not previously been catered for.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 clarifies the position in regard to

certain  officers on transfer from Palestine,  who

were  permitted to make a lump-sum payment to  the

Singapore Widows' and Orphans' Pension Scheme



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 374</b></font><br><br>



at  the  time  of  their  transfer  equal  to  the

accumulated contributions paid by the officer  and

by  the  Palestine Government under the  Palestine

Widows' and Pensions' Ordinance which was wound up

in 1948.

proceed  with this Bill and I beg to  move,  "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing Ordinance (Cap. 163), the

Federation   Government  has   since   1918   been

permitted   to   maintain  customs   stations   in

Singapore  for the purpose of collecting  duty  on

dutiable  goods  exported from the  Federation  by

rail.   Federation  customs  officers  have   been

authorised by warrant to perform certain functions

under  the Ordinance. These functions include  the

collection  of  duty,  the  search  of  goods  and

baggage within the limits of the station, and  the

power of arrest without warrant



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 378</b></font><br><br>



when  an offence has been committed. Under section

10  of the Ordinance, authorised officers have the

powers  of  officers  of  the  customs  under  the

Singapore  Customs Ordinance, and  have  power  to

enforce the provisions of the Ordinance in so  far

as  they  relate to the collection of  revenue  on

intoxicating liquors.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the years, the function of the

collection station established under the Ordinance

has  changed.  More and more it has tended  to  be

used  for the collection of duty on goods imported

into the Federation from Singapore rather than for

the collection of duty on goods exported from that

territory. At the present time, the major  portion

of  revenue  collected at the station  comes  from

imports. Commercial firms in Singapore have  found

it  increasingly convenient to ship goods into the

Federation through this station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is considered that the time has

come  to recognise this change of function of  the

collection   station,  and   to   regularise   its

operations by changing the provisions of the  law.

Consultations  to this end have taken  place  with

the  Federation Government and the Bill  which  is

now before the Assembly is the outcome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is to be expected, Sir, in the circumstances

the   overall  effect  of  the  Bill  is  to  give

extraterritorial  effect  in  Singapore   to   the

Federation  Customs  Ordinance,  1952,   and   the

majority  of the clauses of the Bill are based  on

that Ordinance which, in turn, is very similar  to

the Singapore Customs Ordinance (Cap. 160).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not deal with the individual provisions

of  the  Bill,  Sir.  They are described  in  some

detail in the explanatory note, and there is  also

attached to the Bill a list showing from where the

various clauses of the Bill are derived. This list

also  shows which clauses are new. It can be seen,

Sir, on pages 26 and 27 of the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 379</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, Sir, one or two clauses to

which I should invite attention. It will of course

be  realised that certain clauses of the Bill give

officers of the Federation Government considerable

powers  within  the  territory of  Singapore.  For

example, clauses 14 (2), 24 and 29 give Federation

customs officers power to examine the persons  and

baggage  of individuals at collection stations  in

Singapore.  The original intention was to  examine

passengers and their personal baggage en route  to

the  Causeway.  This was considered  desirable  in

order   to   avoid  a  long  delay   for   customs

examination  at Johore Bahru, and  to  enable  the

mail  train services to be accelerated. Recently,

however, the Federation Government has come to the

conclusion  that  it  would  be  better   if   the

examination  was  to  take place  in  the  railway

station at Singapore. Apparently, quite apart from

the  inconvenience  caused  tp  passengers  by  an

examination while the train is in motion, and from

the possibility that it might not be completed  in

time,  the  cost  of the staff  required  for  the

operation  would be out of all proportion  to  the

revenue   likely   to  be  collected.   In   the

circumstances,  it  is  now  suggested  that   the

examination  should  take  place  in  a  specially

fenced-off portion of the concourse of the railway

station.  The cost of establishing and maintaining

the  examination point will fall  on  the  railway

administration. This suggestion has been  examined

by the Ministries concerned from the point of view

of  physical and mechanical practicability, and no

objection  is  seen to it. All things  considered,

examination  prior to departure would probably  be

preferred by the large majority of passengers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that the Federation Government

does  not wish to establish a collection  station

at  Paya  Lebar  Airport for the time  being.  The

volume of traffic, both passenger and freight,  is

within  the  capacity  of  customs  staff  at  the

airports  in  the  Federation and  the  Federation

Government does not wish to incur the expense  of

maintaining a 24-



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 380</b></font><br><br>



hour duty roster of customs officers at Paya Lebar

Airport.  In  addition, there has as yet  been  no

demand  from the commercial interests in Singapore

for the establishment of such a station.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 17 to 19 of the Bill provide for the

examination in the General Post Office, Singapore,

with  the  consent  and  by arrangement  with  the

Controller of Posts, Singapore, of postal packages

addressed to destinations in the Federation. These

clauses  merely give legal sanction to a  practice

which  has  been followed for a number  of  years.

Singapore  is a considerable source of  supply  of

dutiable  goods for the Federation. From  time  to

time,  extensive  use  has  been  made  of  postal

packages to smuggle small dutiable articles,  like

watches  and  fountain pens, into the  Federation.

When  such traffic has been suspected, it has been

customary   for   the   Controller   of   Customs,

Federation   of   Malaya,  to  arEange   for   the

Controller of Posts, Singapore, to have all postal

packages for a certain destination in the  Federation  examined for a period of days. Normally,  no

packages  are  opened. If, however,  packages  are

found  which might contain dutiable goods, details

of  the  addresses  are  taken  and  forwarded  to

customs  officers  at  the  destinations  in   the

Federation so that action can be taken, to  bring

the  recipient  to book and to collect  duty.  The

examination is also sometimes used as a  check  on

the efficiency of customs staff in the Federation.

It  is unusual for more than two or three of these

examinations  to be required annually,  and  they

generally last for no more than three or four days

at a time. The examinations cause no inconvenience

or  dislocation  of business in Singapore  and  no

objection is seen to their being held.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 53, Sir, confers on authorised Federation

customs officers the powers of officers of customs

under  the Customs. Ordinance, Singapore, and  the

Dangerous  Drugs Ordinance, Singapore. Examination

of  the Ordinances in question indicates that  the

powers  so conferred, are wide and cover  all  the

legitimate   activities   of   customs    officers

operating:

under  the customs law in Singapore. In practice,

however, these powers will be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



limited to those which would follow in the  normal

way  from  the  discovery  of  an  offence  or   a

suspected offence against Singapore law during the

course   of   an  examination  at  an   authorised

passenger station. For example, a passenger to the

Federation might, on examination, be suspected  of

being connected with a gang of opium smugglers. It

might  be  imperative to follow the trail  without

delay.  Under clause 53, this operation  would  be

conducted   by   authorised   Federation   customs

officers  since the delay which might result  from

informing  the Singapore Customs Department  might

mean  that  the law-breakers might be  allowed  to

escape.  There would be no question of  Federation

Customs  officers exercising the powers  conferred

on  them  in  respect of matters not arising  from

examinations at collection stations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federation Government is fully aware of the

wideness  of  these  powers  and  has  given  an

assurance as to their use in the following terms:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Federation Government undertakes that the

powers  under the Singapore legislation  conferred

by  this  section will only be exercised  where  a

breach  of the Singapore legislation comes to  the

notice  of Federation Customs and Revenue officers

in  the  execution  of  their  duties  under  this

Ordinance."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is appreciated that the powers are wide,

it  is  considered that their grant will make  for

greater   efficiency   in   customs   control   in

Singapore.  The Government is satisfied  that  the

powers will not be abused.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will, Sir, be appreciated that an important

constitutional question is involved in  this  Bill

in  so  far  as  it gives officers  of  a  foreign

territory rights of search and detention over  the

person  and goods of citizens of Singapore in  the

territory  of  Singapore. Such an arrangement  can

only  be  contemplated because of the close  ties,

economic and otherwise, between the Federation  of

Malaya  and  Singapore. It would  be  out  of  the

question between Singapore and any other power. At

the  same time, the power o the Bill merely  seeks

to recognise practice and procedures, the majority

of which have been in force for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



a  great number of years in Singapore. It is  as

much for the benefit of Singapore traders as  for

the   Federation   of   Malaya   Government   that

collection  stations for import duties  should  be

established in Singapore. The arrangements for customs  examination of passengers' baggage prior  to

the  departure  of  the mail  train  are  for  the

benefit  of,  and are likely to be  welcomed  by,

travellers  generally. While  the  powers  granted

under  clause  53  are  perhaps  open  to  greater

objection   in   so  far  as  Federation   customs

officers, might exercise powers of search  and  detention outside the limits of collection stations,

the exercise of these powers is unlikely to affect

law-abiding  citizens of Singapore  and  can  only

make   for  greater  and  more  efficient  customs

control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr John Ede -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr John Ede:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I only want to refer

to  one clause in the Bill, and that is clause 24,

in   connection   with  the  Hon. the   Financial

Secretary's  statement  that  customs  examination

will  now  take  place  in the  Singapore  Railway

Station  instead of on the train en route  to  the

Causeway  as  was at one time contemplated.  In  a

question in this House over a year ago, I  pressed

for  the latter practice to be introduced in order

to reduce the journey time from Singapore to Kuala

Lumpur and other stations in the Federation.  Now,

Sir, the Hon. the Financial Secretary has not made

entirely clear whether time will in fact be  saved

in  the  journey under the new clause 24, nor  how

much  time will be taken up by customs examination

at  the Singapore Railway Station, and we will  be

grateful if he would enlighten us a little further

on the operation of this clause when he replies.



<br><br>3.04 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hart -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hart:</b> I cannot give precise details, Sir, but

I understand that, as a result of the operation of

this  particular clause, any delay other than that

required for the embarkation and disembarkation of

passengers at Johore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



Bahru  will be avoided. In short, trains will  now

stop  for  only  a  short time  at  Johore  Bahru.

Hitherto there have been long delays while customs

examinations have been made in Johore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the question of how long it will

take  to  examine all passengers  in  the  Railway

Station  at  Singapore, I  have  myself  put  that

question  to the Federation Government authorities

and they have given an assurance that every effort

will   be   made  to  see  that  it  is  done   as

expeditiously as possible and that all  passengers

are cleared by the time the train leaves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<div align="center"><b>LEGAL AID AND ADVICE (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.

<br><br>3.07 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. J. Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr  Braga  (on behalf of the Minister for  Labour and Welfare, Dr Lim Yew Hock)</b>: Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon. Members will recall that when the Legal  Aid

and  Advice  Ordinance was passed  in  June  1956,

certain  objections to the measure were raised  by

the  Singapore Bar Committee. Discussions with the

Bar  Committee resulted in ironing  out  areas  of

disagreement. This Bill now seeks to  give  effect

to  the  recommendations made by the Bar Committee

which have been accepted by the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the Bar Committee's recommendations was

that in the working of the scheme, some measure of

supervision  should  be  exercised  by  the  legal

profession,  although the Committee conceded  that

the service must be controlled and administered by

the Government. This point is met in clauses 2 and

3 of the Bill which respectively alters section 11

and  amends section 12 of the Legal Aid and Advice

Ordinance, 1956. It is now made incumbent  on  the

Director  of  Legal Aid that all applications  for

legal aid should be approved by a Board consisting

of the Director of Legal Aid and not less than two

advocates and solicitors from the panel maintained

by the Director of Legal Aid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In amending the provisos to section 16 and

subsection (1) of section 17 respectively  of  the

Legal  Aid  and Advice Ordinance, 1956, clauses  4

and  5  give  effect to the Bar Committee's  recommendation  that  an aided person should  have  the

right  to  have  his legal affairs  handled  by  a

lawyer of his own choice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the vexed question of fees

payable  to lawyers working under the scheme,  the

Minister  has power under section 28 of the  Legal

Aid and Advice Ordinance, 1956, to make



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



regulations  relating to fees and no amendment  to

the Ordinance is therefore necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bar Committee has decided to issue no

directive  to  members of the Bar with  regard  to

participation  in the scheme, and each  member  is

therefore  free to join the panel under section  4

of  the  Ordinance as he thinks fit. I  understand

that  several  members of the Bar  have  expressed

their willingness to participate in the scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is a minor amendment

that  I  propose to make, in page 3, line 14,  the

words  "the  appropriate  panel"  should  not   be

deleted   from   the  principal   Ordinance.   The

erroneous insertion was only discovered after  the Bill was printed.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The appropriate time to amend will be in Committee.



<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Yes, Sir. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>3.09 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

with  regard  to this Bill to assist those  people

who  need  legal  aid, I have in recent  times,  a

number of people coming to see me regarding  this.

They  have been very unfortunate in having lawyers

thrust on to them, and they have come along to see

me  complaining that their cases have  never  been

handled  properly. In one case, they  informed  me

that  the lawyer concerned never interviewed them.

They  waited  until the case came  up  before  the

court  and then at that time started dealing  with

his  client,  asking him a few questions,  and  in

most  cases the people who received legal aid were

really  receiving  a  very  shabby  form  of  aid.

Perhaps it may be that complaints of this type may

be  worth the Bar Committee's while to look  into,

but  I  certainly feel that if a person  receiving

aid  has  a  choice  of his lawyer  it  will  help

tremendously.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, I would say that if lawyers who are

rendering  aid  in  such cases  are  found  to  be

wanting  not  only  by  one  person  but  by  many

persons, then it



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



means that the work has not been properly done and

he might properly come off the schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always note that lawyers always talk about

fees  and  it is important to them as to how  much

money they would get out of a case. The amount  of

legal  assistance  seems to be  dependent  on  the

amount  of money received. Of course I have  heard

of  famous cases where people are charged sums  of

three  figures  and over and lawyers  refusing  to

handle cases, although deserving because all  that

the  client  can pay is a few hundred dollars.  I

think one former Member of the Assembly even  said

that his practice brought him well over $10,000  a

month.  What  I am thinking about is  so  many  of

these  lawyers  have been talking about  Socialism

and wanting to help the poor people and today even

the Bar Committee talks about fees. It pains me to

see  that those who talk loudest about helping the

poor  people are actually the people  who  try  to

ask, `How much shall we get for our service?'.



<br><br>3.12 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. C. H. Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. C. H. Lim (Nominated):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, as a member of the legal profession,

I  would  like to assure my friend the Member  for

Serangoon  that in my experience of more  than  25

years  of the Bar in Singapore, no member of  the

Bar,  having been assigned to look after the  case

of  a pauper, has ever failed in his duty. I would

like to assure this. House that I believe that the

information  given  to him  must  be  entirely  in

correct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee on the Bill. [Mr Braga.]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was an erroneous insertion and, as I said

it  was  discovered only when the Bill  had  been

printed.  The  deletion of these words  from  the

original  Ordinance would make the  section  meaningless.  The  section should now  read-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"17.-(1) Where a legal aid certificate is

granted  pursuant  to section 11  or  12  of  this

<div align="center"><b>(Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 14 of 1958)</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr T. M. Hart (Financial Secretary) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Financial Secretary (Mr T. M. Hart):</b> Sir, I have His Excellency the Governor's authority to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the sum of

$735,900 shall be supplied to the Government under

the  heads  of  expenditure and for  the  services

specified  in the Schedule contained in  Sessional Paper No. Cmd. 14 of 1958.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, of the 34 items in the Command Paper, all

but  12  refer  to  unforeseen  revotes  of  funds

already  voted by the Assembly. These applications

for  revotes are fully explained on the Paper  and

with  one  possible  exception  do  not  call  for

special comment. The 12 applications for new money

are   also  fully  explained  on  the  Paper.  The

majority  are for small amounts which do not  call

for additional comment. There are, however, one or

two  which hon. Members will no doubt wish  me  to amplify.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  who  have  been  engaged  in   the

constitutional discussions at different times will

appreciate  that, under the new Constitution,  the

position  of the Director of Audit and  the  Audit

Department  will  change  and  will  increase   in

importance.  Hitherto, the  Audit  Department  has

been  a  department of Government, and its duties,

other  than those prescribed by law or regulation,

are  laid down by the Government. Its officers are

subject  to  governmental discipline and  control.

With  the change in the Constitution, however,  it

is  essential  that  the  position  of  the  Audit

Department should be changed and that it should no

longer be a department of Government, but that  it

should be completely independent of the Government

and free from political influence of any kind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new status of the Director of Audit and the

Audit  Department will be recognised  in  the  new

Constitution.  In the circumstances,  quite  apart

from  the additional work and responsibility which

will fall on the Director of Audit as a result  of

the  termination  of the old connection  with  the

Auditor-General in Kuala Lumpur, it  is  desirable

that  the post should be regraded to take  account

of  the responsibility which will arise out of his

independent   position   in   the   hierarchy   of

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been argued with some force that,

following the example of the Federation of Malaya,

the  post should be upgraded to Grade C, that  is,

on  a  par with the permanent secretaries, but  it

has  been  decided that Grade D is sufficient,  at

any  rate  for  the time being. I hope  that  hon.

Members  will support the application for a  token

vote.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most important item in the Paper is

the creation of the post of Secretary (Loans).  On

a  number  of occasions in the past, Sir,  I  have

drawn attention to the wide gap which is likely to

exist  in  the  future between the  needs  of  the

various  central and local government  bodies  and

corporations in Singapore for development  capital

and the total amount of development capital likely

to  be available. I have also stressed the need to

mobilise and tap



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



all  available sources of development  capital  in

Singapore if the gap is to be narrowed. I  do  not

think that anybody who has studied the matter will

deny  the  existence of the gap  now  and  in  the

future, or the need to do everything in our  power

to   narrow   it   by  integrating   and   phasing

development  plans  on  an island-wide  basis,  by

avoiding  cut-throat  competition  for  the  funds

likely  to  be  available,  and  to  explore   and

mobilise   every  possible  source  of  investment

capital.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integration and phasing of development plans on

an   island-wide   basis  is   a   difficult   and

complicated matter but it will have to he done  if

the  best  use is to be made of the limited  funds

likely to be available. We can no longer afford to

allow  every development authority to  go  merrily

ahead planning what it considers desirable without

regard to the needs of other authorities or to the

funds  likely to be available. There must  be  co-operation and coordination, and I ask that this co-operation  will  be  given when  the  question  of

setting   up  a  suitable  coordinating  body   is

discussed with the various authorities concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it will be generally agreed that it

would   be   folly  for  the  various  authorities

responsible   for  development  in  Singapore   to

indulge  in  cut-throat  competition  for  the

limited   funds   likely  to  be   available   for

development in Singapore. Clearly there is a  case

for one authority, in this case the Government, to

mobilise  and  tap all resources and to  apportion

the  proceeds between the various authorities  for

the  implementation  of a phased,  integrated  and

agreed island-wide development plan.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobilisation of investment, capital will be far

from  easy. It will involve not only the flotation

of  loans  of  all  kinds necessary  to  meet  the

requirements  of  local investors,  but  also  the

question of the issue of Treasury bills, the  creation  of short-term deposits and the like. It will

involve   the  servicing  of  these   loans,   the

operation  of  sinking funds,  the  investment  of

sinking  fund money, the redemption and conversion

of the loans, and so on. It will involve the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



consideration   and  implementation   of   savings

campaigns. It will involve the gradual building up

of  a  local money market, thus giving  a  greater

measure  of  liquidity than exists at  present  to

local  trustee securities. It involves  such  questions as the investment policy of provident funds,

insurance companies operating locally, and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a task which will call for a high degree

of  specialised knowledge and financial experience

which  is  not  available in the Treasury  at  the

present time The Treasury is understaffed and  the

officers  at present serving in it are lacking  in

financial experience. It is in my opinion of vital

importance  not  only  to the  immediate  pressing

problem of mobilisation of investment capital, but

also to the general efficiency of the Treasury  to

recruit a Secretary (Loans)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having regard to the qualifications and

experience   required  for  this   task,   it   is

considered   necessary  to  offer  the   inclusive

emoluments  which  are proposed.  This  particular

question has been most carefully examined and I am

certain  that we would not obtain the services  of

the kind of man we want for anything less. I trust

that  hon. Members realise the importance  of  the

matter and support me in this application.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item 130 seeks a revote in connection with the

investigation of the Oriental Telephone & Electric

Company's assets. Hon. Members will note that  the

explanatory  note  refers to the  need  to  go  to

arbitration.   That   is  indeed   the   position.

Valuations were exchanged in 1956 and,  as  agreed

at  the  time  of the conclusion of  the  purchase

agreement,  valuers  on  both  sides  subsequently

entered   into  negotiations  with   a   view   to

clarifying  points of difference and  making  such

settlements   and  compromises   that   might   be

possible.  These negotiations have been protracted

but considerable progress has been made in certain

aspects  of  the  valuation. There  are,  however,

certain  major points involving considerable  sums

of   money   which  have  proved   to   be   quite

unsusceptible of compromise. These must  now  go

to  arbitration  under the terms of  the  original

indenture. Arrangements are now being made to  set

up an arbitration tribunal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



which,  it is hoped, will sit in Singapore in  the

autumn  of  this year. Hon. Members  will  realise

that  I  cannot at this stage make any comment  on

the  details  of  the negotiations  or  about  the

matters which have been referred to arbitration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Items 133 and 134 deal with the pan-Malayan

development of trunk telephone facilities  between

Singapore and the Federation. Singapore's share of

the project amounts to roughly $1.3 million but  I

am assured by the Minister that it will remove the

serious  bottleneck existing  at  the  moment  and

provide facilities which will meet with the  needs

of  the  peninsula  for a considerable  number  of

years  to  come.  More important,  it  will  be  a

project   which   will  pay  for   itself   in   a

comparatively short period of time.

<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Chairman, Sir, I would like to refer to Head 20 Legal, item 108 at page 2 which reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A further supplement of $1,500 is required to

meet in full settlement, inclusive of costs,

another claim by a member of the public for

alleged wrongful search."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>Would the Hon. the Financial Secretary kindly give

us more details regarding this wrongful search?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. P. Shanks (Attorney-General) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Attorney-General (Mr E. P. Shanks):</b> Mr

Chairman,  Sir, this case was a somewhat  involved

affair in which a police officer used powers which

it  might  be considered by some were  not  really

sufficient for the search he made. There  was  the

possibility of a somewhat involved legal  argument

which might have become extremely expensive and on

considering the case as a whole, it was decided to

compromise the issue and offer a sum of  money  in

settlement  of  the claim that had been  made  and

that  sum  has  been accepted. It  is  not  always

possible  to  forecast  with  any  certainty   the

outcome  of a case before the courts. Fortunately,

for  lawyers,  there  are differences  of  opinion

occasionally  as  to  the  effect  of   particular

provisions  of  the  law and, in  this  particular

case,  the  matter  was one of  some  considerable

doubt.  It  was  because  of  the  doubt  and  the

possibility of the expensive results of litigating

that  doubt  that  it was decided  to  settle  the

matter. Having settled the matter, steps have been

taken   to   explain  to  the  officers  concerned

precisely  how  in future they will  exercise  the

powers  that have been given to them.  Steps  have

been   taken  to  avoid  any  recurrence  of  this

particular unfortunate type of search.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, can the Hon.

the  Attorney-Genera! tell us whether the  officer

or  officers  involved in this  case  were  either

reprimanded  or  punished  as  a  result  of  this

illegal search?



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> Sir, to the best of my

knowledge,  the officers were not punished.  There

was  no reason why they should be punished but the

officers  have had explained to them the way  in

which they should use their powers in torture.  It

is  not  a  case of an officer deliberately  doing

something wrong; the officer was mistaken.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  Hon. the  Attorney-General  has   not

answered    my    question    as    to     whether



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



they were reprimanded or not. I appreciate that it

was not intentional that they did wrong but because

of the result of that wrong, were they ever reprimanded?



<br><br><!-- Mr Shanks -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Shanks:</b> Sir, I am quite convinced that the

officer concerned did nothing for which punishment

or reprimand, which is a punishment, would be appropriate. I am not even prepared to say that what he

did was wrong. As I have explained, it is a matter

on which even lawyers might disagree but what I am

satisfied about is that this particular type of

action will not be taken in the future. But I must

resist any suggestion that the police officer

concerned is deserving of punishment. What he

wanted was help and it is help that he has got.

<div align="center"><b>ANNOUNCEMENTS IN MANDARIN AT SINGAPORE AIRPORT</b></div>

<br><br>3.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan (Tiong Bahru):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly is of the opinion that

Mandarin   should  also  be  used  in  all   verbal

announcements made by and at the Singapore Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this motion is the outcome of long and

futile  negotiations  with the expatriate  Minister

for Communications and Works.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The word "expatriate" in this

sense  is provocative and I ask the hon. Member  to

withdraw that word.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> I withdraw that

word, Sir. Many of my constituents have complained

to  me that they were badly handicapped due to the

lack of information particularly in Chinese at the

Singapore Airport and upon this information,  Sir,

I have written several letters to the Minister for

Communications and Works. With your permission,  I

would like to read the contents of these letters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 28th January, 1957, I wrote to the Minister

drawing  his  attention to the inadequacy  of  the

English  language  being used  in  announcing  the

arrival and departure of planes in the Paya  Lebar

International Airport. I said:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Singapore Airport should, for the con

venience  of  the Asiatic passengers  who  do  not

understand  the  English  language,  announce  the

arrival and departure of planes in Mandarin, Malay

and Tamil.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many instances in which passengers

missed  or  went to the wrong plane  just  because

they  do  not  understand English. As the  Malayan

Airways  and other Airlines are mostly  patronised

by  the  Asians, and it is possible  that  a  good

number   of   them  may  not  know  English, the

introduction    of    multilingualism    in    the

announcement  of  their flight schedules  is  more URGENT.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government is advocating multi

lingualism  in  the Legislative Assembly  for  the

convenience  of its Members, I fail to  understand

why  such facilities should not be extended to the

Commercial  Air  Transports  which  play  such  an

important  part  in  the life  of  the  people  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I, therefore, request the favour of your

early attention to this matter."



<br><br>And  on  8th  February, 1957,  Sir,  the  Minister

wrote:



<br><br>"Dear Mr Tan,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You wrote on 28th January asking if multilingual

facilities  could be introduced at the Paya  Lebar

Airport,  and  in  yesterday's Straits  Times  the

subject was also mentioned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid that I cannot subscribe to the view

that  there  have  been many  instances  in  which

passengers missed or went to the wrong plane  just

because  they were not conversant in  English.  I

am,  of  course, aware of the fact  that  in  many

international airports announcements are made both

in   English,  which  has  been  accepted  by  the

International Civil Aviation Organisation  as  the

lingua  franca  of the air, and  in  the  national

language of that country. In so far as Paya  Lebar

is  primarily  an  international airport,  English

would always be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



required,  but in view of an increase expected  in

the   local  traffic  between  Singapore  and  the

Federation  of Malaya, not to mention Sarawak  and

North   Borneo,  I  have  asked  the  Airport   to

experiment with Malay announcements and to  report

to me after an adequate period."



<br><br>I  was very annoyed when he said that, Sir. And on 11th February, 1957, I replied:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have to acknowledge with many thanks the

receipt  of your letter M.C. & W. 41/57  dated  8th

February,  1957,  in connection  with  my  request

that multilingualism should be  adopted  by  the

airport authorities in announcing the arrival and

departure   of   planes   in   the   Paya    Lebar

International Airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is not so important whether you

will  subscribe to the view that there  have  been

many  instances in which passengers missed or went

to  the  wrong  plane just because they  were  not

conversant  in English; but the facts reported  by

me  in  my letter are supported by witnesse  and,

moreover,   since  such  "instances"   are   never

reported  to the airport Authorities, it  is  very

probable  that you are ignorant of such  state  of

affairs.  Besides, the inconveniences  experienced

by  the  non-English speaking  passengers  in  the

airport can never be appreciated by those in power

who   normally  cannot  understand  or   are   not

concerned  with the real needs of  the  Asians  in

this country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am at a loss to understand why only Malay

announcements  are  to  be experimented  when  the

majority  of  the passengers using planes  between

Singapore  and the Federation of Malaya,  Sarawak,

North  Borneo,  Indonesia and other  countries  is

Chinese."



<br><br>And the Minister replied to me on 10th April as follows :-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir, In your letter to me of 28th January, 1957, you said, "that there are many instances in

which passengers missed or went to the wrong plane

just  because  they do not know English",  and  in

your letter of 11th February, you added that these

instances are supported by witnesses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, we are experimentally making

announcements in Malay as well as English;  and  I

am  also considering reports on the points  raised

in  your letters. It would greatly help me if  you

can  give me details of the instances referred  to

above;  or, if you yourself have not got  details,

if  you can give me the names and addresses of the

witnesses  from whom I can get the facts.  What  I

need to know is:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the date of each instance referred to;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the country to which the passenger intended travelling;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the airline on which he was supposed to travel;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the passenger's name and address;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) the languages and dialects spoken by the passenger."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, how can the Minister expect me to check the

names  and  addresses of the  passengers  and  the

dialects  spoken by them? Why not ask about  their

ages  and  the  number  of wives  they  have  too?

Frankly,  Sir, what I am fighting for is a  matter

of  principle, having  at heart  the  progress  and

prosperity   of   Singapore.  Singapore   has   an

international  airport. I have been  to  Hongkong

and  the  authorities  over  there  think  it   is

necessary  to introduce the Cantonese  dialect  as

well  as English to announce the arrival and departure  of planes because the majority of the people

there  speak  Cantonese. We say that  we  want  to

attract tourists and trade and yet we do not  have

the  same facilities here. I can assure the House,

Sir,  that  most of the Indonesian passengers  who

come  to  Singapore and bring trade and wealth  to

this  country speak Mandarin. I am not asking  the

Minister  to introduce only the Mandarin language.

I  am asking him to introduce something which this

Assembly    has   already   passed,    that    is,

multilingualism, and I cannot understand  why  the

Minister should take such a negative attitude.  Is

he  so  shortsighted not to see that  this  is  an

international airport and that we want progress in

this country?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can quote a few instances. For example,

take the case of a Chinese lady passenger who does

not  speak  English but only the Chinese language.

Whilst  she is having coffee in the lounge  or  in

the  bar  of the airport, suddenly an announcement

comes  over the air regarding the arrival  or  the

departure of a plane. You will see that this  same

passenger will rush to the reception desk or  will

approach  the other passengers and ask  them  what

the  announcement  was about. That  clearly  shows

that she does not understand English.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can also quote another instance. There were

hundreds  of supporters from the various political

parties  in  Singapore who were  waiting  for  the

delegates  to  arrive back from London  after  the

constitutional  talks but the plane  was  delayed.

The  airport manager instructed somebody there  to

make  an  announcement in English to say that  the

plane had been delayed and asked the people to  go

back home, but nobody went back because they could



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



not    understand   English.   Subsequently,    an

announcement  was made in Malay but it  still  did

not  make  any  difference. The  crowd  was  still

there.  Eventually,  in  desperation,  I  think  a

reporter  of  the Sin Chew Jit Poh was  approached

and  he  got  up to a microphone to speak  to  the

people  in  Mandarin. Thereafter, the  crowd  just

dispersed like the April mist in the July sun. All

of  them went back home. That clearly shows,  Sir,

that  most of the people who go to the airport  do

not  understand English. I am quite sure that  the

majority   of  the  people  in  Singapore   today,

Sir - about  50  per cent - understand Mandarin.  The

Government say that they have already experimented

with  the  Malay language and I can see  that  the

reason  why that has not been successful  is  that

not many of the passengers who use the airport are

Malays - I  am  quite  sure  that the percentage  is  very

small.  I  am  not arguing about the facts.  I  am

arguing   about   the  principle  of   introducing

multilingualism in the airport because  it  is  an

international airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. Jumabhoy (Telok Ayer):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I second the motion standing on the Order Paper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is very easy to satisfy the general

public,  Sir,  being of various nationalities  and

speaking  different dialects if announcements  are

made  in  the  four main languages  of  this  City

especially   at   arrivals   and   departures   of

aeroplanes  to  and from different countries.  For

example, English, Malay and Mandarin will  suffice

for  planes  to and from Indonesia or for  Malayan

Airways;  English  only  and  possibly  a   second

language,  Malay, for planes to and  from  Europe;

Tamil  can be added for planes to and from  India.

This can very easily be done in order to help  the

travelling  public in understanding  announcements

of  arrivals and departures of planes to  or  from

the  various  countries. I do not  think  that  it

would  cost  the authorities very much to  provide

these facilities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>3.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas (Minister for Communications and Works) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications and Works (Mr Francis Thomas):</b> I would like to assure you, Sir,

and  the  hon.  Members of the House through  you,

that  the  principle  of  multilingualism  at  the

airport  and  in civil aviation generally  is  one

which is fully accepted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru (Mr William Tan) has

described   his  long  and  so  far   unsuccessful

struggle  to get Mandarin included in the  airport

languages but of course the thing goes far further

back than that - before he had even been elected  to

the  Assembly. The question of what  languages  to

use  at  the  new  Paya  Lebar  Airport  has  been

discussed and consideration given to it and to all

the  factors  involved long before it was  opened,

because  that is part of the professional work  of

civil  aviation  officers, that they  should  make

sure  that their airport is as efficient  as  they

can  possibly  make it and for  that  reason  they

consider  the movement of passengers and how  they

are  going to get to and fro without getting  lost

or held up. Naturally, the announcements which are

made  at the airport are part of the matters which

are  considered and I would give the  House  every

assurance  that if there appeared to be  any  real

need  for the introduction of additional languages

which  would  lead  to increased efficiency,  then

they  should  certainly be put in,  but  it  is  a

matter to be judged on the question of efficiency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member read at length from his letters

to  me and from my replies. He remarked also  that

his  constituents had complained. Now he  told  me

categorically  that there were many  instances  of

people  who missed their planes because  they  did

not  understand the announcements and he said that

he had witnesses prepared to come forward and tell

me all about it. I wrote to him back in April last

year  saying,  "Please tell me who your  witnesses

are.  This  is the sort of information I  want.  I

want  to  know who it was, when he was travelling,

and  so  on,  so  that I can check  up."  Thirteen

months   have  passed  and  he  has  produced   no

witnesses  at all, nor has he produced any  actual

case at all except for the imaginary lady



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



drinking coffee in the lounge and rushing  to  the

information desk because she did not understand an

announcement. He is not able to tell me what  lady

it  was  and on what occasion. It is just "take  a

case  and  there  it is". The only other  concrete

instance he produced was of a crowd seeing off the

constitutional talks delegation in 1957. There was

a  delay  by  the  aircraft,  and  the  crowd  not

understanding  announcements in the ordinary  way,

special  arrangements were made at my request  for

an announcement to be made in Mandarin and through

the    co-operation   of   a   newspaperman,   the

announcement  was  made. That is very  appropriate

and  proper,  and it surely does  not  argue  that

because  on  one occasion there was  a  particular

crowd  which  needed  a special  announcement,  we

should  retain permanent staff able to make  other

announcemets   which  are  not  necessary.   Well,

although  his  researches have  not  produced  any

single  case of anybody who can be identified  and

who  has  required announcements in  Mandarin,  we

have  gone  into this as thoroughly  as  possible,

since I wrote to him last year. If I remember, for

an  Answer  to a Question in the year 1956/57,  we

found  one person who had missed his plane through

not  understanding the announcements. That  person

was  a  German.  In  the year 1957/58,  one  other

person  also went astray through not understanding

the languages used at the airport. That person was

a  Turk. There was one other person who missed her

plane  at the time of the Malayan Airways  strike.

She was a young lady and I believe she went to the

bank.  In  any case, she did not hear the announcement  and as the Malayan Airways was short-staffed

and  overworked, they did not manage to get to the

information   desk  for  a  special   announcement

calling  for her and the result was that  she,  in

fact, did not catch her plane. It was not a matter

of  the  language;  it was a  matter  of  her  not

hearing  the original announcement and not getting

a  subsequent  special call for herself  by  name.

Those  are  the only three cases that I have  been

able  to unearth, and that is why I was so anxious

that the hon. Member should produce his cases



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



which  he  is so confident occurred; but until  he

does,  I  am afraid I must rank him with  all  the

other  sort  of  speeches that are  made  in  this

Assembly in which furious accusations are made but

no   evidence  whatever  is  brought  forward   in

substantiation. I need not instance  the  sort  of

cases  that  have  occurred, but I  personally  do

require  to  be convinced before I am prepared  to

assume that a person is talking sense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there are various practical problems

about - simply a matter of efficiency, Mr  Speaker,

Sir - how  we  are going to run our airport  to  the

maximum  convenience of the persons  who  want  to

travel   through  it.  It  is  correct  that   the

international  language  for  civil  aviation   is

English. French and Spanish are also used  and  in

many airports the language of the country is added

if  there is a large flow of people who do not use

the  English  language. In Hongkong, as  the  hon.

Member  pointed out, it is English and  Cantonese.

In Jakarta, it is English and Javanese-Indonesian.

I  beg  your  pardon; I think it is  the  Javanese

variant  of Indonesian. In Bangkok, it is  English

and  Thai.  In Kuala Lumpur, it is English,  full-stop.  In  Singapore,  we have  experimented  with

Malay announcements. I gave Malay priority because

it  is,  or will, I hope be, the national language

for Singapore as it is for the Federation, and  it

seemed  to me proper that we should give it  first

consideration. As far as could be observed, nobody

wanted  Malay announcements in respect of  Malayan

Airways  flights  and  recently,  after  a  year's

experiment,  we  took  them off  again  and  again

nobody noticed or commented about it. Not a ripple

was  noticed by anybody concerned. The fact of the

matter  is  that  people  at  present  are  moving

conveniently  and satisfactorily in  the  airport,

and  this  is  a matter of the expert  opinion  of

people  dealing with airport matters.  The  people

most  deeply  concerned are  perhaps  the  airline

operators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. Member was under the impression that if

a  person  missed his or her plane,  the  Ministry

would not hear about it. I can assure you that  if

any passenger is inconvenienced at the airport



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



through defects in the airport organisation,

we  shall most certainly hear about it because the

airline  operators will come to us and say,  "What

is  this?  Our airline missed a passenger  because

you  have done something inefficient." The airline

operators  are  intensely  competitive,  extremely

efficient, and extremely conscious of the need for

speedy handling and convenience of passengers, and

to  suppose  that  they would sit  down  under  an

airport which was providing an incompetent service

is  to  underestimate the business ability of  the

airlines.  They  would not.  If  they  wished  for

announcements and if they thought that they  would

serve  any purpose, it would be very important  to

them   to  press  for  announcements  in  whatever

language  they thought was necessary. We have,  in

fact,  an  informal, unofficial Airline  Operators

Committee which sits with the airport manager  and

I have been in contact with all of them. We had re

ports a year ago when the hon. Member brought this

up.  We  had reports again in consequence of  this

motion.  All  we managed to elicit  was  that  one

German  and  one Turk missed their planes  because

they  did not understand announcements in English.

That  is all that the airline operators were  able

to  produce in the way of complaint about  the  announcements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if we are going to have announcements, we

must have them in a way which is going to match up

with  the traffic of the airport. At peak periods,

there are, in fact, eight flight movements such as

an  arrival or departure in the course of an  hour

and  there may be further ones. If the plane comes

in  delayed  or early on its schedule, that  would

add  to the number. There may be other unscheduled

movements  as well. If we multiply the  number  of

flight  movements by the time taken  for  a  fully

multilingual airport, you would have a  continuous

series  of announcements flowing out one after  an

other so that the unhappy passenger would never be

able  to  wait and say, "Well, I wonder whether  I

can  have a cup of coffee." He has to sit with his

ears   open  all  the  time  to  catch   a   hasty

announcement of his flight number.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



There   will  be  a  pandemonium  of   noise   and

experience  shows  that, in  fact,  that  sort  of

continuous  announcement  defeats  itself  because

nobody listens to it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comparison between multilingual facilities in

this  Assembly and multilingual facilities in  the

airport  is  really  out of  the  world.  In  this

Assembly, hon. Members will have to put  on  their

earphones  and  listen  to whichever  wave-band - or

whatever  you call it - they want to, and they  will

sit  down  comfortably in their seats; whereas  in

the  airport the passengers have to walk about  to

see  that  their luggage is checked and get  their

tickets from the office, and so

on. They cannot have earphones on their heads,  as

these   must  be  connected  to  listen   to   the

announcements. This is not possible  in  a  moving

body  of people in a large space engaged in  other

things besides listening to announcements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I do not want to make a great deal of this.

The hon. Member spoke with some feeling about this

matter  but I would like to suggest to this House,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, that this is not a  matter  for

feeling or for emotion. It is simply a matter  for

objectively considering what is going  to  conduce

to  efficient  movement at the  airport.  If  this

House were to take it on itself to decide business

matters  without  taking expert  advice,  then  it

could  do  great harm. I have tried to  give  this

some basis of expert advice and I have pointed out

that the airline operators - and this, of course, includes  airlines  like the  Union  of  Burma,  the

Garuda,  the Thai, Air India, in addition  to  the

Hongkong  line, the Australian line  and  all  the

other  lines - have their means of  discussing  with

the  airport manager matters of the running of the

airport  in the Airline Operators Committee.  They

also  can  come and see me if they  want  to,  and

there  is  no  question  that  if  they  felt  any

improvement is needed they would have put  it  up,

but,  in fact, what they have done was to ask that

Malay should be removed because they felt that  it

hindered the smooth handling of passengers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People at the airport have not observed the rush

to which the hon. Member referred; the mad rush of

fighting



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



passengers running to the information bureau  when

an  announcement was made to say,  "Was  that  for

me?"  It does happen, of course, with people in  a

conversation  who suddenly wake  up  and  say,  "I

wonder  if  that is for me!", and they go  across

and  ask,  "Was  that flight so and  so  you  were

announcing?",  but to describe it  as  a  sort  of

general state of affairs is not, in fact, the case

in  my  own  observation. Persons  experienced  in

travelling on world flights, say to Zurich, where,

I  believe, they use French and German in addition

to  English  and possibly Romansh,  say  that  the

effect  of  a  number of announcements  one  after

another in different languages is that by the  end

of it, you do not hear anything at all.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Ayer (Mr R. Jumabhoy) in

seconding  the motion referred to the question  of

cost  and,  of  course, if we are  going  to  have

flight  announcements made through  the  whole  24

hours  a  day in whatever languages are  necessary

and  to have standby staff because even though  no

scheduled flight is coming in, nevertheless, there

may  be an unscheduled flight or some special late

arrival   or   early  departure,  it  would   mean

recruiting additional staff in quite a big way and

extra  work in training because the staff  changes

very   frequently.   The   girls   that   do   the

announcements are nubile and tend to  get  married

and very often give up their career life. It would

undoubtedly  add  to  the  expense.  I  have   not

attempted to estimate how much because I  hope  we

shall not be involved in it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other point I should like to make is

that  although  the hon. Member  withdrew  it,  he

referred to me as an expatriate. I am, in fact,  a

Singapore citizen and would like to have it on record-



<br><br><!-- Mr G. E. N. Oehlers (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I thought I had made it clear

that that word had been overruled in this context.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> I do not think I need press any

further  on  this  matter, Mr Speaker.  Sir.  The

basis  on  which I would wish this  matter  to  be

approached is not one of emotion or of a sense  of

frustration on the part of the hon. Member because

he had a bright idea as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



he  thought  and  it  had not been  accepted,  but

simply as a matter of seeing what is going  to  be

useful  to  our  airport which is  of  very  great

importance  to us. About a quarter  of  a  million

passengers pass through the airport every year and

it  is important that their convenience and smooth

handling should be as efficiently looked after  as

possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said in my opening remarks and I repeat it

again  that  I fully accept that the announcements

must   be  such  as  will,  in  fact,  serve   the

efficiency  of the airport and the convenience  of

the  passengers. There is no evidence at  all  and

the  hon.  Member has produced none in every  year

since  I  wrote  to  him to show  that,  in  fact,

anybody  is suffering inconvenience from  lack  of

announcements  in  Mandarin.  Although  the   hon.

Member  has produced no evidence, I have made  the

most  diligent search myself in contact  with  the

airline operators, officials and others who  would

be in the best position to know and they have also

produced    no    evidence   of   anybody    being

inconvenienced. There is no doubt at all  that  to

introduce additional languages is inconvenient and

can  be  expensive. It could be  done  if  it  was

necessary;  one inconvenience must be accepted  if

it  removes a greater inconvenience. There  is  no

evidence at all, however, that it is necessary now

and until it is shown to be necessary, we must not

introduce unnecessary languages which do not  help

efficiency but reduce it.



<br><br>4.06 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, when this

motion  came  into  my hands, I  had  in  mind  to

introduce an amendment to leave out "Mandarin" and

insert  "multilingualism" and when I  appealed  to

the  mover of the motion, it appears that, for the

time being, Mandarin is just enough. That is why I

am  not  moving  any  amendment  today  and  I  am

prepared to support the motion as it stands  until

such   time  as  the  Government  will,  I   hope,

introduce the other two languages if it finds that

the  use  of Mandarin announcements at the airport is satisfactory.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the Minister, Sir, it appears to me

that the announcements made at the airport are for the benefit



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406</b></font><br><br>



of  the passengers only. He never thinks about the

friends and relatives who go to the airport either

to meet or to send off passengers. What he is only

worried about is the efficient running of the  airport as well as the convenience of the passengers.

There  are  many cases where friends and relatives

of  incoming  passengers go to the airport.  If  a

plane  is delayed, an announcement is made on  the

microphone  and unless friends and  relatives  are

aware  of that announcement, they will stay on  at

the airport for hours for nothing which is just  a

waste  of  time for them but if they are aware  of

the  announcement  that a plane is  delayed,  then

they  can go home and, come back at the right time

when the plane comes in.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, Sir, according to the Minister, it is

the concern of the airport authorities to see that

the airport is run efficiently. He may be correct,

but times, have progressed, Sir. The days are gone

when  very  few Chinese-speaking people travel  by

plane.  The  days are gone when only the  English-speaking people travel by air.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> Turks and Germans.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Choon Eng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lee Choon Eng:</b> Only one Turk and one German

as quoted by you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even people from China who used to dread hearing

an aeroplane in the old days do travel by air now.

So  why  then,  Sir, this show of favour  for  the

English-speaking people only? There are many  non-English speaking people who travel by air and  are

we  not  to provide facilities for the convenience

of  these people at all - just only for the  benefit

of  the  English-speaking people, and not for  the

benefit of others?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, multilingualism has come to stay, as I have

always    said   so.   So   why   not    introduce

multilingualism in the airport as well?  Why  only

in the Assembly and in the City Council? It should

be  introduced everywhere if it is for the benefit

of  the  citizens, and not only  at  a  privileged

place  like this Assembly. The airport happens  to

be not a privileged place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the reason why the Minister said that so

far  he has got no evidence of any people who have

missed a plane or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



gone  to  a  wrong plane is because  most  of  the

passengers  who  travel by air bring  along  their

friends who speak English. It is very rare to  see

a  passenger going to the airport alone.  You  can

always  see  that he is surrounded by  either  his

friends or relatives who can understand and  speak

English  and this being the case, he can  rely  on

them  to interpret the announcements. That is  the

reason why the Minister has got no evidence so far

of anybody who has missed his plane or gone to the

wrong  plane. He has quoted so far a Turk  and  a

German. It is rather unfortunate that the Turk  or

the  German  did not have relatives in  Singapore.

They  were foreigners and they came in as  foreign

ers. So as such, they could not bring along - I  see

Ministers laughing on the opposite side; it  is  a

fact,  and  it  is no laughing matter  at  all - any

friends to guide or bring them to the airport  and

to  interpret the announcements to them. I do  not

think  it is right that just because the Minister

lacks the evidence he is not prepared to introduce

other  languages at the airport for announcements.

I think it is very wrong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Member for Tiong Bahru (Mr William

Tan)  or the mover of the motion says that because

there  is a common language, Cantonese, spoken  in

Hongkong, the airport authorities of that  country

put  over Cantonese announcements and the Minister

himself  admitted that in Indonesia, you  have  Indonesian and English and in Thailand you have Thai

and  English.  But, we have many languages  spoken

here.  Our  country is quite different from  other

countries where it is a case of only one language.

It  is  Thai in Thailand, Indonesian in Indonesia,

and  so  on. Singapore is a place where  you  have

different  nationalities and the  welfare  of  all

these  people has got to be looked after.  Let  us

not  always  think  of  the  privileged  class - the

English-speaking class. Nowadays, it is  not  only

the   English-speaking   who   can   be   elected.

Everybody, even a trishaw-rider who does not speak

English,  can be elected. The airport is  more  or

less a Government concern and it is not a domestic

or commercial concern



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



and in the interest of everybody, I think the

Government should help everybody to understand the

announcements.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion temporarily as it stands

until  such  time as the Government, I hope,  will

introduce more languages.



<br><br>4.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr G. A. P. Sutherland -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr G. A. P. Sutherland (Nominated):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I cannot believe for a moment  that

the Hon. the Minister for Communications and Works

would  present  other than an  entirely  objective

picture  as far as this is concerned. I  am  quite

sure he does not suffer from any racial prejudice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are just two things I would like to say.

One  is  that  I  am going to oppose  this  motion

because I do not think it was very well presented.

In  one  case,  the  Member for Tiong  Bahru  (Mr

William  Tan)  talked about Indonesia,  the  trade

with  Indonesia  and the number of Chinese  coming

from  Indonesia.  I  myself spent  five  years  in

Indonesia and I would guarantee that every Chinese

in  Indonesia  can speak Malay or  its  Indonesian

variant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is this, that he says about 50 per

cent  of  the  people here speak  Mandarin.  Well,

there  is a sort of snobbism about Mandarin  these

days  and  it may be that, as 50 per cent  of  the

population of Singapore are under 21, the  younger

people  do indeed speak Mandarin. Certainly,  they

are  all  making  a valiant effort  to  learn  the

international Chinese, as it is called but I would

very  gravely  doubt if 50 per cent of  the  adult

Chinese   population   of  Singapore   can   speak

Mandarin. I should have thought that there  was  a

far better case for having Hokkien or Cantonese.



<br><br>4.15 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Soh Ghee Soon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Soh Ghee Soon (Cairnhill):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

in  spite of the opposition to this motion, I must

say  that  I  am  not  convinced  at  all  by  the

arguments put forward by the Hon. the Minister for

Communications and Works that Mandarin should  not

be used at the international Paya Lebar airport.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned, Sir, that long before the Member

for  Tiong Bahru (Mr William Tan) was elected  to

this Assembly, the matter of appropriate languages

was  considered  but  at that  time,  Sir,  nobody

thought  of  having  any  other  language   except

English.  Now, we have advocated the  introduction

of  multilingualism in the Assembly. The  Minister

for  Communications and Works  said  that  he  had

already introduced announcements in Malay and that

they  were not much of a success. I am not in  the

least surprised at that because there are not many

Malays  in Singapore as compared with the Chinese.

If  Malay  announcements were to be introduced  in

the  Federation, they would be welcome and popular

and  I  think would be well received.  Here,  Sir,

apart  from the Malay population which  is  small,

many of them do not travel by air. The majority of

the people who travel by air are the Chinese. Even

compared with the Europeans, the Chinese  are  the

majority of people who travel by air today and for

those  who  speak the different Chinese  dialects,

Mandarin  can  be  used  as  the  common  language

medium.  I think, Sir, that Mandarin announcements

will be very useful and helpful to the people here

as  well  as  to  the  people of  South-East  Asia

because even in South-East Asia, there are  a  lot

of Chinese. If the Minister for Communications and

Works  had already experimented with announcements

in  Malay  and failed, I do not see why he  should

not  try them in Mandarin. I am quite sure he will

find out that they will be very useful and helpful

to the travelling Chinese population of Singapore.

It is the Government's duty to do so.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong (Serangoon):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I have heard a very unconvincing speech from

the Minister for Communications and Works this  af

ternoon.  I  think it is the most unconvincing  of

all   the  speeches  so  far  delivered.   I   can

understand  his  difficulty.  He  said  that   the

Airport  went into the question of the possibility

of  languages as thoroughly as possible before and

after the new Airport came into being and that  he

also gave this matter a great



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



deal  of consideration; but I know that it is very

difficult to consider the problems in the  Airport

when most of the time one is away from it, sitting

in  one's  office and depending on other  people's

information.  He has quoted that  there  had  been

only a few people who missed their planes - Germans,

Turks, or whatever they are. I suppose this is the

usual B.O.A.C. line.



<br><br><!-- Mr Francis Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Francis Thomas:</b> K.L.M. and Q.A.N.T.A.S.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> But whatever it is, he should

always realise that Paya Lebar Airport is both  an

international and an internal airport.  It  serves

the  routes  of  the  world. It  also  serves  our

domestic  requirements. It also serves  South-East

Asia.  There are three distinct types of  services

rendered  by the Paya Lebar Airport.  As  for  the

international air lines, English is a must. As for

the  South-East  Asian  air  lines,  probably   we

require  English  and another  language  that  can

easily be understood by South-East Asians. For our

internal  airline, I think it is a must;  we  must

have announcements in languages that are known  to

the people who use them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been told so many times this afternoon

that  the  Airport is going to be run  efficiently

and  for the convenience of the passengers. If  we

move   amongst   the  passengers,  knowing   their

languages  and knowing how they feel  and  knowing

how  anxious  they are, we will then realise  that

they  have always been asking their friends. "What

is  that announcement about? When is my plane leaving?"  Their friends invariably have  to  come  to

their  rescue  to tell them, "Oh,  this  does  not

concern  you. This is for the plane that is  going

elsewhere." Well, Sir, the Minister countered  and

said,  "No,  we cannot have multilingualism  here.

You  know it is so very difficult. Our air traffic

is  so  heavy  and if we have multilingualism  and

make  announcements one after another,  the  whole

effect  is lost; you cannot hear a thing and  with

our  volume  of  traffic, you will have  a  never-ending string of announcements." I am certain that

Singapore is not as busy as any of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



the  European air ports, and if those European air

ports  can use at least two languages - English  and

their own language - I do not see why Singapore  can

not do the same thing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, has the Minister considered that to

overcome  the  difficulties,  instead  of   having

announcers, we can have the announcements  flashed

on  a screen in words in Chinese so that everybody

can  read them in whatever dialects they want  to?

For planes going to Hongkong, you can just put the

time down on a board and hang it up. That might be

tried  out.  It  would save  having  to  make  the

announcements and you will probably have a quieter

airport.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been told that the airlines must be very

efficient,  as competition amongst  them  is  very

keen. I am certain that there is no competition so

far as the internal airlines go. You either travel

by  Malayan  Airways or you go by any means  other

than by air, and whether a passenger is going with

you  on  this plane or the next plane, you can  be

sure  that  he will be in a Malayan Airways  plane

for  internal  travel. And there  you  are!  Where

there  is a monopoly and where the people who  run

it  feel  that they have done a good job,  patting

themselves  on  the back, we see  no  improvement,

because  the Minister will always tell us that  he

has had expert advice. We have had a lot of expert

advice  coming  to this Assembly; some  accept  it

because  they happen to think in the same  way  as

the  Ministers do, but many spurn it because  they

happen  to think contrariwise. So after all,  what

is  the use of expert advice? If you are going  to

listen  to expert advice, probably you will  still

have  the  Governor  presiding  over  a  nominated

Legislative Council run by a nominated  Executive.

That  would  be the best way - the best advice  from

the  best  experts.  But  it  is  quite  fortunate

sometimes  to  have politicians  who  shout  their

heads  off!  That is why I see so  many  important

people  sitting  right in front of  me;  otherwise

they would not be as important as they are.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. M. Jumabhoy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. M. Jumabhoy:</b> What about yourself?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Choon Mong:</b> Yes, no thanks due to the

experts,  but  to  the  voice  of  the  people  of Singapore!

if    we   in   this   Assembly   have   accepted

multilingualism - and   mind   you,   it   is    the

Government's platform - let us make a reality of it.

Let us make it manifest, not only in this Assembly

so  that we can express ourselves, but also put it

on   trial  at  the  Airport.  We  need  not  have

earphones supplied to passengers so that they  can

listen  in  to any special channels, but  I  think

there will be very little inconvenience if we  try

and adopt methods that can fit into our programme.



<br><br>4.26 p.m.

<br><br><!-- Mr Braga -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Braga:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, like the Minister

for  Communications and Works,  1  would  like  to

reiterate that Government would certainly consider

introducing  multilingualism if it  was  convinced

that such was necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key word in all the speeches from the

Members of the opposite side is "multilingualism".

There  must  be  a confusion of thought,  for  the

mover of this motion has only directed himself  to

one  particular language, namely Mandarin,  to  be

used  in the airport. Listening to him, I wondered

in  what  language the would-be passengers  bought

their  tickets  from the various airlines - whether

it   be  Q.A.N.T.A.S.,  K.L.M.,  Pan-American   or

B.O.A.C. - and  how they understood the instructions

on  the tickets that they had to be at the airport

half an hour before departure time. I have been to

several  airports - Madrid,  Portugal,  London,  and

others. The announcements are made in English  and

in  the  particular language of the  country,  and

even if one listens to the particular language  of

the  country,  one  can always understand  that  a

plane is going to Rome or to London, and so forth;

and  anyone who listens at our airport to whatever

language  is used can always know that a plane  is

going to Bangkok. If this motion had been confined

to  Malayan  Airways - our internal  lines,  as  the

Member   for   Serangoon   suggested - I   could

understand it and would advocate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



that we add not only Mandarin but  Malay  in

particular, as I would certainly say that  90  per

cent of those going to the Federation speak Malay.

If  indeed  any  languages were to be  adopted,  I

would  personally  think that  English  and  Malay

should  be  the  ones, because  as  the  hon.  Mr

Sutherland said that in the several years he spent

in  Indonesia  he found that all the  Chinese  who

travel by air from Indonesia to Singapore and vice

versa speak the language of the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to repeat that Government would be

only  too  happy  to introduce multilingualism  if

they  felt that it was a necessary thing to do  at

the  moment but I think we are all satisfied  that

at  this  stage  just  to adopt  Mandarin  is  not

necessary.



<br><br>4.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr William Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr William Tan:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am not

concerned with the fact that a Turk and  a  German

missed  their planes. As I have already  explained

when  I  moved  the  motion, the  principle  I  am

fighting  for is the progress of the  country  and

surely it is the duty of the Minister in charge to

offer  facilities to all and sundry,  particularly

to those passengers who cannot understand English.

They  may understand Malay, Mandarin or Tamil  and

if  you  want to introduce multilingualism in  the

Airport, by all means do so. In my first letter to

the Minister, I said that the announcements should

be  made  in Mandarin, Malay as well as in  Tamil.

That is multilingualism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, about the letter the Minister wrote to me

dated 10th April, 1957, asking me to produce proof

in  the way of witnesses' names and addresses, may

I inform the Minister that I am one of the elected

representatives  of the people  of  Singapore  and

that it is not my duty - particularly when I do  not

have  the facilities and so on - to submit the names

and  addresses of the witnesses, the  airlines  on

which they travelled, the countries to which  they

intended  to  go, the dates in each instance,  and

the languages and dialects spoken by them?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, Sir, the Minister said that on the

occasion  when the last delegation came back  from

London,  the  plane was delayed and  that  when  a

newspaper reporter announced in Mandarin  to  that

effect, the crowd dispersed. That is proof  enough

that   most   of  the  people  who   go   to   the

Airport - passengers or visitors - understand Mandarin

perfectly well.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the hon. Mr Sutherland, I now

understand  why  the  Member for  Tanjong  Pagar - I

regret to note he is not here - always calls him the

"Member  for Tanglin Club", and I will  not  waste

any time to reply to his remarks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we were to introduce multilingualism in the

Airport, it would save the passengers and visitors

alike  the  trouble of having to go to  the  receptionist's  desk to enquire what the announcer  has

said.  It  would help them very much to understand

the language used by the announcer.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the cost, Sir, is it not possible for

airline companies to make their own announcements?

This would save us the cost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to thank my friends the Member for

Queenstown and the Member for Serangoon for having

replied  to  some  of  the points  raised  by  the

Minister for Communications and Works, so  I  will

not take up the time of this House further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put.

<div align="center"><b>KWONG WAI SHIU HOSPITAL (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Foo Nam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Foo Nam (Pasir Panjang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to have the number

of  Committee  members increased from  40  to  60.

Anyone who is not connected with this hospital  or

is aware of its working may wonder in his mind why

it  is  necessary  to have such a  big  number  of

Committee members. Is not 40 big enough?  In  this

respect, Sir, I think it might not be out of place

if I say a few words about the hospital itself.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hospital was founded in 1910, at a time

when the population of Singapore was only 300,000.

Today we have one and a half million. All the  so-called  thickly  populated  areas  of  today  were

jungles  then.  This hospital is situated  at  the

junction of Serangoon Road and Balestier Road  and

is  known  as Rumah Miskin, the Poor House.  This

hospital is entirely free and takes care of  about

450 patients. In addition, it has to take care  of

about 100 outdoor patients every day.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war, the Committee spent nearly

$600,000   in   renovating  and  rebuilding   this

hospital,  and  building is still  going  on.  The

annual expenditure is about a quarter of a million

dollars, whereas it was only $50,000 pre-war.  The

reason  why  we  are  asking for  an  increase  of

Committee members is this:

it  has  been found most convenient to  appoint  a

Committee member in each district so that  he  can

collect subscriptions from the Chinese, especially

the   Cantonese - more  than  95  per  cent  of  the

contributions are from the Cantonese - and,  at the same time, hear any complaints  from

patients  admitted from that locality. As  I  said

before,   when  the  hospital  was   founded,   40

Committee members were considered sufficient,  but

today, owing to the extension of the city and  the

existence of many more new districts, we find this

number  is  insufficient. We consider 60  will  be

nearer  to requirements. That is why we are asking

for this amended figure of 60. Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committed to a Select Committee consisting of

Mr Speaker as Chairman and such Members as may be

nominated by the Committee of Selection. [Mr Wong

Foo Nam.]
