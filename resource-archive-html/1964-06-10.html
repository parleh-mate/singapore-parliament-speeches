<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I also have to inform

Honourable Members that on the 19th day of

December. 1963, I duly sent a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>



letter  to  His  Excellency  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara  containing  the  Address  agreed   to   by

resolution of this Assembly on the 19th  December,

1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I received a reply from His Excellency dated

21st December, 1963, acknowledging receipt of  the

kind   message   of   the   Legislative   Assembly

transmitted to him in my letter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 5</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>



<div align="center"><b>CLINIC IN ANSON ELECTORAL</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>DIVISION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Health whether the Government proposes to build  a

clinic in the Anson Electoral Division; where will

it be situated, and when will it be ready.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yong Nyuk Lin:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is the

policy  of  the Government to build a  network  of

Outpatient Dispensaries so as to bring medical ser

vices  to  the  people, as far  as  possible.  The

choice   of  sites  will  be  determined  by   the

availability  of  land,  population   served   and

availability  of  staff, namely, doctors,  nurses,

etc.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in the last Yang di-Pertuan Negara's

speech on 29th November, 1963, we already have  no

less than 32 Outpatient Dispensaries in Singapore.

We   have,  in  fact,  expanded  faster  than  the

recruitment of doctors to man this service and  it

is  not  proposed to expand further until we  have

been  able to consolidate and improve the  present

services.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret, therefore, having to inform my

colleague, the Member for Anson, that there are no

immediate  plans  for  the  building  of   a   new

Outpatient Dispensary in Anson Electoral Division.

There  is already an Outpatient Dispensary at  Kee

Seng  Street,  off  Tanjong Pagar  Road.  The  new

Maxwell Road Outpatient Dispensary situated at the

junction of Erskine Road with Kadayanallur  Street

(next  to Maxwell Road Market) is expected  to  be

ready for use by 1st August.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two Outpatient Dispensaries, although not

situated   inside  the  Anson  Electoral  Division

itself, are, however, easily within reach  of  the

people residing inside Anson Division.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 6</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>UNAUTHORISED HUTS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AT PALMER ROAD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

National   Development  whether   the   Government

proposes to demolish certain unauthorised huts  at

Palmer  Road;  whether the people  now  living  in

those  unauthorised huts will be given alternative

accommodation  in  Housing and  Development  Board

flats;  and  whether the Housing  and  Development

Board  has any plans to build flats in the  Palmer

Road area.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, there are 40

unauthorised  erections which were  built  between

1955  and  1958  on  a piece of  land  behind  the

Ministry of Health, Palmer Road. To the best of my

knowledge, the Housing and Development  Board  has

no  plans for a building programme at Palmer  Road

in  the  near future. However, there may  be  road

extension projects and Urban Redevelopment Schemes

to  be  carried  out when comprehensive  Urban  Re

development plans are drawn up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the Government has decided to carry out any

schemes  in  the Palmer Road area,  it  will  make

arrangements to re-house the occupants of  unautho

rised  huts in the affected area. It is the normal

procedure  that  whenever  Government  desires  to

develop  a piece of land for housing or industrial

development  purposes, Mandatory  Orders  will  be

issued  by  the  Court  to have  the  unauthorised

structures demolished and, at the same time, those

living  in  unauthorised huts will be  offered  al

ternative accommodation in Housing Board flats.

<div align="center"><b>(Alternative accommodation for persons living in unauthorised huts)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development whether  persons  living  in

unauthorised  huts at Tian Lye Street  and  served

with  notices  to  quit will be given  alternative

accommodation  in  Housing and  Development  Board

flats,  when will they be allotted the  flats  and

where.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 7</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

unauthorised huts at Tian Lye Street are  on  land

belonging  to the Port of Singapore Authority  who

now require the land for development purposes. The

Housing  and  Development Board is  assisting  the

Port  of  Singapore Authority by offering  to  the

dwellers in these unauthorised huts Housing  Board

flats  in  Bukit Ho Swee, Queenstown, Kallang  and

other  housing  estates. There were originally  91

families  affected by this clearance. 35 of  these

families  have  found  their  own  alternative  accommodation,  and  the  remaining  56  have   been

rehoused in Housing Board flats.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Mr S. V. Lingam</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development whether  he  would  consider

providing street lights to MacPherson Home Estate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, street lights

have  already  been installed in  the  streets  in

MacPherson  Homes  Estate at a  cost  of  $22,000.

These lights were turned on on 5th March, 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MacPherson Homes Estate is a private housing

estate.  The  roads  in  this  Estate  were  until

recently  private  streets.  Streets  lights  were

installed  after the roads were  made  up  to  the

satisfaction of the Director of Public  Works  and

taken over as public streets.

supplied to residents of Lorong Koo Chye.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, electricity

<div align="center"><b>(Community centre)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr P. Govindaswamy</b> asked the Minister for

Social Affairs whether the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>



Government  proposes  community  centre   in   the

Division; where will it be sited, and when will it

be ready.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker. Sir, the

question  of  building a community centre  in  the

Anson  Electoral Division has, in fact, been under

consideration by the Government since  1962.  Five

possible   sites   for  the  (Centre   have   been

investigated but none have been found suitable.  A

sixth   possible  site  in  Wallich   Street   was

investigated hut it was subsequently found that it

had  been  reserved  for  the  construction  of  a

school.  A seventh site at the junction  of  Anson

Road and Keppel Road is now being investigated.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 8</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>PERUMAL AND SIVAN TEMPLES</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr S. V. Lingam</b> asked the Minister for Social

Affairs (a) why the construction of the two  Hindu

Temples,  namely, the Perumal Temple in  Serangoon

Road and the Sivan Temple in Orchard Road is being

held up; (b) when did the construction work start:

(c)  what  is  the amount of money collected  from

members  of the public; (d) what is the  estimated

cost  of  the  construction; and (e) who  are  the

members of the Temple committees.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) I am told that there has been sonie

unavoidable delay because the Sthapathies  (Temple

Architects) arrived in Singapore only towards  the

end of last year because of passport difficulties.

1-lowever,  as the hon. Member knows, construction

work on Hindu Temples of this size generally takes

a considerable  time  to  complete,  and  I   am

infornied  that  work on these  temples  has  been

going on at the normal rate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Building Contractors commenced the work

of  the  building of Perumal and Sivan Temples  at

the  beginning of April 1961, and completed  their

work on both Temples in May 1962. Since the latter

date  the  Indian Sthapathies have been busy  with

the ornarnental works in the Temples.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 9</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The total amount of money collected from

members of the public up to February 1964, by  the

Board  and  the  Building Fund Committee  for  the

Sivan  and Perumal Temples, including the  sum  of

$50,000   contributed  by  the  City  Council   of

Singapore towards the cost of rebuilding the Sivan

Temple  together  with the accrued  interest,  was

about $133,500. There is still a sum of $30,000 to

be  collected from members of the public who  have

promised contributions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The estimated construction cost of the Sivan

Temple  is  $115,000.  The estimated  construction

cost  of  the  Perumal Temple  together  with  the

Rajagopuram (or the High Entrance Tower)  will  be

in  the region of $270,000; this includes the cost

of  boundary wall and wire mesh fencing  estimated

at  $15,000.  The  total cost of the  two  Temples

will, therefore, be in the region of $385,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) The four Hindu Temples under the

administration of the Muslim and Hindu  Endowments

Board   are  managed  by  a  Management  Committee

composed of the following:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) G. Kandasamy (Chairman)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) V. Pakirisamy



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) P. Govindaswamy Pillai



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) S. L. Perumal



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) M. Balasubramanion



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) R. S. Sithamparam (Hon. Secretary)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) S. Ramaiah Thevar



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) K. Samiappan



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) S. Pothiappan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Mr Speaker, a supplementary

question: Is the Minister aware that the six domes

of  the  two temples which were completed in  1962

were pulled down and rebuilt in 1963? And can  the

Minister confirm that there was a waste of $40,000

of   public   funds  due  to  this  constructional

bungling?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I do wish that

the  Member  could give me notice to answer  that.

But, anyway, I wish to state here, with regard  to

his  question, that I have already  stated  in  my

answer that there has been some



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 10</b></font><br><br>



unavoidable delay because the Sthapathies  arrived

in Singapore only towards the end of last year.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> A supplementary question again, Mr

Speaker,  Sir.  Can  the Minister  make  it  clear

whether the following four amounts are included in

the  sum of $133,500, i.e. (i) $50,000 contributed

by  the  City Council; (ii) approximately  $11,000

paid as voluntary donations by certain Muslim  and

Hindu  shopkeepers  of  Campbell  Lane  for  trans

ferring of tenancy of properties belonging to  the

Hindu  Temples;  and  (iii)  approximately  $5,900

collected  from  the public for  the  purposes  of

Hindu  destitutes' burial fund, which  amount  was

handed over by the Hindu Advisory Board: and  (iv)

$30,000 promised by members of the public?



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Would the Member like to repeat

that question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> Can the Minister make it clear

whether the following four amounts are included in

the  sum  of $133,500: (i) $50,000 contributed  by

the  City Council; (ii) approximately $11,000 paid

as voluntary donations by certain Muslim and Hindu

shopkeepers  of Campbell Lane for transferring  of

tenancy  of properties belonging to Hindu Temples;

(iii)  approximately  $5,900  collected  from  the

public  for  purposes of Hindu destitutes'  burial

fund,  which amount was handed over by  the  Hindu

Advisory  Board:  and  (iv)  $30,000  promised  by

members of the public?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inche Othman: Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is

that  the amount of $133,500 includes the  sum  of

$50,000   contributed  by  the  City  Council   of

Singapore,  hut  it does not include  the  $30,000

which has yet to be collected from those who  have

promised to contribute.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no information regarding the other

figures stated in the question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lingam:</b> In the interests of the public, will

the  Minister  consider looking deeper  into  this

matter and give a written answer?



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Othman Bin Wok:</b> If the Member so wishes, yes.

<div align="center"><b>DEFENCE SCHEME</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Finance)</b></div>



<br><br>2.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Before we go on to the introduction

of Government Bills, is there any Minister wishing

to make a statement?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Mr  Speaker, Sir, you may recollect that  on  the

28th  November  last  year  I  described  to   the

Assembly,  in the course of my Budget Speech,  the

situation   facing   the  economy   of   Singapore

following upon Indonesia's economic confrontation.

I  also  outlined the measures that the Government

proposed to take to offset the adverse effects  of

economic  confrontation. I said that a  study  was

made  in  July 1963, some months before the  trade

suspension actually took place, to assess the  pos

sible effects of an economic blockade of Singapore

by  Indonesia. Our calculations showed  that  some

8,200  workers will eventually he laid off in  the

event  that  the Indonesian blockade is completely

effective.  There  may  be  a  reduction  of   the

national income by some $208 million or 8.7  per

cent of the gross national income.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just over six months have passed and both

Members  of  this  House and  the  general  public

outside  may  be  interested to know  what  damage

economic  confrontation did actually inflict  upon

our economy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go into details, it may be useful if I

were   to   remind  the  Assembly  of  the   gross

exaggeration  indulged in by some Members  of  the

Opposition in assessing the losses that  we  would

suffer by way of income and employment. One Member

of the House placed an increase in unemployment as

high  as 20,000. Barisan Sosialis Members  in  particular predicted with great relish a collapse  of

the  economy  which  they had gleefully  expected.

This is, of course, entirely in keeping with their

pro-Indonesia anti-Malaysia political line.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I stress that the estimates which emerged

from  our researches last July were based  on  the

assumption of a total



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 12</b></font><br><br>



closure   of  firms  engaged  in  processing   raw

materials imported from Indonesia as well  as  the

complete  laying-off of ships formerly  plying  on

Indonesian routes? In other words, they  were  the

maximum possible effects, in the event, the  worst

did  not happen. Ships that were temporarily laid-off  soon  resumed work on new shipping routes  to

Burma,  to  Thailand,  to ports  of  Malaysia,  in

cluding those in Sabah and Sarawak, Hongkong,  and

other  places. The closing down of all  processing

factories also did not take place. For some months

stocks  of raw materials were adequate to maintain

production   and   employment,  and   after   that

alternative supply lines were opened to  enable  a

number of these firms to continue in business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October last year the Department of Economic

Defence  was established and it put into operation

two schemes. The first was to pay laid-off workers

a  monthly  allowance equivalent to two-thirds  of

their income from employment. The total number  of

workers  who  received benefits under this  scheme

was 4,202 at its maximum. The figure as on

30th  May was 2,545, a decline of sonic-thing like 1,700.  This substantial reduction was principally

due  to  the  large  number of  workers  who  have

regained  employment either  in  new  or  existing

industries   under  the  Direction  of  Employment

Scheme  of the Government or who returned to  work

when their former employers resumed production.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total amount of money paid up to 30th May

this  year  was  $1,438,830.10.  This  amount  was

shared equally between employers and Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second aspect of the Economic Defence

Scheme,  Government tried to find work  for  these

laid-off  employees.  To do this,  certain  powers

were given to the Director of Economic Defence  to

require specified employers to recruit from  these

laid-off workers on the register. In February this

year,  the Direction of Employment Scheme was  put

into  operation, and the present  position  is  as

follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the 4,202 workers who have

previously mentioned had received these monthly

allowances, another 619 were registered for re-employment



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 13</b></font><br><br>



purposes. These persons did not qualify  for  the

allowances   either  because  they  were   casual

workers  not attached to any particular  employer

or they were not engaged in industries which were

totally   affected  by  economic   confrontation.

Examples  of  these  are the water-front  workers

engaged  in  the Roads traffic of  the  Singapore

Harbour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in all the Government was faced with the task

of  finding  jobs  for 4,821 registered  persons,

victims  of Indonesian confrontation one  way  or

the  other. It  will  be  noted  that  this   is

substantially  less than the estimate  of  8,200.

The reasons for this I have already discussed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As on the 30th May this year, a total of 2,740

vacancies  were  notified  to  the  Director   of

Economic  Defence.  All  pioneer  industries  are

required  to  recruit  their  workers  under  the

scheme,   as  well  as  all  firms  engaging   50

employees  or more each. These are the industries

which  the  Advisory Committee established  under

the  Economic  Defence (Direction of  Employment)

Ordinance recommended as suitable for redirection

purposes.   Public  Authorities  and   Government

departments  were  also required  to  notify  the

Director  of vacancies in Division IV and

daily-rated   occupations.  Of  the  total   of

2,740 vacancies  notified  to the  Department,  pioneer

industries form the largest group, offering 1,036

jobs.  Government and Statutory  Bodies  reported

932  jobs.  Private firms offered 708 places  and

the Armed Services 114.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A part of the notified vacancies could not be

filled  up  from  the register  of  the  Economic

Defence   Department  because   the   skill   and

experience    required   were   not    available.

Exemptions were, therefore, granted in respect of

these vacancies and the Department and firms were

authorised  to recruit from outside  the  scheme.

The total number of exemptions granted as on 30th

May  was  1,045.  This leaves a  total  of  1,745

vacancies  into  which laid-off  workers  may  be

absorbed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this number, 878 workers have either been

employed or are in the process of being employed,

and  this leaves 867 vacancies still unfilled and

available for posting.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 14</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the total figure of 4,821 now on the Economic

Defence  register  for  employment.  2,177   have

already been reemployed or are in the process  of

being   re-employed.   Together   with   unfilled

vacancies of 867, we get a total of 3,054 jobs as

against 4,821 workers on the register. Therefore,

as  on  30th  May the position was a  surplus  of

workers over jobs in the number of 1,767.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of vacancies notified to the Economic

Defence Department conies in at the rate of about

700  a  month of which 450 to 500 may be suitable

for employment of persons on the register. At the

rate  progress is being made, it will not be very

long  before all those who could be employed will

be absorbed and redirected under the scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some observations to make on the

implementation of the plan to re-direct  laid-off

workers.  This operation has proved  to  be  more

complex than we had expected it to be. It is  not

sufficient  to offer the worker any job  anywhere

even  if he or she is capable of performing  such

work,  and  even if the prospective  employer  is

willing  to  accept  the  worker.  There  is  the

important question of travelling distance, it  is

no  good offering a worker living in Sembawang  a

job  in Jurong if a large slice of his daily  pay

will  be absorbed by travelling to and from work.

So  even  if  there  are suitable  vacancies  and

suitable workers, it is sometimes not possible to

match them together and if the worker refuses for

good  reason to take on work offered, it  is  not

reasonable  to disqualify him from the  financial

benefits of the Economic Defence Scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, certain employers are particular

about the type of worker they want to engage  in.

Our  textiles  mills  and the  Garment  factories

insist  on engaging young girls and women.  Their

preference is for those aged between 18 and 21.  We  have  persuaded  them  to  accept  women

workers  up  to  the age of 25.  These  employers

argue  that  the  type  of work  requires  manual

dexterity     and     a     capacity     to     learn   new   techniques which  are often absent

among older women.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 15</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the laid-off workers there are

unfortunately a large number of them. 850 in  all,

who  are  more than 50 years old. It is extremely

difficult to place them in new employment as  most

employers  want to have younger workers whom  they

can  train  and retain in employment  for  a  long

time.  The  problem  of the  older  workers  is  a

difficult  one and the (Government  is  trying  to

find ways and means of resolving it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another difficulty in finding places for

laid-off  workers  is  a reluctance of  some  of  these

workers to come forward for employment. There  are

486 workers  or  the  register  who  have   been

approached four times or more and yet have  failed

to  turn  up  for  interview in  job  registration

process. It is regrettable that these workers have

made  no  effort  to cooperate with  the  Economic

Defence  Scheme in getting alternative employment.

If  they  persist in this attitude, there  is  no

alternative  but to strike them off  the  register

once they have received their full payment for the

six  months. Because of these workers, it is becom

ing   increasingly  difficult  to  fill  vacancies

notified  by  employers.  The  response  rate   of

workers  turning  up  for interviews  has  dropped

recently  to as low as 12 per cent of all  persons

called  up. Members will agree that it is unreason

able  to  keep vacancies over a protracted  period

and  other workers deprived of employment for  the

benefit  of  these unco-operative workers  on  the

Defence Scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final observation I want to make relates to

a number of employers who are giving, wittingly or

otherwise, a misleading impression of the work  of

the Department. When they receive applications for

work, they  reply  to  the applicants  that  they

cannot  offer them work without the permission  of

the  Economic Defence Department. In  fact,  these

employers  have  no vacancies  to  offer  hut  the

regrettable   impression  is  created   that   the

Department  is  obstructing  the  filling  up   of

vacancies. As I said before, exemptions  from  the

provisions  of  the Ordinance are  freely  granted

when the type of employment is such that there  is

no suitable candidate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 16</b></font><br><br>



in the register and, in fact, more  than  a

thousand exemptions had so far been granted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, the damage inflicted on Singapore's

economy by Indonesian confrontation has been  much

less  than I had ever dared to hope. In my  Budget

Speech last year I said that we should be able  to

make  good  the  effects of confrontation  in  two

years.  As it turned out, this was too pessimistic

a  forecast.  Singapore's economy remains  strong,

the  building  boom  goes  on,  and  the  pace  of

industrialisation   proceeds   with   undiminished

vigour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I wish to thank all those who

have  helped  to make these measures  of  Economic

Defence  as effective and successful as they  have

been.  The  leaders of The National  Trades  Union

Congress,   the   Chambers   of   Commerce,    the

Manufacturers   Association  and   the   Employers

Federation  have  rendered invaluable  service  in

advising  the Government on important issues.  The

large  body  of workers and employers involved  in

this  exercise have displayed an exemplary  public

spirit  in carrying out the operations. Last,  but

by no means least, our thanks are due to the small

but   dedicated  stall  of  the  Economic  Defence

Department who have carried out new and unfamiliar

tasks with skill and energy.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> May I remind Members that there is no

debate  on  a  Ministerial statement? But  Members

wishing may ask questions.



<br><br><!--  -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  the  Minister for  Finance  delivered  a

statement  just  now in which lie  mentioned  that

some  water-front workers were not  qualified  for

financial  aid under the present scheme.  Are  the

Government  considering  whether  these  so-called

casual workers are not worthy of consideration for

financial aid from the Government? Another point I

wish to raise ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Please phrase your question in the

form of a question. I have just now said that

there is no debate. Just ask the Minister the

question so that he can answer it. But the Member

should no paraphrase his question with a lengthy

statement.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 17</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): `The first

question I wish to ask, of the Minister concerned

is whether the casual workers on the water-front

are being considered for any financial aid to be

given by the Government, because their plight is

very miserable; and whether the Government is not

to be held responsible to look after their

interests?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another question is this. The Minister for

Finance  has  said just now that some workers  are

not willing to accept jobs offered by the Economic

Defence  Department. I want to know what  kind  of

wages they would be able to get out of these  jobs

offered. Why should they finally reject the  offer

of these jobs?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is this. The Minister for

Finance has said that some factories have resumed

production after having laid off for some time, or

some have changed their form of production. I want

to know how many of such factories have turned to

other forms of production.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The first question with regard

to  the water-front workers, Mr Speaker. Sir.  On

the  Second  Reading of the Bill, I explained  the

position quite clearly. Those who are eligible for

this  form  of assistance are those  who  have  an

employer, who draw regular income, and who are  on

the  pay-roll  of the employer. The employer  pays

half  and  the  Government pays half.  Water-front

workers  are casual workers - lighter  men,  lorry

people  and  so on. They do not have  any  regular

employers  and, therefore, it is not  possible  to

include  them in the scheme. It is not technically

possible.  Further, because they do not  work  for

any particular employer, they have no loss of jobs

because  the handling of Indonesian goods is  only

one  portion  of  the total cargo handled  at  the

water  front.  There  may well  be  a  decline  of

income,  as  indeed  has happened  in  many  other

businesses,  retail business  and  so  on  and  so

forth.  But  there has not been a  total  loss  of

income as has taken place in the case of employees

of  factories  which closed down  because  no  raw

materials were coming from Indonesia.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 18</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is why workers refused

employment when it was offered to them. I  do  not

know whether there was a slip in translation.  But

I  said nothing about workers refusing employment.

What I said was this. I had better read the text:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'There were some 486 workers who were asked to

turn  up  at  the Ministry of Labour  and  various

other recruiting centres to be offered jobs.'



<br><br>They were asked no less than four times. And they

never  turned up at all to consider the jobs  that

were  available  to them. Obviously  this  is  not

quite playing the game.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question is about employers who have

changed their line of business. I have no detailed

information  on  this. I do  not  know  whether  a

person  who  was  formerly milling low-grade  Indo

nesian  rubber could, say, turn over to  producing

high-grade  nylon  goods.  I  think  it  is   very

unlikely.  Obviously if they go into a  completely

different  line, and if they employ more  than  50

workers, they would come within the ambit  of  the Economic Defence Ordinance. But if the Member  has

any information on this, I should be very glad  to

receive it.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  we  have received complaints  from

some  workers who were adversely affected  by  the

Indonesian    economic    confrontation.     Their

complaints  boil  down  to this.  They  have  been

mentioned   by  the  Minister  for  Finance.   The

Economic Defence Board ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> What is the question? As I have said

before, could we go on

straight  to  the question? Ask your question  and

you will have your answer.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, I would like to ask the Minister to

be patient because I am dealing with some

complaints made by some workers. Without dealing

with the complaints. I cannot ask questions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 19</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> On a point of order. If

there are any complaints, the Member should first lay

them before the Director of Economic Defence. If he is

not satisfied, he can always approach me personally or

by letter. The Member has got to observe procedure. He

can ask questions. He cannot turn this into a debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Member should ask his

question straightaway.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Sonic  workers have been offered jobs far away  from

their place of residence. An example is this: a  man

living  in  Jurong has to work in  Sembawang.  As  a

result  of  this,  he has to incur  heavy  transport

expenses.  So  I  want to ask the  Minister  whether

there  are  any plans to pay them some transport  al

lowances. This is the first question.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is this: some workers have been

forced  to  accept  employment  which  they  do  not

consider suitable because of distance, low wages  or

some  other  reason.  I wish  to  ask  the  Minister

whether his attention has been drawn to this matter.

Can he give us a detailed report on this matter?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,   the   subject  of  transport  allowances   of

employees  of private business is not a  ministerial

responsibility. It is not the business of Government

to provide free transport allowances to employees of

private  firms.  But  if the Barisan  Sosialis  have

enough  funds and they want to do public charity.  I

am  sure  that  employers will be too  delighted  to

receive the money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is about forcing the workers to

take  unsuitable jobs. A worker is not compelled  to

accept  an unsuitable job. If the wages in  the  new

employment are less than the amount he is  receiving

under economic defence, he has every right to reject

it  and  to  continue to receive financial  benefit.

Even  if  it is more than his contribution  but  the

cost of transport is such as to make it less, we  do

not  ask  him  to accept this offer.  In  fact,  the

Director  of Economic Defence has been most  liberal

and considerate in listening to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 20</b></font><br><br>



workers' reasons of why they cannot accept  this  or

that  job. But, of course, there is a limit. When  a

suitable  job is offered and the transport  cost  is

not  high  and the worker still refuses to take  it,

then he is laid off from the scheme.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

The  Minister  for Finance has said that  there  are

some  837  persons who refuse to go  to  the  Labour

Department. I wish to ask him why they refuse to  go

to  the  Labour Department for consideration  of  employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next question is: what other remedies is the

Government  considering to offer  such  persons  who

refuse to go to the Labour Department?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> The hon. Member has got his

figures wrong. It is not 837 but 486 - quite  a  big

difference! As to why these persons do not go to the

Labour  Department. I do not know. They  never  turn

up!  Maybe the Barisan Sosialis has been urging them

not to go and get jobs because they want workers  to

remain unemployed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I shall be introducing immediately after

this  the Land Acquisition (Amendment No. 2)  Bill

which  will  make  major alterations  in  the  law

regarding  acquisition of private land for  public

purposes. Some basic principles are involved  and

I  propose to refer the Bill to a Select Committee

in order that landowners and others concerned with

the  process  of land acquisition can  make  their

representations  to the Select Committee  of  this

Assembly.  Pending the consideration of this  next

Bill  by the Select Committee and passage in  this

House, there are certain interim provisions to  be

looked  after, namely, the  position  of  certain

appeals  which  have already proceeded  under  the

existing  Ordinance and which, unless stayed,  may

proceed  to a conclusion whilst the amending  Bill

is under consideration of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, clause 2 of this Bill suspends the

provisions  of section 19 of the Land  Acquisition

Ordinance which provides that whenever any  person

whose land has been acquired for public purpose is

dissatisfied with the Collector of Land  Revenue's

award of compensation on specified grounds, he may

within  a specified time require the Collector  to

refer the matter to Court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 stays all cases which have already been

referred  to  Court  but in which  proceedings  or

hearings  have not commenced. This Bill will  hold

all  proceedings until the House has had  time  to

deliberate on the Land Acquisition (Amendment  No.

2) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [The Prime Minister].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, copies of

this  Bill have already been circulated last  week

to  Members of this Assembly in order to give them

time to peruse it before the Second Reading. I  do

not  propose  to take this Bill through  to  three

Readings.  The  purpose  of  the  Certificate   of

Urgency is in order that the Bill can be committed

to a Select Committee after the Second Reading.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, on the 24th of July, in the

previous Assembly, we introduced the Land

Acquisition (Temporary Provisions) Bill which

sought, amongst



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 25</b></font><br><br>



other  things,  to peg the value  of  land  to  be

acquired for public purposes to that prevailing on

the  1st of January, 1961. Unfortunately,  it  was

blocked  and it lapsed with the Assembly's dissolution. Consequent on the establishment of Malaysia,

it is necessary to reconsider the entire question,

having  regard  to  the constitutional  provisions

applicable throughout Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the debate on the 16th of December last year

on   the  Development  Estimates  for  1964,  when

debating the question of increased land values and

the  cost of land acquisition, I stated two  broad

principles  which  would guide the  Government  in

amending  legislation on the acquisition of  land,

namely,  first,  that no private landowner  should

benefit from development which had taken place  at

public expense: and, secondly, that the price paid

on  the acquisition for public purposes should not

be higher than what the land would have been worth

had  the  Government not contemplated  development

generally  in the area. I said then that  I  would

introduce  legislation which would help to  ensure

that  increases in land values, because of  public

development, should not benefit the landowner, but

should benefit the community at large. Land  is  a

fixed  commodity,  and with mounting  pressure  on

land  as  a  result  of population  expansion  and

development, land values tend inevitably to  rise.

But for public purposes of acquisition, we attempt

in   this  Bill  to  exclude  the  landowner  from

windfall gains in increases of land values  as  a

result,   first,  of  either  public   expenditure

already  incurred  in  the  area,  or  speculative

increases  in the price of land in an  area  which

has been earmarked for development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this No. 2 Amendment Bill includes

provisions which embody these two principles.  The

opportunity  has  also been taken  to  make  other

changes in procedural matters and in the manner of

assessing  compensation by the Collector  of  land

acquired  for  public purposes. The Bill  proposes

substantial  alterations in  the  law  and  it  is

intended  now  to refer the Bill to a  Select  Com

mittee  where  it  can  be considered  in  greater

detail and where public representations on it  can

be received.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 26</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Explanatory Statement of the Bill sets out

the contents of the Bill Section 5 of the

principal Ordinance which provided for the

acquisition of land for public purposes has been

redrafted to define specifically and enlarge the

meaning of "public purposes". This redraft, which

is more specific, follows the Federal Land

Acquisition Act and is considered desirable in

view of the increasing tempo of public development

and the need to acquire land for a variety of

public purposes, including residential development

by the Housing and Development Board, industrial

development by the Economic Development Board, as

well as urban renewal of the City as envisaged in

the next few years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ordinance has also provided for a more

expeditious procedure of taking possession of

lands in cases of urgency. For example, in the

case of areas devastated by fire, the provisions

will enable immediate possession of such lands to

be taken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major alteration is made in respect of appeals.

Under the existing Ordinance, any person

dissatisfied with an award of the Collector may

ask the Collector to refer the matter to Court.

All the consequential administrative-work devolves

on the Land Office and then a single Judge of the

High Court sitting with two assessors decides on

the compensation payable in cases where the award

is not less than $5,000. The amending Bill now

provides for an Appeals Board to be presided over

by a Commissioner of Appeals. The Commissioner

will be assisted in certain cases by two assessors

drawn from a panel. This Board will deal with ap

peals on acquisition awards. Appeals to the High

Court against the decision of the Board will only

be on points of law. These new appeal provisions

follow the precedents which have been set in the

United Kingdom and in Australia of placing

questions of this nature involving specialist

evaluations before administrative tribunals rather

than the courts of law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of the law in regard to the

assessment   of   compensation  have   also   been

redrafted. The Bill provides that when  the  value

of land has been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 27</b></font><br><br>



increased by reason of development of the

neighbourhood by provision of roads, drains,

electricity, water, gas, sewerage, social,

educational or recreational facilities by any

public or statutory authorities within live years

preceding the date of the acquisition, such

increase shall not be taken into account.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we put in provisionally the figure

of five years prior to date of acquisition, but I

would like to state here that it may well be that,

after hearing representations from interested

parties and representations from the Economic

Development Board and other development organs of

the Government, the preceding number of years may

he increased to anywhere between live and 10

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is also specifically provided that

decreases in value due to encumbrances such as

occupation by squatters and so on, shall be taken

into account in fixing the award. Again, the Bill

makes it clear that restrictions imposed under the

Planning Ordinance which affects the market value

of the land shall be taken into account. Another

major change is that a ceiling to market value has

been placed to ensure that the award will not

exceed the most recent value declared and accepted

for the purposes of assessing tax or duty payable

where such declaration has been made within two

years of acquisition, or in other cases a

consideration of purchase price on its last sale

or transfer if within two years of the

acquisition. I think all practising solicitors are

aware that for quite a long time now, valuation

for revenue purposes has always been different

from valuation for compensation on acquisition,

with the result that there is a disparity between

what the State gets and what the State has to pay.

This provision will ensure that when estate duty

is paid or other assessments are made for revenue

purposes, a price more approximate to that of the

market value of the land will be entered in the

estimates. The peril will be that if it were not

so done, then it is open to the Crown to acquire

such land within two



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 28</b></font><br><br>



years of such declaration at the price at which it

has been declared for revenue purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another change proposed is that interest payable

on the difference between the Collector's award

and the award ultimately to be decided upon by the

Board shall be at the rate of six per cent and not

as at present - eight per cent. This follows the

rate payable under the Federation Land Acquisition

Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of minor amendments

considered desirable from the administrative point

of view. They have also been included as well as

transitional provisions with regard to

declarations of acquisition of land and references

to Court made before the coming into operation of

this Land Acquisition (Amendment No. 2) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Assembly have been provided with

copies of this Bill sometime early last week. With

the rapidly expanding population, the growing pace

of  public  development, the increasing  tempo  of

housing  and  other  public development,  land  is

becoming  a  scarce  and  expensive  commodity  in

Singapore. It is imperative, therefore,  that  all

available land is put to the most advantageous use

for  the benefit of the people of Singapore. Swamp

and waste land, therefore, has to be reclaimed. So

too  suitable  stretches of  foreshore  along  the

coast of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is estimated that 25 per cent of the

total area of the island of Singapore consists  of

waste or swamp land. I have left in the Library of

this  House a map of Singapore Island marking  the

areas  where reclamation is planned. Most of  them

lie in the northern and western parts of Singapore

where  mangrove  swamps  could  be  reclaimed  for

either agricultural or industrial development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an area of 168 acres being reclaimed at

Sungei Poyan for agricultural purposes. Eventually

some  900 acres at the Sungei Poyan/Sungei  Berih

area  will  be  reclaimed by  building  a  dam  at

Tanjong Sekopek over the estuary of the confluence

with  a  control gate to prevent intrusion of  sea

water   and   to  allow  the  land  reclaimed   to

desalinate over a period of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same method will be used in Phase II of this

scheme to reclaim another 300 acres further  south

of the First Phase in Sungei Bayan/Sungei Pasir on

the   northern   side   of  Tanjong   Pasir   Laba

promontory.  The  total cost  of  this  scheme  is

estimated at around $1.75 million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Third Phase, a further 450 acres will be

reclaimed in the Sungei Perak area, south  of  the

Second Phase.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 30</b></font><br><br>



Then  further towards the centre of the island  in

the  Kallang  Basin,  an  area  of  387  acres  of

mangrove swamps and land which go below high  tide

level  is  being reclaimed. A first 32 acres  have

already  been established with surplus earth  from

Bukit  Ho  Swee. In Phase I, altogether  some  200

acres  will  be reclaimed with surplus earth  from

Toa  Payoh and Bukit Ho Swee. There is the problem

of  acquisition  and  resettlement  in  this  area

covering about 89 out of the 200 acres.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Second Phase, a further 187 acres will be

reclaimed  with surplus earth from Paya Lebar  and

Ulu Bedok. This project in Kallang Basin will Cost

$15 million over a period of five years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then on the east coast, a pilot scheme for

foreshore reclamation has been established, and 48

acres  of  land reclaimed at Bedok at  a  cost  of

about three-quarters of a million dollars. It  has

been successful, and the plan now is to reclaim  a

total area of 1,200 acres from Bedok to Rhu Cross,

near  the  end  of the Tanjong Rhu  promontory,  a

distance of over six miles extending on an average

of  one-third of a mile out to sea along the shore

line.  Earth  from  Siglap Plain  and  the  former

Katong  Catchment  area will  be  used.  The  land

reclaimed   will  be  used  for  public   purposes

including an express highway from Bedok to Tanjong

Rhu,  public  parks, housing, schools,  and  other

public amenities. But it is proposed to set  aside

a  portion  of  this  land reclaimed  for  private

development.  In this way, a total cost  of  about

$48 million, $33 million of which is estimated  to

be  required for reclamation work and $15  million

for a sea wall, will be in part recovered by sales

to    private   developers   for   high    quality

development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the Tanjong Pagar harbour area,

reclamation is proceeding on a plan to  create  48

acres of land in the East Lagoon area.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reclamation has also increased the area of Pulau

Semulong, which is now a shipbuilding yard in  the

Jurong  Industrial complex, and the area has  been

increased  from  56 acres to 77 acres.  Plans  are

also  being  finalised  for reclamation  of  large

portions of the shore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 31</b></font><br><br>



line  in  the  Jurong harbour area  and  also  of

Sungei Jurong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in trying to achieve this aim of reclaiming

more swamp and waste land and the foreshore to

provide more land so badly needed in Singapore,

the Government should not be hampered or hindered

by elaborate and lengthy procedures with regard

to reclamations, nor should it be faced with

claims for alleged injurious affection and compensation from private landowners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Foreshores (Amendment) Bill has been drafted

to revise the existing Foreshores Ordinance with

a view to eliminating the elaborate and Iengthy

procedure in connection with foreshore

reclamation and in the assessment of claims for

compensation in respect of such foreshore

reclamation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main provision in this Bill is clause 4

which seeks to repeal section 7 of the Ordinance

relating to compensation for interference with

public or private rights in certain cases, and to

substitute therefor a new section providing that

there shall be no compensation as of right in

respect of any land or any interest therein

alleged to have been injuriously affected whether

on account of loss of sea frontage or for any

other reason by the execution of such reclamation

works. However, where the execution of such

reclamation works has directly caused damage to

property, the Owner may appeal to the Minister

for relief, and the Minister is empowered to

order the payment of compensation or the

execution of repairs as are necessary. The

decision of the Minister is final.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of this new provision, clause 5 of the

Bill repeals sections 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the

Foreshores Ordinance which lay down lengthy and

elaborate procedures for notice of foreshore re

clamation to be given, procedure for determining

any claims to compensation and the hearing of

such claims. They will now no longer be

necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another amendment is clause 3 which provides

that the area of land for which the Minister is

empowered to authorise reclamation would be

increased from



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 32</b></font><br><br>



one acre outside port limits to ten acres and

within port limits shall be extended from 5,000

square feet to five acres. The existing

limitation is unrealistic under the pressure of

our present land needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two other clauses in the Bill need only brief

mention. Clause 2 provides for permission for the

erection of any building within 50 feet of any

foreshore to be approved by the Director of

Public Works. At present, the Ordinance limits

such approval to within 50 feet of the bank of

any port, river or channel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 is a procedural amendment to provide

for only one insertion in the Gazette of the

substance of proposed foreshore leases together

with a description of the property to be leased.

This makes for expeditiousness by obviating the

necessity of having to publish in every issue of

the Gazette for a period of three months.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there is urgency in proceeding with land

reclamation in Singapore. Work which has been

slowed down will be speeded up with the passage

of this Bill. Because of expanding population,

increasing industrial progress, higher standards

of Public housing, educational, social and health

buildings, and the need for more open spaces, we

have to stretch our available land to its

maximum.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have today, Mr Speaker, Sir, introduced two

other Bills - the Land Acquisition (Amendment)

Bill and the Planning (Amendment) Bill - together

with this one, and they are based, albeit in an

imperfect way, on certain allied principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill, which

has been referred to Select Committee, seeks to

prevent the Government from having to pay

enhanced compensation rates when acquiring land

for public purposes when the reason for the

enhanced value has been because of development in

the area at public expense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Planning (Amendment) Hill provides that

where there is to be an increase in density which

will be allowed for building, a premium shall be

paid. This premium will in part defray the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 33</b></font><br><br>



extra burden on public expenditure as a result of

a higher density of population being allowed

requiring in consequence a higher expenditure on

roads and the solution of traffic problems, the

laying on of municipal and other services and

other public expenditure to cater for more densely

inhabited areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Foreshores (Amendment) Bill seeks to

prevent landowners from pursuing outmoded concepts

of property rights which are no longer valid in

the context of public development on public

expenditure in present-day Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no foolproof way in

which landowners can be deprived of benefit as a

result of public expenditure, for public

expenditure unavoidably and inevitably increases

the value of land. Sometimes, as in the case of

this Foreshores (Amendment) Bill, it is

conceivable that the value of land may be

diminished as a result of loss, for instance, of

sea frontage. It could, under what we consider to

be an archaic concept of property, be claimed that

if one were accustomed to look across the main

road to the sea one would have suffered an

injurious affection if looking across the main

road some six months later one views not the sea

but a park, the sea having receded by a further

third of a mile. But even in this case, it is more

than probable that any decrease in value as a

result of the loss of sea frontage will be offset

by increased value that will result from the

building of an express highway from Bedok to Rhu

Cross, providing residents in the area with

quicker access to the central business district of

the city, and also an increase in land value

generally in the area must result in the laying

out of parks and other public buildings and

amenities on the reclaimed land.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of these various amendments is to

ensure,  albeit imperfectly, that the increase  in

value   of  land,  because  of  the  increase   in

population and in development, should not lead  to

unjust or windfall gains by private landowners and

speculators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> Mr Speaker. I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves that the amendments

set  out  in  Appendix  I to  the  Report  of  the

Standing  Orders Committee as contained  in  Paper

L.A.  I  of  1964 be and are hereby  made  to  the

Standing Orders of this Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the amendments which have been

submitted  for  consideration in this  House  have

been  arrived at from the light of our  experience

during  the past five years in the last  Assembly.

It  is  our hope that the changes proposed in  the

Standing Orders will facilitate the proceedings in

this  Assembly, and will also assist Mr  Speaker, who is in the Chair, in the conduct of proceedings.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any charge anywhere that democratic

rights are being curtailed, I would like to refute

it  by  stating quite categorically that democracy

is  best preserved by not reducing the proceedings

in  this  House  to those of a comic  opera  or  a

circus. Unfortunately on certain occasions in  the

past,  this  House  had  to  endure  very  lengthy

repetitious speeches which Mr Speaker was  unable

to  terminate. In spite of Standing Order  No.  54

relating  to repetition of speeches, the  Chairman

had  always in the past found it difficult indeed,

especially  when speeches were made in a  language

foreign   to   the  Chairman,  to  terminate   the

repetition.  The result, of course, was  that  50

Members in this House had to tolerate it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Briefly, the principal changes proposed in this

Report are that in future, the debate on the  Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara's Speech  and  on  the  Finance

Minister's Budget Speech will be limited



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 35</b></font><br><br>



respectively to five days. In the case of the

Budget Speech, there is a one-day debate on the

Speech itself and three days are allocated for

debate on the Main Estimates and one day on the

Development Estimates. This gives a total of five

days' speaking time on the Government's Budget for

the following year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the debate on the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara's Speech, it has been found from past

experience - in fact, at the last sitting of the

Assembly - that it took only four days. However, it

is our intention to increase this period by one

further day to allow Back-benchers to make their

speeches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me come to the time and manner of speaking as

laid  down  in  Standing Order No. 43.  Speeches  to

questions  by the Chair will now be limited  to  not

more  than one hour. However, a Member who  moves  a

motion  can extend his speech by 15 minutes  if  the

House  so  allows and he is also permitted to  close

the debate by a speech lasting for not more than one

hour.  In  Committee, a Member will be permitted  to

speak  for  15 minutes. This is so, because  in  Committee, as Members in the House are aware, a  Member

can  stand up again and again to raise questions  or

to  make  further points on questions that  are  dis

cussed. Therefore, it would be tedious indeed if  in

Committee  a Member were allowed to speak  for  more

than 15 minutes at a stretch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this instance, may I also draw the attention of

Members  to the practice which is being carried  out

in  other Parliaments? There is a footnote to  Stand

ing  Order No. 43, which explains that in Nigeria  a

Member  is permitted to speak for not more  than  30

minutes  on  any subject, but that  a  mover  of  an

original  motion  is  entitled  to  45  minutes.  In

Australia  the times vary considerably. A Member  is

permitted to speak for only 25 minutes if the debate

is on the Address of Thanks by the Governor-General.

In moving the Second Reading of a Bill, the Minister

is permitted a 45-minute period and any other Member

who  wishes  to speak on the question  is  permitted

only 30 minutes. In other debates,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 36</b></font><br><br>



that is to say, on motions moved by any other

Member  of the House, the mover has only 30  minutes

and other Members have only 20 minutes. Furthermore,

in  Committee of Supply a Member is entitled to only

two  periods of 10 minutes each. That,  of  course,

means that the Member can, speak altogether for only

20 minutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, I hope, Mr Speaker, will be a happy

compromise which will enable as many Members in this

House - 51 Members - to be allocated the time to make

their  speeches.  Previously  we  have  had  Members

standing  up in this Chamber regorgitating  speeches

written  for  them by somebody else  and  the  whole

period lasting seven hours. Very often sittings  had

to  be  extended  to past midnight  and  there  were

occasions  when  many Members  of  this  House  were

absent  while a Member was spouting out  his  speech

from  his  script  and Mr Speaker had  considerable

trouble  even  to  find a quorum.  Well,  it  is  to

eliminate  this abuse of freedom of speech  in  this

Chamber  that  we have come to this  arrangement  in

this  Standing Order No. 43. I would also  add  that

any  Member in this Chamber who has anything of real

value  to say should be able to find one hour  quite

adequate  to  put his point across, it is  to  avoid

tedious  repetitions and diversions that  this  time

limit has been imposed. In fact, those who have ever

been students before are aware that they can stand a

teacher's  lecture for at the most  only  one  hour.

While  we  do not consider ourselves to be still  in

class, I feel that the majority of us would consider

that one hour is sufficiently adequate to listen  to

a  Member's speech and if he has anything worthy  of

note,  he could put it in within the period  of  one

hour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Standing Order No. 18 relating to questions

to  be  answered  in  the House,  a  Member  is  now

rationed  to three questions per day. Question  time

will  be  limited  altogether to  one  hour,  so  no

questions will be taken after half-past 3 p.m. Again

relevant  to  this,  may  I draw  the  attention  of

Members to the footnote under Standing Order No.  18

which  explains the practice in other Parliaments -

in the House of Commons



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 37</b></font><br><br>



and  in the Dewan Raayat in Kuala Lumpur? The number

of questions is limited to two and three to each Mem

ber  respectively; and furthermore Question Time  is

also  limited to one hour. However, it does not mean

that  questions  which have been introduced  on  the

Order  Paper  for  answer and which  have  not  been

disposed  of  will not be answered at  all.  On  the

contrary,  if a Member so wishes he can  inform  the

Clerk  of the Assembly or Mr Speaker that he wishes

these  questions which have not been taken  by  3.30

p.m. to be taken the following day. This, of course,

does  not mean that supplementary questions  to  the

main  question will be prohibited. Members can still

ask supplementary questions to the main question.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, these are the principal amendments

which   the  Standing  Orders  Committee  have   put

forward. I may end up by stating to the House  that,

as  far as the Government is concerned, we find that

we  should devote more time to the administration of

our  duties  and that the welfare of  the  State  is

better guarded if the Government were to devote more

of  its time to administration. I have no doubt that

we  will  come  to  this  House  now  and  then  for

legislation or for clarification of certain policies

which  have been carried out, but it certainly would

not  be  to the welfare of the State if we  were  to

spend  most  of  our  time squatting  in  this  cold

Chamber  when we could do more concrete and positive

work carrying out administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

under the pretext of facilitating the Speaker's work

and  streamlining the proceedings of this  Assembly,

the present Standing Orders which have been modelled

on  the  legislatures  of  other  countries  in  the

British  Commonwealth have been revised and will  be

passed  at  today's  sitting.  From  the  time  this

Government's motion to amend the Standing Orders and

adopt  a new set of Standing Orders has been passed.

there  will be in reality an occurrence which is  of

fundamental importance to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 38</b></font><br><br>



us.  There  will  have  happened  a  silent  counter

revolution  in  the nature and significance  of  the

Singapore  Legislative Assembly. It will be  another

crack   in   the  political  theory  of   democratic

government  which  advocates a  division  of  powers

among   the  Legislature,  the  Judiciary  and   the

Executive.  Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I  have  no  better

evidence  than the last few sentences in the  speech

of  the  Deputy  Prime Minister where  he  admitted,

openly  and  nakedly, that the Government  does  not

wish  to  waste time debating in this Assembly,  but

wishes  to  concentrate all its energy and  time  in

dealing with administration. In other words,  if  it

is  possible,  the Government wishes to  concentrate

365  days  a  year in executive work  and  does  not

bother  to  waste  even one day in  the  Legislature

except  when  it  has to conic  back  here  to  pass

certain laws like the Land Acquisition Ordinance and

the Foreshores Ordinance on a Certificate of Urgency ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Sure, sure!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Sir, indirectly the Deputy Prime

Minister has admitted that their ideal is towards  a

system  of government where the Executive will  have

full  control  of everything and will  not  have  to

waste  time with Opposition Members, sometimes  will

crack  jokes  at them or shoot them  in  their  soft

parts.  This  will be another step  forward  in  the

creation  of a one-Party State. The irony of  it  is

that  Singapore is only a State with limited  powers

working  within  the framework of a  bigger  Federal

Constitution.  Except  for  this  last  check,   the

transition to a totalitarian regime is not only real

but imminent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that is the real reason given by the Deputy

Prime Minister in the Standing Orders Committee that

we cannot proceed to a one-Party State. Not that the

majority  Party in power believes in the  system  of

parliamentary democracy, but because. Sir, we cannot

help  it.  We  are bound by a bigger  framework,  by

another bigger constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, sittings of this Assembly are now very rare

occurrences. As a matter of fact, the cushions  here ---



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 39</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Moth-eaten!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b>--- very soon will have cobwebs.

People have forgotten the existence of this Assembly.

Now with the revised Standing Orders passed, whatever

little remnants of democracy and free speech left will

he corroded even more and more. In the days of the

colonial regime, the Standing Orders of the

Legislatures were admittedly more free and democratic ---



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> So you prefer the colonial days?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Of course, it is admitted that the

colonial  masters  controlled  the  speeches  of  their

nominated Assemblymen, not through restrictive Standing

Orders,  but through nominating stooges. But now,  Sir,

when  the Government has not yet gone over to either  a

guided democracy or to a totalitarian regime like  some

other  countries, it is not yet possible  for  them  to

nominate  stooges  who  read out speeches  dictated  by

Government.  Therefore, Sir, we have today  this  gross

departure  from  the  parliamentary  system,  the  most

restrictive  Standing Orders yet to  be  found  in  the

British   Commonwealth.  These  Standing   Orders,   if

adopted,  will  make democracy a farce. The  Government

cannot  abolish  the  Assembly  altogether  at  present

because of the Federal Constitution, or either fill  it

with nominated Members. Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not know

what the Government is scared of. Is it because of  the

economic  situation deteriorating clay by day?  We  can

estimate  more  than 100,000 people unemployed  cursing

the  Government.  The Government  are  very  scared  of

criticism  for fear that the lid on the cauldron  which

they are sitting on will blow off.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, coming to these amendments. They fall under

several categories although the objective is the  same.

Having   no   power  to  abolish  this  Assembly,   the

Government have to consider what is the next best thing

to  do.  They will be adopting revised Standing Orders.

Days   of  notices  of  sittings  will  be  drastically

reduced.  Times  for debate on the Government's  policy

speech and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 40</b></font><br><br>



annual  Budget are curtailed. The number of  questions,

as   the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  has  said,  will  be

rationed.  Each  Member will have  a  ration  of  three

questions. Mr Speaker, Sir, very soon we will have  to

apply  for  coupons  to speak from the  Leader  of  the

House. Every Member cannot speak for more than one hour

in the House or 15 minutes in Committee stage. The majority in the Assembly, which means the Government Party,

however, can do many things as it wishes. By the use of

its   majority  vote,  there  will  be  two  types   of

procedures,  one  for  the majority  aid  one  for  the

minority.  It  is in similar vein. Sir, where  a  Party

practices Right-wing policies in Singapore hut seeks to

demand Left-wing social reforms and winds of change  in

the  Federation  or  like  protecting  expatriates   in

Singapore  and opposing expatriates in the  Federation;

or  like suppressing and trampling the workers'  rights

in Singapore and asking for more pay for the workers in

the   Federation;  by  suppressing  all   remnants   of

democracy  in  Singapore and asking for more  democracy

and  more freedom of speech in the Federation. It is  a

similar  vein,  Sir,  that we will  have,  through  the

majority vote, two types of democracy in this Assembly.

It  is  the  usual double-faced policy and the  supreme

fact  for  us is that Singapore is only a State  within

the Federal Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I hope time is not up yet because

the new Standing Orders have not et conic into force.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Please

go on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> I have not forgotten, Sir, that the

new  Standing  Orders will not only  restrict  Members'

freedom   of  speech  but  will  stiffen  the  punitive

provisions  against  Members  for  any  breach  of  the

Standing  Orders. In one of the explanatory statements,

it  is stated that to punish a Member by suspension  or

otherwise  can  be  moved as a  matter  of  course  and

without  notice. Mr Speaker, Sir, this  is  D-Day  not

forward, but backward for this Assembly.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 41</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Huan Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Huan Boon (Bukit Merah)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, the Party in power propose to amend the

Standing Orders of this House for their own reasons. We

have made a careful study of the amendments and we can

understand the reasons advanced by them. They are meant

to destroy parliamentary democracy here, and these

reasons are to cover up their intentions. Their main

purpose is to curb the opportunity for Opposition

Members of making speeches and to prevent us from

preparing our speeches. On the other hand, they try to

give more time and opportunity to Ministers and

Backbenchers to make speeches in order to attack

Opposition Members. Those are the main reasons for

making these amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, Standing Order 43 (8)

(a)  and (b) - it stipulates that any Member making a

speech is limited to one hour, and in Committee the

time allowed is 15 minutes for each Member. This

undoubtedly threatens our opportunity to make speeches

and curbs the content of our speeches. Of course, the

Party in power will say that the same provision is

applicable to Government Benchers so that there will

not be any injustice to the Opposition. But we would

point out that this kind of stipulation is contrary to

parliamentary democracy, because Parliament is the

highest institution where the wishes of the people can

he expressed. It is a place where State affairs and

important public matters can be discussed. Therefore,

the Standing Orders of this House should not be amended

without any good reasons. Members should be given ample

time to represent the people in their speeches.

Opposition Members should be given the opportunity to

check the Government. But now the Government intend to

limit our opportunity for making speeches. This is

contrary to parliamentary democracy.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, we can see that under certain

circumstances the Ministers can make speeches without

any restriction. For instance, under Standing Order 83,

paragraph (2), the Minister for Finance is not bound by

the provisions of Standing Order 43. And also the mover

of the motion to debate the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 42</b></font><br><br>



Yang di-Pertuan Negara's speech and the Member making a

reply are given ample time to make their speeches. From

these amendments we can see that the Party in power are

limiting  the  time of the Opposition.  Under  Standing

Order  13 the time of notice of debate of one week  has

been  reduced to two days. This means that  three  days

after  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Negara has  delivered  his

speech,  the  Party in power can convene a  sitting  to

debate  the speech. Mr Speaker, Sir, the policy speech

is a very important statement of the Government for the

whole  year.  We  would like to ask whether  Opposition

Members  can gather the necessary material  in  such  a

short  period of two days for a debate in  this  House.

The  Opposition  thus cannot have  sufficient  time  to

study  deeply  the policy statement and therefore  they

will  not be able to make effective criticisms  of  the

policy speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another undemocratic amendment. It relates to

the   reduction  of  time  for  debate  on  the  Budget

Statement.  Formerly the time allocated was five  days,

but  flow the time is limited to three days' debate  on

the   Main  Estimates  and  one  day's  debate  on  the

Development Estimates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the various items of revenue for the

Government departments come from the people. Of course,

the  people have a right to know and to discuss the use

of  these  monies.  Therefore, the time  limit  on  the

debate  on the Estimates will mean that Opposition  Mem

bers will be prevented from making full use of the time

to  criticise  the  Government and  to  study  how  the

Government  is making use of public funds.  The  people

will then suffer. Thus the reduction of time amounts to

a  reduction of the right of the Opposition Members  to

make their speeches here. Today we represent the people

in this House, and if we cannot have sufficient time to

make speeches as their representatives, then it is  not

only  a loss to us Opposition Members, but also a  loss

of  the  democratic rights of the people. As Opposition

Members,  we  have the responsibility to safeguard  the

rights  of the people and to prevent these rights  from

being abused by the Party in power.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 43</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>4.40 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, ever since I received the revised Standing Orders of this

House,  after  deep  thought and  study  of  these

amendments  to the Standing Orders.  I  find  that

they  are  improper and unreasonable. I feel  that

they  are  intended  to curb the  freedom  and  opportunity to raise effective criticism against the

government,  thus  turning these  Standing  Orders

into  something beneficial for the Government.  On

the  other  hand,  they limit the Opposition  from

effectively  criticising  all  the  measures   and

policies  put  forward  by  the  Government.   The

questions  discussed in this  House  involve  very

grave State matters and other important issues and

therefore  the  Opposition should be  given  ample

opportunity to study and criticise these policies.

The  amendments  to the Standing Orders,  however,

are  contrary to the spirit of democracy. This  is

another sign that the Government arc becoming more

and  more dictatorial. They are motivated by their

own selfishness.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the revised Standing Orders, the time for

giving notice has been reduced, while the time  of

notice  required  from  the  Opposition  has  been

increased.  This  shows that  the  Government  are

making use of these provisions in order to prevent

the Opposition from having ample time to study all

issues. This is a grave blow to the people. It  is

also   an   insult  and  a  smear  to   democratic

principles. The revised Standing Orders are  unreasonable and disadvantageous to the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me deal with these amendments in great

detail,  in Standing Order 13, firstly,  the  time

for  debate  on the policy speech. Previously  the

Government  gave seven days to the  Opposition  to

study  the  policy speech. But now the  number  of

days  has  been reduced to two. The policy  speech

embodies  all  the  important  measures   of   the

Government   and   other   complicated   problems.

Therefore, we should have ample time to study  the

policy  speech. To make matters worse, we are  not

able  to  get all the necessary data to study  it.

The  Government have been unco-operative  in  this

respect.  We are given a very short time  to  make

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 44</b></font><br><br>



necessary preparation for the debate on the policy

speech. We are not able to devote sufficient  time

on  important  questions embodied  in  the  policy

speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on new

Standing Order No. 43, paragraph (8). In  the  old

Standing  Orders, there was no limitation  on  the

time  to  speak to any question. But  in  the  new

Standing  Orders, provision is made to  limit  the

time  of  Opposition  Members  to  speak  to   any

question. A Member is entitled to speak  for  only

one hour. He can have another 15 minutes if the majority  of  Members  give their  assent.  This  is

another  example  of the Government's  dictatorial

practice.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Parliament is bigger than our State

Legislative  Assembly. Yet there is no  limitation

on  the time given to the Members there. To  limit

the  time of the Members will not only mean a loss

to  them,  but also a great loss to the  Assembly.

Because   of  the  limitation  of  time.  Members,

especially  the Opposition Members,  will  not  be

able  to voice the views of the people. They  will

not  be  able to point out the faulty measures  of

the Government. The Opposition Parties cannot play

an   effective  role  as  representatives  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments to the Standing Orders are

disadvantageous to the Opposition Parties in  that

they   will  not  allow  the  Opposition   Parties

sufficient time to criticise the wrong policies or

measures  of  the Government. They  criticise  the

Government  because they want it to adopt  correct

policies  and  to  pursue the  correct  line.  Why

should  the Government curb the Opposition Parties

from exercising their duties? Why should they stop

the  Opposition  Parties from pointing  out  their

faults and shortcomings?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In old Standing Order 63, paragraph (2), any

Member who wishes to introduce a Bill should  give

two  clear  days' notice. But in the new  Standing

Order,  a  private Member should give  four  clear

days'  notice. That means he has to give two  more

clear  days'  notice.  This only  shows  that  the

P.A.P. is trying to lengthen the time of notice of

a  motion.  The  Government want  to  deprive  the

Opposition of the opportunity to raise questions.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 45</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Standing Order No. 83, paragraph (2), the

Minister  will not be bound by Standing Order  No.

43  (8).  The  Standing Orders should  be  applied

equally to the Opposition Parties as well  as  the

Government. There should not be two standards.  In

the  new  Standing Orders, the Minister is enabled

to extend the time of his speech. This dictatorial

practice  and  attitude can only mean  that  there

would not be any democratic spirit.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In old Standing Order 86 (2), 5 days was

allotted for the debate on the Main Estimates. But

now  the number of days has been reduced to three.

The  Main Estimates are very important. They  need

our  careful study. Thus the time provided by  the

new Standing Order is not sufficient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the amended Standing Order 87 (2), there is

only   one  day  for  debate  on  the  Development

Estimates.   Mr  Speaker.  Sir,  the  Development

Estimates involve the economic livelihood  of  the

people   and  all  other  constructive   measures.

Therefore,  one  day allotted to  the  Development

Estimates will not be sufficient. If it is devoted

to  jesting and talking nonsense, of course, it is

sufficient.  But  if we are really  to  study  the

Development  Estimates,  then  one  day   is   not

sufficient.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not intend to talk on the details of the

amendments. But from the amendment of this major

Standing Order, viewed generally, we can only come

to the conclusion that the Government want to

control the Legislature. Freedom of speech has

already been limited. But by this amendment the

Government can have a hand in further curbing

parliamentary democracy and freedom of speech. The

real intention of this amendment is to preserve

the Government's monopolistic rights, to allow

themselves all the conveniences but to deny to

others their rights in this House. This is a great

departure from parliamentary democracy. It is an

insult to the principle of democracy. These

dictatorial and monopolistic tactics and intrigues

of the P.A.P. should be strongly condemned. Any

line taken, any policy and actions of the P.A.P.

which are contrary to the interest and welfare of

the people and which curb



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 46</b></font><br><br>



their  freedom and their democratic rights, should

be strongly condemned by all the people concerned.

They are a detriment to democracy in Singapore.



<br><br>4.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  the speeches of the three  Members

from  the  Opposition side took in  all  about  20

minutes.  This indicates that what the  Government

has  tried  to do, that is, to amend the  Standing

Orders  to give Members one hour to speak is  more

than  ample  and  justified. Of  course,  in  this

Assembly we are all representatives of the people.

We are here to discuss the interests affecting the

State.  But  it is not for them to make  publicity

for their Jakarta Press. I do not see any logic in

their argument. In amending the Standing Order  to

limit the time of speaking to one hour, it affects

both  sides of the House. It does not affect  only

the Opposition Members. How can they say that this

is undemocratic? I think they are very lucky to be

able  to  enjoy  real freedom of  speech  in  this

Assembly.  If one day it should happen  that  this

freedom of speech is lost, I think then they would

not  dare  even  to whisper among themselves,  let

alone debate in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I fully support the amendments.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think this appears a convenient

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, after

listening to the speeches bemoaning the  death  of

democracy  by the Member for Hong Lim, the  Member

for  Bukit Merah and the Member for Paya Lebar,  I

am  just  wondering  whether these  people  really

believe  in  what they say. They  each  spent  ten

minutes  trying to prove to us that unless Members

are allowed to speak for more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 47</b></font><br><br>



than one hour each, there is no democracy. The Member

for Hong Lim pleaded that unless Members are allowed to

speak for more than one hour, there is no democracy,

and yet he was satisfied making his point within the

space of ten minutes. The Member for Bukit Merah spoke

in a similar vein. The exception was the Member for

Paya Lebar. He decided to exercise his democratic

rights by speaking for 15 minutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the gist of their arguments is this. If you

speak for one hour or less, then there is less

democracy. If you speak for two hours, then there is

more democracy. If you can speak for three hours, then

there is still more democracy. That is their measure of

democracy on this earth. The longer you can speak, the

more democracy there is.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to try to convince them that, in fact, by

allowing a Member unlimited time to speak in this

Assembly, they are curtailing the democratic rights of

this Assembly. Their former leader, Dr Lee Siew Choh,

as we all know, was in the habit of making speeches for

seven or eight hours starting in the evening right

through to the small hours of the next day. What

happened was that for the whole day - a day and a night -

only Dr Lee Siew Choh could speak in this Assembly.

The other 50 Members did not have a chance to speak.

And that they say is democracy! I say, Sir, that our

Standing Orders by limiting the length of individual

speeches to one hour or less provide more democracy,

because where previously only one man could speak

throughout the day, under the new Standing Orders,

five, six, seven, eight or more Members in this

Assembly can speak. So I say that there is more freedom

of speech, because you give the right of speech to a

larger number of people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> That is right.



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Sir, I am told that the word

"hypocritical" is out of order. So I say that it is

insincere for people like Members of the Barisan

Sosialis to shed crocodile tears over democracy here.

They do not believe in democracy. There is a man whom

they are supporting -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 48</b></font><br><br>



their supreme leader - and if the Standing Orders

of Indonesia are implemented in this Assembly, there

will be only one supreme speaker!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, in this Assembly, freedom of speech is not

measured by how long you can speak. The three Members

opposite have shown that if you want to make a point

effectively, you can make it within half an hour or

within ten to fifteen minutes. In fact, it is my

contention, Sir, that perhaps by limiting speeches to

tolerable proportions, we are doing the Opposition a

favour, because some of them within the course of 15

minutes speak a lot of rubbish. If they are given three

hours, they will speak more rubbish and to that extent

they will do more damage to their own cause. Dr Lee

Siew Choh, the man who spoke for eight to ten hours, is

now out of this Assembly. The only former Member of the

Barisan who has survived is the man who talks least

- the Member for Jalan Kayu. It proves our point that

it is better to speak sense for 15 minutes or half an

hour than to speak rubbish for eight or nine hours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, none of the speakers in the Opposition have

indicated in what way, apart from cutting down the

length of time, these Standing Orders limit freedom of

speech. Does the fact that you are speaking for only

one hour limit free speech? In what way is this

undemocratic? I think the Member for Hong Lim said,

"Oh, this is the beginning of a one-Party State." This

is odd, coming from a one-man Party. And yet, under

these Standing Orders, if the Member for Hong Lim is

still in this Assembly, he can speak. It does not

constitute a one-Party State. He is allowed to speak

and make his point. He has not indicated in what way

these Standing Orders make for totalitarian rule. Many

of these Standing Orders have precedents in Nigeria and

Australia. Is it suggested that these are undemocratic

States, or is it suggested that the only democratic

State which appeals to the political loyalty of the

gentlemen opposite is a one-Party State like Soviet

Russia or Indonesia? Are those countries their models

of democracy, where you have a one-Party State and only

one man can speak? Or is it in an Assembly like this or

in Australia or in Nigeria or in the Federation of

Malaya, where you are allowed to speak? The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 49</b></font><br><br>



purpose  of these Standing Orders - as the  Deputy

Prime  Minister has pointed out -  is  to  prevent

abuse  of the privileges accorded in this Chamber,

by  Members  using the Assembly to  prevent  other

Members from speaking. That was what happened. The

Barisan  Sosialis Members, though they constituted

a small group, deliberately came into this Chamber

and   made  long  repetitious  speeches.  You  may

remember,  Sir - at least I remember - that  when

Dr Lee Siew Choh and other Members of the Barisan

Sosialis got up to speak, there used to be a relay

of  runners who came into this Chamber with a  wad

of  notes to keep them fed with ideas. So much  so

that  it  became  tedious,  and  Members  in  this

Chamber had to seek refuge in the C.P.A. Room when

Dr  Lee  Siew Choh was speaking. It was the  same

case  when the other Barisan Sosialis Members were

speaking  -  some  Members went to  sleep  in  the

C.P.A. Room. Far from ensuring that there was real

democracy,  what  happened was  that  by  allowing

Members  to make tedious speeches, other  Members,

including  the  Barisan Sosialis supporters,  were

forced to leave the Chamber in order to escape the

verbal  diarrhoea of Dr Lee Siew Choh who  is  no

longer the Chairman of the Gentlemen opposite.  So

it  is  to  prevent  this kind  of  abuse  of  the

privileges  of  this Chamber that  these  Standing

Orders are being introduced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the intention to prevent the Opposition

from  speaking.  These  Standing  Orders  do   not

prevent the Opposition Members from speaking. They

only    preventthe    Opposition    from    making

unnecessarily lengthy speeches.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in conclusion, may I just illustrate that

the  best  way to make effective criticism  -  the

Opposition   we   know  want  to  make   effective

criticism - is by saying what you have to  say  in

as  few words as possible? This reminds me of  the

fishmonger  who  put up a sign  outside  his  shop

saying,  "Fresh Fish Sold Here". A gentleman  came

along and asked him, "Why do you say that? You are

obviously selling fresh fish; so why not  cut  out

the  word `fresh'?" So the sign became "Fish  Sold

Here". On the second day, another chap came  along

and  told the fishmonger, "Obviously you  are  not

giving your fish away. You know, you



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 50</b></font><br><br>



are selling your fish. Cut out the `Sold' and just

put  `Fish Here'." On the third day, another  chap

came  along  and asked, "Why do you put  the  word

`here'?  Obviously you can see that  the  fish  is

here.  So cut out the word `here'." On the  fourth

day,  another chap came along and said, "You know,

your  fish smells so much after the fifth day that

I  can  smell it down the street. So cut  out  the

word `Fish'."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is my humble suggestion to the Members of

the Barisan Sosialis opposite that there are times

when it is not necessary for them to say anything.



<br><br>5.43 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, we all know that making speeches is a very important aspect in the

life  of  an Assemblyman who is the representative

of  the people. If we do not speak a word in  this

Chamber,   then,  of  course,  we   will   receive

criticism  from the people. But one must  consider

what  kind  of speeches one is going to  make.  We

must  have certain principles to govern the making

of  speeches in this Chamber. We cannot just  come

here and talk nonsense and waste time. There is  a

Chinese  proverb which says, "To govern  does  not

mean  to  speak a lot." In other words,  statesmen

and  politicians  should  not  resort  to  flowery

language  and  lengthy  speeches  to  deceive  the

people.  They must resort to action. They must  be

judged by their deeds and not by their words.  But

the Members of the Opposition are complaining that

they  are not being given sufficient time to speak

their  minds and express their views as adequately

as  possible.  I  think they are  not  correct  in

making  such  a complaint because one  cannot  say

that  the  longer he speaks the better he  is.  It

does not mean that Members of this House must come

here  to  compete with one another to see who  can

speak  longer or better. My opinion  is  that  the

best policy i to speak concisely. In other words,

if  you can speak in fewer words and express  your

ideas   that  are  constructive,  then  you  speak

correctly and well. A speech is not judged by  the

number of words therein but by its content. If you

want to defend the democratic system, then, in  my

opinion, you must not resort to speaking



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 51</b></font><br><br>



for one, two, three or more hours. That is not the

way  to defend democratic rights. It does not mean

that  when  you speak for one hour less  you  will

have  less democratic rights. As a matter of fact,

there is nothing in this world, especially in such

a  small  island  as  Singapore,  that  cannot  be

expressed concisely and precisely and finished off

in  one  hour.  You can, in fact,  deal  with  any

matter  within  the  limit of  one  hour  in  this

Chamber.  No one can claim that they have  a  very

comprehensive  knowledge of every matter  relating

to  every Ministry. It is impossible for one to be

a  know-all. So the Opposition should resort to  a

division  of  labour. This means that they  should

allocate topics to be dealt with in their speeches

among  themselves,  so that one  speaker  will  be

allocated  a certain section and a certain  topic.

So what matters is not whether you speak longer or

shorter. The crux of the matter is whether you can

go  straight  to  the  point of  the  topic  under

discussion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must not resort to the endless gossiping of

an  old  lady. If you do so, then you will be  the

most unwelcomed Member in this House, and you will

be  considered a long-winded gossip. One must  not

abuse   democratic  privileges.   By   trying   to

safeguard  these  privileges and  preventing  them

from  being  abused, we are actually  helping  the

democratic system run smoothly. If you say that to

cut  down  the  time  of speeches  is  to  curtail

democratic rights, then it is not correct.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture has said just now that the former Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis took about seven and a half hours to make his speech in

this House. But I want to ask, "Was he airing  the

views  of the people in those days?" We know  that

the people elected him on a P.A.P. ticket. We also

know  that  he  went  against the  P.A.P. without

consulting  the  voters  in  his  electorate.  The

people  elected  him because he was  in  agreement

with the principles of the P.A.P. That was why  he

was  elected on a P.A.P. ticket. But when he  went

against  the  P.A.P., he did not go  back  to  his

electorate.  Could  he  claim  to  represent   his

electorate? He spoke in this House for eight hours

or more, but we cannot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 52</b></font><br><br>



say  that he was really representing them. He  was

actually representing himself. We can even  go  to

the extent of saying that he was not even speaking

on  behalf of his own Party, because he  has  been

thrown out by his own Party. So we can say that to

speak  at  length will bring you to the  brink  of

disaster.  Of  course, we know that Dr  Lee  Siew

Choh  was  discarded by the people  in  the  first

instance,  and he has now been thrown out  by  his

own Party in the second instance. This perhaps was

because  of his unnecessary and lengthy  speeches.

We  want to urge the Members opposite to take note

of  the fate of Dr Lee and to learn a lesson from

that.  You must not try to get the words of others

and  nuix them together with those of your own and

claim  that  you  are speaking on  behalf  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, there is one other point. The

Member   for   Paya  Lebar  has  said   that   the

restriction on the time of speeches would  mean  a

loss  to the Assembly. I do not agree with him  on

this  point.  In  my view, if the  Opposition  can

offer constructive criticisms, of course, we  will

welcome  them. The more they can offer  them,  the

better  it  will be for us. But if  they  want  to

resort  to  ill-founded rumours in this  House  in

order to defame the Party in power, then the  less

they  talk the better. In fact, if we can restrict

them  from going along those lines, it will ensure

the maintenance of parliamentary democracy in this

country. We must not allow the Members opposite to

waste  the time of this House which also  means  a

waste of public funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one saying, "Your own essay is better

than  that of others." If you write a long  essay,

you  expect others to read it with care, otherwise

there  is no point in writing it at all. Similarly

if  you  want  to speak, you must have  listeners,

otherwise   you  might  as  well  remain   silent.

Democracy  means that the minority must  go  along

with  the majority. It is not the other way round.

If a Member wants to show off his talent in making

speeches  at the expense of the time of other  Members,  then  it  is  not  correct  and  democratic

behaviour.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the establishment of Malaysia, the

political  centre  of our nation  has  shifted  to

Kuala Lumpur, namely the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 53</b></font><br><br>



Central Parliament, so that the major problems now

are  dealt  with and debated upon in  the  Federal

House  of Representatives in Kuala Lumpur. In  the

State  Legislative Assembly, we are given autonomy

in labour and education. We have been able to make

spectacular  progress  in housing.  But  the  main

concern of the Barisan Sosialis appears to be  the

question  of internal security. This question  has

been  shifted  to  the  Central  Parliament.  This

Assembly  is  no longer the forum for the  Barisan

Sosialis  to  deal with the question  of  internal

security.  In  view  of the  shifting  of  certain

matters  to  the Central Parliament, our  Standing

Orders  must be amended according to the  existing

circumstances.  To  restrict the  time  of  making

speeches   is   not  to  unduly   give   ourselves

facilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report has mentioned that in Nigeria a

Member  is only allowed to speak for a maximum  of

30   minutes  on  any  subject.  Nigeria   is   an

independent country, and this is what  happens  in

its Parliament. In Australia, where the population

is   greater  and  the  Legislature  has  a   long

historical  experience and standing,  there  is  a

similar  limitation on the debate  on  the  policy

statement made by the Governor-General.  A  Member

is  only  allowed to speak for 25 minutes  on  the

Address  of  Thanks for the policy  statement.  On

other matters such as the Second Reading of Bills,

even  the  mover  himself and the  Leader  of  the

Opposition  are  restricted to a limit  of  45  minutes, and any other Member is allowed 30 minutes

to  speak. As regards the debate on other  matters

in  the  Australian Parliament, a mover is allowed

30  minutes  and  any  other  Member  20  minutes.

Australia  is  a democratic country  with  a  long

history,  and  yet  nobody  has  ever  said  that,

because  of the limitation on the time  of  making

speeches,  Australia  is no  longer  a  democratic

country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Paya Lebar has said a few moments

ago  that  our  amendments are  moulded  with  the

intention   of   paving   the   way   towards    a

dictatorship.  But we know that in his  own  Party

there  is even greater dictatorship. Their  former

Chairman made a complaint that he presented a long

statement  but  this  was  suppressed   by   other

Committee  members  and  not  published  in  their

organ. We must thank



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 54</b></font><br><br>



our  lucky stars that they have not been  able  to

come  to  power, otherwise the same thing or  even

worse might happen in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their arguments further point out that in the

Central Government there is no limitation on time.

Theoretically, of course, Members of Parliament in

Kuala  Lumpur are allowed to speak throughout  the

whole  year  for  365  days, if  they  so  choose,

because  there  is no provision  in  the  Standing

Orders to curb the hours of speech-making. But  in

practice, I believe the Member for Jurong and  the

Member  fo,r  Bukit Merah understand that  on  the

question  of debating the Yang di-Pertuan  Agong's

speech only last month, two days were allotted for

the   debate,  but  there  are  200   Members   of

Parliament  and  so many of them did  not  have  a

chance  to speak even for one minute. So one  must

not  make  a sweeping statement in any event.  Our

proposed  amendment ensures, at  least,  that  any

Member  will  be given one hour to  speak  on  any

topic.  Singapore  is  a place  where  freedom  of

speech  is allowed. There is no topic in Singapore

that  cannot  be dealt with adequately  within  an

hour. But if you want to repeat yourself over  and

over again - you may be given one hour one day or

even  ten  days - you will still not finish  your

speech.  From our past experience, we  found  that

whatever the Opposition Members said was  more  or

less  stereotyped. Members repeated themselves  or

repeated words that had been spoken by others. But

they  all boiled down to the same thing. They were

just  like  official stereotyped documents.  There

were no differences between them. You listened  to

their first sentence and you knew what was to come

next.  Now,  are we to be entertained or  burdened

with  such  speeches?  In fact,  if  you  want  to

express  views  as they have done, a  few  minutes

will  be  enough. They do not require one hour  to

repeat   themselves.   We   welcome   constructive

criticism - that goes without saying but  if  they

want  to speak on behalf of the Indonesians  about

their innocence, then restriction of time will  be

good  for the democratic system. In fact, it  will

be  a  great help to the maintenance of democracy.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 55</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, in the

debate  on the amendments to the Standing  Orders,

the Government Members have given many reasons  to

defend  their proposed amendments to the  Standing

Orders,  especially  on the curbing  of  the  time

allotted  to  Members. We know that  the  Assembly

sits   very  rarely.  The  last  sitting  was   in

December.  There are many Government policies  and

measures   which  merit  the  criticism   of   the

Opposition  Parties,  but we  are  not  given  the

opportunity to do so. If the Standing Orders limit

the speaking time of Opposition Members, then they

will  find  difficulty in having ample opportunity

and  time to deal with all the various aspects  of

Government's policies and measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour and the Minister for Culture have said just now that the speeches of the Opposition Members last only ten to fifteen

minutes; therefore, one bout- is enough. But  they

must  not make such a comparison. It does not mean

that in future Members will speak for only ten  to

fifteen  minutes on any topic. In  future  Members

will  be restricted and limited by Standing Orders

in their speeches. For example, on the question of

the  policy speech, it is impossible for us to air

our   views  within  one  hour.  Therefore,   such

limitation is harmful. The fact that Members  have

spoken  for ten to fifteen minutes does show  that

Opposition  Members have not abused their  freedom

of   speech.  We  do  not  speak  longer  than  is

necessary. We are not, as they describe, trying to

make  long-winded  speeches.  Can  the  Government

Ministers and Members prove with facts that in the

past  the Opposition Members spoke for many  hours

in  order to delay and protract matters? Sometimes

we  spoke  at  great  length,  but  sometimes  our

speeches lasted for only ten to fifteen minutes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government Ministers have been looking down

on  us.  They  have been saying that our  speeches

have  been written by others. They say that it  is

in  insult to the spirit of democracy. But is that

the  actual fact? Let us look at the report of the

debate which took place in December. It shows that

the Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 56</b></font><br><br>



Members' speeches were written by some

others or by the boss of the C.I.D. Their speeches

merely praised the P.A.P.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blame for insulting parliamentary democracy

should not lie with the Opposition but with

Government Meat-hers. For example, last year there

was a time when there was no sitting at all

because the Government was afraid that the

Opposition Parties might attack them or criticise

their wrong policies. This is a real insult to

parliamentary democracy. When one of their Ministers died they dared not hold a by-election

in Sembawang. That was a real irony of democracy.

When the Government arrested Opposition Members

without giving reasons, that was a real affront to

the democratic principle and spirit. What we want

is to have an open debate. But past experience has

shown that there has been no opportunity for an

open debate in Singapore. Whenever we applied for

a permit to hold a mass rally or any other

meeting, our application was invariably turned

down. The Government controls the radio. We were

deprived of the opportunity to speak over it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom of speech outside this House has become a

relic in the museum, and they want to turn freedom

of speech in this Assembly into another relic in

the museum. That is why they are introducing these

amendments to the Standing Orders. In spite of the

fact that we, Opposition Members, look very young,

the Government want to limit the opportunity for

debate. That shows that the Government are afraid

of us. They say we speak at great length. If

Opposition Parties have been speaking longer than

is necessary hut their speeches really expose the

faults and, shortcomings of the Government, then

their speeches should be welcomed. Now, if the

contents of the speeches are good, of course, they

are willing to listen to what we speak, and the

people on our side are willing to listen to what

they speak. If Dr Lee's ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I am sorry to interrupt the

Member, hut the translation of his speech is not

coming through. Please proceed now.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 57</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, just now I was saying that long

speeches need not be a waste of time and need not

be old grandmother's tales. Whether or not the

speeches are long depend on the judgment of the

people outside this House. If the speeches are

good, they welcome them. Of course, the Party in

power would like us to talk in such a way that

they themselves would be glad. They want us to

shut up. As observers of the Government, we, of

course, want to criticise them for any wrong deeds

or mistakes, and if there is anything good done by

them, we would express our thanks. So that is why

we make speeches in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now I was saying that we have been given very

little opportunity for open argument and open debate.

But the P.A.P., on the other hand, for instance, the

Prime Minister, could go to Radio Singapore and have

12 talks over the air, thus wasting public funds. The

Press was full of it. The funny talks of the P.A.P.

have been broadcast over Radio Singapore almost all

the time in four languages, resulting in Radio Singa

pore becoming the P.A.P.'s possession. People like the

Minister for Culture have been wont to talk about

things such as Radio Jakarta, Communist, pro-Communist.

Such speeches need not last one hour. They

could be condensed into a few minutes. Still we

welcome an open argument and we would like the Party

in power to afford us, the Opposition Members, also

the same facilities as they are enjoying themselves

now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On debating the amendments to the Standing Orders,

they have nothing to talk about, no good things to

mention, so they mention Dr Lee Siew Choh and other

irrelevant matters in the course of the debate. This

to us appears to be unnecessary and is a waste of time - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): On one thing I

could give a reply. Just now the Minister for

Labour has said that we do not have democracy in

our Party and that we suppressed Dr Lee Siew

Choh's statement. But it is his ignorance



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 58</b></font><br><br>



of facts which makes him utter such things. I would

advise him to have a look at our Party organ so

that he could be clear about the facts - [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Please allow the Member to

proceed. He did not interrupt when the Government side

was speaking, so I suggest they let him speak without

further interruption. Please proceed, Mr Koo Young.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): They have even quoted

certain reasons for making these amendments, quoting

Nigeria and Australia, and saying that there are

limitations also in their Parliament on the time of

making speeches. Of course, it is very easy for the

Party in power to advance reasons whether rightly or

wrongly. They could even cite South Vietnam as a good

example where there is no freedom of speech and there

is no democracy. They can even advance South Vietnam

as a good example to show that since there is no

parliamentary democracy, we here also should follow

suit. I would like to ask the P.A.P. Government

whether it has made a careful study of other examples ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajaratnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajaratnam:</b> Such as?



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): They should compare how

the Government in power and how the Opposition Parties

are like in those examples quoted by them. If without

comparison they merely advance these examples as their

reasons, then these reasons are not sound because they

do not hold water.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in these amendments, the Party in power, on the

one hand, try to curb the time of the Opposition

Members in making speeches. Just now my colleagues

have also mentioned this. Even outside this House we

have been limited in our opportunity to criticise

certain measures of the Government. They try to reduce

the number of days of notice to be given so as to cut

down our time to study important documents issued by

the Government. We have to study the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara's Speech within two days instead of seven days;

and this is difficult because the Speech is an

important and comprehensive document



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 59</b></font><br><br>



of  the State. But, on the other hand, they try to

lengthen the notice required of the Opposition  to

ask  any  questions. So we can see that  they  are

resorting  to  unfair play. I hope,  Mr  Speaker,

that  the  Ministers and the Backbenches in  power

will  actually  allow  an  open  debate  and  open

argument  in  this country. But  by  moving  these

amendments  they prove themselves to be  deceiving

the youth of the country.



<br><br>6.28 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

We have been entertained  by  the speeches  made

by  the  Members  of  the  Barisan Sosialis  and

the one-man Party Chairman  of  the

United  People's Party, the Member for  Hong  Lim.

Their  common point boils down to this. Time limit

means  no  democracy. The Minister for Labour  and

the  Minister  for  Culture  have  given  adequate

explanations to deal with their point.  I  do  not

desire to repeat their arguments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one point which I wish to bring up

in rebuttal of the speeches made by the Opposition

Members. That is with regard to the by-election in

Sembawang.  In  the  speech of the  last  speaker,

there  was a reference to it. He said this was  an

example  of an undemocratic act of the P.A.P.  The

by-election  in  Sembawang was a victory  for  the

democratic  camp.  It was not a  victory  for  the

Barisan  and their friends. In the last  elections

they   were  unable  to  retrieve  the   seat   in

Sembawang.  I  support  the  amendments   to   the

Standing  Orders because, insofar as the interests

of  the people and the Assembly are concerned, the

amendments are good.



<br><br>6.29 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, in the debate on the motion to

amend  the Standing Orders, I was paying attention

to  the time that Opposition Members took to  make

their  points.  I found that the Member  for  Hong

Lirn  took eight minutes, to be exact, the  Member

for  Bukit Merah 10 minutes,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 60</b></font><br><br>



the Member  for  Paya Lebar  15 minutes, and the

long-winded speech  was that  of the Member for

Thomson who took about  20 minutes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should think that if the principle of

democracy were on the brink of collapse  when  the

Opposition would lose their democratic rights, the

Opposition  Members  would utilise  more  time  in

attacking  the  Government. But  much  beyond  our

expectations,  while the old Standing  orders  are

still in force without any new amendments being in

force,  the  Opposition took a shorter  time  than

expected  in this debate. If they had  wanted  to,

they  could  have  taken up  more  time  and  even

prolonged the debate to tomorrow morning, but  the

longest  speech of the Opposition today took  only

20  minutes. I was very surprised and, in fact, it

is  regrettable that the Barisan Sosialis have  so

little  to say on this grave matter as they  claim

it to be.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Member for Thomson has said that

there  is no freedom of speech. I do not  want  to

refer  to the pioneer of long-windedness,  namely,

the  former Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis,  who

took  about 7� hours to make a speech  here  to

break the record. Talking about freedom of speech,

Dr Lee Siew Choh said that whenever he wanted  to

speak  in  his own Party he was restricted.  If  a

socialist  is courageous enough to face realities,

why  should  the  Barisan  Sosialis  restrict  the

freedom  of speech of its own Chairman?  They  say

that  we do not give them enough freedom of speech

when  they  themselves did  not  give  freedom  of

speech   to  their  own  Chairman.  Whatever   the

Chairman   had  to  say,  there  was  a   lot   of

curtailment to his speech. How can they claim that

they  are  champions  of  freedom  of  speech  and

champions of democracy when they themselves do not

allow democratic rights to exist? The people could

see   for   themselves  that   in   the   National

Referendum, both inside and outside this House, we

were  confronted by the Barisan Sosialis. To  what

ever   queries  they  raised,  there  were  always

adequate  replies and suitable answers given,  and

that  was  why we were able to win in the National

Referendum.   We   are   not   as   arrogant    as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 61</b></font><br><br>



they  claim  us to be. In fact, it was because  we

were  humble enough to expect criticism  from  the

Barisan Sosialis that we went back to the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already indicated that every time a

Member opposite speaks, I have noted the time, and

the  total time they have taken to speak does  not

amount  to  one hour. This is precisely  the  time

when  they have all the time in the world to speak

their  minds  freely. They say this is  a  country

without  freedom of speech. We say that it  is  in

Indonesia  that freedom of speech does not  exist,

and Indonesia is the country that they look up to.

If  they  think that by resorting to anti-national

activities  they can have more freedom of  speech,

then let me tell them that this is but a fantasy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Labour has likened the speeches of the Opposition Members to old grandmother's tales which are long-winded and unnecessary. Of

course,  he  has  good reasons  for  drawing  this

analogy.  In fact, whatever they have  said  could

have been said in less words than necessary. I can

well  take  a  whole day to express the  points  I

have.  I  can talk about my morning ablutions,  my

business that I have to do every day, and go on to

other  trivial matters, thus wasting a lot of  the

time  of  this House. The champion who  broke  the

record took 7� hours in this House. They  could

see for themselves that whatever they have said at

length  were actually speeches written  by  people

outside  this  House. In fact, one could  see  for

oneself that speeches were handed to Dr Lee  from

time to time by other members of his Party. He had

nothing better to talk than to go back to what had

been  said. He resorted to the tactic of "fatigue"

in  order  to deceive the people to give them  the

impression that he was speaking on their behalf.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I do not wish to take up too much

time.  The point really is that Singapore  is  now

faced   with   a  grave  problem.  The   Singapore

Government has to reconstruct Singapore.  We  want

to  turn  Singapore into a prosperous  and  strong

country.  If  we  can  do well  in  Singapore,  of

course,  the  same prosperity will be extended  to

Malaya.  We  want more people to be in employment.

We



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 62</b></font><br><br>



want  the people to judge the Government by  deeds

and not by words.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Parliamentary Secretary is

straying  away  from  the  motion.  We   are   not

concerned  with what the Singapore  Government  is

doing  outside. We are concerned with the Standing

Orders.   Has  the  Parliamentary  Secretary   got

anything new to say? If so, please go on.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I am pointing out that time is

precious   in   this  House.  If  we   allow   the

reactionary group in the Opposition a lot of  time

to  waste and drag on the proceedings in  this Flouse,

we can do the same if we want to, it  does

not  mean that we are all dumb. We are capable  of

making long speeches. But the point is that  since

time  is  precious, we must make use of it  to  do

more  work for the people. If we do not  work  for

the people and serve them well, then not only will

we suffer but they will also suffer, and everybody

in this House will suffer. So time being precious.

we  must  make good use of it and must  not  allow

anybody to bring trivial matters into this House.



<br><br>6.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, the point is not whether we allow longer

time  to make speeches hut rather whether  we  can

make  full use of the time given. When Members  of

the  Opposition  ask  the Ministers  supplementary

questions, they try to drag in extraneous  matters

in  order  to  waste the time of  this  House.  So

basically  they do not even know the procedure  of

this  House. When Question Time comes along,  they

talk   rubbish.  At  the  last  sitting  of   this

Assembly,  I think the Member for Jalan  Kayu  was

getting impatient when his Party Chairman  took  7�  hours  of this House. As a result, they  lost

the  general  elections in spite  of  the  lengthy

speeches  they made here. The idea is not  in  the

quantity hut the quality of the speeches.  Quality

is  more  important than quantity.  Lenin  himself

said  that  it  is the quality of the  Party  that

matters and not the quantity. As the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 63</b></font><br><br>



Member  for Jalan Besar has said, Members opposite

usually  resort  to  repeating  points  that   are

irrelevant.  So  one must make good  use  of  time

instead of wasting it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Barisan Sosialis opposite talk so

much  about the absence of democracy in Singapore,

the absence of freedom of speech. Mr Speaker,  do

you  believe what they say? In fact, I  can  claim

that  in  the whole of South East Asia  there  are

only   two   countries  practising   parliamentary

democracy,  and  they  are  the  Philippines   and

Malaysia. Whether the system is to succeed or fail

depends  on how you take it. The type of democracy

that   the  Barisan  Sosialis  advocate   can   be

understood  in  this example. When  one  considers

that the former member of the Central Committee of

the  Barisan Sosialis, namely, Mr Chok Koh  Tong,

asked  to  be repatriated to Communist  China,  he

said ---



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think the Parliamentary Secretary

is   straying  away  from  the  motion.   We   are

discussing the Standing Orders and not some person

who went away to China or asked to go to China. We

are   not   concerned  with  him.  Please  confine

yourself to the debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I was just giving you an example

of the type of democracy they are advocating.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the Opposition Parties insist on having

more  time,  firstly,  in order  to  seek  further

inspiration  and, secondly, the  Member  for  Paya

Lebar  in his speech sought to extend his time  to

enable  the other Members to draft their speeches.

It   is  well  and  good  if  Members  could  make

constructive  criticisms  of  the  Government.  We

welcome  the Member for Thomson who said that  any

good  thing  done  by  the  Government  should  be

supported  by the people. If they are to  look  at

our  results  with an objective mind,  of  course,

they  will see that whatever we do is right.  They

do  not  make use of the time allotted to them  to

make good and constructive criticisms. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 64</b></font><br><br>



Members  of  the Barisan Sosialis talk  about  the

lack  of democracy in Singapore. I want to make  a

brief  reply to them. Ever since 1961, the Barisan

Sosialis  have been holding many mass rallies  and

they have given out statements. We have given them

all  the  facilities to do so, apart  from  making

long  speeches in this House. Yet they say success

or  failure does not depend on whether  they  make

long  speeches in the House, but on  whether  they

make   well-intentioned  criticism  or  evil   and

destructive criticism.



<br><br>6.48 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  been  listening  to  the

speeches of the Members opposite touching  on  the

amendments to the Standing Orders. They have  been

saying  that  the  amendments are dictatorial  and

undemocratic. We have been listening to  the  same

speeches ever since 1961. All this belongs to  the

same  trite speeches. Yet they have been repeating

them. It is a waste of the time of this House.  In

my view, the amendments to the Standing Orders are

made  in  order  to  guide the Opposition  Parties

along a better road so as to enable them to make a

better   contribution  to   the   maintenance   of

parliamentary  democracy, and  not  to  abuse  the

democratic  rights and freedom of speech  in  this

House. They should make good use of their time  by

studying  the various subjects and topics  and  to

offer constructive views and suggestions, and  not

to copy speeches written by others and recite them

in   this  House.  Another  spirit  of  these  new

Standing Orders is to allow every Member  of  this

House time to speak here and not to allow only one

Member  to speak, thus depriving other Members  of

the opportunity to speak.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the new Standing Orders.

<br><br>6.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong (Jalan Kayu)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I did not originally intend to speak on these amendments to the

Standing  Orders because several of my  colleagues

have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 65</b></font><br><br>



given  their  views  on  this  matter.  But  since

Members  on  the  Government Benches  have  talked

about me - they  have said that I was getting impatient  when

my  former Party Chairman was speaking - what I want

to  stress is that what my Party Chairman spoke --- [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Will Members allow the Member for

Jalan  Kayu the privilege of speaking undisturbed?

Mr Tan Cheng Tong, please proceed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

I remember when debating the question of Malaysia,

the  P.A.P. then said that if the  Federation  of

Malaya  was Malaysia, then Singapore would  become

the New York of Malaysia. But has Singapore become

the New York of Malaysia? One of the functions  of

the  Legislature,  especially under  a  democratic

system  of government, is to enable the Opposition

Parties to criticise and to supervise the work  of

the  Government.  If  you deprive  the  Opposition

Parties  of  the  time to speak in  the  House  by

limiting it to one hour, it is impossible for them

to  express all their views. This is especially so

if  the issue discussed in this House involves the

problems  and livelihood of the people. We  should

be  given all the facilities and time to supervise

the  work  of  the Government. They  should  adopt

certain  of  our suggestions and criticisms  which

are  conducive to the welfare of the people.  This

would   provide  them  with  the  opportunity   to

consider  our  views  on certain  issues.  In  the

debate on the policy speech, there was no limit on

the  time. But now they want to limit our time  in

debating  the  policy speech  because  the  policy

speech  embodies  all  the  Government  plans  and

policies in the coming year and all the things the

Government  want to do. They concern the  problems

of  the people. If the Opposition Parties are  not

given  ample time to study and discuss the  policy

speech,  this will mean that the people will  have

very  few  chances  to  air their  views  on  such

important  matters.  For  example,  from  my   own

experience,  whatever the Government want  to  do,

they  consult  among  themselves.  The  Opposition

Parties, on the other hand,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 66</b></font><br><br>



are not given such an opportunity to consult among

themselves. We are not in a position to know  many

of  the things which the Government intend to  do.

It  is  only  when we are given all the facilities

and  the time to speak that we can fulfil our role

as  Opposition  Members. You cannot  allocate  the

time  in  proportion to the number of  Members  on

each  side.  If  that is done, we,  being  in  the

minority Party, will be deprived of our time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to notices, whenever we want to ask

questions we must give longer notice. On the other

hand, whatever the Government want to do, they can

do  so by giving shorter notice, because all these

are provided for in the amended Standing Orders. I

have  forgotten  which particular  Standing  Order

provides for that. Previously we were given  ample

tinie  to  study all the documents and Bills.  But

now  that is not the case. Whenever we want to ask

questions, we have to give four days' notice. But,

on  the  other hand, when the Government  want  to

raise  any important measures in this House,  they

need  give  only short notice. They thus  give  us

very  little time to study the issue. We  are  not

given  the facilities and the time to look up  the

necessary material and data. Whatever we speak  in

this House is not meant for you but for the people

outside  this  House. Our duty is to  the  people.

This  is  also the duty of this House. I hope  the

Party in power will not criticise the fact that we

have been too lengthy in our speeches. They should

not  themselves drag irrelevant matters into  this

House. The Party in power can consult our Party on

any  matters to be discussed in this House. We can

have  certain  arrangements  before  matters   are

brought  into  this House. If they can  have  this

mutual  consultation in a parliamentary democracy,

then  there would not be any waste of time of this

House.  Speaking  generally, I  would  advise  the

Party in power not to use dictatorial measures  in

this  House. This House should be responsible  for

all the issues affecting the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now a Government Member has said that his

Party  was  victorious in Sembawang. I  would  say

that the victory



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 67</b></font><br><br>



then was quite different. Do not think that

nowadays you are welcomed by the people because

you were elected by them. It is not so, because

the type of election conducted by you actually

could not be disclosed. Under such circumstances,

the people, even though they were dissatisfied,

could only vote according to what the P.A.P. had

devised. Now that you have come to power, the

whole government machinery is in your hands. Of

course, you have access to various facilities and

machinery, especially in making use of them to

create rumours and ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Fong Sip Chee:</b> I think what the Member for

Jalan Kayu has spoken just now has nothing to do

with the subject in hand. He was relating the

election results in detail.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member is straying away from

the debate before the House. Will the Member

please come back to the subject?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

was just giving my reply to the Member for Jalan

Besar who had said that whatever our representa

tives had said in this House had been lacking in

content anti was useless, with the result that in

the end our Party was defeated. I was only making

the point that the success of the election as con

ducted in the past did not necessarily reflect the

wishes of the people because there had been

certain hidden things behind them.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Member has made his point in

reply to the Parliamentary Secretary to the

Minister for Social Affairs. Can he get on with

the debate?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng:</b> I have never I mentioned

the quality or quantity of

the Barisan Sosialis. I think he was all the time

sleeping. I have never made such points in my

speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> From the time we started this

Assembly, I have asked Members not to make

personal attacks. There have been none this

afternoon until just now. If the Member for Jalan

Kayu has made a mistake, it is not due to any

personal attack on the Parliamentary Secretary. I

do not want any



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 68</b></font><br><br>



personal attacks in this Assembly, and I am not

allowing them. If the hon. Member has a point of

order, he can make it, but I do not want him to

make a speech on it, especially a personal attack

on another Member. Please proceed, Mr Tan.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Cheng Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tan Cheng Tong</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, Sir, I think it is not necessary for

me to talk about the lot of irrelevancies that

have been uttered in this House. Just now I

touched on the fact that there has been no parlia

mentary democracy in this House, and that the

Government have neglected to give good answers to

this criticism. Instead they bring in irrelevant

things. But I would say that there has been a

certain amount of democracy in this House, because

there is a Speaker who supervises the proceedings

in this House, and any breach of the privileges of

this House or of the Standing Orders will not pass

by the Speaker.



<br><br>7.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I will be brief in my summing

up. I do not think I should allow Members of the

Opposition to get away with any allegation that we

are stopping them from speaking in this House. On

the contrary, this afternoon, we had three Bills

put up for debate in this Chamber but none of the

Members of the Opposition spoke a word about them -

and they were very important enactments

indeed. Furthermore, none of the Opposition

Members can complain that they had no time to

scrutinise them. Copies of the Bills had been

circulated to them for some time now in order to

enable them to study them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if it is any consolation to the Barisan

Sosialis, or, for that matter, any Member of the

Opposition, may I remind them that Abraham

Lincoln's Gettysburg Address covered less than 500

words, and it took less than ten minutes to

deliver? Today it has become an immortal speech

which has been cited again and again, simply be

cause of the simplicity and the message contained

in those 500 words.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ex-Chairman of the Barisan Sosialis made two

seven-hour speeches in this Assembly, and although

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>



newspapers may very well have carried what he had

said  in  this Assembly, his speeches  have  gone

into  oblivion. Nobody remembers the  message  he

was trying to drive home. Let that be a moral  to

the  Members  of the Opposition,  that  the  main

purpose  of  a  speech is to drive home  a  point

which  can very well be done within the space  of

one  hour  - that is, if there is any content  at

all in the speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me deal a little with the charges made

by  the  Members for Bukit Merah, Paya Lebar  and

Jalan  Kayu  on the procedure for debate  on  the

Negara's Speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that previously seven days' notice

was  required, after the Negara had delivered the

Government's  policy speech,  to  hold  the  next

sitting of the Assembly so that a debate  can  be

held  in  this  Chamber.  The  revision  in   the

Standing  Orders  provides for  two  clear  days'

notice.  May I ask the Opposition does it  really

take  them  seven days to study  a  speech  which

takes  only  one hour or less to deliver?  A  man

must  be very dull indeed if he requires as  many

as  seven  days to study a one-hour  speech.  For

that  matter,  in  the  Dewan  Ra'ayat  in  Kuala

Lumpur,   the  King  delivered  the  Government's

policy speech and on the very next day Parliament

sat to debate it. The Member for Bukit Merah, the

Member  for Jurong and the Member for Paya  Lebar

were  there.  They understood what the  procedure

was  and  they  did  not  have  the  audacity  to

challenge  the ruling which they had to  observe.

Down here, they say that we are undemocratic  and

dictatorial.  Yet we gave them every  opportunity

to  raise  this point this afternoon. Can  we  be

really  dictatorial and undemocratic if we  allow

them  to  accuse us of being dictatorial  and  un

democratic?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that matter, may I also remind the House

that  the arrangements for the debate on the Main

Estimates were arrived at last December.  It  was

agreed  after  a  resolution  was  moved  by  the

Minister for Finance that the debate on the  Main

Estimates  be limited to three days.  The  reason

given was that a large part of the Estimates  had

been moved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>



over  to  the  control of the Central Government.

There   were   many  departments  whose   budgets

previously   were  the  responsibility   of   the

Singapore  Government, but  since  Malaysia  Day,

many  of  these departments, like Civil Aviation,

Post  Office, Police and so on have  become Pan-Malaysian

departments; because they are no longer our  responsibility,

the budgets  for  these  departments   are   no  longer

included in the Estimates. Therefore, whereas previously

it  was necessary  to have five days to debate  the  Main

Estimates,  it  is  now no  longer  necessary  to

require that same length of time for a very  much

reduced   Budget.   We  have  found   from   past

experience - as was the case last December -

that   three  days  was  quite  adequate.  Nobody

grumbled  about  it. None of the Barisan  Members

complained.  But today they made a lot  of  noise

simply  because they had to make  some  noise.  I

have totted up for their benefit that all in  all

there will be five days to discuss the Budget

-   one  day's  debate  devoted  to  the  Finance

Minister's  Budget Statement, three days  on  the

Main  Estimates  and one day on  the  Development

Estimates.  And  for  the  benefit  of  the   new

Assembly Members of the Barisan Sosialis, let  me

inform  them that in the past five years  it  has

always  been  the  practice  of  the  Speaker  to

allocate   only  one  day  for  debate   on   the

Development  Estimates. Therefore, it  is  absurd

indeed  for anyone of them to complain  that  one

day is inadequate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me end with this note. It is true that

there has been no sitting of the Assembly for the

last  six months, hut may I remind the House that

the  last sittings we had in December lasted  one

month?  It  took us one month to get through  the

debate on the Negara's Speech and the Budget.  We

completed all Government business; no Bills  were

left  in abeyance. We shall call sittings of  the

Assembly  from  time to time when the  Government

has  business to transact or when it  is  in  the

interest of the State that the Government  should

deliver  a  policy  statement  for  debate.   But

believe me, we are not going to call a sitting of

the  Assembly  at  the pleasure  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis just to hear the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>



tripe  they  dish out and which we have  had  to

endure in the past. However, they need not  fear

that  democratic  rights will be  abolished.  We

have  neither the intention to abolish elections

nor  the intention to abolish the Assembly.  All

that   is   impossible.  The   Singapore   State

Constitution   is   part   of   the    Malaysian

Constitution. If there are any changes at all in

the  way  Malaysia  is  going  to  be  run,  and

therefore  the way the States are  going  to  be

run,  the  power lies not in the  hands  of  the

Singapore  Government but in the  hands  of  the

Central Government.
