<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head V -

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Head V - Prime Minister's Office.

Amendment No. (1).  Mr Inderjit Singh.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head V of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Singapore 21 vision which we established two

years  ago  would  be an excellent guide for  us  to  promote

racial  harmony, among other objectives, in  our  attempt  to

build  a  better Singapore for the future.  Many Singaporeans

were  involved in the one and a half years' effort to  define

our  vision for the future and the House also spent two  days

debating  and  accepting the principles of  the  S21  vision.

Perhaps,  many  of us had high expectations of  how  the  S21

vision  would  be implemented in an attempt  to  get  to  the

ideals  that  we define.  To many of us, the S21  vision  has

today  been relegated to something like an on-going  courtesy

or  keep  Singapore clean campaign.  We need  to  revive  the

implementation of the many actions identified within the  S21

vision that was developed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we have done many things to achieve physical

integration of the various ethnic groups in Singapore through

policies  like  the  Housing  and Development  Board  housing

policies,  more  could  be done in  trying  to  achieve  true

emotional integration or bonding amongst all races.  We  need

to  urgently  build this bonding and trust among the  various

races   through  concrete  programmes  focused  on  emotional

integration.   This  is even more important  in  our  schools

where children have the greatest opportunity to interact and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 703</b></font><br><br>

learn  about  each  other.   Practices  in  some  schools  to

segregate  students  into  classes according  to  the  mother

tongue  option they study are very detrimental to our efforts

to   integrate  Singaporeans.   Some  schools   do   it   for

administrative  convenience, but the convenience  is  causing

tremendous damage with respect to building a cohesive  multi-racial Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the ethnic-based self-help groups have achieved

limited   success,  but  much  needs  to  be   done.    While

improvements  have  been  made in  primary  schools,  in  the

secondary schools, problems still exist.  A higher proportion

of Indians and Malays go to the Normal and Normal (Technical)

streams, as compared to the national average.  Performance of

Indian and Malay students at the "O" and "A" levels also  did

not  significantly improve if we compare to the progress made

by the Chinese community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second issue with the ethnic-based self-help groups

is  that  we  intentionally segregate and  differentiate  our

children according to the races when it comes to helping them

to  improve  themselves.  We give our children the impression

that people of their own kind are the only ones who care  and

will  help  them.   For the smaller ethnic  groups  like  the

Indians and the Eurasians, such an approach immediately  puts

them   at  a  disadvantage  simply  because  they  have  less

resources to mobilise, especially in fund-raising, to support

their  activities.  While each of them do  go  to  people  of

other races for funds, the proportion of funds that come from

other  races is very small, compared to the total  sums  that

they  collect.  Because of the lack of appropriate resources,

there  is  a  limitation as to what they can do  and  to  the

quality  of programmes that they can execute.  This, perhaps,

can  explain why the Indians and Malays still have a long way

to go to catch up with the national average of performance at

the  landmark  examinations. This is a very dangerous  trend,

especially in the practice of meritocracy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 704</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully believe in and support the meritocratic practice

in  Singapore, but when such a practice is based on  academic

performance and when the ethnic minorities are the ones  that

perform worse than the majority ethnic group, the result  may

lead to a feeling of discrimination among the minorities when

they  are  not selected for key Government positions  in  the

civil service or in the uniformed service.  I therefore  urge

the  Prime  Minister to seriously consider restructuring  the

ethnic-based  self-help  group  concept  to  one  that   more

effectively gives equal opportunities for improvement to  all

races.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is about time that we merged the various ethnic-based

self-help  groups  into one, or to create  an  umbrella  body

which  oversees all the ethnic-based self-help  groups.   One

possibility is to consolidate certain activities, like  fund-raising, administration and others that make sense from  each

of  these groups, while keeping the operational arms of  each

discrete.   I  concede that there will  be  more  success  in

reaching  out  to  people  if this is  done  via  the  ethnic

grouping  route,  but  perhaps, it is only  this  portion  of

reaching   out  that  should  be  kept  separate   while   we

consolidate the rest of the functions for the various groups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I feel that the younger generation of leaders

needs  to  do  more  to have frank and open discussions  with

Singaporeans of all races, especially among the  leaders  and

the  minorities  in  Singapore, to understand  the  feelings,

frustrations and aspirations of each community so  that  they

can  be  better  understood and explained.   I  attended  the

dialogue session that the Senior Minister held with the Malay

community  about two weeks ago and could not help but  notice

the  trust  and respect those who were present  had  for  the

Senior  Minister and his views.  It was years of  interaction

and understanding and emotional bonding that made this happen

and  possible.   Such things do not get developed  overnight.

It  takes many years and constant interaction to develop such

a  relationship.  I look forward to this happening  with  the

current and future generations of leadership so that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 705</b></font><br><br>

the  trust  among the leaders and the members of the  various

ethnic groups and races can be built and strengthened upon.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Sir, multi-racialism is the

cornerstone  of  Singapore society. We  have  expressed  this

credo  by  striving to forge a common national identity,  yet

allowing each community the space to maintain and evolve  its

own  identity.   But  this  is  certainly  a  delicate  task,

especially  as  some may feel that the two are  incompatible.

But  I  think  that  in  an ethnically diverse  society  like

Singapore, it perhaps represents a pragmatic response to  the

challenge of nation-building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one of the hallmarks of this Government has been

its  candid and forthrightness, both in its discussion of and

approach to managing ethnic issues.  It does not shrink  away

from  saying  it  as  it is, nor does it seek  a  politically

correct veneer.  So we publish educational and socio-economic

data  by ethnic groups, have GRCs and the like, and some find

this  candour  inconvenient, if not a source  of  discomfort.

But  putting  it  out in the open offers our best  chance  of

maintaining a balanced and objective dialogue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, self-help groups are another example of this

forthright approach.  They have been in existence  for  10-20

years  and  are  an essential part of Singapore's  landscape.

They  perform an important function in seeking to  raise  the

educational  and  socio-economic status of the  disadvantaged

within their respective communities.  It is easy to take them

for  granted and to overlook the fact however, that they  are

ethnic  in their focus and therefore are an anomaly of  sorts

within multi-racial Singapore.  I was therefore glad that our

Prime  Minister  recently sounded  a  note  of  caution  lest

Singaporeans misconstrue the Government's support  for  self-help groups as an endorsement for them to retreat into ethnic

enclaves.   However, I was concerned by subsequent  reactions

from the media that self-help groups should be merged and  my

colleague, Mr Inderjit Singh, has expressed similar views.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 706</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans and the media are right to be

concerned  about  the  possible adverse impact  of  self-help

groups  on Singapore's multi-racial character.  But  I  think

they  are  wrong to conclude that therefore self-help  groups

should  be  abolished.  Self-help groups tap into  a  certain

sense  of  mutual  help  within the  community  to  help  the

disadvantaged.  CDAC, Mendaki and SINDA have shown that  this

can  be a positive force for community upliftment and  if  we

look  at the statistics carefully, we will find that  in  all

levels,  there  has  been  an  improvement,  even  relatively

speaking, over the last 10 years or so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is always the risk that it can easily

degenerate  into an ugly form of parochialism  and  segmented

thinking.  In  essence,  self-help  groups  operate  in   the

penumbra  between  perfect integration on the  one  hand  and

ethnic  segregation  on the other.  But  does  that  mean  we

abolish  them?  I think not.  Merging self-help  groups  will

not  guarantee  a  multi-racial utopia, yet,  we  would  deny

ourselves  an  effective vehicle to help  the  disadvantaged.

Besides,  there  are hundreds of other clans,  religious  and

community  groups that will continue to exist that we  cannot

and  we should not remove by Government fiat.  However, I  do

believe Singaporeans are justified in wanting to know whether

there are measures in place to curb the possibility that self-help group activities might be inconsistent with our national

objectives.   This  is  especially so  given  that  self-help

groups  receive  substantial support from Government  in  the

form  of  financial and other resources.  And it is important

to  know  that these are applied in a manner consistent  with

our overarching national objective.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in that regard, I would like to ask whether there

is a case for an oversight or coordinating body for self-help

groups  under  the Prime Minister's Office, not  a  wholesale

integration,  but a body that can receive reports,  be  well-apprised  of the activities of the self-help groups  and  use

moral  suasion  on occasions when necessary.   I  think  this

would go a long way in reassuring Singaporeans that we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 707</b></font><br><br>

have  these entities which serve a useful social purpose,  we

recognise  that  they  might, on occasions,  go  off  from  a

tangent but that we have the measures in place to curb  those

instincts.  Apart from this audit function, I think the self-help  groups  themselves might welcome such an  oversight  or

coordinating body as it would serve as an important point  of

liaison  between  them and the various Government  Ministries

and  agencies in order to launch coordinated efforts targeted

at specific issues within the communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the Prime Minister's Office to comment on

this  and the Prime Minister to comment whether he feels that

such a coordinating body is necessary and whether such a body

can then be set up.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

there are Singaporeans who still wonder today why after  more

than  35 years of harmonious co-existence amongst the various

races,  the  recent  public discussions,  especially  on  the

recent  Malay-Muslim  issues, seem to  suggest  that  we  are

having a more fragile state of race relations in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many, I think, have been lulled into thinking these

issues are mainly related to our past, the historical baggage

that  our  older  generation carries.  Younger  Singaporeans,

however,  must  be  aware  that  they  also  need  to  better

understand  and  manage the diversity of race,  language  and

religion, not only in terms of our past experience,  but  how

they   will  handle  newer  issues  that  will  have   ethnic

implications  and how evolving geo-political  realities  will

affect   us  in  ways  different  from  our  past.    Younger

Singaporeans  will have to find their own personal  relevance

and  experience  and the meaning of racial harmony  in  their

effort towards greater social integration.  I fear that  many

young  Singaporeans  do  not  understand  that  the  new  and

emerging  issues  can be far more divisive and  serious  than

past threats and challenges.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 708</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People and groups are now better connected. Minority

groups  and racial and religious extremists can find  comfort

and safety with groups elsewhere outside Singapore.  Already,

we  have seen how some domestic issues like education brought

about  reaction  from people outside Singapore.   What  about

issues that are potentially more divisive?  For example, what

if the digital divide that we talk about would also divide us

along  racial and ethnic lines?  What if a particular  ethnic

community  continues  to  feel  left  behind,  in  terms   of

education and other opportunities?  There have been  concerns

about stereotyping of minority groups on radio and TV.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard how and certainly felt very uneasy during

recent   talks   of   marginalisation  of  the   Malay-Muslim

community.  There were concerns of discrimination in the past

faced  by  job-seekers,  or of older Malay-Muslims  who  feel

especially  vulnerable as they face future structural  change

in employment. These are extremely explosive issues which can

be  manipulated.  Some countries like UK have race  relations

Acts  to deal with such discrimination on racial grounds.  It

provides  for  avenues  where people who  feel  aggrieved  or

discriminated  by  employers,  for  example,  can   get   the

necessary  protection. It provides for a Code of Practice  to

ensure equality of opportunities in employment and education.

It  gives  powers to investigate and provide for  enforcement

and   prosecution  of  offenders.   Other  than   the   legal

framework,  it  deals with how, for example,  newspapers  and

magazines can reflect the diversity of arts, culture, even in

promotional advertising.  But, Sir, I am not suggesting  that

we  have  a Race Relations Act in Singapore, because I  think

nothing can be more damaging than to have such emotive issues

being   contested  in  court.   So  far,  we  have   existing

mechanisms  to deal with such issues, and mainly through  the

goodwill  of  our community and political leaders.   However,

the  essence  of  these  provisions  found  in  the  UK  Race

Relations Act, I think, is useful to us, because we  need  to

find new mechanisms to handle this in a more transparent way.

And I repeat the call for setting up of a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 709</b></font><br><br>

multi-racial  agency,  perhaps  under  the  Prime  Minister's

Office,  to deal with issues like this.  Or it can be through

the  Presidential Councils for Religious Harmony and Minority

Rights, which can be enlarged and strengthened to take a more

proactive stand towards racial integration.

<br>12.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, it is good to hear the various community

organisations responding, saying that they will  do  more  to

enhance racial and ethnic activities.  But it is one thing to

have an agency like this to monitor and ensure that the state

of  race  relations  in Singapore continues  to  remain  very

healthy,  very  much  like what the People's  Association  is

doing  to  ensure that community centres do actually organise

such activities, and perhaps penalise  those who do not.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To such organisations, we can ensure that channels for

racial integration are always there and adequately protected.

We   can   have   national  education   programmes   in   our

neighbourhoods   -   in  schools and  in  workplaces   -   to

mobilise participation of all Singaporeans.  The multi-racial

agency can also be a body to manage the various accommodation

and  compromises  that are necessary as  we  proceed  towards

racial  integration.   It  is necessary  to  deal  with  such

issues,  because  people who promote culture,  tradition  and

sometimes religion have a missionary evangelical zeal towards

their own culture and tradition, and makes accommodation  and

compromise very difficult.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, our cultural diversities, including the

role  of  ethnic  and minority groups, are factors  which,  I

believe, have and will continue to enrich and strengthen  our

society,  both in culture, politics and economic  prosperity.

But  there  is  no  doubt that this very diversity  can  also

become  a  very  weak factor, and become a threat  to  social

stability in Singapore.  And it is for these reasons, Sir,  I

thought  that  greater  attention should  be  given  to  this

matter.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 710</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S. C. Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, I want to join

those  who  have  raised concerns that  race-based  self-help

groups may inadvertently lead to segregation.  Prime Minister

Goh  has recently encouraged them to work together.  I  think

we  all  stand, in that sense, between these two extremes  of

segregation on the one hand, and merger on the other. And  we

are seeking ways, like the speakers before me, of how to help

these  separate  entities become more  cooperative,  so  that

they  have the conviction about their own ethnicity, but also

the willingness and understanding to compromise when need be.

So I want to focus on how we can offer incentives rather than

merely exhortations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first suggestion I have for the Prime Minister's

Office   is   that  the  Government  should   give   funding.

Government already funds dollar-for-dollar schemes  for  most

of   the   self-help   groups.   To  encourage   multi-racial

cooperation, Government should establish a new and additional

fund.   And where two or more self-help groups work  together

for  programmes and events, this new fund would give them  an

extra dollar to match the expenses.  In this sense, we should

create  financial  incentives to  help  them  work  together.

Exhortation   works   by   moral  suasion,   but   I   think,

additionally,  practical  measures  to  work   together   are

important,  because  cooperation does  take  more  time.   It

sometimes  is  more  costly to cooperate  because  there  are

meetings, more administration, etc.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second suggestion is to encourage people outside of

a  racial group to help.  They can already give funds to that

group, ie, if I am Chinese, there is nothing to stop me  from

pledging  part  of  my CPF, etc, to another  racial  group  - Indian,  Eurasian or Malay.  I think more should be  done  to

encourage  this  and perhaps Government  should  give  a  tax

benefit to encourage this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third suggestion I have is one of oversight. Some

have suggested that oversight be from outside, from the Prime

Minister's Office.  My suggestion is that oversight should be

from the inside.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 711</b></font><br><br>

Government should encourage self-help groups to appoint  more

members  of  other  races to their boards  of  directors  and

advisors.    These  people,  of  course,   should   have   an

understanding and empathy of the particular ethnic group, but

they will be also able to bring in some other perspectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the longer term, Sir, some would urge Government to

consider setting a sunset clause to the self-help groups.   I

think  there is some sense to think about this, because while

there  will always be people in Singapore who need our  help,

if  our multi-racial efforts succeed over time, all of us  as

Singaporeans will be able to help them.  Perhaps that is  the

view  for  the  longer term, but I think it is  important  to

prepare for that by step-by-step efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I hope the Government will consider these

suggestions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng (Nee Soon Central)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, we

have  been successful over the years in raising the  standard

of  living of most Singaporeans.  In fact, it has become  the

envy  of  many nations around us.  However, in our relentless

pursuit, like many developed nations, we will have to grapple

with  issues such as widening income gap between  the  higher

income group, the rich, and the lower income group, the poor.

This  phenomenon will be further accelerated by our open door

policy  to investments, inflow of foreign talents and today's

Internet-driven  economy.  They call  it  the  great  digital

divide.  This digital divide is a serious problem.  Those who

can  capitalise  on the growth of the Internet  economy  will

benefit immensely, whilst those still lagging behind  in  the

old  economy  will  suffer the fate of  dwindling  income  or

stagnation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike developed nations with vast resources, our prized

asset  is our human resource as our capital.  We are  only  a

red  dot  on  the map.  We know that we cannot  and  are  not

capable  of reversing this international trend.  As  a  small

country, we cannot afford social disorder and a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 712</b></font><br><br>

collapse  within our social fabric.  Therefore,  we  place  a

high  premium in ensuring our social cohesion, racial harmony

and integration among the various races,  and unity among our

people.  Like our world-class infrastructure, social cohesion

can  be  ranked  as  one  of our key pillars  supporting  our

continued  competitiveness and survival in today's globalised

economy.  As such, the great digital and income divide  issue

has to be addressed with great care and sensitivity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we continue our drive to attract the best

investments and talents to Singapore, those who are unable to

keep  pace with this drive should not be left behind to  fend

for  themselves,  or made to feel severely  handicapped.   Of

course,  I  am not suggesting in any way that we should  give

hand-outs  and welfare to those who are unable  to  make  the

leap.  We  must acknowledge that despite all our  efforts  to

motivate and encourage fellow Singaporeans to upgrade,  there

will  always be a group who will find it difficult or  unable

to  cope.   This group of people will continue  to  earn  low

wages,  while the rest will ride the Internet wave  and  earn

good wages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our meritocratic system has served us well. The good

and  the  able will be rewarded handsomely, whilst  the  less

able  will  be treated fairly.  It is precisely in this  area

that our Government should continue to play a proactive role.

While  we cannot and should not arbitrarily manage and bridge

the  widening income gap, we can offer other means  to  level

up.   Over  the  years, the Government has been  generous  by

offering periodic CPF top-ups for the lower income groups and

the  aged,  and  asset  enhancement through  shares,  Edusave

scholarships, etc,  all in an attempt to ensure that the less

privileged  and the lower income family will feel  and  enjoy

also  the fruits of our success.  These are good schemes  and

should   be   encouraged,  continued,  and  more  should   be

introduced.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I must stress that ensuring our social

cohesion  goes beyond just providing occasional  CPF  top-ups

or, in simple terms, material benefits.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 713</b></font><br><br>

These  are  not enough.  Lower income and the less privileged

groups, which may grow in numbers, should not be left to feel

that  they have been deprived or, worse still, unable to gain

access  to certain basic amenities due to their inability  to

afford the cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in this respect that our Government has a pivotal

role  to  play.   The provision of basic amenities,  such  as

medical  healthcare  services,  housing,  education,   public

facilities  like parks, playgrounds, etc, should serve  as  a

means  in  bridging  the income gap.  We should  continue  to

leverage  on providing such basic facilities at an affordable

rate  and  make it accessible to every Singaporean regardless

of   their  status  in  our  society.   Ensuring  that  every

Singaporean  has  ready  access to  each  of  these  services

regardless of race, religion and their position in society is

the  only  way  to  create  a level  playing  field  for  all

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my next cut is on the identity crisis - my role

as a Singaporean.  Our Government has always been mindful and

sensitive in devising our policies and approaches.  Many good

programmes  and schemes, such as making funds  available  for

skills  training, asset enhancement, CPF top-up,  rebates  on

utilities charges, etc, have been initiated over the years by

the Government in an effort to "level up" our society and  to

share  the  fruits of success.  While such schemes should  be

encouraged,  should we not be mindful of the ill effect  they

may  impose  on  Singaporeans, especially on  items  such  as

rebates  and CPF top-up?  In fact, many have taken these  for

granted and that they no longer consider them as a privilege.

What  if  our  economy turns bad?  What  will  happen?   Will

Singaporeans still expect to receive their privileges?   What

happens if they do not receive?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent survey on younger Singaporeans revealed that

their pragmatism and lack of passion for Singapore will  make

them  leave  Singapore  for  greener  pastures  without   any

hesitation.  Despite our efforts over the years  to  build  a

cohesive  and  unified society through  various  schemes  and

programmes, there

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 714</b></font><br><br>

are  still  pockets  of Singaporeans who feel  otherwise,  in

particular,  the  younger group.  Not only have  they  become

materialistic, they have come to expect what Singapore should

offer  them,  rather than how they could  contribute  to  the

growth  of  the  society and country.  Are  they  wrong?   We

cannot  really say so.  One of the key points to note is  the

sense  that they have nothing to do with the achievements  of

Singapore.  They felt that they could do very little or  they

have  no  role to play.  This is a real concern because  many

perhaps have taken the good and high standard of living  that

they  enjoy now as their right and entitlement, instead of  a

privilege.  Their better education and our open economy  have

enabled   the   younger   generation  unlimited   access   to

information  of  the  world.  This has perhaps  shaped  their

thinking and created high aspiration and expectation.

<br>1.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore 21 has set out a grand vision for every

Singaporean  in which everyone of us has a role  to  play  in

sustaining and ensuring our success and survival.   It  is  a

pity  that  after its grand introduction, somehow the  vision

has  been  forgotten.   While it is  important  to  emphasise

economic  success,  we  should  also  not  forget  the   very

fundamental values of society and family.  It is these values

that  will bind our people together in a crisis and to  carry

our nation through thick and thin.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, we can see such feelings and emotions of

togetherness and closing of ranks among Singaporeans when  we

deal  with issues such as the SQ 006 crash and the occasional

bashing  from Malaysia.  We can see such feelings and passion

for  Singapore.   However,  for us  to  continue  to  achieve

economic  success,  such  value system  of  togetherness  and

bonding  must  be  deeply ingrained in every Singaporean,  so

that we can ride out the challenges ahead.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, I have a cut

which  I have just missed.  Can I go ahead with my first  cut

on the progress of the Malays?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 715</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> You have missed your turn. But, all

right, make your points very quickly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Yes, I will be as fast as I can.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> I would let you make your points, but

briefly, please.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, the Prime Minister on 21st

January  this  year  made a speech in  which  he  cited  vast

amounts of statistics to show that the Singapore Malays  have

made  marked  progress in education, occupation, income,  and

the  quality  of  life.  The statistics cited  by  the  Prime

Minister   showed   that  Malay  children   not   only   make

improvements  in both the Primary School Leaving Examinations

but  also  the secondary school examinations, and  also  more

Malays  are  getting  admitted  to  both  secondary  schools,

institutions  and the universities.  As for occupations,  the

Malays  are  also  getting more managerial  and  professional

jobs.   The percentage increase in those jobs is from 12%  to

23%  over the period of 1990 to 2000.  Incomes of the  Malays

have  also shown an equal increase.  For the median  resident

Malay  household incomes, the increase from 1990 to 2000  was

$1,800 to about $2,700.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After PM Goh's speech, the Malay MPs in Parliament were

quick  to  point  out that the Malays in  Singapore  are  not

marginalised and the meritocracy system does not work against

the  Malay  community.   I agree with the  Malay  Members  of

Parliament.  While we laud the progress made by the Malays in

Singapore in the areas mentioned above, there are other areas

in  which the Malays are not particularly happy and they want

them  changed.  The Malays in Singapore want to be integrated

with the other communities.  They do not want to be isolated,

like  in the self-help groups.  Also, they want to be treated

like  other  Singaporeans.  They  say  that  they  are  loyal

Singaporeans  and  want to be accepted in the  Singapore  Air

Force.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malay youths today have to do national service, just

like  any  other Singaporean youths.  But they  can  only  do

national service in the Army, Navy and Police

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 716</b></font><br><br>

Force, but not in the Singapore Air Force.  If this is  true,

I  would like to know why.  I would think that members of the

Malay  community  should be allowed to do  their  NS  in  the

Singapore  Air  Force as well as the other  branches  of  the

armed services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of Special Assistance Plan Schools is

something  which  also causes discomfort  to  the  Malays  in

Singapore.  I think that the Government should take  note  of

that  and  have  another look at the SAP schools.   When  our

Malay brethrens say that they want to be integrated into  the

other  communities, I believe that they do  not  want  to  be

branded as an ethnic group or a minority group.  While it  is

true that they comprise only 15% to 18% of our population,  I

believe  they  do not want to be treated as  a  separate  and

distinct  ethnic group.  Each Malay wants to  be  treated  as

just another Singaporean.  Each Malay today wants only to  be

known  as  a  Singaporean and not as a Malay Singaporean.   I

think that the Government should take note of what they want.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singapore is to become a truly multi-racial country,

then  we  should  at  least listen to our Malay  brothers  in

respect  of their problems concerning their integration  into

the  other  communities and their other problems,  and  their

plea  for  acceptance in the Singapore Air Force.   I  should

also add that the formation of the GRC is an identity problem

to  both  the  Malays and the Indians where they are  forever

branded  as  ethnic races.  The Malays have come a  long  way

since  Singapore's independence in 1965 and  I  believe  they

want  to move along together with the mainstream Singaporeans

as Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I take my next cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Singapore is basically a good place

for  business.   The  Government has put  in  place  all  the

necessary infrastructure - the hardware, so to say.  We  have

buildings for offices, buildings for factories, buildings for

schools and hospitals, and a good network of road system  and

other facilities.  All these things are necessary

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 717</b></font><br><br>

to  foreigners to come to invest their money here and  to  do

business and give Singapore economic growth every year.   All

the  things  are  of  course necessary  in  nation  building.

Without food, clothing, housing, hospitals, schools, there is

nothing  to  talk  about  nation  building.   Singapore   has

achieved much in terms of physical infrastructure, in  nation

building,  but  rather lacking in the  software  part  -  the

emotions that Singaporeans can identify with Singapore.  Many

of  the young people recently interviewed find it hard to say

that  they can be proud to be a Singaporean.  They appear  to

have no emotional attachments to Singapore. Emotionally, they

cannot relate to Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, from my own experience, when I came back from

overseas,  I  felt  a strong emotion for  Singapore,  and  of

course also to see my parents, and I longed to see the places

which  were very familiar to me during my childhood days.   I

was  saddened to see that my old house, which I had lived for

many  years as a child, had been sold and pulled down by  the

developers, and it was no longer there.  I had lived  in  the

Orchard  Road area as a boy.  The old wet market there  which

was  so  familiar had been torn down.  As a boy I also cycled

with other friends to eat ice kachang at the shop behind  the

wet  market.  That shop and all the rows of shophouses  along

Orchard  Road  had been demolished to give way  to  high-rise

shopping centres.  The picture of Singapore I knew as  a  boy

had all disappeared.  I think this must be the experiences of

many other Singaporeans.  So, emotionally, if this is not the

picture  that  I had in my mind as a child, it  is  certainly

hard  to  relate  to that place.  It is just like  any  other

place in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Singapore is to have democracy, I think more people

should  be  allowed  to take part in politics.   I  say  this

because of the youngsters interviewed, one said that he could

not relate to the beautiful airport that was built at Changi,

because he said that he did not have a say in the building of

that  airport or had nothing to do with the building  of  the

airport.   My point is that Singaporeans should  be  given  a

chance to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 718</b></font><br><br>

take  part in politics.  As it is, even if they want to  take

part in politics, it is becoming more and more difficult.  We

have  very high deposits and we also have the GRCs which make

it  almost  impossible  for  Singaporeans  to  take  part  in

politics and have a say in what is going on in the country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the landscape, Singapore is developing so rapidly

that now we cannot use the landscape to create emotional ties

with  the  country.  The old buildings that we know  so  well

have all been torn down and made way for so-called progress.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order, Mr Chiam. The time allocated to

you has expired.  General Lee.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (BG Lee Hsien Loong):</b> Sir,

may  I  first  take  all the points made on  racial  harmony,

multiracialism and self-help groups, and then  address  later

the   issues  about  Singapore  identity,  which  was  raised

especially by Mr Ong Ah Heng and Mr Chiam See Tong.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to thank the MPs for sharing their concerns

about the need for self-help groups to look beyond their  own

communities and to collaborate more with one another.  And  I

also thank them for the suggestions they have given us on how

this can be achieved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we should see this problem in our basic context

and  begin with our basic ideal, namely, that we are  seeking

to   build   an   integrated,  multi-racial,  multi-religious

society.   That  is what we set out to do in nation  building

and  self-help groups fit into this context.   When  we  talk

about  nation  building, we try to  do  it  by  many  ways  - integrated  HDB  housing  estates,  so  all  the  races  live

together;  national  schools,  common  curriculum;   national

education in schools so that people know Singapore's  history

and  our strategic circumstances; the pledge said every  day,

the  flag-raising,  and  so  on.  And  the  schools  organise

programmes  to  teach pupils how to appreciate  and  live  in

harmony  with  each  other through actual  participation  and

experience.   Pupils  from different  schools  do  activities

jointly

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 719</b></font><br><br>

together.    Pupils   take  part  in  community   involvement

programmes,  and so they mix with others of different  races,

and  in mixing, get to know one another and get to appreciate

one another.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, at the same time, as we talk about bringing the

ethnic  groups together, we also want the young  to  grow  up

with  a  sense  of their cultural heritage and  their  mother

tongues, and every ethnic group wants to keep something which

is  of  itself.  When Mr Chiam says Malay Singaporeans prefer

to   be   known   as  Singaporeans  rather  than   as   Malay

Singaporeans, I saw Mr Zulkifli smiling at that.   I  do  not

think  Mr  Chiam's reading of the ground is accurate.   Every

Singaporean wants to be both - to keep something  of  himself

and  his  ethnic  group, at the same time to  have  something

which is shared with all the communities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in schools, in order to help people keep some of

their  own cultural identity, we focus on teaching the mother

tongue.   We  cannot  teach the mother tongue  in  integrated

classes.  But that does not mean we have to segregate  pupils

by race into different classes for all subjects, just for the

convenience of teaching the mother tongue.  Mr Inderjit Singh

raised  this concern, but it is an old administrative  issue,

and  the  Ministry  of  Education has actually  resolved  the

problem.  And they have told all the principals who know that

they  must  not, out of administrative expediency,  segregate

the  pupils  based  on the mother tongue  classes.  In  other

words,  all the Malay pupils in one class because  you  study

Malay,  all the Chinese group also in another class,  and  so

on.   Once  in  a while, there is a case which comes  to  the

Ministry's notice, then the principal is reminded of this and

is  asked  to  put the situation right.  So  that  is  a  not

serious  problem.   In general, the schools  try  to  arrange

common  mother tongue periods, where possible, so the  mother

tongue  periods  will all coincide and, at  that  point,  the

pupils   attend  their  various  mother  tongue  lessons   in

different  classes at the same time.  And  this  reduces  the

need for segregating pupils.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 720</b></font><br><br>

<br>1.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while we pursue the ideal of an integrated society,

we   must  also  acknowledge  that  we  are  not  yet   fully

integrated.   If  we want to seriously tackle certain  social

problems,  for  example,  broken  families,  drugs,   teenage

delinquency,   or school under performance, then  an  ethnic-based community self-help approach is really a practical  and

effective way for several reasons:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The motivation to help members of one's own

community  is a very strong and natural one, which we  should

harness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) It is important for the self pride of the

communities.  It is important that they feel they are  making

progress   through  their  own  efforts,  and  not  passively

receiving aid from others.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) There is sensitivity doing social work across racial

lines.   It  is not so difficult to motivate volunteers  from

one  race  to  tutor  children from  another  race.   We  can

persuade  them.   There will be some who are idealistic,  who

will  come forward and they will do that, and some are  doing

that.   Much more delicate is to have, say, an Indian  social

worker exhorting and pressuring Chinese or Malay men to  take

responsibility  for their families.  Families have  problems,

parents  not carrying out their duties, or head of  household

not  carrying  out  his duties.  You need encouragement,  you

need  support, you need counselling, and sometimes, you  need

firm  words  from  somebody whom he respects  and  identifies

with.   And if you cross racial lines in doing such sensitive

work, we can easily cause offence and misunderstanding.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we set up the self-help groups, like SINDA,

CDAC,  Mendaki  and AMP.  As long as these  groups  focus  on

social  and  community  work,  they  are  making  a  valuable

contribution.   But  if  they stray  beyond  that  to  assert

themselves politically, on a racial basis, that threatens the

basic  foundation  of  our social  compact  and  it  must  be

checked.  And MPs are quite right to point out that this is a

danger  which we should guard against.  This was one  of  the

reasons why the Government

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 721</b></font><br><br>

took a strong stand to oppose the AMP's collective leadership

proposal recently.  Because we felt it strayed beyond  social

and  community work to venture into the political arena,  and

not  just  politics,  but multi-racial  politics,  going  for

racial politics dividing Singapore along ethnic lines.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the self-help groups do their own activities, we

also  encourage them to come together and reach out to  other

communities.  In fact, they are already doing this. They have

got  donors  and  volunteers from other racial  groups.   For

example,  14%  of  Mendaki's donations come from  non-Malays.

And we have got volunteers in Mendaki, 11%; SINDA, 10%; CDAC,

9%; AMP, 14%, volunteers from other races.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the self-help groups organise joint programmes

which  they  open to members of other groups, and  they  open

their  own  programmes  to members of  other  groups.   These

include tuition programmes and joint training programmes  for

tutors.  They  run an annual Camp Teen for  youths  from  all

ethnic  communities.  Camp Teen is spearheaded by each  group

on  a  rotation basis to promote cross-cultural  interaction,

enhance  understanding of each other and instill values  like

teamwork.   And  the self-help groups also participate  in  a

larger network of community organisations, including the CDCs

and  voluntary welfare organisations.  For example, the  five

of  them  get together and they run the Joint Social  Service

Centre,  five  of  them plus the Central Singapore  Community

Development  Council, I think it is in Toa Payoh,  which  was

formed  in  1997  and has been providing family  and  student

services since December last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to continue to encourage these outreach

activities which will go some way to prevent individual self-help  groups from becoming inward-looking, racist groups,  as

Mr  Iswaran puts it.  But we should not forget the  rationale

for setting up these groups in the first place, which remains

valid and which we should not inadvertently undermine.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 722</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure that an umbrella body for all these self-help groups, which Mr Inderjit Singh suggested, would help,

because all the self-help groups are already overseen by MCDS

in  a  broad  way, and in fact PMO also keeps a watchful  eye

over  them to make sure that they are fulfilling their proper

purpose.   PMO  and MCDS  will check them  in  case  they  go

astray.   The  Executive  Directors  of  these  groups   meet

quarterly  to coordinate programmes and exchange  experiences

(in  fact,  I understand they are scheduled to meet  the  day

after tomorrow for this quarter).  They communicate regularly

with  one  another  and with e-mail, telephone,  fax,  it  is

hardly  a  problem.   They do keep in touch.   They  do  work

together.   So  to add another umbrella body  will  only  add

unnecessary bureaucracy and overhead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that the self-help groups are the reasons

for   differences  in  performance  between   the   different

communities.  These differences are the reasons why  we  have

created  the  self-help groups.  They are deep-seated.   They

reflect partly cultural trends, partly other factors.  We can

work  to  make each group improve progressively.  I think  to

eliminate the gaps would take a long time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Simon Tay dwelt at length on funding for self-help

groups  and  suggested  that  we  introduce  higher  matching

grants,   tax   incentives  to  promote  greater  inter-group

activities  and  mutual support.  I  do  not  think  this  is

necessary because money is not really the issue.  It  is  the

will, it is a sense of doing something useful.  And there are

many multi-racial groups which already exist, like the PA and

the CDAC and others which are already pursuing activities  on

a  multiracial  basis.  So the self-help groups  fit  in  and

complement  that.   If  we do not think  that  the  self-help

groups  have a valid mission on their own, I think we  should

disband  them rather than have them exist and then go counter

to  that  and  try  and  pull them to launch  joint  projects

through tax incentives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for a sunset clause for the self-help groups in the

longer term, we have to take

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 723</b></font><br><br>

the matter in a proper sequence and have the self-help groups

as long as they are fulfilling a purpose.  We cannot say when

our  society  will be fully integrated.  We cannot  say  when

these  specific  problems which the ethnic  communities  have

will  be  resolved.  As long as they exist, there will  be  a

mission  for these self-help groups.  If they do  not,  well,

then  we all enjoy a glorious sunset.  But I think that  will

be some time to come.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Race Relations Act was raised by Mr Zulkifli. He

suggested  that we take some of the points from there.   This

is  something which we can consider in terms of awareness  of

the   issue   involved  in  discrimination  and  inter-ethnic

relations.  But I do not think that a legislative approach is

a good one.  The British have the Race Relations Act.  It has

not   really   solved  their  problems.   They   still   have

discrimination between the whites and the blacks.  When there

was a black man who was murdered in South London a couple  of

years ago, they had been unable to solve the crime, and  part

of   the   problem   is,  as  the  British  themselves   have

acknowledged,  that  the police are predominantly  white  and

have  found  it  very difficult to get through and  empathise

with   the  black  community.   And  even  within  the  black

community  in  Britain,  they have difficulties  because  the

black community are of different groups.  Recently, there was

a  case  of Damilola, a young boy from Nigeria, who  went  to

Britain and was killed by other school children who were  not

from Nigeria, black, but from other parts of the world.  So I

do not think that the legislative approach is going to be the

solution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key is for us to establish trust and understanding

among  the  races  and  proceed  at  a  pace  that  all   the

communities are comfortable with.  It is encouraging that all

the   communities  and  their  leaders  have  supported  this

objective and even AMP has made their position clear, and now

on  the record.  So long as we make progress in widening  the

common ground between the communities, however slowly, we can

continue to build better lives for Singaporeans.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 724</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam raised the question of Malay progress and of

integration of Malays and also whether Malays serve  National

Service  in  the  RSAF.   These are issues  which  have  been

extensively  discussed recently.  In terms  of  the  progress

which  has been made, the Prime Minister has put up  what  he

called  a report card of the progress.  As for comparing  the

progress of the Malays with other communities, if you look at

the  Advance Data Releases based on the census, in fact a lot

of  the  information  is  there, including  information  with

highest   educational   qualification,  literacy,   language,

occupation or distribution, household size, dwelling type and

household  income.   And  if you  go  to  the  Department  of

Statistics' website, which is www.singstat.gov.sg, all  these

reports are available on the Internet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the SAF and whether Malays feel that they are

Malay Singaporeans or not, and how integration can proceed, I

would  recommend  Mr  Chiam to read what  transpired  in  the

dialogue two weeks ago and was published in the Sunday  Times

last  week and, again, this week, of what the Senior Minister

said and of his exchanges with the Malay community leaders to

get an appreciation of a very deep issue which is going to be

with us for a long time, but which we have to understand  and

empathise   with.    So  it  is  both  a   rational   matter,

understanding it, and also an emotional matter, to be able to

bridge that gap and gradually to narrow it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Singapore identity which Mr Ong Ah Heng and

Mr  Chiam See Tong raised, this too is a matter of hearts  as

well  as  heads  -  long term, instinct-building,  about  the

obligations and the roles of Singaporeans.  It is  a  healthy

sign that younger Singaporeans are asking who we are, what it

means  to  be  a  Singaporean, what is our role  in  society.

Because  like  most young people, they are  going  through  a

phase of questioning, search and discovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young people are the future of our society. So an

integral part of the education is to imbue them with a  sense

of  belonging  and  responsibility  to  the  nation,  and  to

appreciate the fact that our security and economic well-being

is not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 725</b></font><br><br>

a  natural  state of affairs.  Our collective  and  continued

survival depends on our joint effort, on the collective  will

of all those who call Singapore home.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not easy. If you are a Chinese from China, you

would  know who you are, 1,100 million of us.  If you were  a

Japanese  from  Japan, you know who you are,  one  race,  one

language,  one country and descended from the Sun Goddess  of

Amaterasu.  If you are an American, I think you also know who

you  are, the greatest nation on earth, a light unto nations,

a  city upon the hill, a certain history, idealism, a certain

collective  myth which defines your place in the world.   Who

are we?  Perhaps, we are a little red dot.  That is something

to  be  proud of.  Because we have achieved much together  to

get  here.  An earlier generation fought long odds  to  build

this  Singapore and our generation continues  to  face  major

challenges  as a nation, challenges which call for  a  strong

and  unified  response.  And I think we  can  all  feel  that

Singapore belongs to all of us and it is a result of all  our

efforts.   Now that we are almost a First World country,  not

quite but almost, that does not mean our challenge is over.

<br>1.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to show that this success was not just a

transient fluke but a solid achievement that we will  sustain

and build upon year after year.  And if we accept and believe

that, then I think we know who we are and what we need to do.

At  the same time, of course, we will have to feel it at  the

personal level because this is a globalised world, people can

travel  anywhere,  work  anywhere,  feel  comfortable  almost

anywhere  and  float with the waves.  But we need  to  anchor

ourselves here and remember the places where we grew up,  the

friends   we  went  to  school  with,  our  National  Service

comrades,  the  places we settled down  and  raised  our  own

families.  The Orchard Road wet market is gone - those of  Mr

Chiam's  generation and even my generation will remember  it.

The  younger  ones  will remember other places  in  Singapore

because  I  think  Singapore  is different  from  many  other

countries.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 726</b></font><br><br>

There  are many developed countries and we are almost one  of

them,  but  there is a certain atmosphere and spirit  to  the

place  which  we  will remember and associate  with.   It  is

partly  familiar landmarks and favourite local foods, but  it

is  also  memories and associations that link us to Singapore

which make us call this place home, no matter where we are.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to get Singaporeans to see this. It is a

generation  which has grown up in material affluence,  as  Mr

Ong  Ah Heng pointed out.  So their experience and focus  are

on material issues, not matters of life and death or national

survival.   Naturally, their perspectives and priorities  are

different.   But I think a Singapore identity is  developing:

whether it is the pride with which we celebrate National Day,

the  way  we stand up when confronted with prickly situations

around  us in the region - as has happened more than once  in

the  last  few  years  even at a time of peace  and  relative

stability  -  or the way we group together and reach  out  to

fellow  Singaporeans when we are working and  living  abroad.

Whether we go to Sydney, New York, London, Beijing or Mumbai,

we  will find there are Singaporeans there who have formed an

informal  network.   They celebrate our  festivals  together,

they  share common traditions and jokes, they speak the  same

language  (sometimes,  even  Singlish  helps  to  bring  them

together)  and  certain  cultural affinities,  and  they  are

maintaining  their links together with each  other  and  with

Singapore.   And provided we can do that, gradually,  we  can

strengthen this identity and say, "We are Singaporeans first,

and  Singapore Chinese, Malays or Indians second."   That  is

what we are aiming for.

<br><br><!-- Mr Davinder Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Davinder Singh (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, Singapore's

only  resource  is  its people.  Their quantity  and  quality

determine whether we can compete effectively.  Both are under

threat.   We  are not replacing ourselves, some of  our  best

brains  are  being  lured by the bright  lights  and  greener

pastures  in  other countries. The trend is not  encouraging.

As  our  resources are depleted, so our edge is  dulled.   We

need skills across the spectrum, from construction workers to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 727</b></font><br><br>

corporate leaders, from maids to managers.  Some perform jobs

which are shunned, others provide skills in short supply.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arguments for embracing foreign talent are

compelling.   Foreigners compensate for our numbers,  quality

and disinclination.  They inject fresh perspectives at a time

when  we badly need to challenge and change tried and  tested

paradigms.   They give us a profile which comforts investors.

The  Government  is  determined that its  policy  on  foreign

talent  succeeds.  It has introduced a slew of legal,  fiscal

and  infrastructural measures to make the environment talent-friendly.   The private sector is beginning to  respond,  but

there is still work to be done to overcome insecurities.  But

this  policy does not appear to have been targeted, certainly

not  with  equal  vigour, at the public sector.   Is  it  our

position  that sensitive issues are best dealt with by  those

with  a  stake  in  the  country, and  that  therefore,  that

justifies a special immunity for our public institutions?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two dimensions to the issue of sensitivity.

One, where the vital interests of the state are concerned and

two,  the  protection of confidential information.  But  both

can  be  addressed.  Highly sensitive portfolios can continue

to be manned by Singaporeans.  There is force in the argument

that only those who understand our vulnerabilities and have a

vested  stake  in the country can effectively deal  with  and

thwart  threats,  external and internal.  But  that  argument

cannot  be  made with the same degree of conviction  for  all

branches of the public service.  Why will there be a security

risk  if  a foreigner is employed, say, as a Deputy Secretary

in  the  Ministry of Education or the Ministry  of  Manpower?

After all, foreigners occupy sensitive financial positions in

the  Hong  Kong administration.  To be sure, non-Singaporeans

in   Government  will  have  access  to  highly  confidential

information,  but the safeguard is implicit  in  the  policy.

The people we want operate in the international arena.  Their

marketability depends on their integrity.  They of all

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 728</b></font><br><br>

people,  understand that their standing would be  irreparably

harmed if they act dishonourably.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, the private sector faces the same risks.

Confidential information is at a premium, particularly in the

areas  of  technology and the life sciences.  Leaks can  make

the   difference  between  success  and  failure.    In   the

international  market where we compete, indiscretion  can  be

highly inimical to the interests of Singapore Inc.  But  that

has  not  stopped our GLCs and major private sector companies

from  engaging the services of foreigners.  The fact  of  the

matter  is  that these people, whose track records  determine

their  fate in this global employment market, are  the  least

likely  to  behave badly.  If all else fails,  there  is  the

Official Secrets Act, no one who knows Singapore is under any

illusion about this Government's resolve to use it to  punish

and to make a point.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what of the argument that issues which affect the

country  are  best dealt with by those with a  stake  in  it?

Take  the case of the judiciary.  It is, on any view, a vital

public  institution.   In applying and  fashioning  the  law,

judges  have to be acutely aware of and sensitive  to,  local

customs  and  circumstances.   The  judiciary  is  constantly

confronted  with, and has to address, questions which  affect

our  national interests.  Instinctively, we are driven to the

conclusion that therefore only Singaporeans should be judges.

Yet, in 1981, the then Prime Minister told this House that if

he was not able to get men of quality to be judges, he would,

after  consultation,  advise the President  to  appoint  non-Singaporeans to the High Court Bench.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That statement effectively put paid to the notion that

Singapore's interests can only be advanced by Singaporeans or

that  we  will  necessarily be prejudiced if foreigners  hold

sensitive   posts.    Fidelity  is  not   the   preserve   of

Singaporeans.   In  any  case, the  risks,  if  any,  can  be

minimised  by  retaining  key  positions  for  our  citizens.

Ultimately,  it is a balancing exercise.  How heavily  should

these concerns weigh in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 729</b></font><br><br>

the  scale of relative merits?  Should foreigners be enlisted

to  help run our country?  The answer is that we really  have

little choice.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our private sector is already being sapped of some of

its  pep  by  emigration  and overseas  employment.   Foreign

talent  is  no  longer  available on  tap.   It  is  becoming

increasingly   difficult  to  fish  in  the   resource   rich

international waters.  Other countries have joined the  game.

They  are  offering all manner of incentives  to  retain  and

attract talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution is two-pronged: Continue to encourage

talented foreigners to spend some time in Singapore  and,  in

the  meantime, optimise the use of talent in the local  pool.

We  are  doing  the  first, but are we doing  enough  of  the

second?  Today, the best and brightest are drawn into  public

service  by  the  scholarship system.  That  means  that  the

private  sector  is  deprived  of  this  valuable  home-grown

resource.  Some do enter the private sector after serving out

their  bonds.  But they emerge as different people,  with  an

armoury  of  mindsets and instincts which may not necessarily

equip  them  for  the  rigours of the marketplace.   Our  top

students  match and sometimes beat the best  in  the  US  and

Japan.   But they lose that shine in the real world.  Has  it

anything  to do with what we do to our top graduates?   Other

countries have the numbers, so there is always enough  to  go

around.   In  Singapore, we do not have that luxury  and  are

forced  to allocate what is a scarce resource.  The  priority

has  always  been  to deploy our best in the public  service,

that   policy  has  served  us  well.   But  now   that   our

institutions  are in place, and it has become  imperative  to

energise the private sector, we should not continue to divert

the flow of quality away from the market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantages of having foreigners as public servants

are  real and substantial.  They can replace some of our best

brains who can be released to add fizz to the private sector.

The  foreigners  who  step  into their  shoes  will  bring  a

different  perspective to public policy issues.   Not  having

been brought up in the system,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 730</b></font><br><br>

they   may   not  feel  shackled  by  political  correctness.

Paradoxically, the fact that they will have less of  a  stake

may  work  to  our advantage.  They will feel less  inhibited

about  being  frank  and  open  in  their  discussions   with

policymakers,  and  candour cannot hurt  policy  formulation.

Any  misperception that our bureaucracy is a closed and  cozy

club  will  be eroded by an infusion of outsiders.   That  in

turn  will  generate greater confidence in the accountability

of  our  institutions.   It  is  surely  an  objective  worth

striving for.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, the employer

in  the  civil service is the Government.  At the same  time,

the  Government has a political face and a political role  in

making  rules.   And in that political role in making  rules,

the  Government  claims that it has a symbiotic  relationship

with  the unions.  And because of this peculiar situation  of

the  Government in the civil service, how people are  managed

in the civil service is also the model that is looked upon by

the  rest of society.  So it is important that the Government

has  the  right model and sets the right examples in managing

people in the civil service.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the Government has made some changes to the

management  of people in the civil service.  Ministries  have

been  decentralised with powers to manage their own personnel

matters.   These  are  good moves because  they  will  enable

Ministries to respond quickly to changes and make  them  more

effective to recruit, retain and develop people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the measures that the civil service has

introduced, such as changes in medical and other benefits, it

has  done  it fairly responsibly.  If we look at the  overall

report book, if we have to state, I think it will pass -  not

very  well,  but pass - because if we look at protection  for

employees,  etc,  they  have  done  well.   Is  there  social

dialogue?   Yes, there is.  Are people having a part  in  the

industrial relations structure?  Yes, they do, but more could

be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think one area of deficiency is in the implementation

of the Industrial Relations

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 731</b></font><br><br>

Act.   This  Act  is meant to provide for the  regulation  of

relations between employers and employees, and the prevention

and  settlement  of trade disputes by collective  bargaining,

conciliation and arbitration.  In the civil service, a  civil

servant has to be classified as an employee under this Act if

he  wants  to enjoy the benefits of the Industrial  Relations

Act,  and  it  has  to be declared by the President  for  the

purposes  of this Act.  If a civil servant is not  classified

as  an  employee for the purposes of the Industrial Relations

Act,  this  employee  does  not  have  access  to  collective

bargaining, conciliation or arbitration.  I am aware that the

President has declared Division IV and daily-rated employees,

clerks, nurses and a lot of others in Divisions I, II and III

as  employees.   But some of their job titles have  not  been

updated.   I am also aware that many a time, when  the  civil

service  reaches  an  agreement with the  unions,  they  have

points  of  agreement  and exchanges  of  letters.   However,

whenever  there  are  disagreements  on  these  exchanges  of

letters  or  points,  these are not enforceable  because  the

aggrieved  party  cannot  bring it  up  for  conciliation  or

arbitration.  So there is a weakness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what I am asking the Government to reconsider is:

on  the  one hand, it has a symbiotic relationship  with  the

unions  and  recognises their contributions, and we  all  say

positive  things  and there is a lot of support  at  national

level,  on  the other hand, there is also a need  to  promote

bipartite  relations in the civil service.  If  that  can  be

done, it would also help the civil service to be more attuned

like the private sector and respond quickly to changes.  This

can only be good for the civil service.  I ask the Government

to  review  this practice of classifying employees,  for  the

purpose of the Industrial Relations Act, and to set standards

which  are  equivalent  to that of a  private  and  statutory

board,  since for all things, you want to set the  benchmark.

Be a leader in industrial relations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I proceed to my next cut, Sir?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 732</b></font><br><br>

<br>1.45 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Can I urge hon. Members to be concise as

it  appears  that we may not be able to cover all the  topics

under this amendment.  All right, Mr Thomas.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> I will be very brief and cut down on

what I have to say.  On pensioners, during the debate on  the

Budget  Statement, four Members of this House  spoke  on  the

need  for  the Government to be more generous to  pensioners.

The  Minister's response was that the adjustments  more  than

cover  the  increase in cost of living and there  were  other

perks  for  pensioners.  I would like to say that  pensioners

are  people who worked hard in the past to contribute to  our

present prosperity.  In the past, we were told to tighten our

belts, make sacrifices and pensioners who were in that period

made  those sacrifices.  Those were the days when the budgets

were not generous, not so painless, but they made sacrifices.

Today's  impressive reserves that we have, the prosperity  we

have, all the good things that we have, were built up by  the

past.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to say that when you make pension

adjustments, do not just make adjustments on cost of  living.

We  also  have to take into account the standard  of  living.

Our  standard  of living changes, the things  that  were  not

relevant  then may still be applicable today.  And this  must

also be covered.  I am just saying that the 12,100 pensioners

deserve  more, and I hope the Government would  have  put  in

place  a mechanism which we can make periodic adjustments  to

pensions,  not  just once in many years, but more  frequently

and in more substantial and significant quantums.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, there has been

some  renewed  interest of late in the  possibility  of  more

women  being  fielded in the next general elections.   So  it

seems  like  a  good time to bring up the subject  of  better

representation for women.  May I state upfront that  this  is

not engineered as a means of hinting to the Prime Minister on

my availability.  In fact, I

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 733</b></font><br><br>

would  like  to  talk mainly about better  representation  of

women in non-political office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More women in Parliament is actually the far end of the

spectrum   of  better  representation  of  women  in   senior

positions  in  all  areas of public service  and  the  public

sector  and, in fact, in the private sector.  The  Government

has little to say in private sector companies' management and

governance  appointments.  But it is fully in charge  of  its

own  recruitment,  selection  and  appointment  processes  to

senior   positions  in  its  Ministries,  National   Advisory

Committees,  statutory boards and GLC boards.   We  have,  to

date,  one  woman Permanent Secretary, one  woman  CEO  of  a

statutory  board and 8% representation of women on  both  the

statutory  boards and the GLC boards.  I think in  Singapore,

in  this IT day and age, we can do considerably better.   Let

me  say that I am, by no means, asking for quotas to forcibly

inject  women into positions they are not competent to  fill,

or to ask for any deviation from our policies of meritocracy.

There  are enough competent women in Singapore out  there  to

more than adequately fill significantly more than those 8% of

board positions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that, firstly, many of our good women out

there  keep  a  very  low public profile.  Secondly,  current

senior  management, being largely filled by  men,  the  names

that  first  come to their minds, when vacancies open  up  at

senior levels, are those of people they associate with,  went

to  school  with,  did NS with, played  golf  with,  and  are

generally comfortable with.  All men, of course.  There is no

malice  in  this.   This is just the natural  consequence  of

historical circumstance.  But what is needed, therefore, is a

much  more  deliberate effort to search for women  candidates

for  every  vacancy and conscious effort  to  look  out  for,

recognise  and  overcome traditional biases in the  selection

process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly, as the Senior Parliamentary Secretary for

MCDS,  Mrs  Yu-Foo  Yee Shoon observed  at  an  International

Women's Day event last week, women must also play their  part

and be willing to step forward to grasp opportunities that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 734</b></font><br><br>

do  present themselves.  But in this instance, talking  about

board positions and not about political office, I expect that

they  would  not  be  averse to respond  positively  to  such

opportunities.  Australia has some interesting experiences to

share.   Australia has 24% of women in their Parliament,  and

30%  women on Government boards and bodies.  It has  achieved

this  through a concerted effort to put more women in  senior

positions, including an early warning system which identifies

high   calibre  women  candidates  early  in  board   vacancy

processes,  and  in an executive search programme  for  women

participation   on  these  boards.   Their  experience   also

indicates that simply having a register or a list of names of

suitable  women  is  not  enough to make  a  difference.   It

requires a conscious push  from the Minister in charge of the

respective agencies to result in significant increased female

appointments.   Indeed, in the past, some  women  groups  and

individuals have submitted lists of names but they  have  had

little  subsequent feedback on whether they were put  to  any

use.  Indeed, the Business Times published a list of some 200

names  on  International Women's Day in 1998, but we  do  not

know  if anyone, with decision-making authority, gave it more

than  a cursory glance.  In our current environment, when  we

are  constantly reminded of the need for diversity of  ideas,

views  and perspectives, and of the need for talent,  to  the

extent  that  we  scour  the  world  for  it,  surely  it  is

worthwhile to expend some additional effort to ensure that we

are  fully  mining  the  human resource  and  potential  that

resides in a whole half of our own population.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, before I end, some quick short words on women

in  politics.  I have just two quick suggestions to  make  on

increasing   the   participation  of  women  in   Parliament.

Firstly,  to  avoid the triple whammy for  women  of  family,

career  and  politics,  besides the extended  search  now  to

include  single  women, who presumably  would  have  to  deal

largely  with  career and politics, why  not  homemakers  who

would  have  only family and politics on their plate?   There

are  many able women who have opted to be homemakers and they

should not be dismissed in considering

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 735</b></font><br><br>

candidates.   In  fact,  I believe  Dr  Aline  Wong,  in  her

capacity as Chair of the PAP Women Wing, had already made the

suggestion a couple of years ago.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, more efforts should be directed to persuading

women  to participate through the NMP scheme.  The commitment

is  for two years only, in the first instance, and there  are

no  constituency  responsibilities.  If  the  difficulty  for

women  is in the juggling of responsibilities, it will surely

be less difficult to persuade them to make that commitment in

this case.  Possibly not more effort has been made to recruit

more  women NMPs because of the ambivalence that even Members

of  the  ruling  party have with regard to the  scheme.   But

since  the  scheme exists and has been found to be useful  in

the  past  10 years, why not use it to even better effect  to

bring  more women into the political arena?  Look  for  women

architects, women accountants, businesswomen, women  unionist

who will not only represent their professions or sectors, but

would  also  bring diversity of more women's views  into  the

discussions in this Chamber.  I hope the Prime Minister  will

give consideration to my suggestions.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I rise to speak on entrenching the

Elected Presidency.  This is an important issue, but  as  you

have instructed, I shall try to keep it very brief.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singaporeans have voted for the Elected Presidency

and  more  now  understand  the  scheme.   Yet,  the  Elected

President  is  not  entrenched in our  Constitution.  Article

5(2A)  would potentially make the Elected President's  office

powers subject to a public referendum, if it is to be removed

or  reduced, unless the Elected President agrees.   But  this

provision  is still not in force.  It has been suspended  and

at present, Parliament could remove the Elected Presidency by

simply  amending  the  Constitution by  two-thirds  majority,

which is quite easily obtainable by the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My second point, Sir, is that we have fine-tuned the

Elected  Presidency  in  this last year.   We  have  come  to

agreement on

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 736</b></font><br><br>

a  White Paper on the reserves.  We have also now come to  an

understanding about the Net Investment Income (NII).  As  all

this  has  been done, it is not clear to me what  else  would

need  to  be done to complete the fine-tuning of the  Elected

Presidency.   It is now some 10 years and we are  now  having

the second Elected President in that office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My third point is, with the coming of general elections

in  the  next  year or so, this would be a timely  moment  to

consider  entrenching the Elected Presidency and I hope  that

the  Prime  Minister's Office will study the issue fully  and

consider it before the general elections.

<br><br><!-- Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam (Non-Constituency Member):</b> Sir, I

have two amendments. May I take them together?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> No, you will proceed with this one on

Altered  Designation of President's Wife,  because  Mr  Chiam

comes after you.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> As you please. This cut is prompted by

the  announcement  some time ago that  the  President's  wife

should  not be referred to as the First Lady, but simply  as,

what  is her name, Mrs Nathan.  I was puzzled by this  sudden

change  in  this  designation. Then, there was,  accompanying

this announcement, an explanation, I believe, by the Ministry

of  Law  that  it was not right for her to be styled  as  the

First Lady because we do not have an Executive President.  So

I  asked myself: what were we doing - was it two years ago or

more - when we amended the Constitution to give the President

certain executive powers?  Were we just playing a game?   And

he  is  now  to  be  told that he is no longer  an  Executive

President but simply a ceremonial President holding office as

a ceremonial figure?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May we know why this change in the designation has been

announced?   May  I  know,  is  it  the  intention  that  the

President  will no longer exercise any executive powers,  and

all executive powers which were given to him have now been de

facto  taken away from him?  May we have an answer  to  that?

Were  not  the spouses of the previous Presidents  before  we

made

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 737</b></font><br><br>

this change, addressed to as the First Lady?  I would like to

be  told  that I am wrong that they were not.  Could we  have

some  rational  explanation for this  sudden  change  in  the

designation of the President's wife?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I fully agree with Mr Davinder

Singh  that the public sector, as well as the private sector,

ought  to  make  full use of foreign talent.   I  am  not  as

sanguine as he is that we have foreign talent then we can  do

with  fewer scholars and they can go forth and do great deeds

in  the  private sector.  I think we should bring in as  many

talented  people as we can into the public sector as possible

and that includes foreign talent in all suitable professions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can do more to attract them and they can contribute

to  our public sector organisations without compromising  our

vital  interest.  There are certain areas which  we  have  to

keep  as  a responsibility of citizens.  Defence and  foreign

policies  are  obviously two of them.  Some  other  areas  of

social  and  economic  policies  are  politically  sensitive.

Take,  for  example,  education.  It is  a  professional  and

technical  matter, but it is also a political issue,  and  to

make those recommendations for decisions which affect tens or

hundreds of thousands of pupils, I think you have to  have  a

feel  for Singapore which mostly Singaporeans only will have.

But  beyond  these areas, the public sector  adopts  an  open

attitude  towards foreign talent.  So we can find  foreigners

teaching   in  our  schools  and  universities,  working   as

policemen and prison officers, and in the civil defence.   We

also  have architects and technical officers in HDB,  nursing

officers  in our hospitals, and IT specialists  in  IDA.   In

fact, IDA has a very multi-national team.  They have gone out

to   recruit,  because  we  do  not  have  enough   qualified

Singaporeans    to   staff   IDA.    And   without    foreign

professionals, we would not be able to set up the outfit.

<br>2.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, with other statutory boards too. GIC, for

example, which manages our reserves.  We have found  ways  to

bring

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 738</b></font><br><br>

in  substantial  numbers  of  foreign  people   -   analysts,

traders, managers of the particular funds  - who can  fit  in

and   strengthen  our  team.   And  even  our  policy-related

statutory boards, like MAS, EDB and NSTB, are recruiting from

outside  Singapore, and some of them have substantial numbers

of  foreign  non-Singaporeans.   EDB,  for  example,  has   a

significant number of non-Singaporeans, but they work  as  an

EDB  team,  and  they promote Singapore as fervently  and  as

vigorously as the Singaporeans.  In fact, they give us a  run

for our money.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So too with NSTB, which has people from Malaysia, the US

and  the  UK.  And in the case of MAS, recently, we recruited

somebody  - I think she is an Australian.  So if  you  see  a

Caucasian  face  when  you  visit  MAS,  please  do  not   be

surprised.  It is still the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the longer term, when we bring in people, we

would  like to induct them and make them citizens, and  then,

eventually,  they become part of our team.  And  so  if  they

rise  up  and  reach  the  top, at  the  core,  as  Permanent

Secretaries, as Judges, as the Attorney-General, we have them

as  Singaporeans,  but  actually we  know  they  had  foreign

origins.   So  our Chief Statistician, Paul Cheung,  is  from

Hong Kong.  The Permanent Secretary in MTI, Khaw Boon Wan, is

from  Malaysia.   Many  of  our  Judges  are  from  overseas,

including  the Chief Justice as well as the Attorney-General.

But  they have become Singaporeans and they are part  of  our

team.   I  think that is the approach we should take -  bring

them  in, integrate them, as part of our team.  And  for  the

best  of them, most committed, encourage them to be citizens,

and then they rise up in our core group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas asked about the Government as an

employer  and about bringing public officers under the  ambit

of  the  Industrial Relations Act for their  benefit.   Civil

servants covered under collective agreements include Division

IV  officers and daily-rated employees.  As I told Parliament

in   1997,   although  officers  in  the  other   grades   of

appointments  are not covered under the Industrial  Relations

Act for the purposes of collective

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 739</b></font><br><br>

bargaining,  the  civil  service has  allowed  all  officers,

including  those in Division I, to join unions,  unless  they

are  in  the  uniformed services, or if they are  members  of

personnel boards with personnel responsibilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service aims to be a model employer. It is

not  for  us  to grade ourselves, and I am grateful  that  Mr

Thomas  has given us a pass, albeit not a very good one.   We

will  work harder to try and merit a higher grade next  year.

Regardless  of  whether  officers  are  covered   under   any

collective  agreements, the civil service has  been  fair  in

settling their terms of employment  -  salaries, progression,

benefits,  etc.  And we regularly review terms and conditions

of service against the private sector.  Had the civil service

not  done so, it could not have retained and attracted people

to join the service in a full employment economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The civil service has also tried to be responsible in

dealing  with  other  labour management issues.   The  Public

Service  Division takes seriously requests to  review  policy

rulings that have adversely affected individuals or groups of

staff.  PSD adopts a consultative approach when working  with

unions  to  address  their  concerns.   And  besides  regular

meetings between the Ministries and the unions, PSD and  NTUC

have  held several joint management and union gatherings over

the past few years.  PSD also meets the Amalgamated Union  of

Public  Employees  (AUPE)  regularly  to  discuss  issues  of

concern  to  both sides.  And I am happy to  say  that  their

relations are good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand the NMP's perspective, because

collective  bargaining  is one of the  traditional  roles  of

trade  unions, and that is what unions exist for  -  to  push

for a better deal from your employer.  But today's employment

environment has changed.  Union members are better  educated,

the  labour  market  is tight, and for  both  businesses  and

Government,  flexibility  is  crucial,  to  enable  them   to

reorganise and adapt to rapidly changing business conditions.

Trade unions still

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 740</b></font><br><br>

play  a crucial role in organising workers and looking  after

their  welfare, but collective bargaining is often no  longer

their  main priority.  Collective bargaining will remain  the

best way to look after the interests of the less skilled, but

not  so  of the better educated.  As the current arrangements

in  the civil service are working well, I think we should not

change  them without careful study.  But we will look  at  it

from time to time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for pensions, Mr Thomas Thomas knows the position.

We  calculate  pensions  based on  an  officer's  last  drawn

salary.  Our philosophy has been, first, that pension is  not

indexed  to cost of living.  It is what you retired  with  in

fixed  dollar sums, and the Government will try to  keep  the

inflation  rate  low.  Secondly, it is  pegged  to  what  you

earned when you were in service  -  last three years' average

of  drawn pay, rather than continuing to rise either with the

salaries  in  the  general  economy  or  with  civil  service

salaries.   Had  we  not done that, I  think  we  would  have

imposed  a heavy burden on future governments, and  it  would

have  become  a burden, which would have become  increasingly

difficult to bear, as the population grows older, and as  the

population of pensioners increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we chose this. It is not indexed. It is not

pegged to the cost of living, still less is it pegged to  the

standard  of  living.  In fact, I think there  are  very  few

countries in the world which peg pensions to the standard  of

living.   And those which have done so have found it quite  a

problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have done has been to revise salaries so that

officers in service are paid properly, including full CPF  in

most  cases now, and it is for them with their CPF to provide

for  their  post-retirement pension  needs.   For  those  who

retired  early,  we have, from time to time, made  ex  gratia

payments to them, as the Singapore economy has prospered  and

as  our  surpluses have accumulated.  We did so in 1996  when

the Government awarded ex gratia payments of between 6-13 1/2

months of pension to those who retired

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 741</b></font><br><br>

before  1st  January  1982, which was  before  salaries  were

substantially revised.  And we did the same again last  year,

in August, when the Prime Minister, in his National Day Rally

Speech,  declared another ex gratia pay of about $16  million

to  retired MPs, office holders and pensioners.  Sir, I think

they have been looked after.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, can I take the question from Mr Jeyaretnam on the

First Lady, because it is important to clear the matter?  The

First  Lady  is  not a position enshrined  in  the  Singapore

Constitution.    It  is  a  courtesy  term  that   has   been

customarily  used  for  the wife of the President,  including

previous  Presidents,  before  the  Elected  Presidency   was

created.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When President Nathan assumed office, he indicated that

his  wife would prefer to be addressed as Mrs Nathan,  so  as

not  to create the impression that she is holding an official

position.   However,  since the term has  been  in  customary

usage, President Nathan said that she was also comfortable to

be informally addressed as the First Lady by those who prefer

to do so.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the Constitution does not provide for the

position of the First Lady, and the President's wife holds no

official  appointment, she should continue to enjoy,  and  be

accorded,  the courtesies, decorum and respect befitting  the

spouse  of  the  person occupying the highest Office  of  the

land.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Elected Presidency, the constitutional

position  is  quite  clear.   We do  not  have  an  Executive

Presidency.  We never had.  We have an Elected President with

custodial  powers.  And if the Member will read the  Hansard,

he  will know exactly what the position is.  Even if he reads

the  Constitution,  the  President does  not  have  executive

powers.  He has custodial powers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Simon Tay asked when we will entrench Article

5(2A)   of   the  Constitution,  and  entrench  the   Elected

Presidency.  It is something which we have not forgotten.  We

have not done it yet, because, although 10 years have passed,

we are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 742</b></font><br><br>

still   refining  the  precise  provisions  of  the   Elected

Presidency.  We settled the White Paper in 1999.  Last  year,

we  made  amendments on the definition of "NII", which  is  a

major amendment.  So I think we have to let some time pass to

see  how  these  work out.  We are now on the second  Elected

President,  the third if you count Mr Wee Kim Wee.   I  think

that  if  in  five or 10 years' time, we have  not  made  any

further  major changes to the structure, we will be ready  to

entrench it.  But having just made the changes last year, let

us see how the NII provisions work out.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we first went into this and first brought the

provisions  into  effect, we did not understand  all  of  the

implications.   It took us many years to work out  the  White

Paper.  We now have the White Paper.  We have worked out  the

NII.   Therefore,  the White Paper will need some  revisions,

which  are  presently being done.  Let us see how these  work

out.  Hopefully, they will work out well, and we will look at

the problem again in about a term's time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for women MPs and women statutory board members, I

agree with Dr Jennifer Lee that we should have many more,  if

we  can,  on statutory boards and in Parliament.  It  is  not

easy,  because we go on merit, and we have to  look  for  the

people and we have to look for individuals.  If we went for a

quota,  of course, we can just fill the numbers.  But  if  we

can  find more, we will gladly do so.  And if the Member  has

some  names,  let us have them, and I promise her  that  they

will receive more than cursory attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for NMPs being housewives or home-makers, there is no

ambivalence about the NMP scheme.  It is in the Constitution.

We  believe they have made valuable contributions.   We  have

had  NMPs, men and women, who have done good work and  really

outshone many of the Opposition MPs.  And if we can find some

more,  capable men and women, we would like to do so.   Under

the  Constitution,  the nominees must be  "persons  who  have

rendered  distinguished public service, or who  have  brought

honour  to the Republic, or who have distinguished themselves

in the field of arts and letters,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 743</b></font><br><br>

culture,  the  sciences, business, industry, the professions,

social or community service, or the labour movement".  It  is

a  wide  range of fields where you can distinguish  yourself.

It  does not mean that you have to be presently working.   If

anybody  knows of women who happen not to be working but  who

meet  these criteria, I hope they will put them up  the  next

time Parliament invites nominations for NMPs, and the Special

Select Committee will consider them seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I should, overall, point out that this is a problem

which  is  very  unlikely  to be  easily  solved.   Even  the

European  countries,  which have tried very  hard,  have  not

succeeded  in equalising the sex balance in Parliament.   The

British,  which  have a record 120 women in  Parliament,  who

came  in with the Labour Party this time, and some call  them

the  "Blair  babes", are worried that in the next Parliament,

the  number will go down again.  Because if they look at  the

candidates  who  are  coming  up  to  stand  for   the   next

Parliament, less than a quarter of the candidates are  women.

So  you  already know from the candidates that  you  are  not

going  to  get enough.  And they have studied other  European

countries    -   this  is  the  British  Equal  Opportunities

Commission - and they have found that quotas finally were the

most  effective way to get the numbers in.  And now they  are

proposing  to  change the law to ensure that more  women  are

represented in Parliament.  In other words, to change the law

to  institute  quotas, so that you make  sure  you  have  the

women.    And  the  Chairwoman  of  the  Equal  Opportunities

Commission  -  I do not know why it is not the Chairman,  but

it  is  the Chairwoman  - Julie Mellor said, "This new  study

backs  up the Equal Opportunities Commission's view that  the

law must be changed so that political parties are in no doubt

that  they  can use special measures to boost the  number  of

women  they select."  This was from BBC News, Saturday,  10th

March  2001, on the website.  I am sure the Member would  not

recommend  us to use special measures.  But short of  special

measures, we will do everything we can.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 744</b></font><br><br>

<br>2.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong:</b> Sir, there was a call for more women

MPs in Parliament, but I hope that there should be an equally

strong call for more Opposition MPs in Parliament.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are no Queensberry rules in our elections,

neither  is  there  a level playing field.  The  Opposition's

greatest  fear  is  the  practice  of  gerrymandering.    The

Opposition  may work hard between the elections.   All  their

efforts   come  to  nought  if  at  the  last   minute,   the

constituency they have been concentrating all their effort on

is  suddenly taken away.  An example in point is the  single-seat  constituency  of  Braddell  Heights.   In  the  general

elections of 1991, the Opposition obtained about 48%  of  the

valid votes cast in that constituency.  Suddenly, in the 1997

general elections, Braddell Heights' boundary was redrawn  to

make  it  part  of  Marine Parade GRC, which  has  no  common

boundary   with   Braddell   Heights.    So   that   is   how

gerrymandering works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we want to have a fair and democratic election,

the  present  rules should be either altered or  changed.   I

want  to suggest that should the Government intend to  change

the  boundary lines of any constituency, they should give  at

least  one  year's  notice,  so  as  to  give  time  for  the

Opposition to organise themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, broadcasting time should also be given to every

political  party that takes part in an election, rather  than

by number.  I believe currently it is half-a-minute for every

eight candidates.  But many of the Opposition parties do  not

even have that number and are deprived of broadcast time.  So

I  think every party that takes part in an election should be

given maybe half a minute of broadcast time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the election date also should be announced at least

two   months  before  the  elections,  rather  than  to  keep

everybody guessing.  I think announcing the election date  is

nothing  new.   This has been announced in almost  all  other

countries, and I think the Americans have fixed the  date  of

4th November as the election date.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 745</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the deposit, I think it should be reduced by one-half. I believe at the moment, it is $8,000. It should be

reduced  to  $4,000.  There is no reason to fix  or  peg  the

election deposit so high as to keep a lot of people away from

taking part in a democratic process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, I think this GRC is definitely incongruous

as far as elections are concerned.  You are having four, five

or  six  candidates all at one go, and a voter will  have  to

vote  six candidates.  He might like only two of them and  he

is  forced to cast his vote for the other four.  This is very

undemocratic,  because he does not want  the  other  four  to

represent  him and yet he is forced to vote them  in.   Also,

GRCs  are very communal in nature.  I think it should not  be

continued.  At every election, the ethnic candidate will have

to  go  and  declare  himself before  an  Election  Committee

whether  he is an Indian or a Malay.  This is very  demeaning

to  our Singaporeans.  If he is a Singaporean, why should  he

declare himself a Malay or an Indian before he can take  part

in  an  election?   He  should  just  simply  say,  "I  am  a

Singaporean.  I have a right to take part."  But he  has  got

no such rights in a GRC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the element of surprise on the Opposition should be

removed.  If the Government has done its work properly, as it

claims  it  has, then it should be confident  of  itself  and

there  is  no need to spring surprises on the Opposition.   I

assume  at this election, there should be no surprises sprang

on the Opposition.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam, you did mention earlier

that you do not have much to say.  So I presume you will make

it short.

<br><br><!-- Mr Jeyaretnam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam:</b> Sir, I shall be short when it comes to

these things.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the first time I have raised this question of

a  Members' Register, and the answer I have got is, "Oh,  the

Prime  Minister knows.  He keeps it locked up in  his  heart,

and  that's  good enough."  Was it in the last  National  Day

Rally speech by the Prime Minister or some other speech,  the

Prime  Minister  was  saying that entering  politics  is  the

highest form of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 746</b></font><br><br>

public  service.  I laughed when I saw that.  And I  posed  a

question and we have never had any reply to it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We keep constantly talking about how transparent

Singapore is.  Everything is transparent and yet nobody is to

know  the  interests and the possessions of people who  enter

into  politics and become Members of Parliament, and how they

are doing.  This is something which is observed in almost all

countries.   Why  is  it  that we who make  so  much  trumpet

blowing about how transparent, how accountable we are, cannot

have  a  Members' Register, showing exactly what the Members'

interests are or the interests of their spouses are, so  that

we  do know whether they come into politics because of public

service or anything else?

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Wong Kan Seng):</b> Sir,

on  behalf of the Prime Minister.  Mr Chiam has made  several

points which I am sure if you have ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this juncture -

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jeyaretnam</b> left the Chamber.

<br><br><!-- Mr Wong Kan Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Wong Kan Seng:</b> Mr Jeyaretnam is not interested in my

answer.  He has already heard the answer before.  So he  just

raised it perfunctorily.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, we come back to Mr Chiam who has raised some

very  serious  points.   Mr Chiam made  a  number  of  points

concerning redrawing of boundaries, new rules being  set  up,

broadcasting time, election deposit, and so on.  As he knows,

all countries redraw the boundaries from time to time, and  I

do  not believe that we call them gerrymandering.  Boundaries

are  redrawn  because population shifts and  the  pattern  of

residents moving into new housing estates also shifts.  So we

have   to  take  that  into  account  and  provide  for   new

constituencies or regrouping of constituencies, and  that  is

done  quite regularly and there is no surprise about it.   Of

course,  Mr Chiam would like to be told way back in  advance,

as  he says, a year in advance, when boundaries change.   But

unfortunately  the Election Boundaries Delineation  Committee

does  not sit so far ahead, as Mr Chiam would wish.   But  if

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 747</b></font><br><br>

Committee  sits  and the report is completed, and  eventually

the report is submitted to Parliament, he can take a look  at

it,  and  that  is when he can start to prepare  the  ground.

Whether  the  party has enough time to go to the  ground  and

contest or not, much depends very much on what the party  has

been doing during the period when there is no election.   The

party need not wait till election in order to go and find out

about  the ground, know what is going on the ground, or  even

cultivate the ground.  He needs to have enough people  to  do

that.   And  if  he wants to zero in on a certain  number  of

constituencies,  by all means do that.  If he  looks  at  the

pattern  in the past years, some constituencies are contested

and some may not be.  So I think he has got to work very hard

to find the right kind of constituencies to contest.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On election deposit, the deposit is set at 8% of the

total  MPs'  allowance for the year, which,  I  believe,  now

works out to between $11,000 and $13,000.  And that is not  a

large  sum  of  money.  If a candidate is able  to  get  one-eighth, about 12% of the votes, he can get his deposit  back.

So  in  a  very unlikely event that a candidate  just  simply

takes  the gamble and hopes to be elected and only gets  less

than the required percentage to reclaim his deposit, then  he

has taken the gamble and lost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the GRC being undemocratic and communal, I do not

believe  so.  This had been fully explained at the time  when

we  had GRCs, and we had gone to the Select Committee.   GRCs

have been in place since the elections in 1988.  I believe Mr

Chiam  went to talk to some students recently and they raised

the  same point.  And some students asked him, "Mr Chiam,  we

have  heard all this before.  Haven't you got something  else

more or new to say?"  Well, I do not know what he said.   But

I believe that he must have said something.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On broadcasting time, broadcasting times must be

proportionate  to  the number of candidates  that  the  party

fields.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 748</b></font><br><br>

It  is  definitely not a level playing field if  he  says  he

fields one candidate and he is entitled to the same amount of

time  as  the  one that fields 83 candidates.   That  is  not

level.   That  is  very unequal indeed.  So the  policy  will

remain as far as the broadcasting time is concerned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Chiam has asked that we do not spring any surprise on

him.   Let me tell him something in advance so that he  would

not be surprised.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take this opportunity to inform the

House   that  from  the  next  general  election,  a  central

announcement system would be implemented.  There will also be

separate   assembly   centres  for   candidates   and   their

supporters.   This is different from the previous arrangement

that  candidates and their supporters gather at the  counting

centres  to  hear  the  announcement  of  results.   In  past

elections,  even  though  the  announcement  of  results  was

broadcast  live  over radio and television, large  crowds  of

supporters  of  contending  parties  still  gathered  at  the

announcement  centres  to hear the results  being  announced.

The  atmosphere  of such gathering can be very  tense.   Some

troublemakers  appeared and taunted the  candidates  and  the

supporters from the opposite camp.  Such behaviour can  spark

off  major  law and order problems.  Although there  were  no

arrests  at  announcement centres in  recent  elections,  the

potential for a situation in such gatherings to escalate  and

turn ugly is very real.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the last general election, the crowd atmosphere was

particularly  tense at the Bishan-ITE where  the  result  for

Cheng  San  GRC  was  announced.   It  was  thus  prudent  to

designate  a  central announcement centre and  have  separate

gathering  points for different political  parties.   Let  me

explain how this central announcement centre works.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the coming elections, the results will be announced

and  broadcast live by the Returning Officer over  radio  and

television from a centralised announcement centre,  and  that

is  likely  to  be at the Elections Department.   Apart  from

simplicity, this will avoid the problem arising from having

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 749</b></font><br><br>

supporters of different political parties congregating at the

announcement centre.  Centralised announcement of results  is

already  practised in countries such as Thailand, Hong  Kong,

Australia and Germany.  However, in most countries, there are

no  designated  places for contesting parties to  congregate.

Usually, the contesting parties will gather at the respective

headquarters or at a large hotel ballroom.  In Australia, for

example,  the results are transmitted via computers from  the

ground,  and  are  placed  in  the  National  Tally  Room  in

Canberra.   The TV network covers the results live  from  the

National  Tally Room.  Some MPs gather at the National  Tally

Room  while others gather at a large hotel ballroom to  await

the  results.   In  the  United States, the  announcement  of

results  is  decentralised.   However,  the  main  points  of

congregation for the candidates and the supporters are at the

campaign headquarters or at a hotel ballroom or the party HQ.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the public will not be allowed into the

central announcement centre.  Contesting candidates will also

not  be  allowed into the central announcement centre because

their supporters are likely to congregate at the vicinity  of

the  central announcement centre if the candidate  is  there.

However, the media will be allowed to be present to cover the

results when they are announced.  Before the announcement  is

made  publicly, the candidates would be told of  the  result.

They can then get themselves ready to meet the supporters  at

the  assembly  centre  and thank  them.   This  is  the  same

practice as in the past.

<br>2.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain how the assembly centre works. Separate

assembly  centres  will be allocated to  different  political

parties  with  the  contending groups of the  candidates  and

supporters physically separated from each other.  The risk of

potential  conflict  will  be  reduced.   Supporters  of  the

candidate  will  also have a safer place to gather.   Several

electoral  divisions will be grouped together  into  a  zone.

The  number  of zones will depend on the number of contesting

candidates  and  will  be determined  after  Nomination  Day.

Within each

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 750</b></font><br><br>

zone, each contesting independent candidate or party will  be

allocated one assembly centre, irrespective of the number  of

electoral  divisions  in the zone being  contested  by  them.

More details will be announced at the general election.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Mr Jeyaretnam is not here to listen to this. But

having   made  the  point,  I  should  reply  to  his  point.

Otherwise,  the  House would be left with no  answer  to  the

question  raised.  This is not the first time  Mr  Jeyaretnam

raised  it.  I do not think it will be the last time too,  if

he  remains in the House or continues to remain in the House.

The  reasons  why  we do not need such a register  have  been

stated  before  and  I  will  just  reiterate  very  quickly.

Firstly,   Mr  Jeyaretnam's  proposal  does  not  necessarily

contribute to a clean government and uncorrupt practices.  It

will  not  stop  corrupt practices if an  MP  chooses  to  be

corrupt.   An  MP  who is corrupt will not  openly  list  his

corrupt  things in the declaration.  So apart from satisfying

the  curiosity of some people, this will not help to maintain

a  clean government.  Indeed, Mr Jeyaretnam must have thought

of  this  practice  because it was practised  in  the  United

Kingdom.  The British have such a system in 1974.  But we all

know  by  1994,  there  was  a  large  number  of  complaints

concerning  the sleaze problems of the MP.  As a result,  the

Prime  Minister  had to set up a committee  on  standards  in

public  life  to  oversee the conduct of  holders  of  public

office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Singapore, our practice has always been that there is

a  code  of  conduct for the Ministers and the office-holders

and  each  Minister or office-holder is required  to  file  a

declaration  of  his  assets to the  Prime  Minister  at  the

beginning of each term.  And so the Prime Minister knows what

each  office-holder owns and the Prime Minister does not keep

this to his chest, as Mr Jeyaretnam said.  The Prime Minister

shows  that  list  to the President.  So  when  there  is  an

allegation  of  misconduct, the declaration  would  form  the

basis for an investigation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, all PAP MPs are also required to declare their

income  to  the Prime Minister, even though they are  not  in

charge of any

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 751</b></font><br><br>

Ministry or policy.  This system is instituted by the PAP and

I do not know whether the Workers' Party has a similar system

to  require  its  MPs to declare their assets  to  their  own

leaders.  If not, then he should firstly put his own house in

order.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, if we have such a register, it would only

intrude  on  the  personal privacy of members  unnecessarily.

Already,  it  is  quite difficult for us  to  get  people  to

contest and, doing so, would simply dissuade such people from

coming forward.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I would like to thank the

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head N of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the past few years, the Government, through

the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has systematically

reviewed  the  scope  of  financial services  that  Singapore

should  be  offering against the role and expertise  of  both

existing   and  potential  players,  namely,  the   financial

institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the MAS has not shied away from making bold and

sweeping  changes, such as the liberalisation of the banking,

securities and insurance sectors.  To MAS' credit,  this  has

not   gone  unnoticed  by  foreign  market  participants  and

investors.   Not  unlike  the  experiences  at  other   major

financial centres, the regulatory

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 752</b></font><br><br>

changes  are  usually accompanied by wide scale consolidation

of industry players.  Examples abound such as the merger of J

P  Morgan and Chase, or closer to home, the merger of  Keppel

and TatLee Banks and of DBS Securities and Vickers Ballas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this context, I would like to ask the Minister

to  redefine  the role of finance companies  in  our  overall

vision to be a major financial centre.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in December 1998, the MAS indicated that it would

be  reviewing rules to allow better-managed finance companies

more leeway in managing their risks, but without compromising

prudential  standards.   This was  fleshed  out  in  part  as

permission for finance companies to install ATMs in May 2000.

Subsequently,  the better-capitalised ones  were  allowed  to

offer financing for IPOs and to extend unsecured loans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the statistics on loans extended by finance

companies appear to point to an erosion in market share as  a

whole, especially of housing loans.  The only bright spot has

been car loans, which were boosted by the spike in the number

of COEs in Year 2000.  Given the fewer COEs to be handed out,

the demand can be expected to drop in tandem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three of our local banks, DBS, OCBC and UOB have already

absorbed  their  finance  companies into  the  parent  banks'

operations.   This  is  not  surprising  at  all   from   the

perspective  of  optimising capital resources.   As  of  now,

there  are 11 finance companies, several of whom are  family-owned  and  very  small,  having assets  of  less  than  $100

million.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to also ask the Minister whether

the  Government will help facilitate a consolidation of these

less well-managed or small capitalised finance companies.  If

there are shareholders who wish to exit the business but have

been unable to find a buyer, can the MAS assist in any way?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, finance companies have

complemented  banks  as  financial intermediaries,  servicing

small and medium enterprises and small retail

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 753</b></font><br><br>

customers.   They  generally offer higher interest  rates  on

fixed  deposits  than  the banks.  They offer  more  personal

service  to customers, and some older Singaporeans  are  more

comfortable placing their FDs with finance companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finance companies have been active lenders to small and

medium enterprises and in the housing loans and hire purchase

markets.   Their  assets grew from $400 million  in  1968  to

around  $22  billion in 1997.  But, as Mrs Lim has  observed,

over  the  last few years, the finance company  industry  has

been   in  decline.   They  face  growing  competition   from

commercial  banks, both local and foreign.  Since  1997,  the

total  assets of finance companies have fallen by  11%.   The

share  of  the Singapore Dollar non-bank deposit  market  has

shrunk  from  11.3%  back in 1997 to 7.4%  today.   This  has

prompted mergers among finance companies, and between finance

companies  and banks.  Several finance companies have  either

given  up  their licences or gone into voluntary liquidation.

In  1998, there were 31 finance companies.  Today, there  are

only 11 and we expect this rationalisation to continue.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim asked if MAS will facilitate the consolidation

or  exit of the smaller finance companies.  Consolidation  in

industry is not a new development and has been ongoing  since

the  1980s.   MAS  has  consulted closely  with  the  finance

companies  to ensure minimum disruption to customers  and  to

the  industry.  We have allowed the finance companies  to  be

merged   with  well-run  financial  institutions  that   have

demonstrated  the  ability to carry on the business,  as  the

purpose  of  the  merger  must be to  result  in  a  stronger

institution.  In practice, this has so far meant mergers with

banks and other finance companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should recognise the basic distinction between

finance  companies  and banks.  Banks  have  to  meet  higher

capital  requirements  and prudential standards.   They  also

have  larger and stronger management teams.  Because  finance

companies  do  not  meet these requirements,  they  are  only

permitted  to  undertake a more limited range of  activities.

For

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 754</b></font><br><br>

example,  they may not provide cheque accounts  or  establish

off-site   ATMs,  unlike  banks.   This  is   why   MAS   has

reservations about allowing finance companies to be  absorbed

by  institutions other than banks or other finance companies,

for example, stock-broking firms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going forward, I do not expect any fundamental shift in

the  activities of finance companies.  But they must continue

to   assess  the  changing  environment  and  upgrade   their

capabilities  in  order to stay relevant in Singapore's  more

open   and   competitive  financial  landscape.   This   will

determine whether they consolidate their position and reverse

the decline in market share.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Sir, the recent focus on

the quality of services of POSBank, both in the press and  in

this  House, once again raised the issue of bank mergers  and

the provision of post-merger services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members will recall, the merger between DBS Bank and

POSBank  led  to the closure of some POSBank branches.   This

has resulted in long queues forming in the remaining branches

with  customers having to wait much longer before  they  were

attended   to.    Quite  understandably,   there   was   much

unhappiness  all round.  And I am sure some comparisons  must

have  been  made  in the minds of POSBank  customers  of  the

quality of service of the bank before and after the merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unhappy episode of course followed the earlier

incident that involved the shut-down of DBS' ATMs because  of

apparently problems involving integration between POSBank and

DBS'  computer  systems.  Sir, this is  not  to  mention  the

general  unhappiness  and dissatisfaction  that  Singaporeans

felt  over the issue of having to keep the accounts  if  they

did  not maintain a minimum sum in the account.  This has led

many  Singaporeans into asking whether or not they are better

served by the merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In moving the POSB Transfer of Undertaking and

Dissolution Bill, Minister Richard Hu stated and I quote:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 755</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"DBS was a natural choice as the most suitable partner

for  POSBank.  Since the Government is the major  shareholder

of  DBS,  it can be more confident that the DBS will preserve

the spirit of POSBank's social responsibilities."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am glad that the Minister recognises that there

are  social  responsibilities  that  POSBank  will  have   to

continue to assume even after it transforms itself completely

into  a  private sector entity.  And the nub of the issue  is

the  exact  scope  of  social or public  responsibility  that

POSBank  is  expected  to  shoulder.   The  man-in-the-street

perceives  POSBank, Sir, as a public institution.   For  many

who grew up in the 60s, including myself, POSBank was perhaps

the  first savings bank that he encountered.  All through the

school  years,  and  even perhaps, his  young  working  adult

years,  POSBank was the place where his salary  was  credited

into,  and the ubiquitous ATM machines served as a convenient

means  by  which  banking  transactions  were  carried   out.

Surely,  the  services were not exactly sterling compared  to

privately-run  commercial banks but, surely also,  they  were

not worse off than perhaps they are today.

<br>2.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I can understand the business imperatives that

drive many of the decisions for POSBank today.  However,  the

one question that we must ask ourselves is whether everything

must  be  driven by business imperatives alone.  The Minister

has  assured  us that POSBank continues to carry  its  social

responsibility, and that DBS will and, I quote,  "Retain  all

the  good  features  of  POSBank  in  order  to  add  to  its

attractiveness as a combined bank.  Certainly, the ATMs  will

be  maintained, and DBS has assured us that it will  continue

to provide services for the small depositors and, indeed, for

children up to 12 years old and students up to age 21."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are good services for the small depositor? It

would  be, I believe, for the man-in-the-street, the  ability

to  continue  using ATMs with cards issued  by  other  banks,

maintain  savings accounts without levies, tax-free  savings,

shorter queues

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 756</b></font><br><br>

and  convenient  checking accounts - in short,  most  of  the

services that Singaporeans were used to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I accept that we cannot run a commercial

institution  on  the  basis that it provides  free  services.

That would be true, if our starting point was that POSBank is

purely a commercial institution without any legacy.  However,

I  submit, Sir, POSBank is not such an institution.  It has a

social responsibility, in particular, a responsibility to the

man-in-the-street.  That responsibility would mean that there

must  be  a  certain amount of cross-subsidy to  see  to  the

continuance  of certain essential, albeit not so  profitable,

services.   If  for  some  reason POSBank  should  choose  to

relegate  some  of  that responsibility, then  it  should  be

carried  out  over a longer period of time and  not  so  soon

after  the  merger.  I would say that what DBS has done  with

POSBank, since merger, has been a disappointment for the man-in-the-street.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is in a position to intervene, either

through  its  substantial shareholding in DBS or through  the

MAS,  by  giving it greater clout to regulate the quality  of

banking  service to the customers.  I would, therefore,  like

to  urge the Minister to consider a review of, and re-define,

the  exact  scope  of the role of POSBank in discharging  its

social responsibility, as well as a review of the speed  with

which POSBank may withdraw its services if, at the end of the

day, it should decide to continue to withdraw.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, I would first like to thank Mr

Sin  Boon Ann for covering quite a lot of things that  I  had

wanted to say, and quite eloquently.  He has made my job much

easier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to add on to what he has said on banking services,

one  of the points that the Minister told us when selling off

POSBank was to satisfy customer demands.  I would like to ask

the Minister to review whether this objective has been really

met,  because when we go down to the ground, most people seem

to  be unhappy with the services they get under DBS than what

they got before.  DBS seems to be very successful in being

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 757</b></font><br><br>

driven by the profit motive.  I have nothing against  it.   I

know that we need to have a commercially successful bank, but

it also has social responsibilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, when we tried to encourage workers to go

for  cashless  pay, POSBank was there to render the  service.

When  we tried to encourage savings, POSBank was there.   And

POSBank  made  the arrangements to put ATMs  near  workplaces

convenient  for workers to withdraw money and go  along  with

cashless pay.  But now the whole philosophy has changed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know of a place where DBS gave two weeks' notice that

the  POSB ATM would be withdrawn in two weeks, and a  lot  of

workers  were affected.  They complained, but before even  an

appeal  could  be  done, before the two weeks  were  up,  the

machine   just  disappeared.   We  can  say  that  there   is

efficiency,  but I do not know whether it is efficiency  when

it  gives  people two weeks' notice and before the two  weeks

are up, the machine disappears.  But it causes people to feel

very  unhappy and that they have not been well taken care  of

or well treated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When DBS took over POSBank, they had a captive audience,

a  lot  of  goodwill.  And thanks to the POSBank  network,  I

think DBS is making profits, which is all right.  But has DBS

met   its   objective   of  meeting  customers'   needs   and

requirements?  I would ask the Minister to review whether DBS

has  kept faith with the original terms of sale and, if  not,

for  the greater good of all Singaporeans, to review it again

and let us take a new look at this.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I thank Mr Sin Boon Ann and Mr

Thomas  Thomas for raising this problem of DBS-POSBank.   The

issue is in the public eye again because of the recent branch

closures  and some ATM relocations, and also the introduction

of  bank  charges  by  DBS.  Let me  briefly  recap  why  the

Government  allowed POSBank to be acquired by  DBS  and  then

explain the current situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than 25 years, POSBank was a leader in

providing  basic  retail banking services to  the  community.

95% of adult

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 758</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans had POSBank savings accounts.  Mr Sin  Boon  Ann

was  one  of them, so am I, so are most Members.  But POSBank

was losing money on its small accounts, and three out of four

of  its  accounts were not commercially viable,  and  it  was

trying  to cross-subsidise smaller depositors, using  margins

from the larger accounts.  It could not really continue doing

this,   because  the  bigger  depositors  were  taking  their

business  to  other banks offering higher  returns  and  more

sophisticated products.  So POSBank was losing  market  share

and,  in  fact, had to reverse its strategy of  paying  lower

accounts  higher interest, and to pay bigger accounts  higher

interest, in order to try and reverse this tendency.  But the

strategy   of  cross-subsidising  small  accounts   was   not

sustainable,  and  even if DBS and POSBank  had  not  merged,

POSBank  could  not  have  continued  offering  free  banking

services to all customers indefinitely.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, the backdrop globally in the industry

was  of  banking  mergers, because technology was  advancing,

regulatory barriers were coming down, consumers were becoming

more   sophisticated,  demanding  higher  quality  integrated

financial  services.  So the banks had to find  economies  of

scale, economies of scope, big enough and broad enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our local banks too needed critical mass to justify

heavy  but  essential investments in new technology,  markets

and distribution channels.  DBS recognised this need and made

an offer to acquire POSBank in 1998.  The Government accepted

DBS' offer instead of putting POSBank up for bids, because it

wanted POSBank to continue fulfilling a social function after

the merger and DBS was willing to accept this responsibility,

and  Mr  Sin  and Mr Thomas have reminded us of  this  social

function.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what has happened since the merger? DBS has

rationalised  its  branch  network,  introduced  charges  for

cheque  services and savings accounts with balances  of  less

than  $500,  and  it did these because it needed  to  improve

efficiency and recover at least part of the cost of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 759</b></font><br><br>

servicing customer transactions.  These changes have  stirred

public  concerns  over  whether DBS  is  still  committed  to

serving  the mass market, and whether basic banking  services

will remain within the reach of all Singaporeans.  We debated

the  matter  in Parliament last year after DBS imposed  a  $2

charge  on  small  savings accounts.   But,  recently,  their

concerns got stirred again because of long queues, delays  in

integrating POSBank, DBS branches, ATM failures and so on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DBS has reiterated its commitment to continue providing

banking  services  that are accessible to all  at  affordable

prices.  It is rationalising its branch and ATM network,  but

it  has  no  intention of leaving the mass market unserviced,

leaving  the small depositors stranded.  The present problems

are  transitional teething problems, and DBS has assured  MAS

that it is doing everything possible to address them.  It  is

really for DBS itself, rather than the Government, to justify

to  its customers and the public the bank's actions.  DBS has

explained publicly some of the steps it is taking, eg, it has

imposed a temporary moratorium on further branch closures, it

is  enhancing  the  training of counter staff  and  educating

customers  on  the  use  of  ATMs,  it  is  introducing  cash

acceptance machines so that customers do not have to queue up

at the counter but just need to put the cash into a machine - faster and more convenient.  And DBS has also stated that  it

is not cutting back on its ATM network and, in fact, plans to

expand  on  the  total number of ATMs that  DBS  and  POSBank

together had at the time of the merger.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked DBS, "Frankly, are these queues a reflection of

your  intention  to cut back on your service  or  is  this  a

problem  we have to solve?"  They said, no, it is  a  problem

they  have  to  solve,  they are not cutting  back  on  their

service.  They have had to rationalise ATMs and branches, but

their service coverage will remain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I asked for the number of ATMs. POSBank started off

with 654.  When POSBank and DBS merged, DBS had 287,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 760</b></font><br><br>

so  together, they had 941.  So, in fact, straightaway, if we

are  using ATMs, we have got more coverage rather than  less.

Now  it  is slightly down because they are in the process  of

renewing  and  upgrading the ATMs, so they are down  to  878.

But  they expect by the end of this year to go back up to 920

better deployed, better ATMs.  So, if we are looking at ATMs,

I  think  the total coverage, the total number of  points-of-presence where we can get service, is more rather than  less.

It has improved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of branches, POSBank started with 126, DBS

itself  had  42  at the point of merger, excluding  the  head

office, so together that was 168.  Today, the total number of

branches  is  72  for POSBank, 37 for DBS,  three  extra  DBS

Business Centres with staff, adding up to a total of 112.  So

the  total  reduction  is  from 126  to  112,  which  is  not

significant, but the 112 presumably would be better deployed,

better  spaced  out.  The problem is that the integration  of

their  branches has not taken place properly, delayed because

they  had  Y2K problems.  As a result, although  there  is  a

total  of  112  branches, we cannot go to any branch  and  do

anything,  whereas for the ATMs, we can really go to  any  of

these   800-odd  ATMs,  whether  DBS  or  POSBank,   and   do

transactions.   But DBS has assured us they  will  have  that

done  by  the  third quarter of this year and, once  that  is

done, this service will be restored and, I hope, improved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked specifically about Mr Thomas Thomas' ATM problem

because  he  had  raised it, I think, last  week  during  the

Budget debate.  This is at the ferry terminal, I believe, and

the  answer is that this was one of its less-used ATMs.   Its

utilisation was below half the average rate and  so  the  ATM

had  to be closed.  The expiry date of the rental was  to  be

31st  January  2001  but, because of Chinese  New  Year,  DBS

negotiated  with its landlord to hand over the  premises  one

month  later, 28th February.  But DBS needed a week  to  take

away  the  ATM,  paint,  touch  up,  and  make  good,  so  it

terminated its services on 19th February, one week before the

deadline for getting off the site.  It gave notice from 1st

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 761</b></font><br><br>

February,  so customers had 19 days' notice, instead  of  the

usual one-month notice.  DBS could have done better, but I do

not  think this is a sign that ATMs are disappearing all over

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The $500 fee which both Members raised again was

something  which  we debated extensively last  year  in  this

House.   As  a  result of the discussion,  DBS  introduced  a

scheme  once we liberalised our CPF rules to allow low-income

people  who  are  drawing pay, to transfer  $500  from  their

Special  Account  into DBS to meet this $500  requirement  in

order  that  they would not have to pay the $2 fee.   So  the

mechanism is in place.  If they really cannot afford  the  $2

fee,  and if they really meet the $500 minimum quantum,  they

can  make  an  arrangement  to transfer  from  their  Special

Account,  and  DBS will waive the fee.  The  arrangement  has

been in place.  I understand from DBS, in fact, 10,000 people

applied, of whom 5,000 met the criteria.  It is quite a small

number.  So the facility is available, but it is really up to

people  whether they want or do not want to use it.   If  DBS

had been more careful and had done this first before imposing

the  fee, I think it would have gone down better, but we  all

learn from our mistakes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fulfilling its commitment to offer basic banking

services,  DBS has to take into account commercial realities.

Each  ATM withdrawal costs the bank between 30 cents and  $2,

depending on how much economies of scale the bank  has.   The

ATMs have to be replenished and serviced, and security checks

have  to be made.  Transactions at the branch cost even  more

because  the  bank  has  to  pay for  rent,  staff  salaries,

electronic facilities and security.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some countries, banks have introduced basic no-frills

bank  accounts  with limited transaction features,  sometimes

mandated  by  the  government.  But these are  typically  not

free.   For  example, in New York State in America,  a  basic

account  allows eight free withdrawals, but you  pay  US$3  a

month.   In  Australia,  an  account  permitting  eight  free

withdrawals  will  cost A$4 a month, if  your  balance  falls

below A$1,000.  This is higher than the fall-below

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 762</b></font><br><br>

fee  which  DBS  and the other local banks charge  for  small

savings accounts with unlimited number of transactions.

<br>3.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On social responsibility, basic banking services must be

available but to make them free, I think is not possible  and

was  never promised.  It was made quite clear right from  the

beginning  that adjustments would have to be made,  but  they

would go out of their way to make sure that they service this

market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, when introducing the fall-below fees on savings

accounts,  DBS  automatically  exempted  about  one   million

accounts belonging to Singaporeans, those over the age of 62,

those below the age of 21, full-time National Servicemen  and

those  on the public assistance scheme.  In fact, if you  ask

whether DBS has lived up to its bargain, I would say yes,  it

has.  But it cannot be responsible for providing free banking

services for all.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can MAS do to help make banking services affordable

and  accessible?   As  I explained last  year,  Singapore  is

different  from other countries.  We do not have a big  rural

area population and remote villages, unable to be reached  by

bank  branches.  We are compact, we are a city.  I  think  we

can  have  a  network where there is a comprehensive  set  of

branches,  covering the whole of the island, where  ATMs  are

also  comprehensively available, perhaps not at  every  ferry

terminal,  but all over the island, and it is affordable  for

everybody.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that we have done recently was to

approve the use of cash-back services.  In other words,  when

you  buy something at a shop, if you buy $50 worth, you enter

the  ATM terminal for $70, you collect your purchases and you

collect  $20  from  the cashier.  This  gives  consumers  the

convenience and a choice of withdrawing cash at participating

retail  outlets, which means, instead of depending on 900  or

1,000  ATMs,  you will have many, many more ATMs  than  that.

Every  shopping outlet becomes potentially an ATM.   NETS  is

planning to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 763</b></font><br><br>

launch this service soon, in collaboration with Fairprice and

several other major retailers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing which we propose to approve is to allow

banks  to  set  up limited-purpose branches  on  third  party

premises.  In other words, you do not have to have  your  own

branch,  rent  premises, have a full shop  and  have  a  full

branch.   You can rent a space, sublet somebody's  HDB  shop,

for  example,  and put a little counter there, provide  basic

services.  It is cheaper and more accessible.  Then the banks

can  negotiate with third parties, such as post  offices  and

supermarkets,  and leverage on their staff  and  premises  to

provide  basic  services, including  cheque  desposits,  cash

withdrawals  and  other  payments  through  existing   retail

networks.  This way, banks can reduce the costs of delivering

banking services, resulting in savings for consumers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we will do what we can to make banking affordable

and  accessible, and I think we can do a considerable amount,

but  in  the end, we cannot avoid some changes and we  cannot

avoid  some charges. We will try to space out the adjustments

over  a  period of time, rather than suddenly.  DBS, I think,

has  taken  a step back.  They are adjusting their  programme

now.   I  have  confidence  that  they  will  overcome  their

teething problems and provide the service which they  promise

Singaporeans.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I have brought up this issue

about  a  third board for listing Singapore companies before.

The  main  issue is the balance of having a third  board  for

listing  of new and risky companies versus using the existing

main  and Sesdaq boards for fund-raising by companies.  While

Singapore is currently too small a market to justify a  third

board,  we  should expect Singapore to grow as a  significant

financial  hub for the region.  It is therefore, an opportune

time  for  us to have a third board or as an alternative,  an

over-the-counter  (OTC) board, for ease  of  fund-raising  so

that in the long-term, we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 764</b></font><br><br>

would  have  a  much more vibrant place for fund-raising  and

stock market investment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My complaint is not so much that companies are not able

to raise funds, but the problem is the approach that has been

taken  by the Singapore Exchange (SGX) for the last two years

to make it easier for companies without track records to list

on  both boards in Singapore.  It became so easy that so much

so  there  were  too  many  examples  of  fundamentally  weak

companies  that got listed easily, resulting in the investing

public  getting  hurt, while the promoters of  the  companies

made  their money.  While I know that the answer is going  to

be  that  investors  must  be more  prudent  and  study  such

offerings  of  public listings carefully before making  their

investments, the fact is that some of them, together with the

advisors,  do  a very good job in marketing their  companies,

and  the prospectuses are so detailed and legalistic that the

common  man  finds  it  difficult  to  fully  comprehend  the

contents.   When we see too many fundamentally weak companies

getting  approvals to list on our two boards, the  unintended

effect  is  also that the reputation and credibility  of  our

main  board  and of SGX comes into question.   Why  were  the

regulators  not able to sieve out the companies  that  should

not have been listed in the first place?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest that we go for the third board for emerging

and  technology  and  risky companies  to  raise  funds.   By

segregating the three boards this way, where we know that the

third  board  is  for  high-risk  companies  to  get  listed,

investors  would, right from the beginning,  know  about  the

risk  nature of their investments.  We should also  take  the

opportunity to use technology to make it into a global board,

if we want to do this, that trading can go on for 24 hours  a

day, not just to service markets in Singapore, but the global

market and, where trading can be done in global currencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel this is the best way forward to further ease fund-raising issues in Singapore while we avoid tarnishing the

image   of  our  two  existing  boards,  as  is  the  current

situation,  when fundamentally weak companies get  listed  on

them.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 765</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, on Mr Inderjit Singh's idea

of a third board, he raised it last year and I explained then

why  I  did not think it was practical.  Since then, SGX  has

had  an  eventful year.  Many companies have had their  IPOs.

Some were successful, others not.  The question is whether in

the light of this experience, we now think a third board is a

good  idea.  We have asked SGX and in their view,  which  MAS

agrees with, the answer is still no.  Let me explain why.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGX's basic decision is what criteria to use when

allowing a company to be listed and when allowing the  public

to  trade shares in the company, whichever board the  company

goes on.  What are the criteria for letting it be listed  and

letting the public buy and sell the shares?  Mr Singh  argues

that if we put risky shares on a third board, this would be a

signal from SGX to the public that the shares are more risky.

There  are some examples overseas where they have tried  this

approach.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our approach is: the investing public should

already  know, from the company's prospectus, the  nature  of

their business and the risks which the company is subject to.

If   a  retail  investor  needs  help  in  interpreting   the

prospectus, which sometimes he does because it is  put  in  a

complicated way, there are analysts and financial journalists

who  comment publicly on pending issues, and whose considered

opinions the retail investor can read in the newspapers.   If

SGX  had  to  decide  which of several boards  to  allow  the

company  on  to, it would have to base its judgement  on  the

same  public  information that is already in  the  prospectus

because  SGX should not have information which is  secret  to

itself.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, SGX does not want to pass judgement on the

company,  beyond deciding that it meets the listing criteria.

To   do   so  would  be  inconsistent  with  disclosure-based

regulation, and would bring SGX back to the pitfalls of merit-based regulation which it used to practise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that several IPOs were under-subscribed this

year  and  tanked suggest that investors do know  a  doubtful

proposition when they see one.  They are not

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 766</b></font><br><br>

such  suckers.   They may not have understood  all  the  fine

print  and legal language, but they knew enough not  to  part

with  their  money.   It  is only when investors  pursue  the

shares  of a risky company without realising the risks,  then

we have a problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should also be clear about the motivations for

wanting to segregate risky companies onto a third board.   Is

it  to  encourage  more adventurous investors  to  buy  their

shares,  or is it to warn off investors who may not be  aware

of  the  risks?  I do not believe that the present SGX  rules

prevent any companies from listing who could list on a  third

board, as Mr Singh acknowledges.  Nor do the rules hold  back

any  adventurous investors seeking risky stocks  prepared  to

accept the downside in the hope of high returns.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience of other countries confirms that setting

up  a  third  board would not, in itself, draw liquidity  and

interest   to  the  companies  listed  on  it.   During   the

technology  stock boom, exchanges in several Asian  countries

created  technology boards along the lines  suggested.   They

have  had mixed success.  Some attracted significant interest

in  their  initial  months, but have been  hard  hit  by  the

declining  interest  and valuation of  technology  companies.

Their  overall  market  capitalisation  has  fallen  sharply.

Today,  technology companies are finding much more difficulty

raising  funds  on  these boards.  We  can  look  at  several

examples.   Germany has the Neuer market, Korea  has  KOSDAQ,

Hongkong has GEM, Tokyo has the Mothers market, Malaysia  has

MESDAQ.   The experience is mixed.  It is not clear  that  by

putting  it  on a different board, you make the company  more

successful.   Yes, it was hot at the time when the  boom  and

frenzy  was on, but now the excitement has ebbed and many  of

these  boards  are  languishing, their  companies  and  their

shares too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all the companies listed on SGX need be, or should

be,  established, safe, blue chip companies. There is nothing

wrong  with  having  risky  start-ups  being  listed  on  the

exchange,  alongside established names like SIA or DBS,  once

these

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 767</b></font><br><br>

start-ups  reach a certain threshold size.  As  long  as  the

risk  is  an honest business risk, the company complies  with

the Exchange's listing rules and disclosure requirements, and

their  shares  are  properly  traded  and  not  cornered   or

manipulated, then the Stock Exchange is fulfilling its proper

function  -  providing a well-regulated marketplace  for  the

company to raise equity capital from the public.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The business risk is something which the investors have

to  judge.  If it is a matter of dishonesty, fraud,  somebody

running  away  with  the  bank's  money,  manipulating  their

shares,  for  that kind of risk, we would do something  about

it.   We would chase it up and put it right.  But if it is  a

business  risk  - I put forward a proposal, full  disclosure,

you  know  what I am trying to do, you know the dangers,  you

put your money up, then I do not think we should stand in the

way and require you to be separately listed or to prevent you

from listing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in today's business environment, risk is no

longer  very  much  a  function of size and  recent  earnings

profile,   especially  for  technology  firms.    Large   and

profitable firms can also be risky because the conditions can

change  very  rapidly.  When SGX liberalised its criteria  to

allow  more firms to list directly on the main board, it  was

in effect saying that the main board was no longer a low-risk

board. Sesdaq then became a small cap board instead of a high-risk board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this is the correct approach for SGX to

take.  But it does raise the question of the need for SGX  to

have a separate small cap board. Sesdaq was launched to allow

less well-established companies that did not qualify for  the

main  board  to  be  listed.  Now that SGX  has  revised  its

listing  criteria, many companies, which in  the  past  would

have  had  no  choice  but to list on Sesdaq,  can  now  list

directly on the main board, although not all of them. SGX  is

therefore studying the proper role of Sesdaq, to review the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 768</b></font><br><br>

merits  of continuing with two separate boards.  It  has  not

reached any decision on the matter.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat (Aljunied):</b> Sir, our law of

insurance  requires the insured to declare what he  knows  to

the  insurer if such knowledge has relevance to the insurer's

assessment of the risks involved.   The impact of  this  rule

extends  to the Home Protection Scheme (HPS) run by  the  CPF

Board  which,  in  law,  is another insurance  policy.   Many

Singaporeans sign their HPS documents as one of a whole stack

of  papers they sign when they are allocated their HDB flats.

They are not specifically alerted to the nature of the HPS as

an  insurance  policy.  Hence, they are totally  baffled  and

deeply  aggrieved when a breadwinner dies of  a  pre-existing

medical  condition, ie, existing before they signed  the  HPS

and HDB papers, but which they have not disclosed at the time

of signing of the papers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, the same happens even when an insurance agent

has  properly  directed the attention of the insured  to  the

duty of disclosure because of the vagueness of the parameters

of this duty.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only reference in our Insurance Act (Cap 142) to the

duty  of  disclosure is in section 25(5), which  attempts  to

ameliorate the harshness of this common law rule. The section

mandates that insurers who wish to rely on this rule ought to

display  prominently a warning that "if a proposer  does  not

fully  and faithfully give the facts as he knows of  them  or

ought to know them, he may receive nothing from this policy".

Violation  of this section results in a fine but the  insured

still is not entitled to payment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this provision yet does not tell the insured what to

say, what part of his store of knowledge is relevant when  he

"proposes"  to  enter  into a contract of  insurance.   Worse

still, the policy is void even if there is something he ought

to know.  What ought a poorly educated man or woman "ought to

know"?  That  his  "hong sip" (Hokkien for  "wind  and  wet",

referring  to  a whole range of ailments from  rheumatism  to

arthritis) is something that he must declare because it is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 769</b></font><br><br>

some  kind of preliminary cancer?  What ought a well-educated

non-medical professional "ought to know", that disclosing his

high  blood  pressure may not be the same  thing  in  medical

science  as  revealing  his ischemia  or  his  propensity  to

myocardiac infarction?

<br>3.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In legal jargon, leaving aside medical jargon, the

standard  of  disclosure is that of the prudent insurer,  ie,

the  insured must disclose all facts which a prudent  insurer

will  want to know in assessing the risk.  How would a layman

know  what a prudent insurer requires?  In Australia  and  in

Malaysia, the legislatures have amended the common  law  test

to  one of what a  reasonable insured knows to be relevant to

the issue of risk.  This remains difficult to fulfill, but at

least  the  insured is not tested on his guess  on  what  the

insurer  wants to know; nor what the insured "ought" to  know

but nevertheless does not know until a court says he ought to

know.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That leads me to this question of insurance policies

which  an  insurance company issues. Our policies are  chock-full   of   obscure   and  laborious   English,   not   plain

conversational English.  NTUC Income has done a very good job

of  simplifying its policies, but they are still hampered  by

the  fact that the law is painfully laden with language  from

the  ancient cases using language and a style of  English  no

longer  meaningful in the Third Millennium.  If  the  law  of

insurance  updates  and  simplifies its  language,  then  the

policies will follow suit.  Can we look at our neighbours and

emulate them?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, it is a common practice for many life

insurers  to  provide  a column for the proposed  insured  to

nominate   a  beneficiary.   Unlike  CPF  nominations,   this

nomination is not effective in disposing the proceeds of  the

policy  if  there  is  a  will  stating  otherwise.   As  for

nominations in NTUC Income policies, these are valid  because

their policies are not governed by the Insurance Act, but  by

the  Cooperative  Societies Act (Chapter  62).   Nonetheless,

such nominations are not revoked by

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 770</b></font><br><br>

marriage,  unlike the case with CPF nominations.  Then  there

is  the  complication of nominations that take  effect  under

section  73  of  the  Conveyancing and Law  of  Property  Act

(Chapter  61).  In the case of Eng Li Cheng Dolly v  Lim  Yeo

Hua,  reported  in [1995], 3 Singapore Law Reports  363,  the

High Court held that a divorced wife was entitled to proceeds

of  her  ex-husband's life policy, just because he had  named

her  in the policy, despite the fact that he had divorced her

and  had  intended  to remarry before he died.   Surely  this

could  not  have  been  his  intention?   Part  XIII  of  the

Insurance  Act 1996 of Malaysia has 11 sections dealing  with

nominations.  We have not a single section.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our convoluted law needs reform and consolidation in one

Act  now.  Are we ready, Sir, for this mammoth task  for  the

New Millennium?

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> General Lee, would you like to respond?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I am not familiar with all the

Chapters,  sections  and cases.  But I  would  say  that  the

we will look into  -  all of them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the burden of disclosure, the present

situation is, as Assoc. Prof. Toh has pointed out, to  ensure

that  they  have to display a warning that if the prospective

buyer  does  not fully and faithfully give the facts,  as  he

knows  them  or ought to know them, he may stand  to  receive

nothing  from  the policy.  There are concerns that  insurers

might  rely on this to be less than fair in their obligations

to  policyholders.   And to make sure that policyholders  are

not  unfairly  treated,  the Life Insurance  Association  has

issued an internal statement of practice, which requires that

proposal  forms  of  all  life  insurance  companies  exclude

questions whose answers a prospective buyer cannot reasonably

be  expected to know, and which would not be practicable  for

him to obtain.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also provides that the prospective buyer need not

answer any questions

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 771</b></font><br><br>

provided  that he states that he does not possess and  cannot

reasonably be expected to obtain the information necessary to

answer   the   questions.   Also,  the  insurer  should   not

unreasonably  reject a claim or invalidate a  policy  on  the

grounds  of  non-disclosure or misrepresentation, unless  the

fact is material and is within the knowledge of the proposer.

And  for  that,  he is reasonably expected  to  disclose  it.

However,  flawed,  deception,  reckless  or  negligent   non-disclosure  or  misrepresentation of  a  material  fact  will

constitute  grounds for rejection of a claim.   This  is  the

present  position.  So there is some safeguard.   Whether  we

need to change the law is something I will look into.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the use of plain English, MAS supports this

initiative,   and  has  suggested  to  the   Life   Insurance

Association to encourage members to adopt this practice,  and

several  life insurance companies have already  begun  to  do

this.  And, again, we will see whether we need to change  the

law itself, to make the law itself use plain English.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for beneficiaries, this is a problem, as the Member

correctly  pointed  out.   NTUC Income  does  not  have  this

problem, because they are not an insurance company.  They are

a cooperative and therefore not covered by the insurance law,

which  is surely not a good way to do things either.  Because

it  should be covered by the insurance law, whether or not it

is a cooperative.  So, we are looking, together with the Life

Insurance  Association, the Ministry of Law and the  Ministry

of  Finance, into the issue of providing greater  clarity  in

the nomination of beneficiaries for the proceeds of insurance

policies.  And when we amend the Insurance Act, we  will  fix

all these matters.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, first, a point of

clarification  to  the Deputy Prime  Minister.    As  I  have

pointed out in my speech, these insurance laws actually apply

to  the Home Protection Scheme of the CPF.  These papers  are

signed in the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 772</b></font><br><br>

flurry  of  a  whole lot of papers in the HDB  office  before

officials  who are not directing their minds specifically  to

the  insurance point.  I get a lot of aggrieved residents who

come to me and say, "My husband just died.  Now I cannot  pay

for  my flat, because the HPS does not pay, even though  they

said  that they were supposed to pay.  And that's because  my

husband did not declare this disease that he had."  Would the

Deputy  Prime Minister also ask the authorities to look  into

this  issue of both the procedure and the law where HDB flats

are concerned?

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, we will have to look and see

whether  the HDB officers, making house buyers sign  the  HPS

forms,  would  count  as  insurance agents  and  need  to  be

properly qualified for that purpose.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I move on to my next cut

on  electronic payments.  First, I have this point  to  make,

that  for electronic payments to take place, we have to  make

sure  that the old habits based on paper have to be  removed.

All of us know that cheques have become a very important part

of the business life, and even the personal lives of a lot of

Singaporeans  and  of people around the world.   Cheques  are

paper  payment  instruments which, by  law,  are  negotiable.

Unfortunately, Sir, I think it has escaped the notice of many

people  that the cheques that are issued, and  I believe  the

bulk  of cheques issued today, are not negotiable.  They  are

crossed  and  are made payable to "Account Payee  Only",  and

these   cheques,   essentially,  then  become  non-negotiable

payment instruments.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAS has talked about the movement to truncate

cheques, because moving of paper in such volumes is not good.

But  in  order  for the electronic clearance  of  such  paper

cheques to be done, in other words, for the procedures to  be

truncated, the law has to be changed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, while thinking about changing the law relating to

bills of exchange and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 773</b></font><br><br>

how to truncate them, could I urge the Government to look  at

a  totally new paradigm, perhaps initially legislating for  a

payment  order?   In Australia, I understand that  they  have

done  this.  They have removed cheques altogether in the form

of negotiable cheques and legislated for a payment order.  If

a  payment order is merely an instruction to the bank to  pay

and  it  is  not negotiable, therefore, all the  problems  on

negotiability  and  hindrances to electronifying  the  cheque

would be gone.  Perhaps we could be even more radical and  be

like  Finland  which, in 1996, abolished the cheque  totally,

and  only allowed for electronic payments.  Perhaps  the  MAS

could look into how many cheques are actually drawn each  day

which  are  still  negotiable and  provide  for  those  in  a

different way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point I wish to make is that in the payment

infrastructure that we have in place right now for electronic

payments,  our  "killer application", DPM Lee  has  mentioned

himself in this House, is the ERP system.  So we developed  a

card system which is a form of electronic payment system  for

the ERP.  And then we developed a separate system for use  on

trains  and buses.  There is a rumour -  perhaps rumours  are

not  true   -   that the ERP itself would change  to  a  chip

rather than a card.  And then what is not a rumour is that by

2008,  we  are planning to have electronic legal tender.   My

concern  is that all these piecemeal changes to practice  and

piecemeal  introduction of electronic payment systems  should

not  happen,  because they should all be  building  from  one

common  base,  and  therefore the killer  applications  could

grow.   I  hope that we would not have different card systems

and   different  payment  systems  for  Internet,  for   ERP,

transport and perhaps an inter-agency coordinating body would

be  necessary for such payments, so that by the time we  have

our electronic legal tender, the infrastructure does not have

to be reinvented and recreated.

<br><br><!-- BG Lee Hsien Loong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>BG Lee Hsien Loong:</b> Sir, I agree with the Member. On

cheques, I do not think we are ready to abolish cheques.   We

support the initiatives to discourage

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 774</b></font><br><br>

cheque  usage,  but we do not think we can  abolish  cheques,

because  in  many  situations,  cheques  remain  the  payment

instrument that makes the most sense.  One day, there may  be

new  payment methods that are cheaper, safe, more accessible.

I  think we can study how the Australians and the Finns  have

done, but I do not think we are quite ready for it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The volume of electronic transactions has been growing

rapidly   now  in  terms  of  number  of  transactions.    E-transactions have exceeded the number of cheques every  year.

Of course, in terms of total dollar amounts, it is much less,

because   e-transactions  tend  to  be  for   little   retail

purchases.   But the number of transactions has been  growing

rapidly.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are encouraging e-payment innovations and improving

the  efficiency  of  existing  payment  infrastructure.   For

example, we are facilitating cheque truncation, scanning  the

cheque at the starting point and after that dealing just with

the  digital form, rather than the piece of paper circulating

around.   And we are also working with all the other agencies

to encourage competition and innovation in e-payments  - IDA,

Ministry   of   Communications  and  Information  Technology,

Ministry of Finance, BCCS and so on, so that we will  try  to

avoid having inconsistent overlapping pieces.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are supporting the initiative by NETS and its five

shareholder banks to restructure its ownership structure  and

corporate  governance in order to take on new and  innovative

functions,  and  to  make  NETS the premier  payment  service

provider  within and beyond Singapore.  NETS is currently  in

discussion  with potential partners who can bring  expertise,

technology and global connections.  When it finds a strategic

partner  and new management structures, a revamped NETS  will

be  more  effective  in  promoting  electronic  payments  and

proving   the   efficiency   of   payment   instruments   and

infrastructure, introducing new payment methods, and so  move

us towards a cashless society.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 775</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for smart cards, right now, the only multi-purpose

stored  value card we have in Singapore is the NETS CashCard,

which  is based on the contact card technology.  But  LTA  is

beginning  to install infrastructure to support  the  use  of

contactless  smart card technology for its own  stored  value

card  in  the  transit systems, buses and, in future,  retail

shops.  They are different.  One is contact, and the other is

contactless.   LTA  is  choosing the contactless  technology,

because  it  allows  commuters to pass  through  the  transit

system  quickly, without breaking their stride.  They do  not

have  to stop.  They just swish their wallet or their handbag

over  the turnstile and the transaction is completed.  It  is

like driving under the ERP gantry, swift and painless.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognise that this will result in people having to

carry two different stored value cards.  Unfortunately,  this

cannot be helped for the time being, because the combi-cards,

which  combines both the contact and non-contact capabilities

on a single card, are still new.  Their technical performance

and  commercial viability of the combi-card is not tested and

proven  on a wide scale.  But we are looking ahead, and  MCIT

and  MAS  have been encouraging the Land Transport Authority,

the  transit operators and NETS to work together  to  prepare

for  using a single combi-card throughout Singapore once  the

technology is ready.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Prof. Toh's query about the card in the ERP being

replaced by a chip, I have not heard about it.  But if I  do,

I would let him know.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Order. I propose to take the tea break

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head N (cont.) -

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, this topic

of the substantial budget surplus was raised by a few Members

during  the Budget debate.  I feel that there is  a  need  to

raise  this  issue for further discussion because  it  is  an

important  topic  with major impact on the  yearly  financial

plans of the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have examined the budget surpluses of the Government

in the last five years.  The figures are as follows: FY 1996,

the surplus was $5.6 billion; FY 1997, $6.1 billion; FY 1998,

-  $0.4  billion (this was a recession year); FY  1999,  $0.9

billion; and FY 2000, $3.5 billion.  The forecast for FY 2001

budget  surplus is $4.4 billion.  Based on the above figures,

it  can be seen that the Government has performed exceedingly

well  to  achieve consistently substantial budget  surpluses,

except  for 1998 which was a recession year.  If we take  the

total of these surpluses in the last five years, the sum is a

hefty  $15.7  billion, which is nearly 10% of the  year  2000

GDP.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With these substantial surpluses, the Government has

much flexibility in terms of the actions and policies it  can

pursue.  Therefore, it has the following key advantages:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Flexibility and freedom to pursue Government

policies and objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Ability to implement wealth redistribution policies that

enable the Government to give help to the poor and needy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Ability to build up a substantial national reserve that

can  be used to cushion against uncertainties and the ability

to act against external interferences and exigencies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what is more remarkable about our substantial

budget surplus is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 777</b></font><br><br>

that  it  is  attained  after accounting  not  only  for  the

Government's annual operating expenditure but also  inclusive

of  total annual developmental expenditure.  As a result,  we

have  no foreign debt which is the primary reason why we  are

not adversely affected by the recent Asian financial crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, however, the substantial budget surpluses also pose

concerns in some aspects.  Allow me to elaborate.  The  areas

of concern are:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Each year, the actual surplus achieved is typically

higher  than  the original forecast of the annual  Government

budget.   It may mean that the various Ministries are  unable

to  plan  accurately their annual incomes  and  expenditures.

This  tendency  is  not  desirable,  as  some  Ministries  or

departments could be deprived of funds for their projects and

programmes, because other Ministries asked for more money and

did   not  utilize  the  funds  in  the  end.   The  affected

Ministries  could  well be the welfare  and  social  services

group  as  they  tend  to  be lower down  the  priority  list

compared with the economic agencies.  So I would like to  ask

the  Finance Minister whether the Government budget  planning

process  can  be tightened.  Those Ministries and departments

that   over-budgeted   and  did  not  fully   utilize   their

allocations should be queried and taken to task.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) On the Government income side, the budget surplus

could  well  have the adverse impact of over-drawing  on  the

Government   taxes,  charges,  levies  and  fees.    On   the

Government expenditure side, there could be under-spending of

the  expenditures,  especially in  development  projects  and

expenditures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both situations are not desirable. On the one hand,

over-charging and over-collection of Government  income  mean

that  the  Government can be over-taxing the people  and  the

businesses.   If  taxes or levies are lowered further,  which

the  Government could afford to, more money could be left  in

the  hands of the people and the businesses who can then have

more  money  to  spend on their needs.   This  will  help  to

stimulate the economy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 778</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, if the Government's development expenditures

are  unintentionally  curtailed  because  of  poor  budgetary

planning, then there will be a contractionary effect  on  the

economy.   At  least, the economy could have been  stimulated

further  through  higher capital expenditures  on  worthwhile

Government projects.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my comments above are of course predicated on the

understanding that I am not advocating mindless and  wasteful

spending.    We   value  frugality  and   prudency   in   our

expenditures  are  virtues.  I am also aware  that  excessive

spending can cause the evil of inflation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the complexity of the issues, I would like to ask

the  Minister for his comments on how he would deal with  the

substantial surpluses, and whether measures will be taken  to

improve the Government's budget planning and funds allocation

process.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, I would like to make a few

suggestions on how we make further improvements  to  our  tax

system as we enter into the new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to suggest that we allow all new

companies  to  have  a  10-year  average  tax  plan  so  that

companies  which do not enjoy any of the EDB  tax  incentives

(like pioneer status, business HQ tax status, and others) can

enjoy  an effectively low tax during that period.  We  should

allow  companies to carry forward losses within this  10-year

period,  and  the  system  can  also  be  flexible  to  allow

different  levels  of tax rate depending  on  which  year  of

operation   the  company  is.   This  will  basically   allow

companies  to  have a smoother start-up with less  burden  on

their cash flow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the Ministry should allow pre-production

expenses  to be tax-deductible and allow interest income  for

the  first few years of operations for such companies  to  be

tax  exempt  or  tax  deductible.  The reason  is  that  many

companies,  especially the capital intensive  companies,  may

raise  substantial  funds upfront for use for  future  years.

They  have  to  raise  such  funds  because  of  the  capital

intensive nature of their companies.  But

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 779</b></font><br><br>

when  they  do  that the money basically  sits  in  the  bank

earning interest, but we are taxing them for all this.  It is

prudent  for  them to do so and we should not  penalise  such

companies from raising funds early.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also raised some suggestions on enhancing Singapore's

position as a manufacturing hub during the Budget debate.   I

hope  the Minister will study these suggestions and take them

into  account when he implements changes to any of the future

tax system.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage individual enterprise and to create a

culture where every Singaporean thinks as an entrepreneur,  I

suggest the following three schemes:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I suggest that we introduce a negative gearing

scheme  where individuals can write off expenditures  related

to  individual  business related activities, like  when  they

rent  out  their  premises or do some part-time  business  to

supplement  their  income.  In this way,  when  it  comes  to

paying  taxes, individuals will behave like businesses,  thus

developing a sense of enterprise within themselves.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, we should allow individuals and entrepreneurs

to  carry forward losses resulting from investments they made

in  start-up  companies so that they  can  reduce  their  tax

burden in future years.  This would eliminate the risk averse

nature of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, while I am very happy to see the progressive

tax  incentives  for stock options, I would like  to  suggest

that  the individuals and employees be taxed upon realisation

of their gains when they encash their shares rather than when

they exercise their options.  While the current system allows

for  delay of up to three years of exercise, should they make

a paper gain, in fact, the paper gain could actually become a

loss depending on the market conditions some years later, and

this  will create a burden for the individuals when they have

to  pay  tax  on the gain that they made when  in  fact  they

actually did not gain anything when they sold their shares.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 780</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, this year's Budget

can  be  said to have given a double bonus to the individuals

because in this year they not only get a personal income  tax

cut  of  between 2% and 5%, but also a 10% rebate on the  tax

payable.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to point out certain anomalies in the

manner  our  tax  reliefs are worked out.  In  most  families

today,  maids are employed to assist in looking  after  young

children.   Under the present provision, a married woman  who

employs  a maid to look after her children is entitled  to  a

tax relief of up to $8,280.  This works out to about $690 per

month  on average.  In comparison, someone who cannot  afford

or  is  not willing to employ a maid, can only claim a  child

relief of $2,000 for each of the first three children,  which

works out to an average of $166 a month per child.  I am sure

all  of  you will agree with me that it takes much more  than

this amount to raise a child.

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please do not get me wrong. I fully understand the

rationale behind why the foreign maid tax was levied,  and  I

am  not asking for more tax reliefs.  All I am asking for  is

for the Ministry of Finance to review the child relief and to

make  it more realistic in a more proportionate way.   So  in

this way, in addition to the "baby bonus", it would also be a

strategy to encourage more families to have children

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, at the moment, the foreign maid relief is

applicable  only  to  the women.  I find  it  a  bit  strange

because  we  are  always  talking about  equality  of  sexes.

Moreover,  nowadays husbands are expected  to  perform  their

fair  share of duties at home.  So, should we not extend  the

foreign  maid relief  to the husbands as well, in  the  event

that  they  were given custody of the children in  a  divorce

situation  or where the spouses have passed away.  They  need

to  work too and will definitely require a maid to look after

their children.  I hope the Minister would consider this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, on the parent relief scheme. The current

provision only permits one sibling

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 781</b></font><br><br>

to  claim  relief for looking after his or her  parents.   We

know  in  reality  that in Singapore nowadays,  the  cost  of

looking  after  the parents is normally spread among  several

siblings.   As  such, should the scheme not  be  adjusted  to

reflect the actual scenario by allowing more than one sibling

to  claim  the  amount?   Perhaps the one  with  the  parents

staying  in  his house could claim higher relief,  while  the

other siblings claim lower reliefs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, the Government has announced

the  reduction  of  the property tax rate from  12%  to  10%.

However,  at the same time, the 25% property tax  rebate  was

removed.   The net effect is that except for the  residential

sector, the commercial, office and industrial sectors do  not

have any gain in the property tax reduction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a higher benefit to the businesses and property

owners,  it  would have been more appreciated if the  Finance

Minister could have done both, that is, to lower the property

tax rate and, at the same time, give a rebate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, property tax is originally conceived as a form of

wealth tax.  However, the function of the property tax  as  a

wealth  tax  is partially diminished since most  Singaporeans

own  their homes, 93% to be exact; as HDB dwellers are mostly

home  owners  as  well.  Hence, it may be opportune  for  the

Government to reconsider the use of property tax as a  wealth

tax.   Although  the  negative effect  is  mitigated  by  the

reduction of property tax for owner occupied properties,  the

effect of property tax for non-residential area, that is, for

commercial,  office  and industrial, is that  it  essentially

becomes a cost factor.  Property tax has an impact on  rental

charges  as  property owners normally on-charge the  cost  of

property  tax  to  the  tenants.  This cost  factor  adds  to

overall business costs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my question to the Minister is that if property tax

is  losing  its  purpose as a wealth tax, and  tends  to  add

towards  operating  cost, I would like to  ask  the  Minister

whether  he  would  review  the  role  of  property  tax  and

eventually reduce it to a lower level over time.  In the long

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 782</b></font><br><br>

term, is there a need for property tax, since income tax  and

GST  are  serving the main functions of direct  and  indirect

taxes?

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, until the dot-com mania, only a

small  percentage of companies have issued stock  options  as

part  of  an employee's compensation package, purportedly  to

align workers' interest with companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few years, the Minister has moved swiftly

to  make  the  tax  environment here more  conducive  to  the

issuance  of stock options.  The Singapore Exchange has  also

put  in  place a framework for listed companies,  to  operate

within.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, many top vacancies at dot-coms now go a

begging,  despite packages which are heavy on  stock  options

and which used to be the carrot for many a bright candidate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In structuring our tax incentives, I would like to

humbly  suggest  to  the Minister to examine  the  signalling

effect,  especially  in  the light  of  the  emerging  equity

culture  in  Singapore.  Sir, I recognise that a  balance  is

difficult  to  strike.  I recall the cries of  my  colleagues

urging  the Minister to give entrepreneurship a boost in  the

arm by offering generous tax incentives, especially for start-ups.   Offering  too much of a tax incentive,  on  the  other

hand,  might  unwittingly signal to employees at  large  that

stock options are superior to wages or even bonuses paid  out

in  cash.  The understanding of how the upside or downside to

stock  options is linked to a company's performance  may  not

have been as complete as what we are hoping for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in this regard, I would like to ask the Minister to

consider  allowing alternatives to implementing the  intended

extension  of  tax  incentives  to  companies  issuing  stock

options  to  at  least half of their employees.   Whilst  the

intention  may  be  to  spread tax incentives  as  widely  as

possible,  from the signalling perspective, it  would  appear

that the Government prefers the wide use of stock options  to

just  issuing to top executives.  Some preliminary study  has

indeed indicated

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 783</b></font><br><br>

that corporations that offer options to the majority, instead

of  a  few, tended to enjoy significantly higher productivity

levels  and annual growth rates.  However, in the context  of

Singapore,  where both companies and individuals may  not  be

prepared  for  that scale of stock option participation,  the

Minister  may want to allow a modification of the  "at  least

half" requirement.

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Sin Boon Ann is not here. Mr Leong

Horn Kee.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, many of my parliamentary

colleagues  and  I  have  spoken on  the  need  to  help  the

pensioners during the Budget debate.  In my speech during the

Budget debate, I mentioned that retired pensioners are a pool

of  past contributors who had toiled hard to help the country

achieve economic growth and nation building, at salaries that

were generally below market rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned also that the $1.7 million given to

pensioners as adjustment of the Singapore Allowance and gross

pension ceiling is paltry compared to the budget surpluses of

$3.5  billion.   The Finance Minister, I am   certain,  could

have and should have been more generous to the pensioners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to plead harder again for the plight of the

pensioners.   Assuming a pensioner retired 10  years  ago  in

1990  and  had  a pension of $1,000.  In the last  10  years,

inflation  rate, as represented by the accumulative  rise  in

the  Consumer Price Index (CPI), has increased  by  17%.   In

addition,  the national average monthly income of Singaporean

households  has  increased by 74%, from  $9,670  in  1990  to

$16,800  in  year 2000.  If we combine the two factors,  that

is, of rising inflation and the increase in household income,

we  can  see that a pensioner with no other sources of income

will fall behind other Singaporeans by a good 91%, that is by

adding  the  two  figures together.  That  actually  means  a

$1,000  pension in 1990, would roughly diminish by about  50%

in  today's value, compared to the other economically  active

households.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 784</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am not advocating an indexation scheme to peg

pensions with yearly adjustments.  This is not right.  What I

am  requesting is that, in good years, when all  Singaporeans

are  rewarded with pay rise and NWC adjustments to  salaries,

we  should not forget the pensioners.  At present, there  are

about  12,000 pensioners.  Because of the conversion to  full

CPF scheme, the number of pensioners will diminish over time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I would like to ask the Finance Minister, since

this  year  he has not given very much to the pensioners,  in

fact a very meagre sum as benefit to them, perhaps next year,

he  can surely do more for them, and particularly, since next

year he is budgeting a higher surplus of $4.4 billion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, most people are quite happy with

this year's budget and with the generosity that was given  to

them  by  the Minister for Finance.  But our people are  very

concerned that what the Minister for Finance gives out,  will

be  taken  away by other Ministries, statutory  boards,  shop

owners  and others, and very soon, they will have a negative,

rather  than positive reaction.  And the tendency to increase

fees  and prices has already started, whether it is hospitals

or other places, they have already started.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we would like to ask the Ministry to please monitor

these price increases and do not just pass every increase  on

to  the  consumers, the poor man-in-the-street.  There  is  a

budget surplus of $4.4 billion anticipated for this year, and

it is expected to be 23% of Government operating expenditure,

including running costs and transfers.  There is some  buffer

to  absorb  some  of  these unforeseen increases  or  planned

increases.  There can also be productivity increases.  So  in

this  budget,  it  is important that the  feel  good  factors

should  continue to the end of the year, and that  we  should

have it at least carried on to the next Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my plea again is: let it not be said that what the

Minister  for  Finance  gives us is only  waiting  for  other

Ministries  and  statutory boards and companies  to  take  it

away.  Please do not do that.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 785</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau):</b> Sir,

on  the  question  raised  by Mr Leong  Horn  Kee  on  budget

surpluses and whether the recent large surpluses might result

in  a liquidity squeeze on the economy, let me just start  by

reassuring Members that the budget surpluses were not brought

about  by higher taxes.  I have said this many times  in  the

past and I will repeat it again.  We have, in fact, over  the

years, been reducing taxes to keep them competitive and it is

not  our  intention to create budget surpluses by  increasing

taxes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, I have explained to the House the difficulty

of forecasting revenue, and it has become even more difficult

nowadays because the world changes very rapidly.  I have said

that our revenue growth strongly correlates to GDP growth and

our   ability  to  forecast  revenue  is  therefore   heavily

dependent  on the accuracy of our forecast of the  growth  of

the economies of our major trading partners and, in turn,  on

their demand for our export products.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members should note that the Singapore economy is

strongly export oriented with external demand accounting  for

over  55%  of  GDP.   In  the  United  States,  which  is   a

continental economy much less dependent on exports,  even  Mr

Greenspan,  Chairman  of  the  Federal  Reserve  Board,   has

difficulty in forecasting the growth of the US economy.   How

much more difficult it is for us to have to forecast not only

what  the  US  economy will do, but of all the other  trading

partners' economic growth.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these inherent difficulties, we have been

generally conservative in our forecast of GDP growth,  as  it

is  important that we do not base our expenditure  programmes

on income levels which may not be realised.  In order to keep

Government   expenditure  under   control,   we   have   kept

Government's  recurrent expenditures at around  10%  of  GDP.

And  in  recent years, we have been able to live within  this

cap.  However, Government's development expenditures are  not

subject  to  any specific cap because they are project-based,

and we invest in basic infrastructure as and when they are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 786</b></font><br><br>

needed  and  can be economically justified.  In  most  years,

development  expenditure has been around 6%-7%  of  GDP.   On

this basis, we would normally expect a budget surplus of  1%-2%  of GDP.  However, if our economy grows much more strongly

than  forecast because of exceptional external demand, as  it

did  in  1999  and the year 2000, we would end up  with  much

larger budget surpluses.  I consider such a development as  a

bonus  of  good fortune to be enjoyed, and not to be lamented

as a consequence of poor budget forecasting.

<br>4.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of whether budget surpluses would have a

contractionary  effect  on the economy,  the  answer  is  no,

because there are no signs of contractionary pressures on the

economy  at this time.  Our interest rates have remained  low

and there is no shortage of funds.  The economy has recovered

sharply from the 1997/98 crisis, with solid performances over

the  past  two years.  I would also remind Members  that,  in

addition to domestic liquidity, we also have large inflows of

foreign  direct  investments, which have averaged  some  S$79

billion  over  the  period  1990-1998.   So,  liquidity   and

availability  of  funds  for investment  have  never  been  a

problem for us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Inderjit Singh has proposed several innovative tax

changes to promote enterprise in the new economy, and we will

take  his suggestions into consideration when we next  review

our tax system.  His proposals are directed at lightening the

financial  and tax burdens of companies in their early  years

so  as  to promote their development.  He has suggested  that

all  new  companies  which do not enjoy  EDB  tax  incentives

should  be given a 10-year tax honeymoon, during which losses

can  be carried forward and companies are taxed at low  rates

according to their individual income profile.  While  such  a

proposal is clearly very helpful to these companies,  such  a

flexible  tax system will create problems of equity  and  tax

treatment, and will be administratively very complicated too.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of what he has asked for, such as the carrying

forward of losses, are already

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 787</b></font><br><br>

available.  Under existing provisions of the Income Tax  Act,

losses are already allowed to be carried forward without  any

time limitation, as long as the shareholders, in the year the

losses  are  absorbed, are not substantially  different  from

those in the year the losses were incurred.  Also, under  the

partial tax exemption scheme, which will be effective in  the

Year  of  Assessment  2002,  start-up  companies  will  enjoy

substantially lower tax rates.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of pre-production expenses and interest

income,  I should point out that expenses incurred to acquire

investments  do  not  qualify  for  tax  deductions,  if  the

investments  do not produce income.  This is a tax  principle

provided  under  the provisions of the Income  Tax  Act  and,

where  income is produced, the expenses incurred are  allowed

as  a deduction against that income.  We will take a look  at

this again, but I think the principle would be very difficult

to  change,  as  there may be a lot of adverse  consequences.

Consequently,  any expense arising before the production  day

is  not  allowable and, conversely, any income arising before

this  day  is also not subject to tax, since the  company  is

considered as not having commenced business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax-wise, the most important thing the Government can do

to  nurture  entrepreneurial behaviour  is  to  keep  up  our

personal  income taxes at a low level so as not to discourage

hard  work and enterprise.  Our tax rates are already one  of

the lowest in the world before the latest Budget announcement

for   individual  income  tax  cuts.   There  are  also   tax

concessions   to   make   the  environment   favourable   for

entrepreneurship, eg, through making employee  stock  options

attractive,  allowing individuals doing businesses  to  treat

themselves   as   businesses   when   computing   their   tax

liabilities, and allowing individuals to deduct the  expenses

incurred during the course of their businesses against  their

income.   To  change  the  system to  one  where  we  have  a

multitude of deductibles in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 788</b></font><br><br>

personal taxes will, as I said earlier, highly complicate our

tax  system.  Singapore is the envy of many countries because

of  the simplicity of our tax framework, which results  in  a

high   degree  of  compliance  and  predictability   of   tax

liabilities.   I think it is far better for us  to  take  the

approach  of  reducing the rate of tax overall,  rather  than

vary  tax  rates depending on how well individuals  make  out

their accounts and argue their cases.

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.23 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On share options, I believe that taxing at the point-of-exercise is a fairer method than taxing at the point-of-sale,

particularly  since  we  do not have  capital  gains  tax  in

Singapore.   Let me explain.  If we tax at the  point-of-sale

and  the  share price is higher at sale than at the point-of-exercise, there would be an additional tax equivalent to  the

difference  in  price.  This, in effect,  imposes  a  capital

gains  tax.   Secondly,  taxing at the  point-of-exercise  is

fair,  because  the  employee becomes a legal  owner  of  the

shares  upon  exercise.  What the individual  chooses  to  do

after  that,  is  a  separate decision.   Once  the  employee

exercises  the option and owns the shares, he is  subject  to

the  same risks in price fluctuations as other investors  who

buy  the  shares from the open market.  Although the employee

also  faces a tax bill as a result of exercising the options,

he  could dispose enough of the shares to set aside money  to

pay  the tax.  This is a wise move.  Many option holders,  in

fact,  exercise and sell at least some portion of the  shares

at  the  same time, possibly to raise funds to pay off  their

future  tax  liability  but, mostly, to  reduce  their  risks

should prices go down in future.  I think the balance between

risk and reward is best left for each individual to decide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng has commented on the tax rebates for

individuals, both on maid relief and parent relief.   On  the

issue of maid relief, in most families, maids are employed to

look  after  young children.  Under the category  of  foreign

maid relief, a married woman who employs a maid to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 789</b></font><br><br>

look  after the children is able to claim up to $8,280.  This

works out to be about $690 per month on average.  Compare  it

with someone who cannot afford or is not willing to employ  a

maid  to look after her children, can only claim a relief  of

$2,000  for each child.  He says this would work  out  to  an

average  of  $166  per month and, therefore,  appears  to  be

manifestly unfair.  Let me point out that tax reliefs are not

meant  to  compensate  taxpayers for any particular  expenses

incurred.   They are only meant as a form of recognition  for

the  individual's  expenditures  in  specific  areas.   Child

relief is recognition for the care of one's child.  It should

not  be  compared to maid relief, which is part  of  a  wider

package  of tax incentives to encourage and facilitate  women

to  have  more  children but still continue to work  if  they

wish.   A husband whose spouse has passed away, can apply  to

employ  a  maid  to  take  care of  his  children.   This  is

different  from the purpose of the maid relief, which  is  to

facilitate married women to raise a family and to continue to

work at the same time.  Hence, maid relief is not extended to

their husbands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of tax rebates for individuals to look

after  their parents, it is not clear to me exactly  what  Mr

Ong  Ah  Heng is asking for when he says that more  than  one

sibling  should  be allowed to make the same  claim.   Is  he

suggesting that each sibling should ask for the same  amount,

ie,  $3,500 multiplied by the number of siblings,  or  should

they  be  allowed to share this relief, which is $3,500,  for

someone  who  does not live with the parents, or  $5,000  for

someone  who lives with the parents?  I do not think  we  can

allow  multiple claims because it would mean a huge  increase

in  the  amount  of  relief.  So I am assuming  the  question

really is:  how should the relief be claimed or shared?   The

existing  guideline  allows only one sibling  to  claim  this

relief.   This  stipulation is a practical one.   It  assumes

that  the siblings would decide amongst themselves who should

claim  the relief.  I do not think the Government would  want

to interpose itself and make a decision on their behalf.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee has raised the question of property

tax, in which he says

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 790</b></font><br><br>

it is manifestly unfair to remove the 25% property tax rebate

and replace it with a 2% cut.  Arithmetically, he is correct.

But  the purpose is different.  As I have said in the  Budget

debate,  the 25% tax rebate was introduced to help  companies

during a recession period.  That is largely over, and we  are

now  cutting taxes permanently, as I said, by 2%, which gives

companies  certainty so that they can manage their  financial

affairs for the future.  He also says that since property tax

is  a  wealth  tax,  which has an impact on  business  costs,

whether they should not be reduced over time and, eventually,

removed.  We have already started to reduce it.  But  I  have

also  said  that  it is not a tax we will remove  altogether,

because the total tax we collect is a substantial amount, and

total  removal  would  mean that  the  tax  lost  has  to  be

recovered elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Lim Hwee Hua has raised issues on the question of

stock  options and the incentives provided.  She is concerned

that the incentives provided for stock options may signal  to

companies  that  stock  options  are  the  preferred  way  of

remuneration.   I can assure her that is not  the  intention.

The  recent  measures to make the taxation of employee  stock

options  (ESOPs)  more  attractive  is  in  response  to  two

emerging  trends.  One is the more widespread use of  equity-based  remuneration, and the actions of  other  countries  to

make  taxation  of  ESOPs  more  attractive.   As  talent  is

internationally mobile and is increasingly awarded  by  means

of  stock  options, there is a need for our tax treatment  of

ESOPs  to  be  internationally attractive,  to  maintain  our

competitive edge.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the company stock options (CSOP) scheme,

one  important  objective  of  the  scheme  is  to  encourage

companies to offer options to lower-ranked employees as well.

As options are a means of sharing the benefits of a company's

success with its employees, the scheme has been structured to

encourage  options to be more widely distributed rather  than

confined  to  a select group of people at the top.   However,

the Government has no intention to suggest that stock options

are superior to wages

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 791</b></font><br><br>

and  bonuses paid out in cash.  In fact, the CSOP  scheme  is

structured  so that wages and bonuses paid out  in  cash  are

likely  to remain the primary means of employee remuneration.

Stock  options  should therefore be an additional  means  for

motivating and retaining employees.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, it must be up to each company to decide

whether  it  wishes to participate in the scheme and  how  it

wants  to  structure  its  scheme to satisfy  its  individual

conditions  as well as to meet the needs of its company.   It

can  stay  with  the stock options just to  a  select  group,

without  offering options to at least half its employees,  in

which  case, the recipients of the options will simply  carry

on  with  their  benefits of the stock options,  without  the

additional tax break under the CSOP scheme.

<br>4.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Leong Horn Kee has also raised questions on the issue

on  the plight of pensioners. I understand his concern and  I

am sympathetic, but as I have already addressed this issue in

the Budget round-up speech, I do not propose to go through it

again in detail.  But I would just like to point out that  in

addition  to  the Singapore Allowance which has been  raised,

although  not  by a very large amount, pensioners  have  also

been  given  ex-gratia  payments of quite  significant  sums,

depending  on the dates when they retired.  I can assure  him

that  the Singapore Allowance would be adjusted from time  to

time, depending on the impact of inflation and we would  look

at it again whenever an increase is warranted.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Thomas Thomas has expressed concern over the

seemingly  rapid  way  in  which cost  increases  are  passed

through,  in the form of Government charges, so that whatever

we  give away, we are taking back in a different form.  I can

assure him that this is not so.  I believe his concerns  were

about  the  recent increases in public utilities  rates,  but

this  was linked to changes in crude oil and fuel oil  prices

which we cannot control.  I have explained

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 792</b></font><br><br>

in  this  House last Wednesday, there has not been a  runaway

increase in living costs.  The CPI has only increased by 1.7%

per  annum  over the past 10 years and this is  substantially

lower than the average increase in incomes.  On balance, most

Singaporeans would be better off.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Government fees and charges are concerned,

they  are increased to recover actual costs increase  and  no

more,  and  the increases are dependent on increases  in  the

cost  of  wages.  We should not subsidise the labour cost  of

services,  and  we  generally try to  reduce  its  impact  by

improvements in productivity.  Where increases are necessary,

in  essential  services  such as  healthcare,  education  and

public  housing,  the  increases are due  primarily  to  wage

increases  and  to  improvements in the  quality  of  service

provided.  Nevertheless, in all these cases, whether it is in

public  housing,  education  or  healthcare,  its  costs  are

heavily  subsidised by the Government.   I  think  Mr  Thomas

knows  that the health subsidies are substantial and I  would

not repeat it again since I have already mentioned it before.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered most of the issues raised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang):</b> Sir, in this year's

budget,  the Net Investment Income (NII) in Table  1  of  the

Budget  Book  has  been moved up to be included  as  part  of

operating  revenue.  The Minister for Finance  has  explained

the  reason in his Budget speech.  I note that in FY1999, NII

was estimated at $3.74 billion, and the revised FY1999 figure

was  $5.56  billion.  In FY2000, the estimated NII was  $5.61

billion.   In  this  year's budget, the  revised  FY2000  NII

figure  was $1.55 billion.  I would like to know what is  the

original  revised NII figure for FY2000, before applying  the

new  method  of  calculation for contribution  to  Government

operating  revenues.   The  estimated  NII  contribution  for

FY2001  was  also lowered to $856 million.  May  I  know  the

reason for the significantly lower estimate?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these years in Parliament, I find that the most

difficult to track the Government's performance is Government

investments.  When I try to look for investment

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 793</b></font><br><br>

income  details,  either from the budget  summary  under  the

Ministry of Finance, or total estimated receipts, the  figure

can never tally with the total estimated figure.  I have also

checked the budget control documents.  I have also found that

it  does  not  contain information on Government investments.

Although  we  are  supposed to focus  on  expenditure  during

Budget  time, with Singapore's unique circumstances, I  think

it  is  also  important that we should  know  how  Government

invests our money and how these investments perform over  the

years.  Moreover, since the Government emphasises so much  on

the  importance of financial reserves, it is only  fair  that

the  public  should have a clearer picture of the  investment

performance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we always talk that the Government is transparent,

but  the  investments of the Government do  not  seem  to  be

transparent to me. I therefore urge the Minister for  Finance

to  release more details on how the Net Investment Income  is

derived.   I  hope  that  in next year's  Budget  book,  more

details of investment incomes would be shown.

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee:</b> Sir, it cannot be denied that the

Government-linked  companies  (GLCs)  have  been  a  positive

influential factor on the economic development of  Singapore.

Many  GLCs  were formed in the early 1960s when there  was  a

lack    of    private   sector   initiatives   to   spearhead

industrialisation  and  the Government  wanted  to  spur  the

growth  of  certain  new sectors, such as banking,  shipping,

ship repair and the defence industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The background, impact and public perception of GLCs is

well-covered in a recent article written by a journalist,  Mr

Yap  Chuin  Wei and published in the 3rd March issue  of  the

Straits  Times.   I  agree  with Mr  Yap  that  the  constant

refrains  of local businessmen about GLCs are that "they  are

crowding out the private sector; they are stream-rolling  the

competition    and    that   they   are   stifling    private

entrepreneurship."  It is a well-researched  and  well-argued

analysis  of  the  impact of the GLCs. I recommend  that  the

Minister read this report.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 794</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local businessmen do not begrudge the existence of GLCs.

In  fact, everybody recognises the significant role the  GLCs

have played in our nation's progress.  The concerns over GLCs

are three-fold:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The crowding out effect of the GLCs;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The complaint of unlevel playing field; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) The stifling effect on private entrepreneurship.

Actually  the  comments  about  GLCs  also  apply  to   other

Government affiliated and union associated companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the crowding out effect of the GLCs, the Minister for

Trade and Industry has clarified that the GLCs contributed to

only  13% of the economy.  Another report said that the  GLCs

and  statutory boards collectively take up about 23%  of  the

economy.  In my opinion, even at 13% of the economy, the GLCs

exert  a  much  larger influence over the market.   GLCs  are

manned  by current and past top civil servants, both  at  the

board and management levels.  By the fact that GLCs are owned

and  linked  to  the  authorities, at both  shareholding  and

management  levels, they do exert a substantial influence  in

the market, beyond the numerical percentage of their share of

the  economy.  The main disadvantage of the crowding  out  by

the GLCs is that open market forces may not operate fully.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you were to read the annual report of Temasek

Holdings, we cannot help but to have the impression  that  we

are  reading  the general economic survey of Singapore.   The

GLCs,  and  the  Government affiliated and  union  associated

organisations are practically involved in every aspect of the

economy.  In fact, we cannot get by a day without having some

dealings with the GLCs.  For example, when we go to the bank,

read the newspaper, buy food, use the telephone, or even take

a  bus,  taxi  or MRT, the GLC is there.  In fact,  GLCs  are

involved in everything that we do.  We cannot throw  a  stone

without hitting a GLC.  Are they not crowding out the private

sector?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 795</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unlevel playing field is the second constant refrain

of the private sector.  To be fair, I do not believe that the

GLCs  will  get special deals, privileged advance information

of Government policies or changes in plans, or even have easy

access  to  Government  funds.  Every  request  for  fund  is

properly  and  thoroughly  evaluated  before  the  money   is

committed.   But what is true is that the top civil  servants

who  are  directors and managers of GLCs  do  have  a  better

appreciation of Government policy thinking and trends.   They

also  have  close contacts, connections and access  to  their

counterparts  in  the Government regulatory agencies.   These

are in fact strong advantages.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, I like to contend that the unlevel playing field

of GLCs is more often perceived than real.  But even if it is

perceived,  it  does  have a significant impact  on  business

dealings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On stifling private entrepreneurship, I feel this is an

area  of  real  concern. The concern  is  that  because  GLCs

command  such  a large segment of the economy and  influence,

they  therefore capture an unduly large pool of the  business

and   talent,   thereby  stifling  private  entrepreneurship.

Private  companies are affected as they have a smaller  share

of the pie, and they find difficulty in attracting talents to

join  them.   In  contrast to GLCs, the impression  of  staff

joining GLCs is that they offer better perks and sinecure.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is a concern that is worthwhile studying

more in depth. We want to build a strong private sector as an

engine  of growth.  We also constantly lament on the lack  of

entrepreneurship.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I wish to clarify that I voice the above concerns

not  because I am against GLCs per se.  I think they play and

will  continue to play a very important role in  the  nation-building  process.  I have many friends who  are  working  in

GLCs and have close business dealings with GLCs.  In fact,  I

have  worked  in  a GLC before and served on boards  of  GLCs

previously.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 796</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I understand the Department of Statistics is doing

a  study  on GLCs and the Government has announced  that  its

divestment strategy of GLCs will continue.  I would  like  to

know  the status and the current plans.  Besides raising this

issue in the Committee of Supply debate, I also have filed  a

Parliamentary  Question  to  seek  more  clarity   from   the

Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Singapore context, I believe the GLCs are here to

stay,  even in varying degrees in future.  Hence, I  strongly

feel  that it is not realistic to continue to adopt  a  self-denial  approach  that  the GLCs have no  impact  on  private

enterprise.  I would propose that a detailed study or  review

be  done  by  a special committee, with representatives  from

both  the  public  and private sectors  to  examine  how  the

positive  effects of GLCs can be further developed,  and  how

the  negative  effects can be mitigated.  The private  sector

and   GLCs  can  work  together  for  their  mutual  benefit,

especially   in   going   regional   and   seeking   business

opportunities around the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GLCs have played an important role during the

formative days of Singapore's economic development.  After 36

years  since  independence, it is time to do an appraisal  to

reprise the roles of the GLCs.

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh:</b> Sir, for the reasons that Mr Leong

Horn  Kee just mentioned about the role of GLCs, I would like

to  bring up a few issues and suggestions on how we can  make

Government-linked  companies  more  effective  and  how  they

should  be managed for them to be more successful in the  new

economy.   And I too feel that GLCs do have a role  to  play,

but  it  is  about time that we reviewed the regulations  and

roles  and the responsibilities that the Government and  GLCs

have  with respect to how they should be managed as  we  move

forward in the new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the speed of privatisation needs to be

picked  up  because  now is a good time  for  Singapore-based

companies to get ahead in the global marketplace.  Due to the

economic uncertainty

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 797</b></font><br><br>

around the world, there are and will be many viable companies

which  will  be in distress and which would be  in  need  for

strong  partners  who  can bring financial  strength  through

acquisitions  or  mergers.  I feel that it is  only  when  we

successfully  privatise our GLCs, can they  effectively  move

fast  enough to capitalise on such opportunities  and  expand

globally.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, there is a need for greater transparency on

how  GLCs are managed, a point brought up by many Members and

especially for those that are not listed on the stock market.

Some  of the things that need to be monitored are the funding

and   fund-raising   from   Government   coffers,   corporate

Government issues and related party transactions among  GLCs,

where  GLCs  are given preference to each other in conducting

business, even when there are, and maybe better and more cost-effective    solutions   provided   by   private   companies.

Transparency  will not only make them stronger as  this  will

subject  them to more stringent scrutiny than private  sector

companies are subjected to.  I suggest that we put in place a

watchdog  body  which has a mix of private and public  sector

people and this body should have the responsibility to review

and regulate how GLCs operate and are managed. I believe this

is  being  done in some countries like in Hong Kong  and  New

Zealand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, the Government should set a time-frame for each

current and future GLCs to be fully privatised and this  plan

should  be publicised so that all Singaporeans will be  aware

of the privatisation schedules.  We should make out a list of

such  companies  and invite private sector  investments  from

around  the  world,  not  just from Singapore,  so  that  the

Government can divest as much of its holdings in the GLCs  as

it  possibly can.  It is about time we monitored the progress

of  our  privatisation plans.  We have heard of plans but  we

just do not know the schedules, and therefore, cannot measure

the success rate of privatisation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also suggest that we shut down non-viable GLCs by

identifying them early in the process.  If we do not do this,

we   will   continue  to  pour  public  funds  into  wasteful

investments.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 798</b></font><br><br>

<br>4.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, we have seen many examples of GLCs getting

into  businesses  they have no experiences in  running.   For

example,  the  Singapore Bus Service got  into  the  property

business and got its fingers burnt by losing quite a  lot  of

money,  and  another GLC getting into the  food  business  by

buying  the fast food chain, Delifrance, which made no  sense

for the GLC's long-term growth strategy.  There are many more

examples  of  failed  investments by  GLCs,  which  got  into

businesses  they had no expertise or experience in  managing.

We  should  therefore put in place strict rules,  disallowing

GLCs  to  venture into non-core-competency activities.   This

will  also  avoid such GLCs from crowding out our  home-grown

private sector companies,  a point which Mr Leong brought  up

earlier on.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, there should be greater involvement of private

sector individuals in the boards and key management positions

of  GLCs, for the same reasons that Mr Leong brought up.   We

cannot  possibly expect civil servants, who may not have  had

any business exposure in the past, to effectively manage such

companies,  which  have  to operate   based  on  true  market

discipline.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, we should set the tone of privatisation and we

should   therefore  plan  to  outsource  the  governance   of

Singapore  in areas that make sense, by quickly  breaking  up

statutory  boards and Government agencies, and  spinning  off

non-core  and non-sensitive Government activities.   Can  the

Government set a target of resource reduction, eg,  reduction

by a certain number of Government employees or a reduction of

a  certain  percentage  of  Government  expenditure?    These

targets will help drive the pace of changes that we should be

setting for ourselves.  We will also ensure that more  people

will  be released to the private sector,  which is constantly

facing a severe shortage of manpower and talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh, for Government-linked companies that are

already  listed,  will the Government consider  reducing  its

stake to become a minority stakeholder?  In most

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 799</b></font><br><br>

cases,  the  Government still holds a majority  stake.   This

will  allow  true  private sector type  governance  for  such

companies  and  hence, it will further help  build  up  their

strengths.   I  have heard of instances where companies  from

developed  nations  prefer  not to  deal  with  some  of  our

privatised  GLCs,  simply because such  companies  are  still

viewed as being Government owned or Government controlled, by

virtue  of  the  huge  majority  shareholding  held  by   the

Government through the investment arms, like Temasek Holdings

and GIC.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we also saw a few failed attempts by both SIA

and SingTel when they tried to acquire significant stakes  in

foreign companies, precisely because both are still viewed as

Government  linked and Government controlled  companies,  and

therefore  negative  reactions from the companies  that  were

being  acquired.   Can the Minister share with  us  what  the

Government  feels  about reducing their  stakes  in  GLCs  to

become minority shareholders?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Zulkifli, can you make your speech

short?  Otherwise, you will not get a reply at all.

<br><br><!-- Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Zulkifli bin Baharudin:</b> Sir, we have heard in this

House  how GLCs are being viewed by SMEs as very big, strong,

but can be more friendly, because they leave very little room

for  others  to  do business and somehow enjoy  some  special

position  in  securing contracts and Government business.   I

think the Minister for Trade and Industry has clarified  this

matter.   My own view is that SMEs feel like this about  GLCs

because they somehow feel uninvolved, uninvited, to take part

in  the  larger process of privatisation, as GLCs  go  on  to

expand  their  business  or  take  part  in  some  very   big

projects, which is very important to make SMEs feel  a  sense

of ownership, a sense of belonging.  They must be the ones to

participate in the expansion of the airports and all that.  I

think  the  sense of being uninvolved, unattached, uninvited,

unappreciated must somehow be changed.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 800</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should the SMEs not, on the other hand, feel that

GLCs  are  some of the most admired companies,  someone  that

they can become partners with, can do business with, as vital

organisations  that  they  can link  up  with,  as  strategic

partners, who can bring them forward as they expand into  the

region.  I think we should do that.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sometimes wonder, as an illustration, Phua Chu Kang

Private  Limited  may be number one in Singapore,  Johor  and

Batam,  but  if  the  GLCs were to go  into  home  renovation

business,  whether they would be interested in the  likes  of

Phua  Chua  Kang.   Because they are seen  to  be  completely

different types of people, irrelevant, and incompatible.  But

on  the  one hand, I think we see that some of the  SMEs  are

very  entrepreneurial.  They have close relationships in  the

region.   They  can  help GLCs negotiate the  very  difficult

business practices.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am asking the Minister really in privatising some

of  these GLCs, for the GLCs to take on a role where they can

lead,  bring along other SMEs together with them, not just  a

corporate or business mission, but other objectives as  well,

the larger objective of bringing along the SMEs as they grow,

prosper and develop in the region.  The GLCs must then take a

big  brother  role  and  assist the SMEs.   Only  then  their

feelings about SMEs and GLCs can be improved.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, first, on Mr Low Thia

Khiang's question.  I will give him the figures that he  asks

for.   He also said the NII figure for the year 2000 was very

high.   This  is because in that year there was a very  large

payment from Temasek Holdings which will not be repeated this

year.  This accounts for the big difference.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the published figure for NII in FY2001 is low

because it only includes 10% of the NII which is available to

Government  for  use.  If you recall, the  amendment  to  the

Constitution  provides for up to 50%, but we only  notionally

include a figure as 10%.  It is not that we are going to  use

the 10%.  But rather than

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 801</b></font><br><br>

put  a  zero  there, we have put 10%.  That is why  it  looks

small.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as Government's return on investment is

concerned,  Government's investments are divided  into  three

groups.  One comes under Temasek Holdings, which is a holding

company   for  GLCs,  and  its  accounts  are  available   to

Parliament.   The  other  is  MAS  which  manages   quite   a

substantial  proportion of Government reserves.   Again,  the

results  are  published annually.  So you can  look  at  MAS'

annual  reports to see how they are doing.  The final amount,

which  is  a  large part of our reserves, is managed  by  the

Government  Investment Corporation (GIC).   This  is  not  an

asset  owning  company.   It  is  simply  a  fund  management

company,  which  manages the remaining amount  of  Government

reserves.   This  company does not publish its  results.   We

have explained why we do not publish the results because they

contain information which our competitors would love to have.

But  its accounts are available to the President and  to  the

Auditor-General.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GIC is a very large fund manager and its performance is

comparable to the performance of any large international fund

management company, which manages a portfolio of funds spread

around  the world, in a variety of assets and currencies.   I

can  assure Mr Low that the returns of the GIC are more  than

adequate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next year, the reserves figures will not be in the

Budget book, for the reasons I have explained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the problem of GLCs, the complaints are not

new.   We have given the same answer many times and I do  not

want  to go through it again.  I think the problem is one  of

perception.   GLCs are generally large, and  they  are  large

because  they were started by Government at the time  of  our

independence,  when there was a shortage  of  private  sector

funds, technical know-how and so forth.  They have now become

quite  successful and large, and they are large  compared  to

SMEs.  If it is a problem of size, would you prefer that GLCs

did  not  exist at all and have foreign companies  doing  the

same

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 802</b></font><br><br>

job?   That will be far worse, I would assume.  So our  GLCs,

which  compete in various sectors, must be strong enough  and

as  efficient as the foreign companies who are free  to  come

in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give you an example. One of the corporations,

NTUC  FairPrice  has  always been the  target  of  a  lot  of

complaints,  because it is seen to be competing  against  the

mama  and  papa shops in HDB housing estates.  It has  become

very efficient and its prices are competitive and, generally,

low.  It has to compete against a supermarket chain like Cold

Storage,  which is owned by a Hong Kong company,  Dairyfarms,

who  runs  a  very  large chain of supermarkets.   Would  you

rather  that  NTUC  FairPrice  get  out  of  the  supermarket

business and let our SMEs compete directly with Cold Storage?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Zulkifli is quite right that our objective should be

to  get  our  successful GLCs to act as a mother hen,  so  to

speak,  and  try  and help our SMEs to develop,  particularly

overseas.  And  this,  in fact, is the objective  of  Temasek

Holdings,  which  is  the  holding  company  responsible  for

monitoring the performance of our GLCs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, some of our GLCs have made wrong

investments, as pointed out by Mr Inderjit Singh.  They  have

made  mistakes  and they have taken their punishment,  so  to

speak.  But mistakes are bound to happen, hopefully, not very

frequently.  But because what has happened, Temasek  Holdings

is  now imposing quite a strict policy to ensure that GLCs do

not  go  into  areas  outside their core competencies.   They

should  focus on expanding overseas and bring our SMEs along.

What  is past, I think we will have to accept.  But from  now

on,  we recognise that the purpose of our GLCs is not to kill

our  small SMEs, but to help them, and to compete against the

big  foreign  companies which, whether you like  it  or  not,

because  of the open style of our economy, will want to  come

here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Temasek Holdings is already doing quite a good

job.   So  I  do  not think we would want to set  up  another

private

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 803</b></font><br><br>

sector  body to monitor the performance of GLCs.  Let Temasek

Holdings  do its job.  We will review the position from  time

to  time.   And  if  we have problems of SMEs  facing  unfair

competition, let us know and we will do everything we can  to

ensure that SMEs are not disadvantaged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure you that the GLCs do not receive special

preferences  from  Government.  They  operate  as  commercial

entities  and  you can see that quite a few have  been  quite

successful.   Companies like SIA, DBS, PSA are top  companies

in  their fields, and they are commercial companies we should

be proud of.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have answered most of the questions

raised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, I just want to say that the

Companies  Act  needs to be reformed to  better  protect  the

interests  of  workers and small-time investors.   Small-time

investors  are  also basically workers who  have  been  using

their  CPF accounts to invest in the stock market.  And going

by reports, they have not done well.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that needs to be looked at is the

rules  on  payments to workers of companies under liquidation

and  judicial management.  Section 328 of the Act gives wages

and  benefits, including retrenchment benefits,  preferential

treatment  in the event of liquidation.  However, when  there

is  judicial management, workers are not preferred creditors.

I  hope this will be addressed, together with the lifting  of

the  maximum  of five months' salary of $7,500, whichever  is

lower.  This quantum was fixed in 1993.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other matter is that the small-time investors need

information  to  make correct investment decisions.   So  the

rules  on  disclosure, openness and transparency need  to  be

reviewed.   I accept that there are mindset obstacles  for  a

prescriptive code on what should be disclosed.  I  know  that

even  if there is a prescription, the companies will use this

as a minimal standard, and stick to it.  So I see that

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 804</b></font><br><br>

there  is a role for the SIAS,  as a voice for the small-time

investors,  in monitoring the market and helping  the  small-time  investors to make wise decisions.  However, I see  that

there is a need for legislation to give companies  ---

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head C of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in moving this cut, I wish to revisit the auditing

function as carried out by the Auditor-General's Office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To recap, the Auditor-General has a constitutional duty,

amongst other things, to audit and report on the accounts  of

all  the  departments  and  offices  of  the  Government  and

prescribed public authorities and bodies administering public

funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Auditor-General discharges his duties

in compliance with sections of the Audit Act, which relate to

the  conducting of financial statements audits, examining  of

controls  and  reviewing the effectiveness and efficiency  of

selected systems and activities.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 805</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, firstly, on the focus of the auditing function.

The  spirit of auditing the Ministries and public bodies,  as

embodied  in  the  above legislation, must be  to  ultimately

preserve  the  integrity of the Government in  its  fiduciary

responsibility.  Much has changed in terms  of  the  way  and

scale  on which the Government now operates, especially  from

the  perspective of the extensive use of technology  and  the

attendant risk to our economy at large.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In revisiting the Auditor-General's role, I would like

to draw a parallel to the auditing function of a company, for

which the Audit Committee is responsible and which is usually

accomplished  by  both  the  Internal  Audit  Department  and

external auditors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I understand, not all Ministries have internal audit

functions.  If true, the Auditor-General would then  have  to

undertake  both the internal and external roles.   This  will

lead  to  a  situation where owing to the sheer  variety  and

scale   of  operations,  the  audit  can  at  best  highlight

occasional  lapses.  Moreover, there would  be  inevitably  a

preoccupation  with the means rather than the end.   Ideally,

the  focus  should be more outcome-oriented than  process  or

compliance-driven.  To illustrate with an  extreme  case,  it

would be far better to highlight weaknesses in the sharing of

a sensitive financial database than to detect an over-payment

of $200 to a staff who has resigned.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the wide application of technology. Sir, the

entire  Government  machinery is  so  wired  up  now  that  a

commensurate  amount of auditing resources must be  allocated

towards ensuring the preservation of integrity.  The auditing

function  must  take  cognisance of the  risk,  financial  or

otherwise,  of losing access to, or abuse of, the information

within the various Government networks.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is even a strong case to argue for a

shift  towards a more proactive than a purely reactive stance

in  the  longer  term.  I would therefore  like  to  ask  the

Minister  how  he thinks the role of the Auditor-General  can

stay relevant to the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 806</b></font><br><br>

increasing  use of technology and whether amendments  to  the

Audit  Act  are  necessary  to  shift  the  focus  towards  a

minimisation of risk than financial compliance per se.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> Sir, the role of the Auditor-General is separate from the Internal Auditor. Currently,

about  half  of  the  Ministries have internal  audit  units.

Since  October last year, the Accountant General's Department

has  been encouraging all Ministries to set up internal audit

units.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audits by Auditor-General's Office focus on both the

process  as well as the outcome.  However, the Audit  Report,

which is submitted to the President who in turn tables it  in

Parliament, tends to focus on the outcome, to demonstrate the

effect of some of the control weaknesses.  Control weaknesses

and recommendations are reported separately to the Ministries

in  management  letters that are sent out  after  each  audit

project.   In  FY1999/2000  audit,  more  than  700   control

weaknesses were reported to Ministries for improvement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to auditing the highly wired up Government

environment, there have not been impediments to the  Auditor-General's ability to audit and take into account the risk  of

losing  access  to  or  abuse  of information  of  Government

networks.  Hence, there are no plans to amend the Audit  Act.

To  deal  with the increasing use of technology, the Auditor-General's  Office has stepped up training of its auditors  in

computer-assisted audit techniques.  It has also equipped its

auditors with notebook computers with sufficient capacity  to

examine and carry out tests on financial data downloaded from

its auditees.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister for his

response and beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head Z of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I must congratulate the Minister for managing the

treasury  so  well that we have got a lot  of  assets  to  be

distributed, and I particularly congratulate the Minister for

this  laudable  move of allocating more to be distributed  to

the lower income.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that in distributing this, there are

standards  that need to be set to decide who are  indeed  the

lowest  level of income earners.  I find no problem with  the

allocation  to 3-roomers, even though some of you  may  point

out  that some 3-roomers may actually own big cars.  However,

I  do  think  that  perhaps a little room for  adjusting  the

general rule can be thought about, particularly in this issue

of dependants of low-income earners, who live in the quarters

of  their  employers or in institutional quarters.   I  think

these  are,  quite clearly, people deserving of  help  and  I

would  ask that the Minister amend the general rule  so  that

this  can  be  taken note of.  It may be necessary  for  such

people to come forward and identify themselves.  But I  think

there  would not be too many people and therefore  this  rule

could be considered.

<br><br><!-- Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau:</b> I agree with Prof. Toh's

concern.   There is this small group of people who are  often

left  out  because of our allocation criteria.   It  is  very

difficult to produce an allocation system which takes care of

all  groups.  I will look at this problem in detail  and  see

what  we  can do perhaps next time round, because I recognise

that there is some unfairness.  Although there is a provision

where  they can go to their CCCs or the CDCs to ask for help,

they  may feel reluctant to do so.  We will have to  look  at

the problem to see what can be done.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Toh See Kiat:</b> Sir, I thank the Minister

for his response and beg leave to withdraw my amendment.

No. (1), Mr Hawazi Daipi.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, I beg to move,

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the total sum to be allocated for Head T of the

Main Estimates be reduced by $100.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, people are our only resource. We have to maximise

our  manpower  resources in order to carve  a  niche  in  the

global  competition.  We have to ensure that our people  have

enough  jobs,  better  quality jobs in future,  in  order  to

sustain  high quality of life in Singapore.  But  competition

is  always  going  to  get keener as new  entrants  into  the

industrial  world  offer  cheaper manpower,  land  and  other

resource cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been able to stay ahead of our competition

because  our  manpower remains disciplined and  well-trained.

But we have to watch our competitors.  Even as we improve our

pre-employment education training, other countries, like  the

US  and  the  UK,  have also come up in  recent  years,  with

initiatives  to improve the quality of their  workforce.   We

are  competing not only with fellow developing countries  but

also  with  more  developed countries as our economy  becomes

more mature.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give an example, Sir, in the United States, a

Workforce  Investment  Act was enacted  in  1998  to  provide

greater   support  for  workforce  development  and   special

statutory  boards  were  set  up  to  implement  five  years'

strategic  plans for workforce development.  In the  UK,  the

British government launched a new National  Skills Agenda.  I

think  this was done last year.  Its primary objective is  to

boost workforce skills to support industrial development and,

more importantly,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 809</b></font><br><br>

to  sustain the country's international competitiveness.   So

we  have  to  watch our competitors as we try to improve  the

quality of our workforce.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To support new investments and jobs so that we can

sustain long-term economic development for Singapore  in  the

next  10  to  15  years, we need a workforce with  65%  post-secondary education.  I think we are on the way towards that.

But  at  the same time, half a million of our workers do  not

have  secondary qualification.  We have set up  the  Lifelong

Learning  Endowment Fund to ensure that our workers  will  be

able to take up skills training courses to improve themselves

in order to remain relevant.  However, we are a long way from

the target of helping so many workers to be retrained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the Manpower Minister for an update

on  the implementation of Manpower 21, in particular how  the

six   strategies  have  been  implemented  since  we  started

Manpower  21.  For example, for integrated manpower  planning

aspect of the Manpower 21, how do we plan for manpower  needs

of  certain industries when technology changes so  fast?   Is

our manpower planning cycle able to catch up with the changes

in technology?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On lifelong learning and lifelong employability, I would

like  to  ask  the Minister to give us some progress  on  the

retraining  programmes under SRP and other  training  in  the

programmes, and how we are going to cover training programmes

for  half  a  million  workers  who  do  not  have  secondary

qualifications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Sir, on augmentation of our talent pool. As we

need  foreign workers and foreign talent, what is the optimal

proportion of foreign workers and foreign talent that we  can

host  in  Singapore in the context of the needs  of  our  own

local workers?

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Sir, the Ministry of

Manpower is classified under the Economic Development  Sector

in the Government budget.  MOM has a total expenditure budget

of $184.15 million.  This comprises the operating

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 810</b></font><br><br>

expenditure   budget  of  $121.85  million  and   development

expenditure   budget   of   $62.3  million.    MOM's   budget

constitutes  only  0.66%,  two-thirds  of  1%  of  the  total

Government budget.  It has the lowest budget provision  among

all  the  Government Ministries.  I certainly hope that  this

low   budget  provision  does  not  reflect  the  value   and

importance  that  the Government has on the  only  asset  and

resource we have in Singapore, that is, our people.

<br>5.15 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am very impressed with the latest Annual Report,

called the Millennium Report, of the Ministry of Manpower for

the  year 1999/2000.  I only wish that more Singaporeans have

access  and read the wealth of information contained  in  the

Millennium Report.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans need to know the challenges we face in the

New   Economy.   Very  different  skills,  competencies   and

capabilities  will  be  required  in  working  in   the   new

commercial  and business environment.  To remain  employable,

workers will have to be knowledgeable, skilful and adaptable.

With threats, there are also opportunities for us to reap the

rewards in the New Economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to find out from the Minister how well

informed and prepared are Singaporeans for the pace of change

taking place in our economy.  Do Singaporeans have the  right

attitude and mindset to cope with the change brought about by

globalisation, information and communication technology?   Do

we  have the necessary manpower of the right calibre to  meet

the  needs  of the new manufacturing and services sectors  in

Singapore?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is necessary for us to address the needs of the

older  workers  who are less educated, having  little  or  no

skills  in  our society.  The Ministry of Manpower  and  NTUC

have done a great deal for them.  However, we must not ignore

the  growing  number  of  executives  and  middle  management

personnel who have been displaced by mergers and acquisitions

of companies, and business restructuring.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 811</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans  have  been retrenched in recent  years  because

their  companies have suffered losses or have been  relocated

to  other countries in the region.  May I ask the Minister to

give  us his views on the employment outlook in the next  few

years and into the future, if possible.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MOM is in the enviable position for the abundant

manpower  data  and  information that it possesses.   It  has

strong  links  with  companies  and  knows  their  employment

requirements.   It also knows by the issuance  of  employment

passes  and  work  permits,  how  many  expatriate  managers,

professionals  and foreign workers are working in  Singapore.

The  Ministry can be more proactive in sharing the employment

information  with  Singaporeans  because  they  are  in   the

excellent  position  to  provide  job-matching  services  for

Singaporeans  needing jobs or Singaporeans  who  want  a  job

change.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the local level, the CDCs are good links and networks

for  MOM to tap.  They can be one-stop shop for companies and

individuals  looking for work to connect  with  one  another.

MOM  can  facilitate  the process to  match  and  secure  the

productive  resources  and energies of  Singaporeans  through

gainful employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Ministry will actively look into providing

timely and good job information and job matching services for

both  the  companies and individuals.  With better employment

market   information,  we  can  reduce  wastage  and   better

utilisation of our limited manpower resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, can I move on to the next cut?

<br><br><!-- Mr Eugene Yap Giau Cheng (Mr Deputy Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Yes.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See:</b> On lifelong learning, Sir, the

Government  is  very  generous in  setting  up  the  $100,000

million Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund.  The NTUC and self-help   groups  are  also  providing  retraining  and   skills

redevelopment opportunities for those who need assistance for

upgrading.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 812</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, my concern is in the area of general attitude and

expectations  of  employers  and individuals  towards  skills

upgrading.  There are attitudinal and practical barriers that

need  addressing.  Perhaps, the Minister can  share  with  us

what incentives are in place to encourage as many individuals

as possible to take lifelong learning seriously.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I particularly like the initiative that the Ministry has

taken  under  the  Strategic Manpower  Conversion  Programme.

Here,  professionals  are channelled  into  strategic  growth

areas   through   conversion   training.    The   Information

Communication  Technology sector was piloted.   It  has  been

highly  successful  in  helping  many  individuals  make  the

switch.   I  wonder  if there are other  areas  that  can  be

included  in  the  programme.  I foresee  the  life  sciences

sector  as  one key growth area where many more professionals

will  be  required in the future.  There may be other sectors

in the pipeline.  Perhaps, the Minister can share with us the

steps  taken  by  his  Ministry to prepare  Singaporeans  for

lifelong learning for lifelong employability.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, the most valuable

asset  of Singapore of course is our human resource.  Because

this  is  one  of  our key building blocks  in  ensuring  the

continued competitiveness and survival of our economy.   This

is  even more so now in the new Internet-driven economy which

is  largely determined by the quality and brain power of  the

human  resources.  Over the years, the Government has  poured

in  substantial  amounts of public funds to  set  up  various

training   and   retraining  schemes.   The  Government   has

allocated   $200   million  for  the   Manpower   Development

Assistance  Scheme  (MDAS),  $100  million  for  the   Skills

Development  Fund  (SDF), and another $200  million  for  the

Skills  Redevelopment Programme (SRP). Recently, the Minister

announced  that  another $500 million will be  added  to  the

Lifelong  Learning Endowment Fund,  making  a  total  of   $1

billion.   This  Fund  is  set up to train  and  retrain  our

workers to upgrade their skills and knowledge.  We must  also

not  forget  the billions of dollars invested in  our  school

education system to ensure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 813</b></font><br><br>

that our new generation of workers are specially trained  and

possess the relevant skills for the new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the setting up of the various schemes is a move in

the  right  direction to upgrade the skills and knowledge  of

our  workers.   However, I must point out that  SDF  and  SRP

schemes are essentially employer-based.   In other words, the

courses that the workers would like to go to must be relevant

to  their work only. Only  then will the employers be willing

to  allow  them  to  go for training or retraining.    It  is

precisely  for  this reason that the NTUC  set  up  the  NTUC

Education and Training Fund (NETF), with the support  of  the

Government,  to  train union members on an individual  basis.

In  other words, the workers can apply to the NETF to finance

their training on some courses which are not directly related

to their work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund is a laudable

project.   But the question is:  how will the scheme  operate

and  how can workers benefit from such a scheme? I hope  that

the  Ministry  of  Manpower and the  relevant  agencies  will

quickly   work   out   proper  guidelines,   incentives   and

operational schemes so that our workers can tap into the fund

for  their skills upgrading purposes.  On this point, I  hope

that the scheme will be operated in different directions.  We

should   also  consider  allowing  every  eligible  Singapore

citizen to apply directly to this Lifelong Learning Endowment

Fund to pursue their skills upgrading courses.  While most of

our  employers  are  generally  supportive  of  training  the

workers,  it is just not possible for our workers to  go  for

training.   At the same time, there may be some  workers  who

may  want  to  attend  courses which,  in  the  view  of  the

employers,  are  not  directly relevant or  useful  to  their

future  career  development.  As  we  move  towards  the  new

economy,  our  workers'  skills  and  knowledge  will  become

obsolete  very fast and they are constantly put to test.   As

such, the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund should be operated

in  a flexible manner in order that it may enable our workers

to be quickly trained and retrained.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 814</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee:</b> Sir, I also read the Ministry of

Manpower's  Millennium  Report  and  it  is  indeed  a   very

impressive report.  I particularly like the transformation of

the  idea of Singapore as a little red dot to Singapore as  a

hot spot for talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Report speaks of the rapid advances in technology

and  intense global competition that will require our workers

to  develop  new  skills throughout their  lives.   That  the

Government  is committed to encourage and assist our  workers

to meet this challenge is clear, from the funding it has been

willing  to put to this cause.  For older and lesser educated

workers,  particularly, hundreds of millions of dollars  have

been committed to the Skills Redevelopment Programme and  the

Manpower Development Assistance Scheme.  However, as  it  has

been noted by speakers before, and also the Minister of State

for  Manpower,  in response to a Question in the  House  last

year,  our  biggest challenge now is not so much  in  finding

funds  for  upgrading,  but encouraging  both  employers  and

workers to come forward and utilise these incentives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, Sir, having made all that money available, have

we thoroughly investigated all the obstacles that are holding

people  back  from  accessing skills upgrading,  and  made  a

concerted  effort, including perhaps signing a small  portion

of  the  fund  to find ways to overcome them?   A  couple  of

routes come specifically to mind.  Firstly, older workers for

whom we may have classified as plain poor attitude may indeed

be  real  psychological  barriers and  anxiety  and  who  may

benefit from better structured encouragement and counselling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, workers who are holding down more than one job

to make ends meet.  How can they be assisted to find the time

or  get financial assistance to tide them through during  the

duration  of  the course?  And finally, single  parents  with

child  minding  responsibilities, mainly women.   Can  simple

baby-sitting  arrangements, for  example,  at  the  place  of

instruction  be  made so that this group who would  otherwise

not be able to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 815</b></font><br><br>

attend, especially for courses held in the evenings, can  now

have  the  opportunity?   With all the  good  intentions  and

efforts  that  have  gone into putting together  schemes  for

skills  upgrading,  I  am sure some additional  attention  to

addressing obstacles to the utilisation by target groups will

be well worth the effort.

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang (Minister for Manpower) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Manpower (Dr Lee Boon Yang):</b> Sir,

first,   may  I  thank  all  the  Members  who  have  spoken,

especially  those  who  have  complimented  the  Ministry  of

Manpower on its Millennium Report, or the Annual Report,  for

the last financial year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to address the points raised, particularly,

by  Mr  Hawazi  and also Mr Loh Meng See  in  regard  to  the

progress  that we are making in implementing the Manpower  21

strategies  and  in  getting Singaporeans  prepared  for  the

changes that are coming at a very rapid pace.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, over the last two years, we have certainly made

some  progress  in  regard to implementing  the  Manpower  21

strategies.   I  would like to highlight a  few  of  the  key

areas.   We have established an integrated manpower  planning

framework  to guide pre-employment training as  well  as  in-employment  training  under  the direction  of  the  National

Manpower  Council.  This Inter-Ministerial Council  seeks  to

identify   key  growth  areas  and  to  channel   appropriate

resources  to meet manpower demands in these growth  sectors.

It  is not going to be an easy task and we may not be able to

get it perfectly right all the time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the process of manpower planning, we should be

able  to better anticipate the rapid changes that are  taking

place  in  the  wake  of globalisation  and  also  develop  a

workforce with all the right mix of skills so that  they  can

help  us  to enhance our competitiveness.  In our studies  of

the  manpower demand from the various sectors of the economy,

it appears that, in the short term, manpower demand is likely

to   come   from   industries  like  computers,   information

technology, communications and media, financial

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 816</b></font><br><br>

inter-mediation, and the chemical industry which  forms  part

of  the  life sciences cluster.  In addition, manpower demand

in the social, healthcare and education services will also be

high in the near future.

<br>5.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we transit to the new economy, the demand for higher

skill  workers  in  professional,  technical  and  managerial

positions   will  increase,  particularly   in   the   growth

industries  in  the service and manufacturing sectors.   Sir,

this  phenomenon  is already evident.  As of September  2000,

vacancies for professionals, managers and technical personnel

form 35% of the total available job openings.  This is nearly

triple the 13% share that this group held in 1991.  There  is

also  an  increasing need for workers trained in  specialised

and  technical fields like engineering and the sciences.   In

the  new  economy,  comparative advantages will  increasingly

hinge  on innovations, development of new products,  and  the

ability  to  apply new technology as soon as  they  come  on-stream.   Hence, we need to have a strong base  of  engineers

and  technically-trained manpower to provide the backbone for

the manufacturing and key service sectors.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these industries and the employment

trend, the universities and polytechnics will increase  their

intakes   for   disciplines   such   as   info-communication,

engineering  and  the sciences, including life  sciences,  as

well  as education.  The ITE will also offer more places  for

its technical courses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the new economy, manpower planning must go beyond a

number-counting  exercise.   Besides  trying  to   anticipate

changes in manpower demand, we must provide more information,

and more timely information, to employers and workers so that

they  can respond swiftly to the changes taking place.   This

was  a point raised by Mr Loh Meng See also, about how we are

making information available to the workers.  Hence, we  have

established an enhanced National Manpower Information System

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 817</b></font><br><br>

to  provide  relevant manpower information to  policy-makers,

employers,  training providers and workers, to help  them  in

decision-making.  We have also made available many up-to-date

labour  market information and statistical releases, manpower

publications,  and  the  results of various  surveys  in  the

labour  market.   For  instance, Sir, we  will  be  releasing

information on employment trends and outlook for the  various

industries  by the end of March in print as well  as  on  the

Internet.  In order to give it wider circulation, we will put

most  of  these reports on the Internet so that they  can  be

conveniently  accessed by anybody with a  personal  computer.

Sir, our manpower planning framework is in place.  Of course,

it  has to be refined and will be refined.  It will be tuned,

with  the benefit of experience.  Over time, it should enable

us  to have a better qualitative and quantitative estimate of

our manpower demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I turn to life-long learning for life-long

employability.  This is one of the key strategies  under  the

Manpower  21 plan.  The Skills Redevelopment Programme  (SRP)

is  a  major  initiative in life-long learning.  For  FY2000,

about 23,000 workers participated in the SRP, an increase  of

about  60% over the 14,000 in FY1999.  More than 90% of these

trainees have no more than secondary education.  They are the

ones   who   will  benefit  tremendously  from   the   Skills

Redevelopment Programme, which has succeeded to  raise  their

skills level and enhance their employability.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A survey of SRP participants, jointly commissioned by my

Ministry  and the NTUC, showed that about 60% of the trainees

reported  an increase in their job scope after SRP  training.

In  other words, with SRP training, they were able to take on

more  responsibilities  at their place  of  work.   40%  also

enjoyed  a  pay increase, 70% of the employers reported  that

their  workers  were more productive after undergoing  Skills

Redevelopment Programme training.  As for retrenched  workers

who  took  part  in the training programme, 75%  secured  re-employment within six months of completion of their  training

courses.  These are encouraging

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 818</b></font><br><br>

results.  They show that training can make a difference.   We

will  continue  to work closely with NTUC to further  promote

the Skills Redevelopment Programme, and to convince even more

employers and workers to participate in the programme in  the

years ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, last year, my Ministry, together with the

Productivity and Standards Board, launched a National  Skills

Recognition  System, which is also aimed  at  helping  lower-educated  workers.   It  will  provide  open  entry  training

courses  and  skills upgrading for workers.  The training  is

designed  to  be job-specific and modular, with a  nationally

recognised skill certificate for each level achieved.  As the

skills  would  have  to  be  relevant  to  actual  jobs,  the

commitment and participation of industry groups and employers

are of utmost importance.  To date, 35 industries are already

in   the   process   of  implementing  the  National   Skills

Recognition  System.  Close  to  2,000  workers   have   been

assessed.   In the coming year, we will develop  more  skills

standards  covering more industries in different sectors  and

increase  the number of workers who can be trained,  assessed

and   certified.    The  National  Skills  Certificate   will

certainly help these workers to face the demands of  the  new

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, manpower development has also received an added

boost  with the creation of the $5 billion Lifelong  Learning

Endowment  Fund.   Already, the Government has  committed  $1

billion  to the endowment fund:  $500 million last year,  and

the  Minister  for  Finance, in his Budget  speech,  promised

another  $500  million  this year.  My  Ministry  is  working

closely  with  the Info-Communications Development  Authority

and  other agencies to launch the first major programme under

the  Lifelong  Learning Endowment Fund.   This  will  be  the

National Information Technology Literacy Programme which aims

to  reach  out and train 350,000 people over the  next  three

years,  in  basic  computer skills and teach them  sufficient

computer  skills  so  that they can surf  the  Internet,  for

instance.   It is a programme that will help all Singaporeans

to bridge the digital divide, and level up the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 819</b></font><br><br>

lower-educated  and older Singaporeans to  the  new  economy.

Currently,  we have spent about $1 million in developing  the

courseware and to run a pilot project involving 5,000  people

at several community clubs, Toa Payoh Community Library and a

few other locations.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, as I said earlier on, information is important.

Therefore, my Ministry has pioneered the establishment of the

first  one-stop Career Centre in July last year.  The  Centre

helps  individuals  in their job search,  career  management,

selection  of training courses, and training incentives.   It

also  helps  employers in their recruitment and  training  of

workers.   The  initial  results from  this  one-stop  Career

Centre  have been encouraging.  20% of those who came to  the

Centre for help in the first six months said that their visit

had helped them to secure a job.  Another 12% said that their

visit  had helped them to develop a better career plan.   10%

were  more  aware of the various training opportunities,  and

another 6% actually signed up for training courses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make it convenient for Singaporeans to access these

services, we will work with various partners, such  as  self-help groups and the Community Development Councils to provide

similar   services  at  other  convenient  locations.    This

reflects  the point that Mr Loh Meng See had made earlier  on

about the CDCs and other community groups playing their  role

as  part of the network to reach out to Singaporeans to  come

forward   to   take  advantage  of  our  life-long   learning

investments.   We  will  continue  to  work  with  all  these

community  organisations so that we can  bring  our  services

closer  to  the  people.   We are also  working  to  put  our

services, in terms of career guidance, job matching, training

information  over  the Internet for those who  are  Internet-savvy,  ie,  those  who  are already  capable  of  using  the

Internet, both the employers and the individuals.  But,  more

than  that, I think community organisations that want to help

us to reach out to the people can play a role here, by having

some of their service personnel trained to utilise our

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 820</b></font><br><br>

services  provided over the Internet, so that they  can  help

those  who  are  not Internet-enabled to have access  to  our

Internet  services with computers that are  provided  at  the

various centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next strategy of the Manpower 21 plan that I

want to touch on is the point about foreign talent, which  Mr

Hawazi mentioned.  Manpower 21 clearly recognises the need to

supplement  our  talent pool with foreign talent.   Over  the

last two years, we have embarked on a comprehensive revamp of

our  work  pass framework.  We have de-linked the  work  pass

framework  from  the immigration regulations, introduced  new

schemes  which  can  facilitate and encourage  the  entry  of

entrepreneurs into Singapore, coordinated the integration  of

talent  attraction activities across many economic  agencies,

and   put   in   place  an  international  talent  attraction

processing and settling-in service with an expanded chain  of

Contact Singapore offices around the world.  We have expanded

the  chain  from  seven offices in 1999 to 11 throughout  the

world.   In  the years ahead, we will continue to  strengthen

our  links with Singaporeans living overseas, and also  raise

awareness  among  global  talent  of  the  opportunities  and

challenges available in Singapore. We will join in the global

war for talent to seek our share of talent and to enhance our

capabilities in many different areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manpower 21 also recommended that we take steps to

transform   our  workplace  environment.   We  have   already

initiated measures and programmes to professionalise  certain

sectors  by encouraging and supporting the efforts  of  these

domestic-based  industries,  to  transform  and  upgrade  the

services that they offer and the jobs that they can offer  to

Singaporeans.  The examples include the Construction 21  plan

to  reinvent  the  construction industry, the  initiative  to

professionalise  the commercial cleaning industry,  steps  to

enhance  service  standards  and productivity  in  the  hotel

industry  and, most recently, the Productivity and  Standards

Board's  announcement of the Retail 21 plan  to  upgrade  and

transform the retail industry.  These efforts

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 821</b></font><br><br>

recognise the critical need to professionalise the  jobs  and

transform the workplace environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are also utilising funds provided under the

Manpower Development Assistance Scheme to set up new training

facilities for workers in industries which are moving  ahead,

to  improve  their  business model and redesign  their  jobs.

Such   investments  and  support  for  the  private  sector's

initiative  will  certainly play a part in  transforming  the

workplace   environment,  and  create  more  attractive   and

rewarding job opportunities for Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In implementing Manpower 21, my Ministry has also worked

closely  with  the  public, private and the  people  sectors.

Over  the  past  year,  for  instance,  we  implemented   the

Singapore   Learning  Initiative.   We  held  the   inaugural

Singapore  Learning Festival 2000, which is the anchor  event

to  promote life-long learning.  This event was held over two

weeks,  from  August  to September last year.   The  festival

generated  over  300  learning activities  by  65  partnering

organisations.   Nearly 150,000 people  participated  in  the

various  festival activities.  While this is  a  good  start,

more  has  to  be  done to inculcate a mindset  of  life-long

learning in our people.  We will use the lessons learnt  from

the  past  year  to  do  more in the coming  year,  including

redefining  and  improving  the Singapore  Learning  Festival

which will be held later this year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in summary, we have made progress in implementing

Manpower  21,  but there is still much to be done.   Business

environment and manpower demand are changing rapidly.  We are

still   in  the  early  stage  of  realising  Manpower   21's

objectives.   The effort to develop our human resource  is  a

long  and  continuing challenge.  It will  require  the  full

commitment  of workers and employers with Government  support

to achieve our objective of a globally competitive workforce.

<br>5.45 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi also asked what would be the optimal

proportion of foreign workers

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 822</b></font><br><br>

in Singapore, how do we balance the number of foreign workers

with  the  needs of Singaporeans.  This is an issue that  has

come  up  from time to time, as the number of foreign workers

in  Singapore increases over the years.  In fact,  it  is  an

emotive issue, but we cannot react emotionally to this issue.

We have to be rational, and be driven by economic principles.

The fact is that we do need foreign talents because they help

us  to  be more competitive in a global market.  They add  to

our  capability and help us to make up for the small  number.

Foreign   talents,   in   fact,  create   opportunities   for

Singaporeans.  If we adopt a closed door approach,  it  would

only  reduce our attractiveness as a business hub  and  force

investment to go elsewhere where talents are more welcomed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only last Friday, 9th March, I saw in the International

Herald  Tribunal an opinion piece headlined "The  trends:   A

worker-hungry Europe in need of immigrants".  I was a  little

surprised.  I  thought Europe still had a  high  unemployment

rate, although I knew that the European unemployment rate has

come  down  over the years, compared to what it  was  several

years ago, a double digit unemployment rate.  When I read the

article,  I  realise  that  the  writer  had  concluded  that

Europe's  declining birth rate, widening skills gap  and  the

growth  of  the  knowledge economy, can  only  be  solved  by

importing  talents, and not just talents in  the  information

technology area, but a whole range of talents with the  right

mix  of  skills needed by the growing industries.  I  believe

his observations are quite relevant to our situation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of what is the optimal number, I think

it  is  a  question of how fast is our economy  growing.   In

order to support the economic growth, in order to meet skills

needs  of  the employers and the new industries that  we  are

attracting to Singapore, we have to continue to adopt an open-door policy as far as foreign talents are concerned.  The way

to cope with rapid globalisation and changes is, in fact, not

to  keep foreign talents out.  If we keep them out, they will

just simply go elsewhere to compete against us.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 823</b></font><br><br>

most  effective way by which we can help Singaporeans  is  to

give  them the tools to compete.  Hence, the Government  will

continue  to  spend  a  large proportion  of  the  budget  on

education for young Singaporeans and our children.  For those

who are already in the workforce, we will continue to invest,

as  I  have described earlier on, in all our skills upgrading

programmes,  so  that older workers can continue  to  upgrade

their  skills and maintain their currency in the skills  that

are needed by the employers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I would like to address the point raised by Mr Loh

about  the plight of the middle aged managers and executives.

I recognise the difficulties that this group faces.  For many

affected managers and executives who are very experienced  in

their  kind of work and with many years of working experience

to  be  retrenched  is  a  tremendous  shock  and  a  serious

financial  setback.  But as I said, this is a group  that  is

already  skilled  and  fairly well-trained.   However,  as  a

result  of economic restructuring, they also face uncertainty

and  the prospect of retrenchment.  Their years of experience

may  have  become  irrelevant  as  industries  or  businesses

undergo radical changes and are completely transformed.   Let

me give you an example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local banks are streamlining their operations. Some of

them are closing down branches.    We have heard some Members

mentioning this problem during the Budget debate.  When  that

happens, not all the branch managers or the executives in the

larger branches can be re-deployed.  Some branch managers  or

executives may face retrenchment, including some of those who

have  many years of experience as the branch manager.  It  is

difficult  for this group who are middle-age, facing  such  a

situation,  to  be  retrenched and  having  to  look  for  an

alternative job.  Despite the difficulty, I think  there  are

opportunities available for them but they may  have  to  look

beyond their immediate working environment.  They may have to

be  prepared  to  look at allied sectors.   If  we  take  the

example of the bank manager or the branch manager

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 824</b></font><br><br>

in  the  bank  who has been retrenched, he may have  to  look

beyond  banking into insurance, other financial  services  or

commerce.   In other words, he must be prepared to widen  his

choice  of an alternative job and, at the same time, I  would

like   to   emphasise  that  despite  his  years  of  working

experience, he must also be prepared to make an effort to  go

out  and acquire additional and newer skills that are perhaps

more  relevant  to  the needs of the labour  market  at  this

moment.   And  last  but  not least,  when  faced  with  this

situation,  he may also have to be more realistic and  adjust

his expectation of what a new job can give him.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Loh supported the Strategic Manpower Conversion

Programme  (SMCP) which we introduced in May  last  year.   I

thank him for his support.  I just want to explain that  this

programme   is  aimed  at  facilitating  the  conversion   of

professionals to take advantage of job opportunities in high-growth   sectors.   We  started  out  by   looking   at   the

infocommunications because that is one area  where  there  is

strong demand for IT professionals.  We introduced the scheme

initially  as an employer-based scheme.  In other words,  you

can  only  have  access  to the training  and  the  financial

support through your employer.  But in October last year,  we

widened  the  scheme to an individual-based scheme,  so  that

even  an individual can apply for support under the Strategic

Manpower   Conversion  Programme  through  certain  appointed

organisations.  To-date, we have about 200 trainees  and  100

employers participating in the pilot programme.  Based on the

experience  of  this  small-scale pilot  programme,  we  will

expand  the  scheme  to  cover more  sectors  which  we  have

identified  to have a growing manpower need, and where  there

is  also a skill mismatch.  Managers and executives, who need

additional skills to fit into the new jobs, will benefit from

this scheme. They can, in future, sign on for such conversion

courses  which will prepare them for the new jobs in the  new

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ong Ah Heng has asked for support for workers to

acquire skills upgrading on their own, and whether they could

apply

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 825</b></font><br><br>

to  the  Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund for  some  support.

The  answer is yes.  As I have said, even in the case of  the

Strategic  Manpower  Conversion Programme,  we  are  allowing

individuals  to  make applications through appointed  agents.

The Computer Society is one of the appointed agents that will

help  us  to  promote  this programme.   Under  the  Lifelong

Learning  Endowment  Fund, we will also introduce  programmes

which are both employer-based and, at the same time, open  to

the individuals, the workers themselves can take advantage of

this programme, completely separate from what their employers

would provide in the normal course of their work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, I mentioned earlier on the National IT

Literacy  Programme.  This is a programme  that  is  entirely

community-based.  We will work with community  organisations.

Individuals  can apply for training under this programme  and

they  will  get  support,  both from  the  Lifelong  Learning

Endowment  Fund  and  also from the community  organisations.

Even the Skills Redevelopment Programme has got an individual

component in it.  I mentioned that we have 20,000-odd  people

trained  last  year.   We also have about 7,000  workers  who

went through the Skills Redevelopment Programme on their own,

without  the  backing  of employers because  these  were  the

workers  who  have  been retrenched. They  went  through  the

Skills Redevelopment Programme with the support of the  self-help  groups. So there is an individual element in the Skills

Redevelopment Programme.  Doors are open for individuals  who

want  to come forward to take advantage of the programme.   I

agree  with  Mr  Loh  that  what is  most  important  is  for

Singaporeans,  faced with this situation, to  quickly  change

their  mindset  and their attitude towards lifelong  learning

and upgrading their skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr Jennifer Lee made a very good observation that while

we  have  announced  so  many training  programmes,  so  much

resources are being pumped into skills upgrading and lifelong

learning,  how  many  people  are  coming  forward  to   take

advantage of this opportunity.  If you look

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 826</b></font><br><br>

at  the  Skills  Redevelopment  Programme,  we  have  made  a

tremendous effort to promote this programme and over the last

three years, about 46,000 people have come forward to sign up

and participate in the training places that have been offered

to  them.   Our target is 100,000 in five years.   We  are  a

little bit short, but we believe that with extra efforts this

year  and next year, we should be able to meet the target  of

100,000  workers that we set initially when we  launched  the

Skills   Redevelopment  Programme.   But  it   will   require

tremendous  effort  and  we need to  work  closely  with  the

National    Trades   Union   Congress,   and   the   employer

organisations  to  get  them to mobilise  their  workers,  to

incentivise their workers to go forward for training.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that for older workers, there are barriers.

It  is  very  difficult for them, having  joined  the  labour

market  25 years ago, and have not been back to the classroom

since  then,  to  begin to think about going  back  into  the

classroom to learn a new skill.  These are issues that we are

addressing  in the kind of training programmes  that  we  can

offer  and  the environment in which we provide the training.

We  will continue to improve the training methodology, course

materials and also make training much more accessible to  the

older  workers  who  may  be  very  hard  pressed  for  time,

including the group of workers that Dr Lee mentioned who  are

holding more than one job. That is why we emphasise part-time

training.  We understand that not many people can afford  the

luxury of taking time-off from their job completely to go for

six  months' full-time training course.  We, in fact, try  to

offer  as many of our skills upgrading programme on  a  part-time basis, working closely with the ITEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of single parents, these are issues

which  we  will  have  to address.  It  is  not  just  single

parents, but also housewives who have family duties, who have

young children to look after.  For instance, if we want  them

to come and join the National IT Literacy Programme, to learn

how  to  use the computer, we would have to see what are  the

barriers or difficulties that they face. That is why we

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 827</b></font><br><br>

want to work closely with community organisations, whether it

is  the  community club or the Community Development Council.

By  working closely with the community organisations, some of

these issues, like having a nearby child care centre that can

look after the kids for a couple of hours while the housewife

is  attending a course, are certainly possibilities  that  we

should examine.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have addressed the points raised by the

Members.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang (Cheng San)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, in

order to effectively deal with the competition and challenges

of  the  globalised economy, our workers today  must  undergo

many  cycles  of  training  and retraining  throughout  their

lifetime  in  order  to  remain employable.   The  Government

should  try  its  best to help these workers  deal  with  the

challenges.

<br>6.00 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very happy with the contributions made by the

Skills  Development  Fund (SDF) all these  years.   In  1999,

among  those  who were trained under the sponsorship  of  the

SDF,  the  ratio of workers aged 40 years and above has  been

increased to 1:5.  I would like to know whether the SDF  levy

would  be  pegged to the median wage.  In this way,  the  SDF

will  be able to grow and adjust automatically, so as  to  be

more responsive to the training needs of the workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are lucky to be able to create an average of

45,000  jobs  a year for our people.  However, we  are  still

unable  to  avoid  the  problem of  structural  unemployment,

because  the skill levels of some of  our workers are  unable

to  match the requirements of the new jobs created.  I  would

like  to  know whether the Ministry has any measures to  deal

with  this  problem, so as to prevent the gap  from  becoming

wider.   More  importantly, the Government should  strive  to

project  more  accurately the manpower needs of  the  various

sectors, so that workers will not choose the wrong skills  to

be trained and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 828</b></font><br><br>

face  being eliminated at the race.  Only accurate projection

of market skills requirement can effectively help our workers

to  take  on the relevant skills training and to successfully

migrate  to  the  job areas where their potentials  could  be

fully developed.   In this way, our workers, particularly the

older workers, will  remain employable.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann:</b> Sir, at the commencement of this

Budget  debate,  I  touched on the issue  of  retraining  and

employability.  If you recall, Sir, I had mentioned that  for

many of these older workers, the issue is not whether they go

for training and retraining, but one of re-employability post

training,  particularly for the older workers.   I  suggested

that  the Government should perhaps consider giving some  tax

incentives to the employers to help make it easier for  these

employees to be rehired.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his reply, the Minister said, and I summarise it in

my   own  words,  that  we  should  not  interfere  with  the

operations  of the market with such incentives,  which  would

distort  its  efficiency.  In other words, what it  means  is

that  the  Government will not, at this stage, be considering

proposals for tax incentives to encourage employers  to  hire

older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was hoping to hear that the Government will be

considering  any tax incentive at this stage.  As  you  know,

Sir,  a middle-aged employee, who was made redundant and went

for   retraining,  may  not  be  in  a  position  to  compete

effectively   with  the  younger  ones  who   are   similarly

qualified.   The older employee will probably require  higher

salary  because of his commitment to his family, but may  not

be  in  a  position  to dictate his requirements  because  of

competition  from the younger employee who, typically,  would

not  have as onerous a responsibility for family as the older

employee has.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we use tax incentives all the time to induce

certain  forms  of  behaviour from the taxpayer  or  even  to

address certain market conditions.  For instance, we give tax

incentives  to  foreign companies to induce them  to  set  up

operations in Singapore, to encourage spending in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 829</b></font><br><br>

R&D,  and  to raise funds in the capital market here.   These

incentives were given because we thought that such incentives

would be beneficial to Singapore in the long run.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, what we are asking for here is to level the playing

field,  shared  between the older and  the  younger  workers.

This, as I have argued earlier, is necessary to maintain  the

long-term cohesiveness of our society here.  For this reason,

therefore,  I  would  urge the Minister to  consider  such  a

scheme  of giving tax benefits to companies to make it easier

for them to hire older employees.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi:</b> Sir, we have increased our mandatory

retirement  age  to 62 years.  If we are to  follow  our  own

population trends, this will probably need to be increased to

65  years in the near future, as the average life span of all

Singaporeans increases.  Indeed, many in the old-age  bracket

enjoy  keeping  busy by continuing to work,  albeit  in  less

stressful   capacities,  not  only  because  it  keeps   them

physically and mentally healthy, but it is also because there

is  a psychological need to know that one is still useful and

financially independent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gone is the extended family system in which the

successive  younger  members of the  family  look  after  the

parents  and the older ones in the same household.  Most  old

parents  now  live  on  their own after  their  children  got

married  and  live apart, and thus have their  own  financial

commitments.   Our older workers, especially those  who  have

little personal savings due to low income, need to work  even

beyond the retirement age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our economy restructures further, we may face more

problems  in  finding  employment  for  older  workers.   The

situation  could  be due to shortcomings of both  sides,  ie,

from  the  older  workers  as well  as  the  employers.   The

Ministry  will surely  look into this matter to  ensure  that

the  impediments  to  employment of older  workers  would  be

removed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the side of older workers, there are those who could

have lost touch with the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 830</b></font><br><br>

latest  developments,  lack  the  required  skills  and   are

reluctant to go for training.  Some may not like the prospect

of their salary lower than the level they used to enjoy.  The

Government,  employers  as  well  as  the  NTUC  representing

workers   and   other  groups  have  established  programmes,

subsidised training, partial payment of salaries for  workers

to acquaint them with the latest developments and acquire new

skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times, the focus has been on older workers. These

efforts  have been boosted with the enactment of the Lifelong

Learning Endowment Fund.  This is one important way  to  help

our older workers meaningfully.  The task now is to encourage

older  workers  to  take up skills upgrading courses.   There

could  still be complacency among our older workers, to  take

advantage and act on the schemes available for them.   But  I

would  like  to  make  a  point that  employers  too  have  a

responsibility to encourage and support their  older  workers

to upgrade their skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Sir, there needs to be more effort on

the  part  of  the employers to start hiring  older  workers,

especially  when  they  have acquired  the  relevant  skills.

There  needs to be a change in the mindset of some  employers

with  regard  to older workers.  It is not uncommon  to  hear

that  workers above 40 years old, who have lost  their  jobs,

complain  that they have been turned away, because  they  are

considered too old.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some companies tend to generalise about older workers,

believing  that  older workers are likely to  get  sick  more

often,   and   are  slow  to  pick  up  new  skills.    These

generalisations do not fit many older workers, especially  in

an  ageless on-line environment that operates in an  industry

like  the IT industry.  In fact, many retrained older workers

combine professional experience with fresh IT skills.   Their

attitudes  are  progressive and  positive.   In  the  service

industry,  older workers bring a lot of wisdom  and  maturity

which   have  been  learned  on  the  job.   This  sense   of

responsibility is much greater, because of the financial  and

family commitment they have taken on with age.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 831</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers have also a lot of preconceived assumptions

about  older  workers.  For example, some assume  that  older

workers  will  be unwilling or unable to work  longer  hours,

which studies in the US have found to be untrue.  They assume

that  older  workers  will only be  willing  to  accept  high

salaries  without  even giving them the  opportunity  for  an

interview  and, worst of all, they assume that older  workers

have  less  commitment and energy, which is  untrue,  because

many  older workers are more committed to their careers after

spending much time and effort carving out a career.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I agree with Dr Jennifer Lee that perhaps, in some

instances,  it  is  timely that older workers  are  not  only

retrained   in  new  skills  but  also  offered  counselling,

including  how to present and approach prospective employers.

At  the same time, employers need to be more aware that  they

have  discriminatory assumptions which can  lead  them  to  a

wrong  conclusion about older workers.  In  the  face  of  an

ageing population, perhaps employers and employer federations

should   be   looking  at  ways  and  means  to  reduce   the

preconceptions  that  some of their  members  may  have.   In

unionised companies, I am sure we can work out ways  to  work

together  between the unions and the management  in  ensuring

that we can encourage more older workers to be retrained  and

to continue to enjoy employment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the part of the Government, I hope the Ministry can

assess  the implementation of the new retirement age  at  62.

Although  it  has been implemented only since 1999,  I  would

like to suggest that discussions among representatives of the

labour  movement, employers and the Government can be started

with  a  view  to  phasing  the  eventual  extension  of  the

retirement age to 67.  I think they have implemented the  new

retirement  age at 62 long enough to study the  problems  and

opportunities on both sides of workers and employers, and see

how we can extend to 65 first, and later to 67.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 832</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government can also help by encouraging more and

more  companies to embrace job redesign, so that  there  will

always be jobs that are relevant to older workers, especially

for  those who have put in many loyal years to the companies.

Through  job  redesigning, companies can  reassign  functions

which  are  suitable to the physical make up of  these  older

workers  without  having to bear too  much  additional  cost,

especially for workers who have attained relevant skills.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should companies resort to employing and be allowed

to  engage  foreign work permit holders when they can  employ

local workers who can do the same job?  I would like to  echo

the  views of some of our colleagues here, especially Mr  Sin

Boon  Ann who spoke before me, of the need to consider fiscal

incentives  in  order  to  encourage  employers  to  consider

employing older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the question of our older workers is not going away

with   the   recovery  of  our  economy  after  the  economic

recession.  In fact, I think we are going to face  more  such

problems  as  our  economy  continues  to  restructure.   The

tripartite  partners should work more closely to address  the

issue  of employment and re-employment of older workers,  and

even  facilitate contract work as well as part-time work,  so

that  we  can  help  our  older workers  to  continue  to  be

financially independent.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, recently, the

Government talked a lot about the Singapore 21 vision and  to

affirm  that every Singaporean counts.  The Manpower Ministry

also  published  a report called Manpower 21, which  contains

many  recommendations on how to meet the  needs  of  manpower

resources in the future.  But the report does not specify how

we  should solve the unemployment problem of the elderly  and

less  educated workers.  Although the retirement age has been

raised  to   62 years,  many people in the 40s told  me  that

when  they  went  to apply for jobs, they were  told  by  the

employers that they were too old to be employed.  Those  less

educated   or   uneducated  workers,  particularly   in   the

construction industry, are unable to find

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 833</b></font><br><br>

alternative  jobs once they are retrenched.   This  state  of

affairs  remains  the  same  ever  since  the  1998  regional

financial crisis.  I have, on more than one occasion,  raised

this  matter in Parliament, but I have not seen any  concrete

measures  being adopted by the Government to help  those  low

income workers.  Although the Prime Minister has appealed  to

employers  not  to discriminate against older  workers,  such

appeal seems to have fallen on deaf ears.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the Ministry of Manpower has all sorts of job

training  programmes.   But  according  to  a  Straits  Times

report,   a  survey conducted by MOM revealed that those  who

attended  the  skills upgrading programmes are  mostly  young

educated  workers.  That being the case, how do such training

programmes help the less educated workers?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have a few questions. First, what is MOM's

attitude  towards the plight of those less educated  workers?

Does  it  think that these people are beyond redemption,  and

are  better left to fend for themselves?  Second,  after  MOM

has  identified the causes for the reluctance of  these  less

educated and older workers to go for training, what is  MOM's

reaction?    Third,  has MOM formulated  a  policy  specially

tailored to address the unemployment problem of this group of

lowly paid workers?

<br>6.15 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Ah Heng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Ah Heng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, my main concern is

the  training of our older workers.  All along,  our  leaders

have called on our workers, especially older ones, to upgrade

their  skills because they are usually the ones  with  higher

risk  of  losing  their jobs.  While we fully understand  the

importance of skills upgrading, we must also be sensitive  to

the needs of older workers.  We must have read many times  in

the  papers  how our older workers, despite having  taken  up

advice to upgrade their skills, are still turned away at  job

interviews.  In many cases highlighted, it is not  that  they

do  not  possess the right skills or mindset, but more  often

than not, it is their age which prevents them from securing a

job.  Many employers though

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 834</b></font><br><br>

will  not openly admit this.  Although at the height  of  the

recession in 1998, the tripartite partners did come  up  with

some  form  of  guidelines not to discriminate against  older

workers, it seems this has fallen on deaf ears.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many older workers now want to know what the Government

has  done  or is planning to do to address the above worrying

trends.   From my feedback, individual Ministries  have  also

embarked   on   outsourcing  their  operations   to   private

contractors, for example, the Ministry of the Environment has

farmed  out some of its cleaning work to private contractors.

Many  older  workers  are  definitely  affected  in  such   a

situation.   Will  these private companies  continue  to  re-employ  these older workers?  If these older workers are  not

re-employed,  what happens to them?  Does the  Ministry  show

any concern to these workers or help them find alternative re-employment  with  these  new private contractors?   If  these

contractors  refuse to employ these older  workers,  does  it

mean  that  these  private contractors  will  go  to  recruit

younger  foreign workers?  Perhaps the Ministry  of  Manpower

should examine our existing recruitment policy and guidelines

on older workers employed in the public service and statutory

boards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although our leaders have helped these older workers to

seek  other  jobs,  very  few  concrete  measures  have  been

formulated to help them.  I hope that we will not  just  talk

about  it.  Therefore, I would urge MOM to take this lead  to

coordinate with the relevant Ministries and statutory  boards

to  set a good example by taking concrete measures to recruit

older workers in their departments.

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas:</b> Sir, I too add my voice to the plight

of  older  workers,  many  of them may  not  have  sufficient

schooling  or  skills.   They are at  the  greatest  risk  of

retrenchments and once they lose their jobs, it is  difficult

for  them  to get another job, even at a lower pay.   At  the

same time, these older workers need a job badly, because they

are  usually  at a phase in their life where their  financial

commitments are highest.  They have a mortgage

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 835</b></font><br><br>

to  settle,  children to educate and families to  take  care.

While they need jobs, employers are reluctant to employ older

workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We therefore need to get these employers to change their

attitude and values of these older people.  The needs of  the

older workers are beyond training and retraining.  They  need

counselling and assistance to learn how to learn.  If nothing

is done and the situation is allowed to continue, we could be

making  a  mockery  of our legislation on  the  extension  of

retirement  age.  Older workers may not be forced  to  retire

early,  but  they could be easily retrenched and not  be  re-employed  on  decent and dignified incomes.   We  should  not

allow  this  situation  to continue  and  I  would  urge  the

Minister to work on this with some urgency.

<br><br><!-- Mr Yeo Guat Kwang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Yeo Guat Kwang:</b> Sir, since many Members before me

have  mentioned about the issue, I would not want to  repeat,

but  would like to ask the Ministry whether it will  consider

raising  the  retirement age beyond  62  years  in  the  near

future.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong:</b> Sir, lately, when someone talks

about  lifelong learning, I observe that they like  to  quote

the Chinese saying of  "                            ."

While  older  workers understand the importance  of  lifelong

learning,  they  are more concerned about the their  lifelong

employability.  So they ask, can we "

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"? In short, they want to be reassured that after they

receive the necessary training, they can get a job, and  that

is crucial.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At many of the dialogue sessions, Singaporeans expressed

their concern that as more and more companies restructure and

with  the  development in technology, the older and the  less

educated   workers  tend  to  be  retrenched.   Despite   the

retraining  they  receive, they notice that employers  prefer

younger workers.  Thus, they perceive the age discrimination.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for those who have a job at the moment, they are also

worried about their

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 836</b></font><br><br>

job  security.   One union leader said at a  session,  and  I

quote,  "We need a job.  We older workers are concerned  that

if  we  are out of job, we have to go back home to  face  the

wife and the wall.  That will be very stressful."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, he received big applause from other fellow workers.

That  shows  that they all agreed with him that it  was  very

stressful without work.  But I do not know whether they  also

agreed  with him that facing the wife, and especially  facing

the wall at home, was also stressful.  But I can imagine that

life  without  a roof and four walls and without  a  wife  is

equally stressful.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"WWW" is the in-thing nowadays, which means world wide

web  to  the youngsters.  I was told that the soldiers  refer

"www" as wine, women and war.  But to the workers, especially

to the older ones, the "www" means work, wife and walls.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concern of age discrimination in the employment

market  should be addressed.  Recently, there was a  proposal

to  form  a  watchdog body similar to the  equal  opportunity

commission  found  in  the US, UK, Hong Kong  and  Australia.

Watchdog  body means another "W" which workers can  turn  to.

But,  in my view, our unions have been playing an active role

in  ensuring  that older workers are not being discriminated.

We  may  not  see eye to eye in some of the things  with  the

employers;  however, we should work hand  in  hand  with  the

management and Government in resolving this concern.  And, in

fact, this has happened in a smaller way in the petrochemical

industry  where  older workers are being  retrained  and  re-employed  after their retraining.  And I must admit  that  we

should  do  more  to  ensure  that  workers  are  not   being

discriminated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, I would like to urge the Minister to re-consider

if  an incentive package could be given to employers who  re-employ  older  workers  after  they  have  gone  through  the

retraining.  I believe this is one of the more effective ways

to   get   older  workers  employed.   Our  National   Skills

Recognition System has also created

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 837</b></font><br><br>

opportunities for workers to have their skills certified  and

made it easier for them to gain recognition by the employers.

It  is  through this concerted effort that the perception  of

age discrimination can be checked, and I believe that this is

a  more  pragmatic approach towards the issue and  to  ensure

that older workers will get the right type of "www".

<br><br><!-- Dr Lee Boon Yang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Lee Boon Yang:</b> Sir, let me respond to all the hon.

Members  who  spoke  so eloquently on  behalf  of  the  older

workers.   The  Government  shares their  concern  about  the

plight of the older workers, but we have to go about tackling

this  problem  in  a  rational  and  sound  way.   Structural

unemployment  -  higher unemployment rate for  older,  lower-skilled  workers  -  is  not  a problem  that  is  unique  to

Singapore.  It is a problem that is also being experienced in

other  countries.  You will see this problem emerging in  the

European  countries,  as stated in the  International  Herald

Tribune  article  last Friday which I mentioned  earlier  on.

They  also have a problem - ageing workforce, widening skills

gap;  as  a  result, older workers are having more difficulty

staying employed.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let us not fall into a rhetoric trap. Mr Low said,

"What has the Government done about these older workers?"  He

raised  several points.  What are our policies, what are  our

plans  to help the older workers?  He said that there are  no

concrete  measures by the Government.  I think that  is  very

far  from the truth of what has actually happened in the last

three  years.   Mr Low knows very well that we have  taken  a

very  strong interest and deep concern on the plight  of  the

older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example of what we have been doing.

We  actually  promote training for older  workers  much  more

aggressively than for any other sector.  We work closely with

both the Productivity and Standards Board, the NTUC and self-help  groups,  to  market  and to  package  skills  upgrading

programmes targeted at the older workers.  We even give older

workers  special funding support.  In the case of  those  who

are  40  and  above, we provide the higher level of  funding.

For instance, if a person, aged 40 and above,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 838</b></font><br><br>

signs  up for a SRP training programme, he will receive  100%

of  the  cost  fee  subsidy.  In other  words,  these  people

receive  free  training.  And if they are  already  employed,

then  their  employers  will  receive  85%  absentee  payroll

subsidy,  instead of 70% for the younger workers.   In  other

words,  there  is  already  additional  incentive  given   to

employers to train their older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have introduced measures to specially address the

needs of this older group of workers.  The first and foremost

issue  is  how do we equip the older workers with the  skills

that are needed in the workplace.  It is no use talking about

measures  to  help  them  get  jobs  if  the  older   workers

themselves do not have the skills for the jobs.  You can give

your employers all the tax incentives that they want, you can

give them all the benefits that they want, but if the workers

cannot  do the job because they do not have the skills,  then

they  will not be hired for the job.  Today's marketplace  is

very  competitive.  If you do not have the workers  with  the

right  set  of  skills, who can deliver the  product  or  the

service  productively and efficiently, you  will  go  out  of

business.  No amount of tax incentives can help you  to  stay

in business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the first and foremost challenge is to equip our

older  workers with the right skill set, and this is what  we

are  doing.  That is why we are providing more incentives for

the  older  workers.   That is why  we  have  introduced  the

National Skills Recognition System, which is aimed at meeting

the  skills  upgrading needs of older workers who lack  basic

education.   That  is why we design the  system  to  be  open

entry.  In other words, anybody can walk in and sign on for a

course under the National Skills Recognition System.  You  do

not  need to have a Secondary Four Leaving Certificate.   You

do  not need to have completed your Secondary Three.  You  do

not  even need to have completed your PSLE.  All you need  to

do  is to show an interest in upgrading your skills.  We will

find  you  an  appropriate  area where  your  skills  can  be

upgraded,  certified, and we will then help you  to  find  an

appropriate job.  So I think that is the most important

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 839</b></font><br><br>

thing,  and  we should not be distracted by this  feeling  of

hopelessness, that there is nothing we can do about it.  That

is  far  from  the truth.  The truth is that  we  are  making

tremendous effort to address the needs of the older  workers,

and we will continue to do so, but in a coherent and sensible

manner that will yield results.

<br>6.30 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I would also like to point out that, of the

40,000  workers who have gone for skills upgrading under  the

Skills Redevelopment Programme, about 30% of them are in fact

the older workers.  So older workers are receiving their fair

share of support, in terms of skills upgrading and, as I have

said  earlier  on  when I reported on  the  progress  of  the

Manpower  21  Plan,  those who have been through  the  Skills

Redevelopment Programme actually saw enhancement in their job

capability  and 40% had increases in pay.  And employers  saw

them  as  being  more productive workers.  So these  findings

confirm what we believe, that an older worker can be equally,

if  not,  more productive and efficient as a younger  worker.

And  employers should of course give older workers  a  chance

for  any  job vacancy that is available provided, of  course,

that  the older worker himself has taken the trouble to equip

himself with the right skills and right competency to be able

to cope with the job.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Skills Development Fund also supports about 160,000

training  places  for older workers last year.   This  is  an

increase from 130,000 training places that were supported  by

the  Skills Development Fund for older workers.  So  in  many

different  areas, we are reaching out to the older  group  of

Singaporeans  by  helping  them to upgrade  their  skills  to

prepare them for the knowledge-based economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yeo Guat Kwang has asked whether the skills

development levy will be linked to the median wage level.  We

have announced that when we were going to increase the skills

development levy.  We will also make regular adjustment.  The

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 840</b></font><br><br>

announcement was made last year and what we said was that  we

would adjust the skills development levy contribution ceiling

to  $2,000 by the year 2004.  The first increase from  $1,000

to  $1,500  took  effect  only on 1st  July  last  year  and,

subsequently, we will raise it in steps, $1,800 in  2002  and

then  $2,000  in  2004.  This we have already announced  last

year  and  we have implemented it in July last year.   Beyond

2004,  we  will  review whether we need regular  updating  or

review  of  the  ceiling, or peg it  to  some  measures,  for

instance, such as the median wage level.  We will have a look

at it again after 2004.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi and, again, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang also asked

whether we would raise the retirement age currently pegged at

62.   We  introduced this minimum retirement age or statutory

retirement age of 62 in 1999.  So we have about two years  of

experience to work with this new retirement age.  We will  be

looking  at  whether there is a need to review this  at  this

juncture.   Of  course,  in  the  longer  term,  Government's

intention is to raise the retirement age to 67.  The question

is whether we should now introduce a higher retirement age of

65,  at  this  juncture, or we should wait till the  economic

situation becomes more stable before we initiate this review.

We  would  like to wait a little bit longer to  see  what  is

going  to  happen  in the light of the possibility  that  the

economy  will slow down before we make another move.   So  we

will  have to wait till the later part of the year  after  we

have  a  clearer feel of the economy in the next one  or  two

years before we commence a review.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me reassure Members that the intention remains

the  same.   We  intend to raise the retirement  age  at  the

appropriate time from 62 to 65, and then on to 67.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the Members have basically raised the same

point  about  what  we  are going to do  to  help  the  older

workers.  Mr Seng Han Thong spoke about the older workers and

asked   whether  we  could  reconsider  incentives   to   the

employers.  My point is that, in response to Mr Seng  and  Mr

Sin  Boon Ann's request for tax incentives, we should not  go

in and micro

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 841</b></font><br><br>

manage and interfere in the labour market in this fashion  to

the  point  where you would say that if you employ  an  older

worker,  I  would  give you a special incentive  or  subsidy.

What  we should do is we should ensure that the older workers

are  fully  equipped with the skills that will be needed  for

the  job.   But at the same time, we should not make  it  too

easy  for  employers  to substitute our  local  workers  with

foreign  workers.  That is why we will continue, and  I  will

touch  on  it  later on in our discussion on the  section  on

foreign  workers, to have restrictive measures in place  with

regard  to  the entry of lower skilled foreign  workers,  ie,

work permit holders.  This is to ensure that our employers do

not become overly dependent on foreign workers at the expense

of our Singaporean workers, particularly the older workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if we take that approach, we make every effort to

train our older workers to give them the new skills that  are

in  demand  and, if the older workers respond  positively  by

coming  forward  to accept the training,  then  we  would  be

making some headway in resolving this problem.  It was Mr Low

who  mentioned  that  the training went only  to  the  better

educated  workers and that we had ignored the older  workers.

That  is not true.  As I said earlier, in my response on  the

Skills Redevelopment Programme, a lot of efforts have gone to

the older workers and older workers have come forward.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is true is that among those who did not undergo any

skills  upgrading, many of them are in fact  the  unemployed.

They  are in fact the group most in need.  They had not  gone

for  the  skills  upgrading.  That is why they  still  remain

unemployed  because  they have not got the  skills  that  the

employers need.  So, in effect, what we need to do is to  get

this group of unemployed, particularly, the older unemployed,

to  come  forward to take advantage of our various  upgrading

and retraining programmes so that they can acquire new skills

and  then we can be in a better position to help them to look

for new jobs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Hawazi mentioned about the contract and part-time

work, as a measure

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 842</b></font><br><br>

to  help  older workers.  That is one possible approach.   We

will  look  at how part-time work and contract  work  can  be

better  organised  in order to create more job  opportunities

for  older  workers.  But the flip side of the coin  is  that

some  older  workers  do not want to hold  a  full-time  job,

particularly  those  who  are near their  retirement  age  or

already  past the age of 62.  They are fit, they are healthy,

they are able bodied and they can work.  But they do not want

to  hold  a full-time job.  So for this group, maybe a  part-time or contract work may be useful for them.  So we will  be

looking  at  how this can be further improved and  made  more

attractive  so that they will remain gainfully employed  and,

in a way, also contribute to our manpower resources.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but not least, I would like to reiterate the point

that,  as  far  as  the  older workers  are  concerned,  some

employers  may  have  a  misconception  that  they  are  less

capable,  less  productive, less efficient.  Mr  Hawazi  also

made the point that employers should be more prepared to give

older workers an opportunity.  As the Government, what we can

do  is to help employers who are willing to take this step to

ensure  that  the  older workers that he  recruits  would  be

trained  to  the  skill level that he  needs.   And  this  is

precisely  what  we  are  doing through  the  various  skills

upgrading  programme that we have already put in place.   Any

employer  who today wants to employ an older worker,  but  is

not  quite certain of his capability, can always recruit  the

worker and then have the worker trained, or skills certified,

so that they can be assured that he will be able to do a good

job once he is hired.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point that Mr Hawazi mentioned is the fact

that  older workers do not only need the training  or  skills

upgrading, they also need some counselling.  I agree with him

entirely.  This is the same point that Dr Jennifer  Lee  made

earlier  on  that they need more than just skills  upgrading.

They  need some guidance, they need some counselling.  For  a

start,  even in skills upgrading, they need to be  guided  in

what type, which area to go in for and which area of skills

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 843</b></font><br><br>

upgrading should they embark on because they may not be aware

of  the  changes that have taken place in the labour  market,

that  the  demand for skills set has changed.  And  today,  a

whole new set of skills is being required by employers.  That

is  why we are pioneering this one-stop career centre and  we

want  to work with the community organisations to expand this

network so that workers, particularly older workers, can have

easy  access  to  such counselling services  where  they  can

approach  professionals who are well informed of  the  labour

market  trends and demands of the growth sectors  where  jobs

are  plentiful,  but jobs which require workers  with  higher

skills.   So older workers can go to one-stop career  centres

to seek advice and counselling.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have indicated earlier on, in my response on the

progress  of  Manpower 21 strategy, that the result  that  we

have  got from our one-stop career centre at the Ministry  of

Manpower has been quite encouraging.  People who turn up have

found  it useful.  We would like to multiply this experience.

We  would like to increase the number of such centres.  It is

best to have them located conveniently in the housing estates

so  that older workers, housewives and women who have  family

duties  can all turn up.  If they need advice or counselling,

it can be made available to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I think I have covered the points that were raised.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang:</b> May I seek clarification from the

Minister?   Sir, I understand there were various  programmes,

like Skills Redevelopment Programme (SRP).

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 844</b></font><br><br>

My  point  is whether these programmes are focused enough  to

solve  the  problem  of  the  unemployed  older  workers.   I

understand  that  only  about  23%  of  older  workers   have

participated  in  the programme.  Is the  Minister  satisfied

with  the  participation rate of the  older  workers  in  the

training  programme?  The Minister is correct in saying  that

the  unemployed  older workers are the main problem  now.   I

would  like to know from the Minister what he has in mind  in

reaching  out  to  this  group of workers  specifically,  and

design  programmes for them in order that  they  can  be  re-employed.   Lastly,  I would like to know from  the  Minister

what  is  the  macro level of the problem  and  what  is  the

magnitude  of  the problem of this group of workers  who  are

older and less educated.  And what is the target, ie, whether

the  Ministry has set any target to reach them and to resolve

the problem?
