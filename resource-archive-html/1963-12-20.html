<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resumption of debate on Question

[19th December, 1963], "That the Bill be now read a

Second time.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.31 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The Deputy Prime Minister was

speaking in reply yesterday when he was interrupted

at  the  moment  of interruption. Does  the  Deputy

Prime Minister wish to speak further?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):

Just  one  line. Mr Speaker, I was  going  to  end

yesterday rebutting the Member for Hong Lim who had

earlier  on suggested that there was an attempt  by

the   Government  to  fiddle  with  the   electoral

registers. I would only like to remind him that the

results of the elections depend upon those who cast

votes themselves. They are human beings who must be

present  in  person. And being human  beings,  they

will  not  like, without their own consent,  to  be

transferred from one electoral district to another.

Therefore, it is not possible at all to fiddle with

the  electoral  registers to  anybody's  particular

advantage. It is not the electoral registers  which

decide victory or defeat for a candidate, but



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>



it  is  the  electorate  themselves  who  make  the

decision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. -[Dr Toh Chin Chye]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1050</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4><div align="center"><b>SINGAPORE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS</b></div></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>(AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Mr Speaker, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This amendment Bill is being introduced partly in

the  light of experience that has been acquired  by

the  Elections Office over the past years.  As  the

list  of  claimants after the register of  electors

and Lists A and B have been exhibited to the public

has  increased enormously from about 9,000 in  1959

to  22,500  in 1963, more time is now required  for

the  registration  of  these  claimants.  This   is

provided for in clause 2 of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 proposes an amendment to reduce the

period  between the date of issue of  the  Writ  of

Election and Nomination Day from nine days to  five

days.  I  would like to point out that this  is  in

accord  with  the  practice in the  United  Kingdom

where  from the time the Returning Officer receives

the  Writ  up to the Day of Nomination, the  period

can  be  calculated to be about five days.  In  the

United  Kingdom, however, this period of five  days

is  the maximum and cannot be increased by statute,

whereas  in  Singapore the provision which  we  are

asking  now  of  five days should  be  the  minimum

period  and this period could be increased to  more

than five days, if at any time it is desired to  do

so.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1051</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment in clause 4 is consequential to the

amendment in clause 3 if this is accepted. It seeks

to reduce the period between the publication of the

Notice  of  Election by the Returning  Officer  and

Nomination Day from five days to four days. This is

in  line  with the reduction of the period  between

the  date  of  issue of the Writ  of  Election  and

Nomination Day as proposed in clause 3. The  number

of  days  between  the Notice of  Election  by  the

Returning  Officer  and  Nomination  Day   can   be

calculated to be the same as in the United Kingdom.

It is considered that the publication of the notice

by  the Returning Officer at least four clear  days

before  Nomination  Day  is  sufficient  notice  to

prospective candidates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 suggests removing the limitation in the

present Ordinance which stipulates that Polling Day

shall  be  a  Saturday.  There  is,  in  fact,   no

justification for this limitation at all. There has

been  some doubt as to whether Polling Day being  a

holiday  should  or  should  not  be  counted   for

purposes of determining the minimum number of  days

required  between the publication by the  Returning

Officer  of  the notice of contested elections  and

Polling  Day. This amendment is for the purpose  of

clearing that doubt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed in clause 6 follow the

provision  in  the  National Referendum  Ordinance,

which  are necessary to ensure that on Polling  Day

there is no canvassing or undue influence exercised

on  electors who should be allowed to consider  the

platform  of  the  various  political  Parties  and

candidates   and  vote  according  to  their   best

judgment and free will.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention of clause 7 is to prohibit secret

society  gangsters who are under Police Supervision

Order from taking part in any election activity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 8 empowers the Returning Officer

to  use  free  of charge as a Polling  Station  any

school  or portion thereof for the purposes of  any

election.  In  the past it has been found  that  on

occasions  persons  who  were  in  charge  of   the

premises of certain private



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1052</b></font><br><br>



schools  were  reluctant  to  allow  the  Returning

Officer  to  use  the schools as polling  stations.

Although   the  amendment  empowers  the  Returning

Officer  to  use such schools as polling  stations,

the  power  will not be exercised except in  places

where  no other suitable building or place where  a

temporary  building could be erected can be  found.

This  applies mainly to the crowded city area where

it   is  difficult  to  find  suitable  alternative

buildings  or vacant sites for temporary  buildings

to serve as polling stations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Lian Teng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Lian Teng (Bukit Panjang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  in regard  to  this  Singapore

Legislative  Assembly  Elections  (Amendment)  Bill

introduced by the P.A.P. I have great doubts as  to

the  true  practice of parliamentary  democracy.  I

fear that they want to resort to legal means to put

into effect their dictatorial measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of democracy is still being limited by

this  Bill. Originally the period between the issue

of  Writ  of Elections and Nomination Day was  nine

days.  It  is  now the desire of the Government  to

reduce  it to five days. To the Party in power,  of

course,   there   will   be   no   difficulty    or

inconvenience, but to the Opposition Parties  there

will  be great difficulty and hardship because  all

the  disadvantages of the reduction of  the  period

fall on the Opposition Parties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Writ of Elections is issued by the Party in

power,  and not by any Opposition Party. Therefore,

only the Party in power know when they are going to

issue  the Writ. So their intention is not  to  let

the  Opposition  know  or to have  enough  time  to

prepare  for elections. Even in the recent  general

elections, the period was nine days from Nomination

Day  to  Polling Day. So the total period would  be

two  weeks  from the issue of Writ of Elections  to

Polling   Day.   This  period  of  two   weeks   is

insufficient  to  Opposition Parties  because  they

have to carry out election work,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1053</b></font><br><br>



such as printing publicity material, the choice  of

candidates  and election campaigning.  But  to  the

Party in power this is not so, because they know it

in  advance. I heard that publicity and  propaganda

material had, long before the general election  was

held,  been  printed in Hong Kong. They  are  in  a

position  to know the date of any pending  election

and   could  take  advantage  of  it.  We  in   the

Opposition do not have that advantage. We  are  put

at  a  disadvantage. Of course, the Party in  power

can  argue that they have fighters and that we  too

have  fighters. Therefore, they say it is fair.  In

actual fact, it is not so. The Party in power is in

control  of all publicity and propaganda machinery.

They can, therefore, carry on a propaganda campaign

on  a  long-term basis for the elections.  They  do

this,  of course, through the Press, the radio  and

television.  Their candidates will not be  arrested

by  anybody.  The  Party in power can  abuse  their

power  by arresting prospective candidates who  are

in  the  Opposition.  There is clear  and  concrete

evidence  to  show  this. Many of  our  prospective

candidates  were  arrested  prior  to  the  general

elections.  This  caused great  difficulty  to  our

Party.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The P.A.P. can, of course, argue that the

Government  have still afforded us the  opportunity

and   facilities  to  take  part  in  the   general

elections,  and that we are free to carry  on  with

our  propaganda  work  like  the  holding  of  mass

rallies.   But   we   are   only   afforded    such

opportunities  during  the  period  of  nine   days

allowed   to   us.   We  are  not   afforded   such

opportunities or facilities on other days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of this Bill is this. Clause 6

gives  strong powers to the police. This  provision

is  similar  to  the one in the Singapore  National

Referendum Ordinance of 1962. This clause  provides

that  no  person  can, on Polling  Day,  enter  two

houses  or  places of work of the electors  in  the

same polling district other than his own home. If



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1054</b></font><br><br>



he  is  seen  doing that, he will be committing  an

offence  under the provisions of this Bill,  unless

he  can  prove to the contrary. It also  gives  the

Commissioner of Police very great powers in dealing

with these matters. The police can enter and search

any   premises   or  place  for  the   purpose   of

ascertaining  whether  such  an  offence  is  being

committed.  The P.A.P. may abuse these powers  when

applying   these   provisions.   People   will   be

intimidated. This provision will create fear in the

electors.  When we consider all the  provisions  of

this  Bill, we can see that Polling Day will  be  a

day  of  terror when these rules are applied.  This

will  be  so  if  we  take into  consideration  the

provisions in clause 3. For instance, a hawker will

he prohibited from carrying on his trade on Polling

Day  according  to the provisions of  this  clause.

This  is  because he is not allowed to  enter  more

than two houses. Even those people who want to call

on  their friends will be committing an offence  if

they do so. Hawkers and shop assistants who wish to

deliver  their goods will have to enter  more  than

two  houses, but this will be construed  as  having

committed  an  offence.  Nobody  will  dare  to  go

anywhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this, it is the practice of the

P.A.P. to   intimidate  and  coerce  people,   by

propaganda  and other means, saying  that  if  they

carry  on  certain  activities  or  take  part   in

election campaigns, they will be arrested. There is

thus  an  atmosphere of terror.  There  will  be  a

reduction in the period from nine days to five days

in  regard to the period between the issue  of  the

Writ  of  Elections and Nomination Day. We can  see

from   this   whether  or  not   the   P.A.P. are

dictatorial.  This  shows  that  the  P.A.P. have

ignored the principles of democracy in the interest

of  the Party. I think democracy is the monopoly of

the   P.A.P.   They   can  pass  unreasonable   and

undemocratic  laws in this House. After  that  they

implement the laws outside this Assembly. They then

turn  round and say that they are doing  things  in

accordance with the laws passed in this House. As a

matter  of fact, they are doing things contrary  to

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1055</b></font><br><br>



principles  of  democracy. This is not  justice  as

embodied in the term "democracy". If they  want  to

achieve their aim by this kind of legislation, then

I  advise  them to introduce a Bill in  this  House

whereby they can deprive others of any right.  They

have  a majority in this House. They can also  turn

round  and say that they have that right under  the

law. If they wish to be so undemocratic, they might

as  well  pass a law to say that the victims  of  a

robbery are guilty and the robbers are innocent. It

is  entirely wrong in principle for the  P.A.P. to

legislate  laws  from the point of  view  of  their

Party's interest.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chow Chiok Hock -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chow Chiok Hock (Ulu Pandan)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr  Speaker, I believe you will agree with me that

an  election  is a special feature in a  democratic

country.  It  is  a peaceful method  by  which  the

people  can  express  their wish.  The  people  can

decide  the  future  of their country  through  the

ballot  box. I would like to tell the Back-benchers

that  whether  the Opposition Members  have  enough

time  for propaganda or not does not depend on  the

number  of days allowed for electioneering. Whether

a  candidate of the Opposition is good or bad  will

depend on what he has done in the past. A candidate

cannot  convince the people that he is good  during

the few days allowed for electioneering. Whether he

is good or bad will depend on what he has done over

a long period of time. They have complained that we

have  not given them enough time to carry out their

election  campaign in the rural  areas.  Voting  is

secret  and the choice of a candidate is determined

in  a  free  manner. There is no humbug  about  it.

Nobody  can  force another person  to  vote  for  a

certain candidate. If one says that the voters  can

be made use of during the election to bring victory

to  another Party, then I say, in my view, this  is

impossible. Nobody will ever be used or will  agree

to  any  interference of their freedom.  Canvassing

actually is a method by which interference of  this

nature  is  effected. This was done by the  Barisan

Sosialis during the last election. That is why they

were able to win a few seats.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1056</b></font><br><br>



Their  own  candidates had to resort to  canvassing

and  other  illegal means. For example, the  Member

for  Bukit  Merah  had not intended  to  stand  for

election in his constituency. But a few days before

Nomination  Day,  a  few  leading  figures  of  the

Barisan Sosialis were sent to his house in order to

persuade  him to stand for election. They  promised

him  certain conditions in the event of  a  Barisan

victory. They threatened him by saying that  should

he  refuse  to stand for election, his position  in

Nanyang University would be made untenable. This is

what  they did. I personally feel that if we really

want  to  safeguard the democratic system  and  the

rights  of the people, then we must give sufficient

powers  to  the  police to protect the  rights  and

security  of  the  people. But the Communists  will

always  make  use  of  the  democratic  system   to

undermine  the system itself. That is to say,  they

are  making use of democracy to undermine democracy

itself. We hope that through the provisions of this

Bill,   the  true  spirit  of  democracy  will   be

safeguarded  and maintained. This will ensure  that

those who act foolishly and in the dark will not be

able to do so again in the future.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak (Tampines)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  we have different kinds of elections.  We

have  democratic  elections as well  as  dirty  and

filthy  elections.  There are elections  which  are

carried  out  fairly  and  justly  and  there   are

elections  which  are  rigged.  [Interruption]  The

Member for Jalan Besar does not know of a story  of

a  King who was elected by the people. I will  tell

him.  In  the 19th century, Napoleon II  of  France

made  a law to force the people of France to  elect

him  as  a King and he received a hundred per  cent

votes. Does the Member know about this? If he  does

not  know  it,  he should go and read  his  history

books. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. Will the Parliamentary

Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs  allow

the  Member for Tampines to proceed? The Member for

Tampines  is  now telling us stories which  do  not

appear to be relevant to this Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1057</b></font><br><br>



I know the Member was led into it by interruptions.

But please get on with the debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

was  just  saying  that  there  are  all  kinds  of

elections. But it does not mean that an election is

and can represent the true spirit of democracy.  If

an  election  is  conducted fairly and  justly,  of

course,  we  cannot deny that it  is  a  democratic

election.  But if an election is done in  a  filthy

way  and  is  a  humbug, then it is  a  dictatorial

election. So one must not say that because  in  the

last general election the P.A.P. obtained 37 seats,

then it must be a democratic election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a peaceful election and a violent

election.  I  think they had better  listen  to  me

carefully  and  quietly.  What  is  the  difference

between a violent election and a peaceful election?

My friends opposite must pay attention to what I am

going  to  say. If you have basic common  knowledge

and  common  sense,  you will recall  that  in  the

recent  elections in South Korea and Japan,  voters

were forced to take part in the elections, and many

of  them  were slaughtered and killed in these  two

places.   Here  in  Singapore,  similar   incidents

occurred  in  which Barisan Sosialis  workers  were

assaulted.   Can  you  say  this  was  a   peaceful

election?  Can  you  say  it  was  conducted  in  a

peaceful  manner? There should be  an  election  in

which  the  voters can express their views  freely.

But  in certain circumstances force was used on the

voters.  Violence too was used. So  let  them  stop

talking  about the last election and claim that  it

was  a peaceful election. I must say that the  last

election and future elections will not be conducted

freely   because  of  the  number   of   days   for

campaigning which has been reduced from 9 to 5.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference was made about the Member for Bukit

Merah. Who was actually guilty of deception? It was

not  the  Barisan  Sosialis.  Who  was  guilty   of

intimidation? It was the P.A.P. and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1058</b></font><br><br>



Prime   Minister.   We   already   know   how   the

intimidation was done ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> On a point of order. We are talking about

this  Elections Bill. We are not talking about what

has  happened.  We  do not want to  listen  to  the

figment  of imagination of the Opposition  of  what

happened.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> It is true, Mr Minister. What the

Member  for  Tampines is doing is  replying  to  an

allegation made by the Member for Ulu Pandan  about

the  election in Bukit Merah. Surely he has a right

to reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, I am not aware that

the Member for Ulu Pandan did that.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> He did that. The Member for Ulu

Pandan  cast  some aspersions on  the  election  in

<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. All that the Minister was

doing was to come up on a point of order, which  is

very  proper.  The  Member  should  not  make   any

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Improper allegations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I am

sorry.  I  asked him not to be excited. I  did  not

mean  to  say that he must behave himself. I  asked

him to be calm and not to be excited. That was what

I meant ---



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, the Member is

taking  advantage of your ignorance of the  Chinese

language.  I  think  he  was  just  fooling  around

because  what he said was "Luan, Luan  lai",  which

means  "rubbish". Now he turns round and says  that

what he said was "slowly, slowly".

<br><br><!-- Mr Poh Ber Liak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Poh Ber Liak</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, I

just do not understand whether our Member for Bukit

Merah  has authorised the Member opposite to  speak

on  his  behalf,  or whether the  Barisan  Sosialis

Headquarters  have given authority to  the  Members

opposite  to make reports to this House  about  the

candidature of the Member for Bukit Merah.  I  just

do  not  understand  at all, it  appears  that  our

rights  as a Party and the Party's internal affairs

and  decisions  made  by the  Party  were  made  in

consultation with Members opposite. I just  do  not

understand why he should smear our Member for Bukit

Merah.  It  looks as though he is  jealous  of  our

success in Bukit Merah.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Member  for Tampines is quite a historian. He  has

given  us a list of the various types of elections.

But  I  think he has forgotten one particular type.

Does  he  know  there is one great country,  a  big

country where, during election time, there is  only

a  single list of candidates and no one ever loses?

Everyone wins! That is the kind of country that  he

admires. I should remind him that there is only one

Party  candidate  and no one  else.  But  maybe  he

prefers  that  one. When they talk about  elections

being  undemocratic and so on, well, for propaganda

purposes,  it is all right. But when  it  comes  to

actual  fact,  when  they were  talking  about  the

defeat of Mr Lee Khoon Choy in Bukit Panjang, they

never  said  a  word  that the  last  election  was

undemocratic.  They  even thought  that  it  was  a

wonderful  election  that they  had  won  in  Bukit

Panjang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that to reduce the number of days will

benefit  the Government Party by giving it time  to

prepare  well in advance. Any political Party  that

is  worth  its  salt and has got a  platform  would

surely have prepared everything in readiness a long

time  beforehand. Yes, all these  years,  in  fact;

every day is part of a politician's work. There  is

no  last-minute juggling about. That is why  I  say

that  he  is thinking only of presenting candidates

at the last minute



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1060</b></font><br><br>



and  trying to pull the wool over the eyes  of  the

electorate in a last-minute effort.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Member was talking on the point that on

election  day  the police will have  the  power  to

check  canvassing and so on and talking about  shop

assistants  going round - "ch'u ch'i  sung  hoa"  - I

wonder  whether he was thinking that there  is  one

way  out.  Policemen are wise enough, and  I  think

they have a sufficiently fair standard of education

to  differentiate between a canvasser  and  a  shop

assistant. But I can say here is one way out. If he

thinks that being a shop assistant he can get  away

from  this  part of the Bill, where policemen  will

not  allow  a man to go to more than two  or  three

places  on  canvassing day, well, he  can  disguise

himself as a shop assistant and get away with it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last election, the complaint was that

the  number of days for campaigning was  too  short

and all the rest of it, but I am sure that if there

were  more time, if we were able to refute some  of

the  statements  that Mr Tan Lark  Sye  had  said,

perhaps  some of these gentlemen would  not  be  in

this Chamber today.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>):

Mr Speaker, I feel this amendment Bill is full  of

the  spirit of democracy. As a matter of fact,  the

aim of the amendment will act in the same manner on

the  Party  in  power as well as on the  Opposition

Parties. The reduction of nine days to five days is

to  enable officers of the Elections Department  to

prepare  themselves for Nomination Day. It  is  not

our  intention  to  make use of the  provisions  to

restrict   the  activities  of  all  the  political

Parties  in their contact with the electorate.  No,

it  is  not our intention. If the Barisan can claim

that  they  have  the support of the  broad  masses

behind them, then why should they be afraid of when

and  where election is to be conducted? Why  should

they  be afraid and worry about the number of  days

allowed for campaigning? They just cannot say  that

there is no democracy because the number of days is

reduced. If they claim



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1061</b></font><br><br>



that  they are the heroes of the people,  they  are

the  representatives of the people,  they  have  no

reason  to  fear at all. But it is surprising  that

their remarks against this Bill show that they  are

paper  tigers and paper heroes. They really do  not

have  the  support of the people, and that  is  why

they  are afraid of this Bill, which will give  the

Government the power to hold elections at any time.

Then they will be afraid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, as I have said just now, this amendment Bill is full of the spirit of democracy, because we have no intention and desire to restrict the opportunities of the Opposition Members to come into contact with the electorate. In the last five years of our office, we have given them

opportunities to come into contact with the people.

In  fact,  they did make use of these opportunities

to  spread  rumours  among the electorate  and  the

people.  The  Members opposite are really  good  at

spreading  rumours. They made the  allegation  that

our  propaganda material was printed in Hong  Kong,

but  I can prove to them that it was published  and

printed by our local printers. But it is the  usual

tactic  of the Barisan Sosialis to spread  rumours.

They  say the rumours are spread by others but,  in

fact,  they came from them. So we can see that  the

Barisan  Sosialis, who claim to be  heroes  of  the

people  and  enjoy the support of the  people,  are

really  humbugs. If they really had the support  of

the  people  and they had five years to  carry  out

their  propaganda work, then they should  not  have

been  what  they are now. They would have  got  the

support  of  the  people and come  to  power.  What

difference does it make between nine days and  five

days? Do you mean to say that the reduction of  the

number of days is going to affect the Opposition to

such  an  extent  as to warrant  the  uncalled  for

criticism against the Bill?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they spoke about the election of a king. I

would  like to ask them what is the meaning of  the

word  "election"?  Election means  competition.  In

this  historical  case that they referred  to,  was

there another candidate competing for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1062</b></font><br><br>



the  throne?  No. That was not so. That  being  so,

where  was  the  election? They  are  just  talking

nonsense.  Their  talk  is  very  preposterous  and

absurd. If it was a true election, of course, there

must  be  another  person competing  for  the  same

thing.  If  there was a true election for  a  king,

then there must be another candidate competing with

Napoleon for the throne. But from the Member's  own

historical  knowledge - let us assume  that  he  has

some  such  knowledge - he knows that  there  was  no

candidate  competing with Napoleon for the  throne.

Can you call that an election for a king?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say that the P.A.P. are not democratic and

that  their  workers  were  assaulted  during   the

election.  Now let us look at them.  They  are  all

very young and have strong muscles.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The hon. Member is making a

personal  attack. Will he leave the "young Members"

- as  he  calls them alone? Please get on  with  the

debate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): I am just

making  a  point  to refute their  allegation  that

their  workers were assaulted and hit on  the  head

during  the election. I say that their people  were

not  so  peaceful and innocent. We saw  how  lorry-loads of their supporters went round prepared for a

fight  at  any moment. How could such  people  have

been  assaulted? Who will believe their  allegation

that  it  was  the P.A.P. people who assaulted  the

Barisan boys? If this was so, I am sure the  P.A.P.

would  not have been returned with 37 seats. If  we

had  done  so, we would have resorted  to  violence

against our opponents and they would not have had a

chance  to  come in here at all. It  was  fortunate

that the P.A.P. did not restrict the activities  of

the  Barisan Sosialis during the election. In fact,

we  gave them ample opportunities to conduct  their

election  campaign in a democratic manner  so  that

the  people  could  make a  free  choice  of  their

candidates.  The  facts have  proved  that  we  are

right.  The  people have chosen us again.  And  yet

they  talk of the broad masses behind them. But  it

was  the broad masses who objected to their  coming

to power.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1063</b></font><br><br>



Where  was the support that they had? If  they  say

that  the people were behind them, then the people

would  have voted them in. But why did they  choose

such  a  handful of them? On the other  hand,  why

were 37 of us elected? We have been here day in and

day  out  continuously explaining to them, and  yet

they  fail  to understand the true position.  These

people  just  refuse to understand  the  fact  that

Singapore  has joined Malaysia as a State.  Instead

of referring to our country as Malaysia, they still

use the term "Malaya". [Interruption]



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, there is one other point I wish to draw attention to, and that is with regard to the police. They say that during the election the police were given power to arrest the Barisan people and to interfere with the activities of the workers and delivery-clerks, thereby creating an

atmosphere  of  fear. This is  sheer  falsehood  in

order  to divert the attention and blind the vision

of  the  people.  We know that the  police  do  not

belong  to  the  P.A.P. They do not belong  to  any

Party. They are a neutral force and are above party

politics. They are not a partisan force. If you are

guilty  of an offence, then the police will  arrest

you.  If you want to sell out the interests of  the

country  and become traitors, then, of course,  the

police will arrest you. What else do you expect the

police to do? If you do not have the consent of the

members  of a union and you make use of the  funds,

then,  of course, the police will investigate  into

the  matter. But the Barisan Members have the cheek

to  say that the police are helping the P.A.P.  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, you appreciate that the  police  are

above  politics and are neutral. If you are  guilty

of any offence, you will have to face the law. This

is   a  State  where  the  rule  of  law  prevails.

[Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng (Paya Lebar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Member for Ulu Pandan referred to

the  Member  for Bukit Merah. It is lucky  that  he

said  that in this House. If he had said it outside

this  House,  we  would  have  taken  court  action

against him.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1064</b></font><br><br>



But his allegation does not merit our rebuttal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to touch on the points raised by the

Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for  Social

Affairs.  He  said  there were no rival  candidates

competing   with  Napoleon  for  the  throne.   But

Napoleon  also  said  that he was  elected  by  the

people.  For  example,  the ex-President  of  South

Korea, Syngman Rhee, was also elected by the people

in  a  democratic way. There was a rival candidate.

But  sometimes such rival candidates are  arrested,

executed or they just disappear in elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary also made another point. He said that if we have mass support, we can take part in elections anywhere and at any time. But in the recent election, one of our candidates, Mr Tan Siew Swee, was arrested just before Nomination Day. Mr Speaker, Sir, this was the so-called election referred to by the Parliamentary

Secretary.  We  know  that  once  a  candidate   is

arrested and detained, he cannot take part  in  the

election.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am now going to refer to the election in

Sarawak.  That was also an election. The Opposition

Parties  in Sarawak also nominated their candidates

to  contest the election, but they were arrested by

the  police  and detained in a police  station  far

away  from  the town. Later on, they were  released

and asked to walk home.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, we are debating the Elections Bill of

Singapore and not the Elections Bill of Sarawak.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I agree with the Minister that we

are discussing the Singapore Elections Bill. How we

managed  to  come to Sarawak was  by  a  series  of

examples;  we  have been hopping from  Napoleon  to

South  Korea. But as long as the Member  is  brief,

please proceed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> In Indonesia, there is no

election.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  want  to  cite examples to show that  there  are

various  kinds  of  elections.  For  example,   the

election conducted in Sarawak was one kind of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1065</b></font><br><br>



election; the election conducted in South Korea was

also  one  kind  of election; and the  election  of

Napoleon   was   also   one   kind   of   election. [Interruption]



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I cannot follow the English

translation unless there are less interruptions.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir,

let  me  give  my  reasons why  I  think  that  the

reduction  from  nine to five days  is  not  right.

Firstly,  it will be advantageous to the  Party  in

power   but   disadvantageous  to  the   Opposition

Parties.  The Deputy Prime Minister said that  this

reduction  in  the number of days is based  on  the

practice  in  England, that the maximum  period  in

England  is five days, whereas the five-day  period

in  Singapore is the minimum and that the provision

here is better than that in England. Let us compare

Singapore  with England to show why we  should  not

have  a five-day period in Singapore. We know  that

Singapore  has been under direct British  rule  for

more than 100 years. This is a fact which cannot be

denied  by  the  P.A.P.  During  this  period,  the

British suppressed and exploited the people in this

area.  They  did  not educate  the  people  in  the

parliamentary  procedures of a  democratic  system,

such  as  the holding of elections, and so on.  The

British people have held elections for hundreds  of

years,  but  the  people  of  Singapore  have  held

elections  since the Rendel Constitution came  into

existence. The people in England have had  hundreds

of  years'  experience in the holding of  elections

which  we lack in Singapore. Another point is  that

there   is  the  rule  of  law  and  constitutional

monarchy  in  England. In such a country,  after  a

long period of political education, the people have

become  familiarised  with the  democratic  way  of

life.  In  addition, they have a very high standard

of education; most of them are educated. Therefore,

in  England, the period of five days is  sufficient

without causing any difficulty.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point is that the Member for Ulu Pandan

mentioned   that  it  is  easy  for  a   particular

candidate to be elected



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1066</b></font><br><br>



if  the  people  know him. There are some  shocking

incidents which he did not reveal to the House.  In

England, political Parties can hold rallies at  any

time they like to carry out their party propaganda.

But  in  Singapore the political Parties are denied

this  right.  For example, if the Barisan  Sosialis

want  to  hold a rally at Hong Lim Green, they  are

not  allowed. They will also not be allowed to hold

a  rally at the Jalan Besar Stadium. There will  be

the  added  difficulty of applying for a  site  for

this  purpose.  We  will not  get  any  permission.

Therefore, it is difficult for us to carry out  our

political  work, whereas in England  the  political

Parties  can  carry out their party work,  such  as

explaining  their  party  aims  and  educating  the

people.  There  is this difference between  England

and Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process of elections is new to the people of

Singapore. Elections were only introduced after the

Rendel Constitution came into force. Therefore, the

people  of  Singapore  are not  accustomed  to  the

procedure of elections.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point is that education is not

universal   in  Singapore.  Not  many  people   are

educated,  although  there  is  free  primary   and

secondary education. But the students generally  do

not have voting rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is because of these reasons that the reduction

of  the  period  from nine days  to  five  days  is

improper.  Many  difficulties will come  up  before

Opposition   Parties  and  this  will  give   ample

opportunity to the Party in power to deal with  the

Opposition. The period of five days is very  short.

Two  days will be taken up for nomination, and  the

balance of three clays is left for campaigning.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, let me give another example. Soon after the elections, on the night of 2nd February the majority of our Party leaders were detained, among whom were Lim Ching Siong and Fong Swee Suan. They are respected by the people and are very popular. That is why they were detained. Altogether

more  than a hundred of our comrades were detained.

Following the arrest of our leaders, the Government

restricted the Press so as to deny us the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1067</b></font><br><br>



opportunity  to  publicise our propaganda.  On  the

other  hand, the Prime Minister went to  the  rural

areas  to  carry out his electioneering  work.  All

these  rural  tours  were for the  purpose  of  the

elections.   We,  however,  did  not   enjoy   such

opportunities. And it was exactly for those reasons

that  the Government held a snap election. We  were

only  given nine days to canvass, and this  already

is a very short period. And now they want to reduce

it  to  five  days.  Within  those  nine  days  our

potential candidates were arrested and we had  some

difficulty in getting replacements. If we had other

candidates, they too might have been arrested.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, when printing work for our campaigning

had   gone   half-way,  the  Government   cut   the

electricity  supply to our printers,  so  that  our

publicity material could not be printed in time. If

they  reduce the nine-day period to five days,  one

day is spent on nomination.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> I think the Member is basing his

argument on the wrong facts.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Is it a point of order or a point of

clarification?



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> The Member is talking about

reducing the period from nine days to five days. We

are not reducing it from nine days to five days for

election campaigning.



<br><br><!-- Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to reduce

the period from nine days to five days. Is that not

what the Member is speaking about?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary must rise on a point of order or on a point of clarification. If he thinks that the Member has got his facts wrong, he can rise in reply and tell him so. But he only interrupts on a point of order or clarification.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please proceed, Mr Kow.



<br><br><!-- Mr Kow Kee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kow Kee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): You do not know

what  is  being discussed. This five-day period  is

disadvantageous  to  the  Opposition  Parties.   If

elections  are  conducted fairly  and  impartially,

then, of course, it is a different



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1068</b></font><br><br>



matter. But the P.A.P. have been guilty  of

malpractices in elections. And so this reduction in

the   period  is  an  added  disadvantage  to   the

Opposition  Parties, so that they cannot  have  any

opportunity to carry out their propaganda work  and

to get in touch with the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give another example. At the last

elections,  about two days before Polling  Day  the

Prime  Minister  gave a radio talk  at  half-hourly

intervals. He said that if the people voted for the

Barisan  and they were returned on the  results  of

the voting, then Federation troops would march into

Singapore, thus causing fear in the hearts  of  the

people.  There  was almost terror  in  them.  Under

these circumstances, we were put at a disadvantage.

The  Barisan  Sosialis then tried to  persuade  the

people  not to be misled by P.A.P. propaganda,  but

whatever  we  wanted to say, we were not  given  an

opportunity to broadcast over Radio Singapore,  and

nothing was printed in the Press too because of the

P.A.P.'s restriction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus if the elections were conducted under

similar circumstances, the people would not be able

to freely exercise their discretion. The Opposition

also  would  be put in a disadvantageous  position.

There  is  also the fear that the Government  might

monopolise everything. If the Government  dared  to

give  equal  chances  to  the  Opposition  in   the

elections, such as a certain period of time for the

Opposition  to  speak  over  the  radio,  then  the

results  would be different. Otherwise,  this  Bill

only helps the P.A.P. to perpetuate their regime.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very likely that in future the P.A.P. might

introduce another Bill to further reduce the period

of  live  days  to  three days. I hope  the  P.A.P.

Government  do  not think that because  the  people

have voted them in, as they so claim, they can  now

do  anything they want, even bad things. The people

have   voted  them  in  under  their  own  election

machinery to form the Government, and so they  hope

that  they can do something good for them  and  not

anything  bad. They cannot say that since they  now

form the Government, they have



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1069</b></font><br><br>



the  right  to  do  bad things, if  this  is  their

reasoning, then I really pity them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Mr Speaker and Members of the House

have  now and then been to the pictures. They  will

have  noted  that the finale of every  film  always

shows   the   villains  defeated  and  the   heroes

triumphant. So it is the case with our society.  In

the  end,  the  undemocratic  Government  will   be

defeated.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> Sir, we all agree that

elections  are a very serious business  and  not  a

circus.  We  do  not want to let the outside  world

believe  that  this amendment has any intention  to

inhibit Members of the Opposition.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis, as usual, whenever they are

faced   with  any  specific  problem,   calls   the

Government "Fascist". They know very well  that  if

we  were Fascists today, there would not have  been

any  elections and Members in the Opposition  would

not be sitting where they are.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make it quite clear that what is

in  dispute  is  the  period between  the  Writ  of

Elections  and  Nomination Day. The period  between

Nomination  Day and Polling Day is not involved  at

all  in  this Ordinance. The minimum period between

Nomination  Day and Polling Day remains  as  it  is

- nine days. In other words, the period for election

campaigning is not altered. What we are  asking  is

the  reduction of the period between the  issue  of

the Writ and Nomination Day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Barisan have complained that this

reduction in the period is to their disadvantage. I

would  say right here that it is all utter  rubbish

to  believe that any serious political Party  which

has  intentions or ambitions to form the government

would be inhibited at all from participating in the

elections purely by a reduction of four days.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take the situation which occurred sometime

early  this  year.  The Barisan had  moved  several

motions  of  no confidence against the  Government.

When  they  did this, surely they should have  been

prepared for the consequences. Do they mean to  say

that they were



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1070</b></font><br><br>



uttering  words without meaning to take action?  In

the  end,  the Barisan Sosialis, together with  the

Right-Wing  political Party, the  S.P.A.,  which  was

already discredited, and with the U.M.N.O. and  the

U.P.P.,  ganged up to defeat us on  a  vital  Bill.

When  I  announced in the Assembly on that occasion

that  we  were going to adjourn sine die  and  that

deletions  were  going to be  held  sometime  after

Malaysia day, if Members of the Opposition had  any

brains  in  their heads at all, they  would  surely

have  understood the consequences of their  action.

They should have prepared for the elections. You do

not  choose candidates between the period when  the

Writ  is  issued  and  Nomination  Day.  A  serious

political  Party would already have  laid  out  its

ground.  It  would have surveyed who would  be  the

likely candidates arid who would stand on the Party

ticket.  In the past, several elections have  shown

that  independent candidates, who  popped  up  like

mushrooms after a thunderstorm or rabbits out of  a

magician's hat, did not stand any chance at all  in

these  elections.  The  days  have  gone  when   an

Independent  can  claim  that  he  will   win   his

constituency  by  virtue of his personality  alone.

Nothing has been more evident than the instance  of

the  election  in Anson when an ex-Chief  Minister,

the ex-Member for Anson, without the support of the

Communists,  which we have all along  said  he  had

been receiving, lost his deposit. The intention  of

this  amendment  in reducing the period  from  nine

days to five days between the issue of the Writ and

Nomination  Day is to facilitate and  expedite  the

business of nomination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the Barisan have forgotten that during

the election campaign, an opportunity was given  to

the  Opposition Parties to participate in radio and

television forums. In fact, in one T.V. forum,  we

all  remember very clearly that the Chairman of the

Barisan  Sosialis agreed with the Member  for  Hong

Lim that even if the elections had been confined to

three days, it would not have mattered at all. They

were  all  in  agreement  that  the  record  of   a

political  Party over the past few  years  was  the

deciding



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1071</b></font><br><br>



factor.  It  is  not  that the  electorate  are  so

foolish  or  stupid  as  to vote  in  some  unknown

candidate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, may I come to clause 6, to which the

Member  for  Tampines  has taken  great  objection?

Clause  6,  which  seeks to prevent  canvassing  or

intimidation during Polling Day, was debated during

the  debate  on the Referendum Bill. In  fact,  the

provisions  of  clause 6 were enforced  during  the

referendum  in  September last year.  Clause  6  is

important  to  prevent  undesirable  elements  from

intimidating  those who are going to the  poll.  As

the  Member for Hong Lim has said, the Barisan  are

the  meanest  political Party in town,  and  it  is

quite  clear  why the Barisan object very  much  to

clause  6.  It  is not true that a hawker  will  be

afraid  to move out of his house to hawk at another

house,  all  because of clause 6. Let me  read,  so

that they can understand the implications of clause

6. This clause says:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Notwithstanding the provisions of the Criminal

Procedure Code relating to the powers of search  of

any  police  officer,  if any  police  officer  has

reasonable  cause  to believe that  an  offence  is

being  committed  under  the  provisions  of   this

section,  such  police officer, by  virtue  of  his

office, shall be empowered to enter and search  any

premises  or  place for the purpose of ascertaining

whether such an offence is being committed.'



<br><br>There  is no reason why, therefore, people who  are

honest  and  who have no intention to infringe  the

provisions  of the Elections Ordinance should  fear

the  introduction of clause 6 into the Bill. Clause

6  merely  states that a police officer  can  enter

premises  to  investigate and  find  out  what  the

suspicious character is doing moving from house  to

house. It has been our experience in the past  that

even  on Polling Day certain people have been going

round the streets intimidating voters and trying to

canvass votes even to the very, last minute. It  is

our  intention to stop this and clause 6, we  hope,

will act as a deterrent to such evil doers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say here again that it is not the electoral

registers  nor  the  Elections Ordinance  which  is

decisive. The decisive factor, the decisive  force,

in the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1072</b></font><br><br>



elections will be the electorate themselves.  Given

the opportunity of expressing their views in secret

- one man one vote - we are quite sure that democracy

will  prevail.  Despite what the  Barisan  Sosialis

have  said against the amendments to this  Bill,  I

can  assure  Members of this House  that  elections

will  always be fairly conducted according  to  the

rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill.-[Dr Toh Chin Chye].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 and 2 ordered to stand part of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 3 stand

part of the Bill."



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan (Hong Lim):</b> Mr Speaker, I have

heard  the  arguments  given by  the  Deputy  Prime

Minister. He says that clause 3 is in line with the

United Kingdom practice. Mr Speaker, clause  3  is

the  meat  of  the  whole  Bill.  The  Government's

proposal  to  amend  section 24  of  the  principal

Ordinance has been motivated, in the words  of  the

Deputy  Prime  Minister, so that electioneering  in

Singapore will be done according to the practice in

the United Kingdom. In the last few minutes, I have

gone  to  the Library of the Assembly House  and  I

have  checked that, far from following the practice

of the United Kingdom, we are departing further and

further   away  from  the  electioneering  practice

there.  I  have checked that in 1955  the  date  of

announcement  to the date of polling  is  41  days.

This is in the 1955 general elections in the United

Kingdom.  In  the  1959 general  elections  in  the

United  Kingdom,  the minimum period  was  41  days

after  the announcement. But previously the British

Prime Minister had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1073</b></font><br><br>



intimated  to  the  Opposition Parties  that  there

would  be  general  elections  soon.  In  the  last

elections   in   Singapore,  the   period   between

announcement and polling is only 18 days.  Now  the

Government is further attempting to reduce it to 14

days.  Mr Speaker, if the Government will give  us

an  undertaking that they are going to  follow  the

United Kingdom electioneering practice in toto,  we

will   accept   it.  We  will  even  support   this

amendment.   But  for  that  matter,  having   much

experience  with this Government, I  am  very  much

doubtful  whether the Government  will  follow  the

United  Kingdom electioneering practice in toto.  I

would, therefore, suggest that in future, elections

to the State Assembly of Singapore be conducted not

by  the  P.A.P.  Government but by the  independent

Federal   Elections   Commission,   which   is   an

independent   body   appointed   by   the   Central

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 is the meat of the whole Bill. As a

matter  of  fact, this clause is the most important

matter  which  this House has been discussing.  The

speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara and the Budget

are   only  forums  where  Parties,  both  on   the

Government  side and the Opposition  side,  express

their  propaganda and their views.  They  can  talk

until  the  morning and until the cock  crows.  But

there  is  no power struggle involved.  Whereas  in

clause  3  of this Bill, which Bill, in my opinion,

is  the  most important Bill so far brought forward

in  this House, the Government hope that they  will

be  one  step further towards the one-party  State,

and that by virtue of this clause they will be able

to  win  again  in the next general elections.  Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Deputy Prime Minister has told us

that  he  is  only  following  the  United  Kingdom

electioneering practice. I hope he will give us  an

assurance  that  the  Government  will  follow  the

United Kingdom electioneering practice in toto.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I assure the Member for Hong

Lim  that that is the intention of this Bill,  that

is,  to  follow the time-table as indicated in  the

United



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1074</b></font><br><br>



Kingdom  Representation of the People Act. In  this

Act,  in Schedule II, the time-tables for the issue

of  writ and delivery of nomination papers, are all

very  clearly stated. May I point out to the Member

for Hong Lim that even in the United Kingdom, there

is  greater flexibility given to the Government  on

the issue of writ. It says in the case of a general

election,  "as soon as practicable after the  issue

of the proclamation summoning the new Parliament, a

writ  will be issued." Writs will be issued to over 500

Returning  Officers  in  Britain.   In   this

Ordinance  of  the United Kingdom nowhere  does  it

state  specifically when the writ will  be  issued.

All it says is that writs will be issued as soon as

practicable. After the event of issuing  the  writ,

nomination  papers must be received not later  than

the  eighth  day  after  the date  of  proclamation

summoning  the  new Parliament. Therefore,  between

the  date  when  the  proclamation  is  issued  for

summoning  the  new Parliament and Nomination  Day,

there  are approximately eight days. But the  writs

can  be  issued at any time within the eight  days.

All  it says in this Ordinance is that these  writs

must be issued as soon as practicable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Hong Lim, from his experience in

the  last  Assembly,  should have  known  that  you

cannot  pick out 51 candidates within five days  or

within  nine days. If the Member for Hong  Lim  had

any  serious  intentions of forming the  Government

this  year, he would have picked out his candidates

wisely  and  he  would  have  had  his  candidates'

posters   plastered   all  over   Singapore.   But,

unfortunately,  the Member for Hong  Lim  had  only

posters of himself pasted throughout Singapore,  so

it  appeared to the people of Singapore that  there

was  only one candidate from the U.P.P. In fact,  I

have  heard it said that they did not even know  in

the rural areas whether the U.P.P. candidate was  a

man or a woman. All they knew was a name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know whether, even in the next general

elections, if we were to allow this period of  nine

days  to  remain in the Ordinance, it would improve

the  situation  for the U.P.P.  In  fact,  I  would

advise the leader of the U.P.P., if he had



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1075</b></font><br><br>



ambitions to capture what support he can  from  the

Barisan Sosialis, to prepare now and form a  shadow

Cabinet  as the Labour Party in Britain,  which  is

now  in  the  Opposition, has.  The  Labour  Party,

although   in  Opposition,  always  has  a   shadow

Cabinet,  ready  for  the elections  at  any  time.

Therefore, whether the period between issue of writ

and  Nomination Day is nine days or  five  days  is

immaterial.   It   is  purely  for   administrative

convenience  that this period is  inserted  in  the

Ordinance. In the case of Singapore which is a very

small  island,  it  is easy for  the  writ  for  51

constituencies to be issued in one day, because  we

have  only one Returning Officer. But in the United

Kingdom  you  have one Returning Officer  for  each

constituency  and many of these constituencies  are

located  in  remote spots in Scotland, Ireland  and

the  Shetland Islands. Therefore, that  period  was

provided  for  in the United Kingdom  Ordinance  to

permit these writs to reach the Returning Officers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would add once more that, although the Member

for Hong Lim says that clause 3 is the meat of this

Bill, it forms only part of the amendment which  we

are  proposing and that it is not decisive  in  the

elections  to come. What will be decisive  will  be

the  work  of  the  political  Party  each  of   us

represents in the next five years.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Eng Guan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Eng Guan:</b> Mr Speaker, the Deputy Prime

Minister  has not assured us that he  is  going  to

follow  the  United  Kingdom election  practice  in

toto. If he had, I will be able to point out to him

what is the practice in the United Kingdom. In  the

1955  and  1959  general elections  in  the  United

Kingdom,  the  Government  announced  that  general

elections would be held and that the period between

the  announcement of the general election  and  the

writ  of  elections was 21 days. It was 21 days  in

the  1955 general elections and 21 days in the 1959

general  elections. That seems to be the  practice.

But  in  Singapore we have two days.  Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  it is not possible to make photos and  blocks

of  candidates in two days, unless like the  P.A.P.

Government  with  their resources,  they  can  make

their  blocks and print their posters in Hong  Kong

and ship them overnight like a thief to Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1076</b></font><br><br>



In  the  United Kingdom the practice  is  that  the

Government  always  give  three  weeks,  when  they

announce  that general elections will be held,  for

Parties to prepare up till the issue of the Writ of

Elections.  There is a further three or four  weeks

before  they have polling. But in Singapore  if  we

have  a law making the same requirements that there

will  be a date of announcement, which will be  two

weeks  or three weeks before the date of the  writ,

we will accept the Government's amendment.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Toh Chin Chye:</b> I do not believe the Member

for Hong Lim is quite correct. He is talking of the

practice of governments in the United Kingdom.  You

know very well that governments change. In 1955 you

have  one government and four years later you  have

another government. What governs the conduct of any

government is the Elections Ordinance, and  I  have

just cited a U.K. Act called the Representative  of

the People Act which has a Schedule giving the time-table  for the issue of writ, publication of notice

of election, delivery of nomination papers, Polling

Day, and  so on. Every government has to abide  by

this Ordinance which is the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Member for Hong Lim's complaint that

there was no warning for general elections, let  me

remind him again of what he said on television.  He

said  very  clearly it was immaterial  whether  the

election  campaign was going to  be  nine  days  or

three  days. He was here in this Assembly in  July.

He  ganged  up together with the S.P.A.,  U.M.N.O.,

the  Independent Member for Anson, and the Barisan.

He  helped to defeat a vital Bill in this Assembly.

That  was the last sitting of the Assembly. At that

time  I  stated  in this Chamber very  clearly,  in

reply to the Member for Anson, that elections would

be held after Malaysia Day. In July we had our last

sitting;  elections  were  held  at  the   end   of

September;  there was an interval of three  months.

How could the Member for Hong Lim complain that  he

had no time to prepare his election campaign or  to

look  for his candidates, or to get his candidates'

posters printed? I have no objections if he has his

posters  printed  in Hong Kong or  Japan.  That  is

immaterial to me. But the Ordinance dictates



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1077</b></font><br><br>



that these are the rules by which elections must he

held and we have followed the rules. I do not think

any politician would be that stupid to go along and

defeat a government on a crucial Bill and not  take

the  consequences of it by preparing  for  the  day

when  the Assembly would be dissolved and elections

held  within three months after the dissolution  of

the Assembly according to the Constitution.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.10 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I have the Yang di-Pertuan  Negara's

recommendation that this Bill be proceeded with.  I

therefore beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill was originally introduced and had its

First  Reading  at the sitting of  the  Legislative

Assembly  on the 7th of June, 1963. At  its  Second

Reading  on  the 24th of July, 1963, the  Bill  was

committed to Select Committee. At the first meeting

of  the  Select  Committee on the 28th  of  August,

1963, notice was given of certain amendments. These

amendments  are now incorporated in clauses  7  and

11. Except for these clauses, the provisions in the

Bill  remain the same as those in the original Bill

introduced on the 7th of June, 1963.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of this Bill is to enable amendments to

be made to the Central Provident Fund Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main amendment is in clause 4, which will

enable  the  Board  to declare  a  higher  rate  of

interest on contributions to the Fund than are  now

prevailing. At present the Board is precluded  from

declaring a higher rate of interest than 2�



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1078</b></font><br><br>



per  cent per annum unless the assets of the  Board

at  current market value exceed its liability by 10

per  cent.  The amendment proposed is in line  with

what  has been introduced in the Employee Provident

Fund (Amendment No. 2) Act, 1960, of the Federation

of  Malaya,  which came into force on the  31st  of

December, 1960.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is in a financial position to declare a

higher rate of interest than 2� per cent per annum,

as  the redemption value of the Board's investments

is very much more than its liabilities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other amendments proposed in the Bill are

being introduced on the recommendation of the Board

in  the light of experience gained in administering

the  Ordinance since it came into force on the  1st

of July, 1955.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arguments and explanations for these

amendments  are  the same for those  given  by  the

previous  Minister for Labour on the 24th of  July,

1963,  when  he  moved the Second Reading  of  this

Bill. I do not wish to waste the time of this House

to repeat these explanations. I will invite Members

to look up the Hansard for the explanations if they

find them necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.18 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to provide powers in

the  Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance  to

make regulations,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1079</b></font><br><br>



among  other  things,  for the control,  licensing,

keeping, and destruction of dogs. Until the  coming

into  force  of  the  Local Government  Integration

Ordinance  (No. 18 of 1963) on 1st December,  1963,

dog  licences  were levied under the provisions  of

section  83 of the Municipal Ordinance and the  by-laws  made thereunder by the local authority,  viz,

the  City Council, in respect of the city area, and

the  Rural  Board in respect of areas  outside  the

city.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Municipal Ordinance was repealed upon the

coming   into   force  of  the   Local   Government

Integration  Ordinance, and as  the  provisions  of

section 83 of the Municipal Ordinance have not been

repeated   in   the  Local  Government  Integration

Ordinance  the statutory powers of licensing  cease

to exist. The deletion of this provision in the new

Ordinance was, however, intentional.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it was considered to be much more appropriate

to include dog licensing and kindred matters in the

Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance than  in

the   Local   Government   Integration   Ordinance,

accordingly  when the Local Government  Integration

Bill  was in the draft stage a draft amendment  was

also  prepared  to transfer the provisions  to  the

Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance. At  the

same   time,   steps   were  taken   to   draft   a

comprehensive Animals Ordinance based on the  lines

of  the  Federation Animals Ordinance  which  would

embrace   related   animal   matters   like    meat

inspection, slaughter-houses, control of drugs  and

vaccines   and   biological  products,   artificial

insemination, etc, including the licensing of dogs,

hatcheries, poultry and bird shops, and the like.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been hoped to introduce this comprehensive

Animal   Bill   simultaneously   with   the   Local

Government  Integration  Bill.  But  this  was  not

possible  as  material  and  information  on   such

legislation  had to be gathered from overseas,  and

it  would still take some time to prepare and adopt

a comprehensive Ordinance to meet local conditions.

It is, therefore, necessary to amend as a temporary

measure  the  existing  Prevention  of  Cruelty  to

Animals   Ordinance   to  seek   powers   to   make

regulations for the licensing and control  of  dogs

among



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1080</b></font><br><br>



other  things  until such time as the comprehensive

Animals Ordinance is ready for introduction to this

House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity has also been taken in this Bill

to   include  poultry  within  the  definition   of

"animal",  as  well as providing a  definition  for

hatcheries.   Increased   penalties    were    also

prescribed in the Bill to bring the scale into line

with  penalties  for other offences  of  a  similar

nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Bill will substantially re-enact the

previous   provisions  contained  in  the  repealed

Municipal   Ordinance  to  enable  the  making   of

regulations for the licensing and control of  dogs,

hatcheries, poultry and bird shops, and  the  like,

it   will  be  necessary  for  the  Bill  to   have

retrospective  effect from the  1st  of  September,

1963,  which  is  the  day the Municipal  Ordinance

ceased to have effect with the coming into force of

the  Local  Government  Integration  Ordinance,  in

order to preserve the continuity of licensing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>4.24 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chia Thye Poh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chia Thye Poh (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  this House should be very glad that  even

pigs,  poultry and dogs in Singapore are  receiving

more  and more attention from the hierarchy of  the

society.  So  the Party in power is now introducing

this amendment Bill to prevent cruelty, to animals,

so  that animals will be happy to die when they are

slaughtered, instead of dying with dissatisfaction.

But, unfortunately, the lower strata of society  in

Singapore are now being treated cruelly and are not

receiving  any  attention from any quarter.  It  is

also regrettable that in introducing this amendment

Bill,  the  Government have, as we have  suspected,

certain  ulterior motives behind the Bill. What  we

are  afraid is that the Government, in the name  of

prevention  of cruelty to animals, levy more  taxes

on  the  people because there is provision in  this

Bill  saying that if hawkers sell poultry and other

animals they must possess a licence, otherwise they

are liable to a fine. So with this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1081</b></font><br><br>



provision  I do not know whether those  hawkers  in

the  rural areas who sell meat are required  to  be

licensed or not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another provision in this amendment Bill

giving powers to the Minister to regulate rules and

fees  in  connection with licences. So the Minister

can regulate rules and decide on the fees according

to his own wish. I hope the Government will not try

to extract heavy fees from the poor hawkers because

the hawkers are unemployed people in the true sense

of  the  word. That is why they have to  resort  to

hawking to earn a livelihood. I hope the Government

will not increase the fees for licences in order to

get more money from the people.



<br><br>4.26 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><div align="center"><b>[Mr Deputy Speaker (Dr Fong Kim Heng) in the Chair]</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young (Thomson)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker,  Sir, my colleague has already  said  that

our  honourable Ministers are paying more attention

to  poultry and domestic animals. Their interest in

this  respect is increasing so that they  can  take

further  steps to prevent cruelty to  animals.  But

what intrigues me is that there is no provision for

the  prevention  of  cruelty  to  another  kind  of

animal, i.e. human beings. I believe that you  will

not  forget the fact that there are many high-class

animals - homo sapiens - who are being ill-treated by

the P.A.P.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Kah Hui:</b> On a point of order, Sir. We are

discussing  the  Prevention of Cruelty  to  Animals

(Amendment) Bill, and not a "Human Beings Bill". If

the  hon. Member wishes to move an amendment to the

Bill, he may do so and speak on the amendment.  But

he is not. So he should be discussing this Bill and

not human beings.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I do not think the hon. Member

should include homo sapiens in this Bill. Could  he

just speak on the principle of this Bill pertaining

to animals alone?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1082</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

human beings are also animals. I think you cannot

deny that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park)</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Point of order?



<br><br><!-- Mr Rajoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Rajoo:</b> Yes, Sir, Is the Member saying that he

is an animal?



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> That is not a point of order.

Mr Koo Young, please continue.



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

I  think  if you will allow me to speak  slowly,  I

will show you the relation between human beings and

animals. The Members on the other side seem  to  be

afraid  of what I have to say, and so they  try  to

interrupt.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say that human beings are also animals, except

that we are high-class animals. The P.A.P. Government

arrested a lot of political leaders, and they  were

ill-treated.  The detainees were  put  in  solitary

confinement  and were not allowed  to  read  books.

They were not even allowed to go out of their cells

for  fresh  air.  They were only allowed  to  leave

their cells for half an hour a day for baths. So  I

do  not  know  whether  the Minister  for  National

Development  is going to extend the  scope  of  the

Prevention  of Cruelty to Animals (Amendment)  Bill

to  include  human  beings, such as  the  political

detainees. We cannot just shed crocodile tears  and

pretend to be merciful. It would be like preventing

cruelty  to cats and dogs and forget about  cruelty

to  human beings who are high-class animals. It  is

the Government that are ill-treating human beings.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> I have already ruled that

human  beings  do not come under the definition  of

"animals" in this Bill. The definition here in this

Ordinance  is  that "animals mean any birds,  fish,

reptiles  or  insects, whether wild or  tame",  and

does  not  include human beings.  Will  the  Member

please proceed and do as I have ruled?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1083</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Koo Young -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Koo Young</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy Speaker,

I just want the Minister to expand on the

definition.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chan Chee Seng</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): The Members

opposite  want  to debate with us  on  the  foreign

stooges now in detention. If they really want to do

so,  they can do it at the proper time, instead  of

making   use   of  this  opportunity   to   mention

irrelevant matters.



<br><br><!-- Deputy Speaker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Deputy Speaker:</b> Order. I have ruled. Will the

Minister for National Development proceed?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do

not know why they are so suspicious. I have already

explained that this Bill is introduced in order  to

provide  for  powers  which  were  provided   under

section 83 of the Municipal Ordinance which  lapsed

in  1963  when  the  Local  Government  Integration

Ordinance  came  into being.  This  is  for  us  to

control   licensing  of  dogs;  licensing  control,

keeping  and  destruction  of  dogs.  It   is   not

something  new.  If the Member  for  Jurong  is  so

concerned about the higher species of human kind, I

would  welcome his introducing a Bill here for  the

prevention of cruelty to human beings. I will  take

it  up.  We will probably introduce a Bill here  to

his satisfaction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for National Development (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1084</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this Bill is to remove the

existing  restriction on Members of the Legislative

Assembly  from becoming Members of the Housing  and

Development Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under section 6 of the Housing and Development

Ordinance,  No. 11 of 1959, it is provided  that  a

Member  of  the  Legislative  Assembly  cannot   be

appointed  or  remain a Member of the  Housing  and

Development Board. Ever since 1960, there has  been

active   participation  by   Assemblymen   in   the

Allocation   Resettlement   and   other    Advisory

Committees  of  the Housing and Development  Board.

All these Committees have rendered good service and

given  useful  advice to the Board.  There  should,

therefore,   be   no  restriction  to   Assemblymen

participating  as  full  Members  of   the   Board.

Further,  the restriction is not imposed  on  other

statutory  bodies like the Public  Utilities  Board

and  the Telephone Board, the Harbour Board and the

Economic Development Board. Since all these  Boards

are  appointed by the Government, members of  these

Boards   should  command  the  confidence  of   the

Government  as they would be expected to  implement

Government policy, and there should be  as  wide  a

field  of  choice  as  possible,  and  they  should

include Assemblymen who are elected representatives

of  the people and command the confidence of  their

electorate.  Such restrictions as  there  are,  Mr

Deputy  Speaker, Sir, should only  be  confined  to

bankrupts,  persons  who  have  been  sentenced  to

imprisonment  for terms exceeding  six  months  and

have  not  received a free pardon, and  persons  of

unsound  mind,  as is the case of membership  with

the Public Utilities Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also proposed to make this amendment come

into  force with retrospective effect from the 21st

day  of September, 1963, as since then some members

of  the  Housing  Board have been elected  to  this

Assembly,  and so as not to invalidate their  acts,

it   is  proposed  that  this  amendment  be   made

retrospective.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to move, Sir.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the  Bill

he now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over three years have passed since the People's

Association  Ordinance came into operation  on  1st

July,  1960.  In  the light of  experience,  it  is

necessary to amend the Ordinance to enable  certain

reorganisation  to  be  made,  especially  in   the

membership to the Board. Hitherto, three  Ministers

sat on the Board and one of two Ministers must be a

party to the signing of cheques. The object of  the

Bill  is to reduce the number of Ministers  to  two

and  to  make it easier for cheques to  be  signed.

Provision  is made for a member of the  Corporation

to  be appointed as Secretary/Treasurer, instead of

tying  the post to the Director of Social  Welfare,

which  in practice has not been found to be  always

satisfactory.  There  is no  change  in  the  total

membership of the Board, which remains at 14.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The People's Association's symbol is now well

known   in  Singapore,  and  it  is  necessary   to

safeguard its use to prevent plagiarism by  anybody

in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other minor amendments, and all these

provide  for  the more efficient administration  in

the People's Association.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b>

Sir,  I  beg to move, "That the Bill be now read  a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have His Excellency's recommendation that the

Bill be proceeded with.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is conscious of the importance of

the  tourist  industry as a source  of  income  and

employment. Everybody knows the great potential  of

tourism in Singapore by virtue of its international

name,  and  its strategic location on international

air  and  sea  routes. This potential needs  to  be

exploited and this is best carried out by the joint

efforts  of  both private business and  Government.

With  this  in  view,  the  Government  propose  to

establish  a Tourist Promotion Board on which  both

business and Government will be represented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main functions of the Board will be to

publicise  Singapore  and its  attractions  in  the

principal  tourist  markets,  to  co-ordinate   the

activities  of tourist enterprises such as  hotels,

airlines,  shipping  lines, travel  agencies,  tour

operators, tourist shops, to regulate standards  to

be  maintained by tourist enterprises so that  they

compare  favourably with standards  elsewhere,  and

generally  to  improve facilities for  visitors  to

Singapore.  We  must  seek  not  only  to   attract

visitors  to Singapore, but we must also  see  that

they  go away satisfied so that when the word  gets

around more visitors will come to Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1087</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the composition of the Board, Members

will   note  that  five  of  these  will  represent

business  interests  as against  four  representing

official interests. I think it is proper that those

in business should be given adequate representation

in a Board of this nature.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The activities of the Board will be financed by

funds  from the Tourist Promotion Fund (clause  11)

to   be  established  under  this  Ordinance.  Both

business  and  the Government have a stake  in  the

tourist  industry and accordingly contributions  to

the  Fund  will  be  from  both  business  and  the

Government.  Initially, the Tourist Promotion  Fund

will be financed from a small cess of 3 per cent on

every  room  or suite occupied each  day  in  every

tourist hotel as well as from a subvention from the

Government. Members will note that half a million

dollars   have   been  provided  in  the   Ordinary

Estimates  under  Subhead 58 of  Head  24.  Hotels,

travel  agencies, tour operators and tourist  shops

benefit  from tourism. It is only right  that  they

should  be  called upon to contribute  towards  the

costs of the activities of the Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill only sets out the framework, but the

success  of  the Board will have to depend  on  how

intelligently the Board frames its strategy and how

effectively specific measures are carried out.  The

current  boom  in the construction  of  first-class

hotels  shows that fhere should be a bright  future

for tourist promotion in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

to a Committee of the whole Assembly.

<hr size="2" noshade>

*  The motion reads as follows: -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this Assembly resolves, in accordance with

section  2  of the Local Treasury Bills  Ordinance

(Chapter  69)  that the Minister be authorised  to

borrow,  by  the issue of Treasury  Bills  in  the

State,  sums  not  exceeding Malayan  $150,000,000

(Malayan  Dollars One Hundred and Fifty  Millions)

in amount.

<hr size="2" noshade>





<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the provisions of section 2 of the Local

Treasury Bills Ordinance, the Government have  been

borrowing  by  the issue of Treasury Bills  in  the

State up to the amount of $40 million by resolution

made in the Legislative Council on 13th July, 1948.

The  limit is now being reached in this, and it  is

sought to increase the limit to $150,000,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 25th July this year, similar approval was

sought  in the last Assembly, but was not obtained,

the votes being equal.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis who opposed the motion were

under  the  curious  notion  that  the  motion  was

related  to loans for the development of Sabah  and

Sarawak.   There   is,  in  fact,   no   connection

whatsoever.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treasury Bills of 91 days' maturity were issued

on  tap  to  statutory bodies as and when required,

and  are  offered  to  the public  every  month  on

tender.  Tap  bills carry 4 per cent  interest  per

year,  tender  bills average 4.1 per cent  interest

per  year. The amounts outstanding on these  issues

are: Tap bills $22.8 million, and Tender bills  $17

million.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the Government's intention to encourage the

growth  of  a short-term money market in Singapore.

There  is evidence that one or two discount  houses

or  short-term money market dealers are coming into

operation. These dealers should be provided with an

ample supply of Treasury Bills which should be  the

main stock in trade.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a large quantity locally of surplus

funds which are available for investments for short

periods.  Unless  suitable  outlets  are  found  in

Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1089</b></font><br><br>



to  absorb such funds, these monies may be remitted

overseas for investment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new limit, which has the approval of the

Central Bank of the Federation, under Article 49 of

the  Malaysian  Act  will  improve  the  Treasury's

ability  to  borrow  in the  local  market  and  to

provide   at   the  same  time  opportunities   for

investment   of  surplus  monies  not   immediately

required.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the Assembly, pursuant to subsection (2) of

section 12 of the Singapore Society of Accountants

Ordinance, 1963, approves the Singapore Society of

Accountants  Rules, 1963, which were made  on  the

13th  day  of  December, 1963,  and  published  as

Notification  Sp. No. S 64 in the Gazette  of  the

14th December, 1963, as contained in Paper S.L. 19

of 1963.

<hr size="2" noshade>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these Rules were made by the Council of the

Singapore Society of Accountants in accordance with

the  provisions of subsection (1)  of section 12  of

the Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rules provide, inter alia, for the admission

of  members  to the Society, the classification  of

the members and the election and appointment of the

President, the Vice-President and the Treasurer  of

the  Society.  The qualifications  of  persons  for

admission as members are set out in Parts I and  II

of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 1090</b></font><br><br>



Schedule  to  the  Rules and the  fees  payable  by

members are prescribed in Part III of the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with Government's policy to provide

employment    to    Polytechnic   graduates,    the

Professional   Diploma  in   Accountancy   of   the

Singapore  Polytechnic  is accepted  as  sufficient

qualification entitling the holders to registration

as  members of the Society. Part II of the Schedule

sets  out  the  Associations of  Accountants  whose

members  are  entitled  to be  registered  as  full

members of the Society. The qualifications obtained

by   members  of  these  Associations  are   widely

recognised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 2 provides for the admission of members to

be  made  by the Council or a Council Committee  at

meetings  in  which at least three-fourths  of  the

members are present. This, in effect, ensures  that

the  admission  will be considered by  at  least  3

members  of the Council. Rule 4 provides  for  four

classes    of   membership   according    to    the

qualifications and experience of the members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admission Fees and annual subscriptions are

prescribed  under Rules 6 and 7. There will  be  no

annual  subscription for the  year  1963,  but  any

person applying for membership now will have to pay

the  1964 annual subscriptions forthwith on  making

their   applications.  The  fees   prescribed   are

reasonable and comparable to those prescribed by  a

local accounting body.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rule 8 sets out the procedure at Council

meetings. The quorum for Council meetings is  7  as

provided under subsection (2)  of section 20 of  the

Ordinance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.
