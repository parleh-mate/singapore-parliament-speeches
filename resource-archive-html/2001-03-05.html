<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<div align="center"><h4>ORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS</h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>SPEAKERS' CORNER</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Simon Tay</b> asked the Minister for Home Affairs if

he  will  give  an update on the use of the Speakers'  Corner

and,  in  particular, the number of complaints  received  and

police investigations that have resulted from events held  at

the Corner.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee (Minister of State for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Home Affairs (Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee) (for the Minister for Home Affairs):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  since  its inception on 1st September 2000, there  have

been  about  800 registrations to speak at Speakers'  Corner.

Many more have gone there to listen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, Police has received no complaints from the

public on the use of the Speakers' Corner.   However, from  a

website posting, it would appear that an illegal assembly had

taken  place  at the Speakers' Corner on 10th  December  last

year, which I had already discussed in this House at our last

sitting.  Police is currently investigating into this.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon S. C. Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon S C Tay (Nominated Member):</b> Sir, may I ask if

it  is  the principle of the Police to investigate everything

it sees on the website?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 69</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, if the Police receives

information  from a reliable source such as media  report  or

website that an offence may have been committed, and there is

indicative evidence, then it is Police's professional duty to

investigate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, may I remind the Minister of State

that  he said that the Police has received no complaints from

the public.  Is he saying that every website is reliable?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> The website posting was in the

Think  Centre website.  It was a report and, in  fact,  there

was  also a photograph of people with clenched fists  raised,

and  the  report said that they chanted "Abolish ISA" several

times.   The Police assessed that this may be indicative of a

demonstration having taken place.  So, they saw it  as  their

duty to investigate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, this is pending investigations,

therefore, I am sure the Minister of State will not  want  to

go  too  much into the details of this particular case.   But

may  I  ask,  more generally, what is the difference  between

speech  and demonstrations?  And whether per se if I were  to

go  to the Speakers' Corner and clench my fist in the air, is

that a demonstration, Sir?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, at the last sitting, I

had  an exchange with Mr Jeyaretnam.  Many speakers have gone

there to speak.  Many people have gone there to listen.  They

have not met with any problems from the Police.  But if there

is   an   organised  meeting  at  the  Speakers'  Corner   to

demonstrate, in this case, for the abolition of ISA, and five

or  more  people gather there, then it is indicative evidence

of  an illegal assembly having taken place.  So Police has to

investigate.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I take it then that it is not the

clenched fist which he mentioned that is the cause.  May I go

on  to the next question, Sir?  This is whether five or  more

people  could  register to speak on the  same  topic,  either

sequentially or at the same time, at the Speakers' Corner?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 70</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, investigations are

ongoing.   So  we should not go into details.  Basically,  we

have said that the laws of the land must be observed, and the

laws  include  the Miscellaneous Offences (Public  Order  and

Nuisance)  (Assemblies and Processions)  Act  read  with  the

Miscellaneous   Offences   (Public   Order   and    Nuisance)

(Assemblies  and  Processions) Rules, which defines  what  an

"illegal  assembly" is.  That is the basis upon which  Police

is investigating.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, without going into the details of

this  case, I am concerned for future use, in the sense  that

any  speaker  goes down and if five or more  people  were  to

follow him and start clenching their fists and saying,  "Yes,

we  agree  with  you" or "No, we don't agree  with  you  with

whatever  it  is you are saying", how would the  Minister  be

satisfied that this too is not worthy of investigation?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, I think it is quite

different  if  you  go  there  on  your  own  accord,  as  an

individual speaker, you go and speak.  And indeed  when  your

speech  is  a rousing one, people may support you.   But  you

cannot be said to be organising an illegal assembly.   It  is

quite different from the situation in hand.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, may I ask the Minister of State that

if  I  were to e-mail to friends saying, "I am turning up  on

Friday  evening.  Will  you come and support me?", will  that

be considered organising an illegal assembly?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, as I said, we have to

look   at  the  Miscellaneous  Offences  (Public  Order   and

Nuisance) (Assemblies and Processions) Rules.  If you look at

rule  2,  it  defines  when an "illegal assembly"  has  taken

place.  Rule 2 says:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If five or more persons . [gather together] to (a)

demonstrate support for or opposition to the views or actions

of  any person; (b) to publicise a cause or campaign; or  (c)

to mark or commemorate an event,"



then an illegal assembly may have taken place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let us go on the law. In the context of these

questions,  it  is  better  for  the  investigations  to   be

completed before we further this discussion in the House.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> A final question, if I may, Mr Speaker?

This  is  to ask the Minister of State whether they will,  in

fact,  help  us  by  tracking  the  continued  usage  of  the

Speakers' Corner, subsequent to the public knowledge of these

investigations.   My  concern is  that  there  will  be  some

chilling  effect  that  people will  stop  using  this  early

experiment in Singapore.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Sir, we do not track the use

of the Speakers' Corner.  I think that is the starting point.

In  this  case,  indeed, but for the website posting  in  the

Think  Centre website, the Police may not have known  of  the

event.   That  is  the basis on which we should  operate  the

Speakers' Corner.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay</b> rose -

<br><br><!-- Mr Tan Soo Khoon (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> One more question, Mr Tay.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I think I was misunderstood on that

point.   The  Minister of State has told us that  800  people

have  registered  to  use  the  Speakers'  Corner  since  its

inception. I am asking the Ministry just to keep track of the

numbers  since knowledge about the investigations  that  have

happened.   My concern is that usage will fall  to  close  to

zero, because people will be very frightened to speak.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Ho Peng Kee:</b> Yes, we can do that. That is

not  really tracking.   The numbers are there because  people

register.  We can look at the numbers in due course.





<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 71</b></font><br><br>





<div align="center"><b>MOBILE TV IN PUBLIC BUSES</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Simon Tay</b> asked the Minister for Communications

and Information Technology how the introduction of Mobile  TV

in  public  buses  affects  the  basic  services  offered  to

commuters.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology (Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim) (for the Minister for Communications and Information Technology):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Public

Transport Council

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 72</b></font><br><br>

(PTC)  has  a set of service guidelines to ensure that  basic

bus  services meet the needs of commuters.  These  guidelines

stipulate,   among  other  things,  service   frequency   and

coverage,   time  of  operations  and  display   of   service

information.  The PTC conducts regular audits of the services

provided  by the public transport operators to measure  their

level  of  compliance to these guidelines.  In addition,  the

PTC  and the LTA encourage bus operators to introduce new and

innovative  schemes  to  improve  the  quality  of   customer

service,  provided that these schemes do not have an  adverse

impact   on  safety  and  basic  service  level  offered   to

commuters.

.    The TV Mobile scheme does not affect basic service level

provided by the bus operator.  The TV monitors would not pose

a danger to the passengers, hinder the movement of passengers

in  the  bus and/or affect the concentration of the  drivers.

The  bus operator will also not be exposed to undue financial

risk.  We  understand  that  in a  survey  conducted  by  the

operator  during a one-month public trial in 1999, commuters'

feedback on the TV Mobile scheme was positive.

.     We  are  aware  of  the discomfort  expressed  by  some

commuters regarding the presence of the TV Mobile monitors in

the  buses  since its launch on 14th February 2001.  We  have

asked  the  bus company and Media Corp to improve the  system

and  they are currently looking into adjusting the volume and

improving  on the quality of the images. We will continue  to

monitor to see that commuters' concerns are duly addressed.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, the Parliamentary Secretary has said

that  there  is no effect on the safety.  May I know  whether

any  tests have been carried out in case of a crash,  because

it  seems to me that these screens could fall on somebody, or

somebody could impact himself against the screen?

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, when the request was

made, approval from the LTA was required, as there was a need

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 73</b></font><br><br>

to ensure safety, in case the monitors may impede the flow of

commuters in the bus and they must be securely fastened,  and

all  other relevant technical details to ensure that they  do

not  become a hazard.  The technical details were cleared and

sorted  out  with  LTA's Vehicle Engineering  Department  and

therefore we gave the approval.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> I am not sure whether the Parliamentary

Secretary  has answered my question about a crash simulation,

Sir.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> I will ask the LTA to

look  into  this.  At this point in time, I do not  have  the

answers.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, my second question is about noise

volume,  whether  they  have set some requirements  of  noise

level and whether it is possible to secure some parts of  the

bus  so  that  people who want quiet when they  travel  could

actually opt for those seats.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> Sir, as we understand it,

the  operator  and Media Corp are looking  into  it.   I  can

forward the suggestions of Mr Simon Tay to the operator.   As

I  understand  it, they are looking into how  to  adjust  the

volume to meet the needs of various commuters in the bus.

<br><br><!-- Dr S. Vasoo -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr S. Vasoo (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I want to ask the

Parliamentary Secretary whether there will be an increase  of

charges  as  a result of this frill that has been introduced.

Because  if you introduce more frills in future,  it  is  not

only  a distraction from the basic core services, but I would

like to ask him whether there will be an increased cost.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Yaacob Ibrahim:</b> No.

<br><br><!-- Mr Simon Tay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Simon Tay:</b> Sir, I have a reverse question. Since

this  is  another  revenue stream for the bus  company,  will

there be a reduction in cost?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resumption of Debate on Question (23rd February, 2001),



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That Parliament approves the financial policy of the

Government  for the financial year 1st April,  2001  to  31st

March, 2002.".  -  [Minister for Finance].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.

<br>12.42 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Leong Horn Kee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it

must  have been a very pleasant task for Dr Richard  Hu,  the

Minister for Finance, to deliver this year's Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is obvious. Unlike the Budget and off-Budget

statements in 1998 and 1999, when painful and belt-tightening

measures had to be introduced to combat the recession and the

adverse  impact  of the regional financial crisis,  in  sharp

contrast,  this  year's  Budget is a  happy  one.   The  only

problem,   I   think,  Dr  Richard  Hu  and  his  Ministerial

colleagues had was how to share out and apportion the goodies

that a healthy Government budget can enable them to dole  out

to the different segments of the population.  For FY2000, the

budget  surplus  is  expected to increase from  the  original

estimate of $2.4 billion to $3.5 billion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget is indeed an extremely generous one.

The Finance

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 75</b></font><br><br>

Minister  has given out benefits to practically  everyone  in

Singapore.   Allow  me to quickly recount some  of  the  very

generous benefits doled out.  There are the significant  2-5%

cuts in personal income tax.  Then there is the unexpected 1%

cut  in corporate tax, following a 1/2% cut already given out

last  year.   Small  businesses are given partial  tax-exempt

benefit  for  chargeable incomes of up to $100,000.   To  top

off, the Government is giving a 10% rebate on personal income

tax.   This is more generous compared to the 5% rebate  given

last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other benefits that touch deeper into the hearts of

the  lower income group is the Service and Conservancy  (S&C)

charges,  rentals and utilities rebates to various households

living  in  HDB  estates.  Then there is the additional  $500

million  contribution  into the Lifelong  Learning  Endowment

Fund,  an additional $250 million to the ElderCare Fund,  and

$100  million to the Medical Endowment Fund.  These are  very

gratifying   benefits  indeed.   These  and  other   benefits

announced brought great cheers to the people. What  is  worth

noting is that the benefits are biased in favour of the lower

income group and the smaller firms.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in spite of the excellent benefits, I do feel

that  there are areas in which the Government can perhaps  do

more,  or  be more proactive to anticipate potential  problem

areas, and detail the possible remedial actions.

Uncertainty of External Economic Developments

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Finance Minister did make general broad brush

reviews of the regional and international economic situation.

However,  I  feel  what is lacking are some clear  statements

stressing  the likely problem areas in the short  and  medium

term.   We are concerned about the worsening US economy.   We

watch  with  dismay  the geo-political  developments  in  our

neighbouring  countries,  like  Indonesia,  the  Philippines,

Thailand,  Japan, Malaysia and elsewhere.  The  Deputy  Prime

Minister, BG Lee Hsien

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 76</b></font><br><br>

Loong,  has  warned about the tough external  environment  as

mentioned in last Friday's newspaper reports.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Deputy Prime Minister said that given the current

political and economic uncertainties in South-east Asia,  the

external   environment  Singapore  now  faces  is  the   most

difficult  since  the  1960s.  He warned  that  any  regional

political  turmoil  would have direct  impact  on  Singapore.

These  are  strong statements and a very realistic and  sober

assessment of the current economic situation.  Then,  why  is

it  that the Budget Statement for this year did not dwell  on

this  matter in depth?  Why are no comments made  on  how  to

deal  with  a potential crisis if another regional crisis  or

turmoil  were to precipitate?  We are fortunate that  through

sound  management of the economy, we have escaped the  recent

crisis  in  a  sharp "V" shape recovery. The people  and  the

business  community  are  indeed  very  concerned   about   a

recurrence of the recession, meaning a "W" shape downturn.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose the Finance Minister will respond that when

the  time comes, he will deal with it, and propose off-budget

measures.   This  is  not a very comfortable  approach.   The

Singapore Government is known for its practice of looking far

ahead, anticipating problems and planning in advance.  As the

Chinese    saying    goes:    wei    yu    chou     mou     (

),  which means to close the windows and the doors before the

rain comes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that this time round, the Budget did not

mention  these preparations.  Are we getting too  comfortable

and  too  smug?   I do not think so.  One explanation  I  can

offer is that talking about a potential downturn may not  fit

in  the tone of the Finance Minister's Budget speech for this

year;  that  things  are  good, let us  come  and  share  the

goodies, and let us worry about the rain later.  Whatever are

his  reasons, I do feel that it would indeed give the  people

more  comfort  that even in good times, we are reminded  that

our  Government is prepared for any unforeseen  eventualities

ahead.  Similarly,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 77</b></font><br><br>

it would bolster the confidence of foreign investors that the

Singapore  Government is very alert and mindful  of  external

eventualities, and is constantly thinking and planning ahead.

We  definitely  are.   This  is  the  trademark  of  the  PAP

Government.

Collaboration with the Countries in the Region

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evident that the region is going through a

difficult transitional period.  I say "transitional"  because

I  am  confident  that the leaders in the regional  countries

will eventually overcome their problems.  Since we are living

in  a  difficult  neighbourhood and  we  cannot  just  uproot

ourselves  and move elsewhere, it is necessary therefore  for

us to find ways to help our neighbours to get out of the rut,

so to speak.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the direct bilateral assistance that we are

doing,  there may well be other methods for us to  help  each

other,  for our mutual benefit.  One way is to use the  ASEAN

framework to do joint trade and investment promotions to  the

Western  economies.   Collectively, the  economic  and  trade

Ministers  of ASEAN countries can work together  to  persuade

the  MNCs  in  the developed countries that this region  (ie,

Indonesia,  Malaysia,  Thailand and others)  are  still  good

investment  areas in view of the low overheads  and  abundant

labour  supply.   Singapore  can  help  to  facilitate   this

process,  if  we  can  undertake joint trade  and  investment

promotions.  If foreign investors return to this region,  the

economic recovery will be hastened.

Leap-frogging the Region

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we work hand in glove with our neighbours to

attract  foreign  investors,  it  is  also  beneficial   that

Singapore makes direct approach to countries beyond ASEAN  to

encourage them to invest here.  In this instance, our move to

establish bilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) is a step in

the  right direction.  The FTAs will encourage the strong and

successful

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 78</b></font><br><br>

companies in the foreign countries to seriously explore trade

and investment opportunities with Singapore.  In the process,

they can be encouraged to cast their eyes wider, and look  at

other investment opportunities in our neighbouring countries.

At  least,  we  can hope that through their  attention  being

attracted  to  Singapore and by casting  their  eyes  in  our

direction, the region will also enter their "radar screen" of

these foreign investors as areas of investments.

Promotion of Nation Building

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the main task of the Budget to plan and allocate

resources  for  the  economic  development  of  the  country,

another major objective of the yearly Budgets is to apportion

Government  spending  and  resources  to  match  the  broader

objective of nation building.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recently completed year 2000 survey of household

income showed that over the last 10-year period from 1990  to

2000,  the  household income gap of Singaporeans has  widened

further.   The national average monthly income of the  lowest

10%  wage  earners dropped from $370 in 1990 to only  $61  in

2000.   In  contrast, the national average monthly income  of

the  top  10% wage earners increased from $9,670 in  1990  to

$16,800 in 2000.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, there has been a widening in the income gap

between  the  rich  and the poor.  As I  recall,  the  Senior

Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, commented before that this is like

a  marathon race by all Singaporeans, starting back  when  we

first  gained our independence.  As we progress and  prosper,

the  gap  between  the forerunners and the stragglers  behind

gets longer and longer.   This is inevitable.  We cannot stop

the  race and start all over again.  We also cannot tell  the

forerunners to run slower to wait for those behind  to  catch

up.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Prime Minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong's call

over  the weekend to the people not to fret over this  income

gap.  Firstly, everybody's income has increased,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 79</b></font><br><br>

from  an  average of $3,080 per month in 1990 to  $4,940  per

month  in 2000.  The Prime Minister has explained that wealth

is  not  confined to a privileged minority at the expense  of

the  majority.  There are opportunities for all.   Wealth  is

redistributed through measures introduced during the  Budget,

and  Government has programmes to reach out and help the poor

and needy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to what the Government can do is to provide

everyone   a  sound  education  so  that  every  Singaporean,

whatever  are  his abilities, can run a good  race  and  earn

enough  rewards to have a decent and useful  life.   For  the

ones  with  potential, we provide scholarships and bursaries,

at  all levels, to lift them to higher heights.  Another task

of  the  Government is to lessen the burdens that the  people

have  to  carry  in  the race, and at the same  time  provide

supplements and assistance programmes along the way.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this regard, I can say that Singapore has scored top

grade  "A"  in  its  mission  of nation  building.   We  have

provided one of the best educational systems in the world, an

envy  of  many  others.  Our students scored high  grades  in

international mathematics and science tests.  They have  done

well in top universities around the world.  They achieved top

honours in international oratorical debates.  We have a  low,

but   simple   and  effective  tax  regime.    Huge   foreign

investments continue to flow in.  We have substantial foreign

reserves.   And  we have consistently achieved high  economic

growth and healthy budget surpluses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I particularly welcome are the various funds to

help  the  poor  and under-privileged.  We have  the  Medical

Endowment   Fund  and  ElderCare  Fund.   Another  worthwhile

programme  is  the Lifelong Learning Endowment  Fund.   These

funds  are very meaningful.   They help the poor and  elderly

to  pay  for their medical and hospitalisation bills if  they

cannot afford it.  The other fund helps the older workers  to

be  trained  and  retrained so that they  can  adapt  to  the

changing technological environment in the work place.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 80</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then what more can be done? Actually, not much more,

since there are so many plans already thought out and put  in

place   by  the  Government.   However,  I  do  have  a   few

suggestions.

Grassroots Fund for Community Groups

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to suggest that we establish a

Grassroots  Support Fund which grassroots  organisations  can

tap  on  to do more activities for their task to support  the

Government's   plan  towards  nation-building  and   building

stronger  community  ties.   I would  say  that  even  if  we

allocate  a  lowly  sum  of $100,000  per  constituency,  the

Government  needs only to put aside $8.3 million  yearly  for

all  the  83 constituencies, as a fund for grassroots leaders

to help finance their projects.  Currently, I do say that the

lack of ready availability of money does put a constraint  on

the  scale  and the quantity of projects and activities  that

grassroots  bodies  like the Residents'  Committees  and  the

Community Clubs can organise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fact that important community groups like the

Residents'  Committees  in HDB estates  are  formed  with  no

direct  funding  support from the Government.   Often,  while

they  devote  much  time to organise activities  to  draw  in

residents,  they  also  have to raise  their  own  funds  for

activities  and  projects.  When  they  have  to  source  for

donations  from local residents or shopkeepers, or  undertake

major  fund raising project exercises, these efforts  can  be

laborious,  energy sapping and time consuming.  I  feel  that

this  is  unfair to our dedicated and hardworking  grassroots

leaders.   Lack  of  funds should not  be  a  constraint  for

grassroots groups to do more.  They should be freed from time

spent  on fund raising, so that they can channel more  energy

towards  organising activities and promoting neighbourliness.

The  grassroots bodies are important elements in the  nation-building process.  It is time that due recognition should  be

given  to  them by allocating them sufficient basic funds  so

that  they can be more effective in their efforts.  The money

is   affordable.    To  ensure  that  the  money   is   spent

meaningfully, we can allow the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 81</b></font><br><br>

advisers of the grassroots organisations to manage and decide

how the funds can be used.

Reward for Pensioners

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area where I feel strongly that the

Government  can  do more is the recognition and  rewards  for

pensioners.   The retired Government pensioners are  a  group

that  has  toiled  quietly and faithfully to  help  build  up

Singapore.   Many of them spent their entire  career  in  the

civil  service.  During the old days when Singapore was  less

well-off,  civil  servants on pension scheme  generally  drew

lower  salaries  compared  to  their  contemporaries  in  the

private sector.  It was just an honour to serve.  Salary  was

not  the  key consideration.  Things have changed  since  the

pension  scheme  has  been  modified  where  most  Government

servants  are  switched  to  full  CPF  payments,  and  civil

servants' salaries are matched to the private sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for the pool of retired civil service

pensioners, many are trying to survive and make ends meet  on

their  lowly  meagre pensions.  They see the  fruits  of  the

economic pie which they have helped to build being shared out

in  the  recent years, but they get nothing or  very  little.

Moreover,  the pensions are eroded in value through inflation

and  increase in the cost of living.  Not many  of  them  are

complaining.  You do not see many letters to the press.   But

I  think during the good times like now, it is important that

this lot of past contributors is not forgotten.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's Budget, the Finance Minister has made an

attempt  to  provide  something for the pensioners.   He  has

increased  the Singapore Allowance by $10 to $150  per  month

and  increased the gross pension ceiling from $950 to  $1,050

per  month.   This  revision  will  cost  the  Government  an

additional $1.7 million.  I wish to lament that this  sum  of

$1.7  million  is  rather  paltry.  Compared  to  the  budget

surplus  expected  for financial year 2000 of  $3.5  billion,

this  is  only 0.0005%, or less than half of a 1,000th  of  a

percent.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 82</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, may I quietly plead to the Finance Minister, on the

pensioners'  behalf,  to  ask  that  some  form  of  a   more

substantial  adjustment be considered so that the  pensioners

are  also amply rewarded.  I am not asking for a formula  for

inflation indexation scheme to constantly adjust pensions for

inflation.  But an ad hoc review may be a kind and thoughtful

gesture.  Sadly, this year's Budget cannot be said to be  the

most  generous  to  the  pensioners.  I  sincerely  hope  the

Finance Minister will sympathise with this appeal.

Raising Living Costs and Business Costs

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, with your indulgence, I like to speak on two

remaining  areas that I wish to raise in this Budget  debate.

It  is a constant refrain from both the common people and the

business  community, that is the call to help contain  rising

costs of living and costs of doing business.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to accept that with rising affluence, living

costs  and  business costs are bound to increase.   What  the

people  and  the  business  sector  are  asking  is  for  the

Government to refrain from imposing more charges,  rates  and

fees  on  them.  For example, the low income group is  facing

difficulty with the recent increase in utility charges due to

oil  price  increases.  Their income is  falling  behind  the

increase in cost of living.  For FY2000, the expected  budget

surplus is a hefty $3.5 billion.  For FY2001, this surplus is

expected to increase further to $4.4 billion.  That means the

Government is collecting more revenue than it needs  for  its

yearly total expenditures.  Surely there is no need to  raise

Government charges and fees.  On the contrary, more reduction

in taxes, rates and fees may be considered.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, the low income group are the people

falling  behind the wage gap between the rich and  the  poor.

The  Government  must continue to find  ways  to  help  them.

Otherwise,  they may feel left behind and become  disgruntled

or  disillusioned that they are not enjoying a share  of  the

country's  economic wealth.  Their only hope is to  see  that

their  children  do  well  in their studies,  and  they  look

forward

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 83</b></font><br><br>

to  the days when their children can secure good jobs, attain

good  stead  in  their  careers.   Therefore,  education  and

retraining is the great opportunity equalisation factor.   We

must  ensure  that everyone has good access to education  and

retraining.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the business community, they are concerned and

disappointed that this year's Budget did not address or  even

mention  how to contain the threat of rising business  costs.

Although the overall economy has grown by 9.9% in 2000,  many

local  businesses  have  not fully recovered  from  the  1998

recession.    Good  examples  are  the  retailers   and   the

construction  sector.   They  are still  facing  insufficient

business demand, high business costs, high labour, utilities,

rental  and other costs.  A survey recently conducted by  the

Singapore  Confederation of Industries  (SCI)  has  confirmed

that  most  local businesses are still concerned  about  poor

business  prospects  and rising business  costs.   Even  MNCs

based   in  Singapore  are  becoming  concerned  about  these

business cost increases.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction of corporate tax by 1% is welcome, no

doubt.  However, companies can only enjoy the tax cut if they

make  a  profit.  If they are not profitable, the tax cut  is

not  meaningful.  Therefore, reducing cost of doing  business

is  still the best and most direct to them.  The only measure

in  the  Budget that helps to reduce business  costs  is  the

reduction  in  property tax rate from 12% to  10%.   However,

except for the residential sector, this effect is negated  by

the  withdrawal of the 25% property tax rebate.   Mr  Finance

Minister, you gave out with one hand and took back  with  the

other hand.  Some may cry foul.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To contain business costs, companies wish to request for

a  slowdown in the restoration of the employers' contribution

rate  to 20%.  The rate has already been restored to 16% from

January 2001.  It is appreciated that workers have taken  the

10%  CPF cut to help lower business cost and help revive  the

economy.   However,  many companies are  concerned  that  too

rapid a restoration of the employers' CPF contribution to the

full 20% will stall their business recovery.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 84</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the business community would like to urge the

Government  to  make  a  determined effort  to  help  contain

business costs.  They hope that with the flexibility  of  the

larger  budget surplus, the Government can do a comprehensive

review  of  Government  administered charges,  such  as  port

charges,  land  transportation  cost,  ERP,  utilities,  COE,

levies,  and other duties, so that operating costs should  be

kept as low as possible.

Conclusion

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to repeat

that this year's Budget is an extremely generous Budget.   We

wish to thank the Minister for Finance and his colleagues for

giving  us so many benefits and rewards.  As he has  said  in

his Budget speech, this year's package of "share-outs" is the

most  generous  to  date (except to the pensioners  perhaps).

This  sharing-out  is possible because of the  effective  and

prudent Government we have.  It is especially significant  in

the  face  of the turmoils we see in the surrounding  region.

The  Government  will  continue to build  substantial  budget

surpluses.   Next  year's budget surplus is  expected  to  be

higher,  as  I  said earlier, at $4.4 billion.   If  this  is

achieved,  we would be pleased that some of this  surplus  is

shared  out with the people, and the balance is put into  our

national reserves as a cushion against future uncertainties.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, uncertainties and changes we are sure

to  face  them, now and in the future.  In my view, the  best

safeguard is not how big our reserves are, but the key is  to

have an effective and honest Government.  That is the one and

only surest safeguard.

<br><br><!-- Mrs Lim Hwee Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs Lim Hwee Hua (Marine Parade):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Minister for Finance has presented what most would regard  as

the  most  generous Budget to-date.  I rise  to  applaud  the

positive  intent on both the business and individual  fronts.

I  would  however  want  to  look  at  the  Budget  from  two

perspectives.   Firstly, to look beyond the goodies,  at  the

material  changes to, (1) the business environment,  and  (2)

the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 85</b></font><br><br>

sharing  of  more of the fruits of our labour in  Singapore's

growth.   And, secondly, to be vigilant about the development

of a psychological divide amongst Singaporeans from the rapid

pace  of  change  from  the extensive  application  of  ever-changing   technology   and  increasing   liberalisation   or

deregulation of certain industries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, on material changes. Sir, the lowering of the

corporate tax rate by 1% point and personal income tax  rates

by  between  2  and  5%  points is a very  significant  move.

Equally  significant  is  the exemption  scheme  for  smaller

chargeable  incomes which will benefit the small  and  medium

enterprises  (or  SMEs),  and to a certain  extent  companies

going through a bad patch.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that, in earlier years, there was a concern

that lowering our corporate tax rate below the 25% level  may

lead  to Singapore being classified as a tax haven.  I am  by

no means suggesting that we forgo the opportunity to make our

tax regime more competitive but I would like to know why this

is  no  longer  a  concern.  Also, if this  is  no  longer  a

constraint, how much lower can we go?  As low as Hong Kong's?

Can  the  Minister also discuss the implications  of  further

reductions  in direct taxes for the level of indirect  taxes,

such as the goods and services tax?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the gap between the top income tax rate and

corporate tax rate has narrowed by 1% point.  I would like to

ask  the Minister whether there is any intention to harmonise

the two in the context of entrepreneurship and start-ups.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the reduction in income tax rates across the board,

presumably  the tax base, in terms of persons  paying  taxes,

will  shrink  further.  Will this limit the effectiveness  of

income   tax   adjustments  as  a  fiscal  tool  in   future?

Specifically, will wealth sharing through tax rebates be less

wide-reaching as a consequence?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the development of a psychological

divide.  In his

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 86</b></font><br><br>

Budget Statement, the Minister has commented on the need  for

both  the  Government and Singaporeans to  adapt  quickly  to

changes and that we must continue to be mindful of our  local

context.  I cannot agree more, for the ability to embrace and

adapt  to  trends and changes by Singaporeans will indeed  be

key to our survival.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is in this context that I am concerned - that we

are facilitating changes but may not have done enough to help

Singaporeans   embrace  changes,  many  of  which   are   not

immediately  obvious.   It  is this psychological  battle  or

divide which, I feel, merits a lot more attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, much has been said about the wealth and digital

divides  which  are largely the consequences of globalisation

and  use of technology.  My colleague, Mr Leong Horn Kee, has

spoken  at  length on the wealth divide.  I should  also  add

that  much has been done to narrow the digital divide by  the

relevant  Ministries,  especially the Ministry  of  Manpower,

MTI,  MCIT  and  the  NTUC,  in  terms  of  putting  training

programmes  in  place and for a wide range  of  workers.   In

aggregate,  the Government has dedicated serious  money,  for

example, $500 million to the lifelong learning initiative for

training and retraining and cannot be accused of not  funding

enough.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, Sir, the digital divide, in terms of the haves

and have-nots to access to computers and technology, learning

and retraining, cannot be addressed simply by pumping in more

money or providing even more training programmes.  A part  of

the budget for such programmes must be allocated to extensive

public  education  and reaching out to the  target  audience,

working  through the grassroots and community  organisations,

where  necessary.  The psychological divide must be  narrowed

first before the digital divide can be.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same attention must be paid to persons, who are

affected   by   realignments  to  our   economy,   be   these

displacement of jobs, liberalisation or deregulation effects.

Sir, this is not unique to us.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 87</b></font><br><br>

Japan  is  being  confronted with a  structural  unemployment

challenge,  which is caused by both a mismatch in skills  and

resistance  to taking on alternative jobs.  In this  context,

can more proactive efforts be made to identify the vulnerable

industries  and counselling be provided as early as  possible

so  that  workers are mentally prepared for the  need  to  be

retrained?   In  any case, as it is highly  conceivable  that

contract  employment  is likely to dominate  in  future,  the

sooner Singaporeans modify their mindsets, the more adaptable

to  change they will be.  The more we can minimise the sudden

shock  of  being  retrenched, the more  willing  to  consider

alternatives  will  Singaporeans be.  Moreover,  our  limited

manpower  resources mean that we can ill-afford to  lose  the

contribution of any segment of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for adapting to the necessary or desirable

liberalisation  or deregulation of certain industries,  there

is anecdotal evidence that some degree of public education is

necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Singaporeans have complained bitterly about being

inconvenienced  by  bank branch closures,  particularly,  the

POSBank  branches that have served them for many years.   But

is  this  rationalisation of branch network unique to POSBank

or  DBS?  No, it is not.  All the other local banks are  also

rationalising.   Or  for  that  matter,  is  it   unique   to

Singaporean  banks?   Again, it is not.   I  understand  that

customers  in  the  UK  and New Zealand are  raising  similar

objections.   Should  the banks have  done  more  to  educate

customers  on the impending changes, which are really  driven

by  competitive forces, not purely from a Singaporean context

but  from  a global perspective?  Yes, individual  banks,  or

perhaps even the Association of Banks, could have embarked on

a  public  education  programme to  pave  the  way  for  more

electronic   banking   as  opposed   to   branch-based   cash

transactions.   Advice on alternative arrangements,  such  as

the  provision of cash-deposit machines, or directions to the

nearest  shopping mall, well ahead of the closure could  have

made the transition easier.  Where the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 88</b></font><br><br>

changes  are  sweeping,  in terms of their  impact  on  daily

lives,  even  the Government can help play a role  in  public

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me end by making a similar request to the

Government to ensure that sufficient resources are set  aside

for  public  education on the impending deregulation  of  the

energy or electricity market.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Trade and Industry has indicated that,

eventually  even  the retail segment of electricity  will  be

completely  liberalised,  implying that  market  forces  will

determine  tariffs,  as opposed to a quarterly  review  right

now.   A  complete  pass-through of costs will  no  doubt  be

transparent  and  defensible  but  Singaporeans  need  to  be

mentally prepared for an exposure to an occasionally volatile

oil  market,  such  as  the phenomenon experienced  recently.

More  importantly, they need to be able to take into  account

possible swings in their household budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, Sir, I support the financial policy as

outlined by the Minister for Finance.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chiam See Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir):</b> Sir, in 1996, we had

an  election budget.  That year was an election  year.   This

time  round,  again, we have essentially an election  budget.

It  is  quite foreseeable that the general election shall  be

held  either  this year or early next year, before  the  next

Budget Day.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister this year has been much more generous than

in  1996.  With the election year in mind, the benefits  have

been  mainly  aimed  at  the  individual,  such  as  the  tax

reduction,  rebates  in  service  and  conservancy   charges,

rentals and utilities.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the tax breaks may not be really beneficial as

about  71% of the workers are not paying income tax  at  all,

there are good reasons for the Minister to be generous.   The

workers  have given their full cooperation in the 1998  cost-cutting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 89</b></font><br><br>

measures to revive the economy, after it was hit by the Asian

crisis.  Singapore suffered two years of recession, beginning

about  July  1997.  In respect of the cost-cutting  measures,

the workers were at the forefront in those steps taken to cut

costs.   They sacrificed a 10-percentage point cut  in  their

CPF.   Even up till today, full restoration of their CPF  has

not  come about yet.  Despite the generosity of the Minister,

workers have given up more of their pay in terms of their CPF

cut than what they shall be receiving in the Budget handouts.

The  workers therefore deserve this generous budget.  Up till

now,  each  of the workers has put in his national  sacrifice

and he suffers in silence.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are forecasts that, this year, the Singapore

economy shall be slowing down.  It is therefore good  to  put

more  money  in  the hands of the HDB flat  dwellers.   I  am

thinking of the poor state of the retail business in the  HDB

heartland,  as  mentioned recently by Dr Lily Neo,  the  hon.

Member  for  Kreta Ayer-Tanglin GRC.  With the  $1.8  billion

handout,  it is hoped that much of it shall be spent  in  the

local  HDB shops, to give those shops some business  to  keep

them  alive  and the ability to pay their HDB  shop  rentals.

Those  rentals  shall largely be returning to the  Government

kitty in any event.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recession came in 1997. The following year, the

Government  put  in place cost-cutting measures.   The  cost-cutting measures comprise mainly cutting the workers'  salary

in  the  form  of  CPF and the flexi component  part  of  the

workers'  pay.  The reduction in wage was mainly  responsible

for  keeping the economy afloat.  Singapore's economy  pulled

through  the recession and recovered.  Last year,  it  had  a

surplus of about $4.36 billion, after the deduction of  $1.85

billion for the special transfers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost every year, Singapore has a surplus in its

Budget.   All  surpluses are transferred to the reserves  and

invested.  Those reserves are not used up for the benefit  of

the people.  Dr Kanwaljit Soin,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 90</b></font><br><br>

the  NMP,  in 1996, during the Budget debate, suggested  that

the  budget surpluses be used in accordance with a  framework

she proposed.  The Minister, of course, refused and said that

the proposal of using the budget according to a framework was

too rigid.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that more money be released from the

surpluses,  say, about $2 billion for a start,  to  make  our

education system the best in the world.  In the initial year,

more  money is needed to build more schools to keep the class

size  small.  My hope is that every Singaporean, by the  time

he   leaves  school,  shall  be  equipped  with  the  English

Language.   He  must be able to understand, to  read  and  to

write properly that language.  Without a working knowledge of

English, our workers shall not be able to be trained to  keep

up  with the knowledge-based economy.  That is the problem of

a  large  number of our workforce today.  They lack a working

knowledge of English and, for that reason, the great  efforts

put in by the Government and the NTUC seem to be getting very

little results.  If we want Singapore to go into the ranks of

the  developed countries, both in terms of per capita  income

and  in  social ranking, we must make sure that every one  of

our  workers  is  properly  educated.   I  say  that  it   is

worthwhile for us to use our accumulated surpluses  for  that

purpose.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Kian Min -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Kian Min (Pasir Ris):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you

for allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the Budget Statement delivered by the Minister

for  Finance.   I am especially heartened by the Government's

commitment  to  creating  the  best  conditions  for  private

enterprise to flourish in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our founding by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819,

people  from  many countries, from different walks  of  life,

have come to Singapore in search of opportunities.  They have

come  in  search  of a better life for themselves  and  their

families.   To many, this means being here to make  a  decent

living and to create

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 91</b></font><br><br>

wealth.   After  all, we are not an island to  the  south  of

Hawaii,  where  people chose to retire to, or to  while  away

their days under a coconut tree.  Singapore has always been a

highly competitive commercial hub for businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, it is business that draws foreign people to

Singapore  and retains local talents to work and  live  here.

If  Singapore  is a backwater economy with few  opportunities

for advancement, talent, which is mobile, will take flight to

seek out opportunities elsewhere.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this globalised world, a highly qualified and

disciplined  workforce, brought about by good  education  and

training, is important but not sufficient by itself to ensure

our  continued success.  As Mr Leong Horn Kee has pointed out

just  now,  we  have  a  very sound and  effective  education

system.   Our young achieved the best scores for science  and

mathematics.  In a recent international ranking, our students

came out tops.  Last year, out of 12,192 students who sat for

the "A" levels, 1,251 students (or more than 10%) scored four

As.   They  move  on to do very well in foreign universities,

often   coming  up  tops  in  their  class.   But  if   after

graduation,  they decide to remain and work  in  London,  New

York  or  Hong Kong and never return, how would that  benefit

us?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore must not merely be a training centre for the

world.   We must not merely be the school that produces  good

students, nor merely an institution that churns out efficient

and  diligent  workers  for  foreign  employers  to  recruit.

Already,  this  is  happening.   Foreign  hospitals  come  to

Singapore  to look for good qualified nurses.  Foreign  firms

woo   our  best  and  brightest  research  engineers.    More

conducive  business  conditions  elsewhere  tempt  our   most

promising entrepreneurs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge, ideas and talents are highly mobile. These

are  mobile  because they reside in the heads of people,  who

are  mobile.  When a person is attracted to move to a foreign

land  with better opportunities, his knowledge, ideas, skills

and talents go with him.  But capital - our own

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 92</b></font><br><br>

money,  our own national reserves - does not move unless  and

until  we decide to move it.  Ultimately, we decide where  to

move  and  deploy  our money.  We should  therefore  use  our

financial assets to strategically seek out and attract  other

people's  knowledge, ideas and talents, and retain  our  own.

Sir,  I  feel that the guardians and managers of our  capital

have  not  been  creative enough to use the  funds  at  their

disposal  to attract and retain talent.  More can and  should

be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is noted that this year's budget contains a lot of

measures  to stimulate the business sector and to  allow  new

industries to mushroom and thrive.  This is a good sign  that

we  are  concerned  about  how to make  sure  that  homegrown

businesses  can  flourish.  We should not just  be  concerned

about  training Singaporeans and foreigners so that they  can

make  it in the world beyond our land.  We want them to  make

it right here within our fair shores.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we need is to make commercial room so that

Singaporeans  can be successful entrepreneurs  in  Singapore.

This  will  be another root to bind good people here  to  our

land.   It will help us deal with the very present danger  of

losing these good people to a digital, globalised world  -  a

world  that  does not subscribe to the concept of "Our  Home,

Our Nation."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entrepreneurs are more invested in a country than

professionals, who just offer their services to  the  highest

bidder  anywhere in the world.  Entrepreneurs  will  be  more

engaged  and  concerned  about  local  issues,  because   the

business  they own is at stake.  We need to give  such  local

talented trained Singaporeans the business conditions to grow

here, so that they can feel invested in this country and have

a stake here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, at the same time that we are making room for top

talents,  we must also make room for those who are  going  to

have  a harder time in this high-speed world.  While we  must

emphasize  training  and  skills  upgrading  to  prepare  our

population for the new economy, and there are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 93</b></font><br><br>

laudable  success  stories of those  who  have  made  it,  in

reality,  not everyone can be retrained for the  new  digital

age.   Some may just have to be helped along until their next

generation  takes  over and brings the  entire  family  to  a

higher plane.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, the media reported that the income gap was

widening.   Those  from  low-income  families  running  small

businesses face a particularly daunting uphill struggle.  The

small  business  owner is becoming a dying breed.   There  is

also a change in business operations and the big boys have an

advantage.  Take, for example, newspaper kiosks along Orchard

Road   and  at  bus  stops  are  tendered  and  won  by   big

corporations  like Singapore Press Holdings.  The  individual

proprietors do not stand a chance in the tender exercise.   I

understand that some schools are considering tendering  their

canteens  to  main contractors, who then find individuals  to

run the stalls for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this makes commercial sense in terms of

control, coordination and efficiency.  It is easier  to  deal

only with one "big boss" rather than many small ones.  It  is

easier to sub-contract to a main contractor and let him  deal

with the small individual problems.  However, what this means

is  that  the  small guys no longer have an avenue  to  start

small, and will always be an employee and taken advantage  of

by bosses who act as middlemen.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many famous entrepreneurs have started small. One

example  is Li Ka-shing, who started the Cheung Kong  factory

making plastic flowers.  Today, he is a major player in  real

estate, retail, telecommunications, power generation and port

operation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we, in modern Singapore, have room for someone to

start  small and grow like this?  I would say it  is  a  room

that  is  getting smaller every day.  But I do think that  we

need  to  give  some due consideration to the small  business

owner in Singapore, to give him a fair and fighting

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 94</b></font><br><br>

chance to carve out some niche here.  I am happy that in this

budget, we have embarked on this process.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the financial policy of the Government.

<br><br><!-- Mr Seng Han Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Seng Han Thong (Ang Mo Kio)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr

Speaker,  Sir, in his Budget Statement, Finance  Minister  Dr

Richard   Hu   described  this  as  the  most  generous   and

unprecedented Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget is not only generous, but is thought of by

many  as being more generous than expected.  My personal view

is  that  the  generosity  of  the  Finance  Minister  is   a

principled  and creative one.  It is intended to relieve  the

people  from   hardship, reassuring the people,  pro-business

and maintaining competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just now, the Member for Potong Pasir said that this was

an  "election year" Budget.  I think we can only say it is  a

budget  which  is  presented  close  to  an  election   year.

Utilities, service and conservancy charges rebates will serve

to  relieve the hardship of the lower-income group.  Lifelong

Learning Endowment Fund, Eldercare Fund and Medical Endowment

Fund  serve to reassure the people.  The various tax  rebates

and  reductions will not only benefit the business  community

but also reaffirm  their competitiveness.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, the most touching part of his Budget Statement,

particularly to the lower and middle income workers  who  are

apprehensive  under  the impact of the new  economy,  is  the

following  statement, "This year's Budget emphasises  how  to

help  every  worker  to  pull  through  this  difficult   but

necessary  economic transformation."  The Minister also  said

that  in  the next 10 to 15 years we need to have a workforce

comprising  at least 65% workers who have received  secondary

education  and above.  Yet, in 1999, we had only 35%  of  our

workforce with secondary education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has allocated another $500 million to the

Lifelong Learning

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 95</b></font><br><br>

Endowment  Fund.  The Fund has now $2 billion.  As this  Fund

will eventually be topped up to $5 billion, our challenge now

is  how  to  mobilise every Singaporean  to   participate  in

lifelong learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should let everyone know that the objective of

lifelong  learning  is to enable our workers  to  tackle  the

challenges of the new economy, that is,  to have a job in the

new economy and to lead a good life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many workers have this worry: they thought that "new

economy"  means  computer technology,  companies  reform  and

restructure,  and hence more retrenchments.  Then,  they  may

lose their jobs. To undergo retraining, they fear it may be a

case of "The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, during the transitional period of migrating

to  a  new economy, the Government should give them not  only

the  Lifelong  Learning Endowment Fund but also the  lifelong

learning confidence.  Tell them, "The new economy is actually

built  upon  the  foundation of the  old  economy.   The  new

economy  is not just computer technology, life sciences.   It

also  includes the essentials of our daily lives."   The  new

economy  is to solve the problems of our daily lives in  more

innovative ways, to improve our quality of life, and  to  let

us lead better lives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example. I believe everyone of us

must have taken instant noodles.  I believe every family must

have  stored  some instant noodles at home.   In  fact,  many

people  are storing some packets of instant noodles in  their

office  to tackle the challenges brought about by working  in

the new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instant noodle was invented in the 1950s by Ando

Momofuku  of Japan.  He is already 94 years old today.   This

was  the first chicken ramen invented by him in the 50s.  The

instant  noodle is a product of the old economy.  It  enables

us  to  eat a bowl of steaming hot and stomach-filling noodle

very quickly, and it is cheap.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, instant noodle is also a product of the new economy

because it is continuously innovating, and new types of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 96</b></font><br><br>

products,  new flavours and new packaging are emerging  every

day.   We  have now the cup noodle and the bowl  noodle.   In

other  words, we do not need to have a cup or a bowl to enjoy

a meal of delicious instant noodle.  How creative!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instant noodle is sold all over the world, even taking

to  the  sky.   When we are hungry while taking a  long  haul

aircraft,  we  can simply ask the air hostess for  a  cup  of

instant  noodles.  Instant noodle can take to the sky because

it is convenient and innovative.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instant noodle is part of the new economy. Our

Singaporean popiah, kuehs, satay and roti prata can also  fit

into the new economy.  If we can be more creative to make the

production of these delicacies more economical, tastier, more

"instant-cooking", they can become a part of the new economy.

If  they  can be like the instant noodle selling to all  over

the  world, then they are part of the new economy!  I am glad

to  see  that  our  "Ti Yi Jia" popiah  has  stepped  out  of

Singapore.   Our Bengawan Solo has set up retail  outlets  at

Changi Airport so that tourists can bring our Singapore brand

home.  These are products of the new economy!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I hope that when the Ministry of the

Environment and the HDB upgrade their hawker centres, markets

and  neighbourhood shops, they would create opportunities for

creative  Singaporeans  to start up not  only  in  their  HDB

flats,  but  also in our markets and shops,  and  extend  the

benefits  of the "Creativity Fund" to them.  Let the ordinary

folks see that when computer technology which is essential to

the new economy is creatively applied to our daily lives,  it

can make life better for everyone.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is only an example. I can give you hundreds of

other   examples   to  illustrate  how  we  could   encourage

Singaporeans, especially the older Singaporeans, to take part

in lifelong learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that in the new Budget, the Minister for Finance

could consider

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 97</b></font><br><br>

allocating  some  funds  to  encourage  employers  to  employ

workers who have undergone retraining, that is, those workers

who have migrated from the old economy to the new economy.  I

also  wish  that  while  emphasising  the  new  economy,  the

Government  should also simultaneously tell all  Singaporeans

that any service or product which brings about better results

through creative measures will be needed by the new economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you another illustration. Our public bus

service  conveys  some 2 million passenger-trips  every  day,

about half of our population.  Buses spur on our economy, our

new  economy.  If the buses do not move, our economy will  be

affected.  As such, the bus service industry is also part  of

the new economy.  Can we not conduct various training schemes

through  the  Government  to attract  more  workers  who  are

affected  by the economic transformation to turn to  the  bus

service  industry?   I understand that many  years  ago,  SBS

attempted  to promote a bus driver training scheme,  but  the

response  was  not  encouraging.  If we  can  repackage  this

scheme,  it should be able to help some Singaporeans who  are

affected  by the economic transformation.  Let them obtain  a

Class 4 licence which costs some $1,000.  This will also help

to alleviate the problem of shortage in bus drivers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I am citing all these examples to

illustrate the fact that apart from computer technology,  our

essentials in life, such as clothing, food, accommodation and

transportation, can also be part of the new economy.  As  the

Finance  Minister said, "Every Singaporean  can  continue  to

play a role in our new economy."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the Budget Statement by the

Finance Minister.

<br><br><!-- Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mdm Claire Chiang See Ngoh (Nominated Member):</b> Sir,

Budget  2001  is a generous one.  As this is my  last  Budget

speech  in  this House, I would like to express a few  wishes

for this House to consider.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 98</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by adopting as a starting principle in S21 that

"everyone   matters",  we  have,  as  a  society,  explicitly

recognised  that,  while we should continue  to  nurture  the

elites,  the  very  smart children and  big  or  leading-edge

businesses, we must now equally focus our attention  on  ways

to  enhance  the quality of life for many other  Singaporeans

who  are  not  so  smart, not so capable and also  the  small

businesses like what Mr Seng Han Thong had argued for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately for us, there is no abject, absolute poverty

in Singapore.  However, poverty, as any sociologist or social

psychologist will attest to, is a relative measure  of  well-being.   And even in the richest societies, so long as  there

is  competition and a free market place where some are better

off  than  others, there will be pockets of  underclass,  the

disadvantaged and the marginalised.  That is not something to

be ashamed of or to hide, but instead, to try to reduce it by

first  understanding what is happening, and then how to  deal

with it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need better and more sophisticated measures of

relative  poverty, such as the impact of the length  of  time

families  spend  in so-called "poor" status,  on  the  mental

health  of various family members and suicide rates;  or  the

impact  of  low  income  on educational  opportunities,  even

within  a  meritocratic  society.  We  need  to  explore  the

complex  dynamics between drop-out rates from  school,  crime

rate,  family break-ups, poorer housing conditions and income

levels.  The recent release in the Straits Times on the  rise

of  children  as  young  as pre-primary  and  primary  levels

seeking psychiatric help is a disturbing trend.  Is this, for

example,  related  to  income at all?   Or  is  it  a  stress

condition caused by school pressures which affects all social

classes?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the "untidy", no-simple-answer social

complexities  which  are masked by macro-economic  statistics

such as per capita GDP.  Now that we have arrived as a nation

and achieved the highest per capita GDP in the region, we can

do more than meeting the basic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 99</b></font><br><br>

needs  of  Singaporeans by addressing the numerous challenges

due to globalisation.  It is not just the low-income families

which  are  struggling,  the impact of  modern  day  stresses

claims  its  casualties in all social  classes  in  different

intensity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the low-income or socially disadvantaged

families  need  integrated solutions  to  their  inter-linked

problems.  As Dr Hu himself had said in a World Bank  meeting

last   year  that  a  "new  social  contract  is  needed   as

distribution of wealth and opportunities cannot depend solely

on  free  market"  (June  7,  2000,  Business  Times).   This

initiative  requires a belief in the worth of the  individual

by  offering  to  those who fall behind a second  chance  and

additional  support to move on. The Government had identified

training  as  an important support but we also need  to  know

what  are  the  socio-psychological barriers to learning  and

retraining and why are the older workers not stepping forward

to  retrain.   Education is provided for  even for  the  poor

with  the  Education Fund proposed in the  Budget,  but  what

about those in the 60s and older who are beyond training  and

expect to live for 15 to 20 years more?  How are we going  to

share our prosperity with them?  Will they get farther behind

us as our nation is hurtling into the new era?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need now to give substance to PM's call for a caring

society  by  starting  to construct  a  new  social  contract

through   specific  measures.  We  can  begin  by  committing

resources  to tracking a range of social exclusion indicators

with  the  objective of monitoring whether we see a permanent

underclass emerging.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I would like to propose four measures.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, after a decade of dialogues and workshops on the

family,  we  need some closure by enunciating a clear  family

policy  that  addresses  the needs of  families.   This  will

generate an ethical movement to help Singaporeans re-focus on

family  values  and  encourage the start-up  of  a  range  of

services and industries to cater to the needs of working

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 100</b></font><br><br>

couples.  Like the $500 million Lifelong Learning Fund  which

was  set  up  to develop a slew of programmes to upgrade  our

workers, we should set up a similar $500 million Family  Fund

to  implement the numerous recommendations on family-friendly

programmes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, set up an Inter-Ministry Fund to sponsor joint

projects which need to be addressed in a concerted effort  by

all  Ministries  and  civil servants.  For  example,  in  our

effort to implement an effective care plan and rehabilitation

programmes for domestic violence victims and perpetrators, we

need  to  draw the IT resources of the various Ministries  to

produce  a  central database on domestic violence  cases  and

their  profile.  We have talked about this project  for  four

years  and the progress has been slow, because there  was  no

ownership  by  any  one Ministry due to a  lack  in  funding.

Other  projects  include the collaboration among  MCDS,  MOM,

NTUC  and  SNEF  to set up formal structures,  processes  and

activities   to   facilitate  implementation  of   pro-family

practices  at workplaces.  Another urgent need is to  enhance

the  channels  of  information sharing  and  coordination  of

services  between  prisons and the community-based  voluntary

agencies in dealing with special needs of children and  their

families made vulnerable by both their parents' incarceration

due to drug offences.  These children, about 850 of them, are

left unattended by their own parents.  Sir, the fragmentation

and  duplication  of efforts at all fronts  is  wasteful  and

frustrating for all the officers involved.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, in view of continuing labour shortage in the

services sector and particularly higher attrition rates among

social  work  graduates, we may need to develop  social  work

skills  within our communities.  I propose that we set  up  a

Social  Service Training Scheme in each CDC to design adapted

social  work  curriculum to be conducted  in  various  family

service centres and community centres, with the objective  of

producing a larger pool of social service personnel  to  meet

specific needs of that community.  Housewives, retirees, mid-life adults wishing to change

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 101</b></font><br><br>

careers, retrenched mid-40s who have no paper qualifications,

retired teachers, nurses and youths can be tapped and trained

through  modular  programmes, to  deliver  paid  social  work

duties.    By  introducing  social  service  skills  training

programmes outside of tertiary institutions and locating them

within   the   community,   with   proper   supervision   and

accreditation  status,  we can effectively  match  the  right

people to appropriate skill modules.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, set up a once-off Parliamentary Committee to

review and rationalise budgetary, regulatory and professional

issues  related  to  the  social services  and  its  delivery

infrastructure.    Let me raise specific issues.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should Government adjust the current 50-50 co-sharing

scheme for subsidising the operating expenses of a VWO  to  a

60-40  funding formula considering that operating  costs  are

rising  faster than Singaporeans' willingness  to  donate  to

charities?   At  the  level of service  providers,  will  the

Government  allow a VWO to operate a school for drop-outs  to

promote  second  chance  education?   Will  the  Ministry  of

Education fund it partially?  If a VWO is willing to  deliver

occupational  therapy services to homes and  charge  for  its

services,  can it do so without losing its funding  from  the

Government?  There are many suggestions which can enliven the

social  service sector and make it more dynamic  and  market-driven,  if  some  of  the  regulatory  restrictions  on  the

operations  can be re-assessed.  Can we move  away  from  the

comfort  zone  of  making small step incremental  changes  to

policies  and instead map out new working models which  place

VWOs at the core of the delivery infrastructure?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our effort to professionalise and upgrade social

services,  we  need to address the remuneration structure  of

the  sector  to incentivise more to join and remain  in  this

sector.   In  similar arguments which we have  used  to  keep

civil servants or teachers in their jobs by paying them

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 102</b></font><br><br>

well,  we need to consider paying social workers well  enough

to ensure that they deliver quality service to those in need.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we also rationalise a policy on eldercare after

so  many  dialogues and workshops were conducted  last  year?

Who  is  designing a policy on disability and addressing  the

critical need for rehabilitative and residential needs of the

severely mentally handicapped in order to lighten the  burden

of  parents  who  need to go out to work?  Indeed,  NCSS  and

MCDS,  as well as MOE, are the institutions tasked to provide

new  guidelines and seek more funding for services on  behalf

of these vulnerable communities.  I remember the Minister for

Finance told me last year that he never failed to give  money

away  if there were good reasons, but only if they were being

requested  by the various Ministries in the first  place.   I

urge  the officers to take this point seriously and  help  to

champion the needs of the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a need to thoroughly review outdated regulatory

mechanisms  and  planning norms.   Let  me  illustrate.   The

financial support of 90% capital funding for a special school

and rehabilitation workshop for the disabled is based on what

the   MOE  and  MCDS  define  as  "supported"  areas.   These

supported  areas  are based on space norms which  were  fixed

during  the  seventies,  at  a time  when  physiotherapy  and

occupational  therapy  were based on high  touch  and  simple

equipment.   Today,  with  better  and  larger  physiotherapy

equipment, more space is needed, but VWOs will not be  funded

for  this  increased space requirement, as  the  space  norms

remain  unchanged.  Believe it or not, this rigidity  applies

in  setting  space norms for details such  as  toilets.   And

different Ministries set different space norms.  For example,

for  occupational  therapy functions,  MOE  funds  42  square

metres for two persons, and MCDS funds 18 square metres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VWOs today find the norms too outdated, limited and

restrictive.   So,  in order to develop a building  with  the

desired features optimal for the comfort

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 103</b></font><br><br>

of  their  clients  who are on wheelchairs,  for  example,  a

social  agency  ends up paying close to 40%  of  the  capital

funding,  instead of just the 10%. On top of that, they  need

to  find  more money for furniture installed outside  of  the

"supported areas", including office installations.   What  is

peculiar  to  me  is,  for  a  group  such  as  the  Spastics

Association which is tasked to equip the disabled with  basic

self-management  skills and cooking being one  such  critical

skill, the space designated as domestic science classrooms is

not  funded  by  MOE.    Yet, the Ministry  funds  mainstream

schools which conduct domestic science classes.  Sir, I think

we need to revamp, assess and fix new space norms for special

needs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, given that a budget surplus of $4.4 billion has

been  forecasted for the coming financial year, and if  there

is another severe economic downturn, I hope the Minister will

focus  on the lower 10% segment of the population and support

the social services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My last wish, Sir, is that the representation of women

parliamentarians and female community leaders  and  directors

at  all  levels, will increase in order to provide  a  multi-layered  perspective to social and economic policies.   Their

increased  participation may help to highlight more questions

on the social sector which I hope will be given more priority

to  be raised in this House.  If families are the pillars  of

social  cohesion, then women's role in forging this  cohesion

is  critical, as they are the primary care-givers tending  to

the needs of the young and the old.  They know the challenges

of keeping families intact.  They know the impact of economic

upswings  and downturns on family cohesion.  If we listen  to

what  women  have to say and want, gentlemen, we  would  have

helped to solve literally half of the country's problems.

<br><br><!-- Mr S. Iswaran -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. Iswaran (West Coast):</b> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir,

for allowing me to join in this debate.  I rise in support of

Budget FY2001 and the financial policies that underpin it.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 104</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, by all accounts, this is a Budget that is generous

and  many speakers have already alluded to that.  But, to me,

I  think this Budget is significant for one particular reason

and,  that is, it is introducing not just a series of one-off

transfers,  but also systemic and structural changes  to  our

fiscal regime.  I think that is important because it has  the

effect  of translating one-off gains in our surpluses into  a

stream   of  incentives,  a  flow  of  benefits,   for   both

individuals and corporations.  And I welcome that  because  I

think it will serve our long-term goals.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a case in point, I would like to focus on corporate

tax.  I think lowering the corporate tax by 1%, to 24.5%,  is

a  good  gesture,  and it is certainly in  keeping  with  the

times.    Avowedly   socialist  regimes  like   Sweden   have

aggressively reduced their corporate tax, and it is  good  to

see   that  Singapore  is  not  sitting  by  waiting  to   be

competitively outflanked by these countries.  But having said

that, Sir, and I think the previous speaker Mrs Lim Hwee  Hua

mentioned this and I would like to bring up this point again,

the  Minister  has  previously mentioned that  the  long-term

target was 25% for the corporate tax.  And one of the reasons

he  cited  was concern about Singapore becoming a tax  haven,

and  I  believe this, in particular, was linked  to  concerns

from certain countries which are big investors here.  I would

like  to know how has this scenario changed and perhaps, more

importantly,  since this threshold has now been breached  and

we  have gone below 25%, the question is: what next?   And  I

would be grateful if the Minister could share with this House

the  Government's thinking on its longer-term target for  the

corporate tax, and what will be the parameters that  it  will

use in determining that policy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I also welcome the introduction of preferential tax

treatment for the first $100,000 of the chargeable income  of

corporations.  This has introduced, I think, as a  matter  of

principle for the first time, an element of progressivity  in

the  corporate tax regime in Singapore.  I think  this  is  a

very   welcome  development  and  certainly  SMEs   who   are

profitable will be thankful for it.  And I do hope that  this

is a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 105</b></font><br><br>

principle  that  the  Government  will  apply  with   greater

flexibility in the years ahead in response to scenarios.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to focus on the company stock option plan

(CSOP).   Sir,  the  move  to  extend  the  preferential  tax

treatment  to established companies is a welcome  one.   Last

year,  when  it  was first introduced for the start-ups,  the

question  was  when will it be extended to  other  companies,

since the principles underlying stock options are general  in

nature.   Having introduced the scheme, I would like  to  ask

the Minister two specific questions.  The first, why is there

a  difference in the tax treatment between start-ups  on  the

one  hand  and  established  companies  on  the  other?   The

motivation  for  a  stock option scheme  is  the  same.   The

Minister  has, in the past, argued that it is because  start-ups  have  greater difficulty in attracting  talent.   But  I

would  ask  the Minister to consider this.  In  the  case  of

start-ups,  those  who join the start-ups tend  to  get  much

larger   quantities  of  stock  options.   So  there   is   a

quantitative  element in the attractiveness of start-ups  and

the option schemes therein.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, one could also argue quite persuasively that

the  scope for upside in a start-up is significantly  greater

provided it succeeds.  Given those scenarios, I would imagine

that even if the tax regime for stock options is the same for

all companies, it should not adversely affect the ability  of

start-ups to attract talent.  So I would appreciate it if the

Minister could explain why there is this differentiation  and

whether there is scope to harmonise this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect of this CSOP scheme is the requirement

that  50%  of  employees must have stock options  before  the

company  can  qualify.    Sir,  I understand  the  motivation

behind  it  and I fully appreciate the intent.  But  I  would

like  to pose two questions:  one, which I think is a problem

in  principle,  is stock options in general are  targeted  as

incentive   devices   for  the  senior   management   of   an

organisation.  It

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 106</b></font><br><br>

is debatable how valuable it is as a device to motivate lower

down  the  ranks, because the quantum given to them would  be

relatively  small.   And, secondly, there are  other  devices

such   as   variable  bonuses  and  other  performance-linked

incentives, which can take its place.  That being the case, I

think  it poses a problem in principle why we need to  insist

on this 50% minimum allocation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other is the problem in practice. Sir, today, in

Singapore,  there  are  many  corporations  which  will   use

Singapore  as  a  HQ  for  R&D  and  certain  core  types  of

activities, but it is not uncommon to find that the  bulk  of

their manufacturing operations and other activities may  well

be conducted outside the country.  It is not uncommon to find

companies  which  have got the bulk of their manpower  living

and  working in countries outside Singapore, in ASEAN, China,

etc.   These  are  subsidiaries or  wholly-owned.   In  these

instances,  the 50% requirement, it seems to  me,  will  pose

quite  a  problem for the company to structure  a  meaningful

stock  option scheme for those working in China, in order  to

meet  the 50% threshold.  So without knowing the full details

of  the scheme, I would urge the Minister to consider a  more

flexible  application of this requirement.  In the limit,  it

would   be  best  if  the  requirement  could  be  eliminated

altogether.   But  if  that is not the case,  then  certainly

lowering  the threshold, I think, would be very  helpful  for

such companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, on the matter of systems and structures, may I just

turn  my  focus  now to transfers and income  redistribution.

First,  I  would like to add my voice to the chorus of  those

who have asked for a more generous  -  if I may use that term

-   treatment  of  pensioners.  I heard  feedback  from  many

pensioners that a $10 increment in the Singapore Allowance is

by  all  means not the best that the Government can  do,  and

they ask that they be treated with greater consideration.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, Sir, in more general terms, the

Government has used three main devices to effect some form of

wealth sharing or income redistribution

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 107</b></font><br><br>

and  transfers.   The first device has been tax  rebates  and

reductions in tax for individual income.  The fact that  more

than two-thirds of Singaporeans, and I believe the proportion

will  rise with recent measures, I think the first $7,500  of

chargeable  income will now be tax exempt  as  well,  so  the

proportion  of  Singaporeans who do not pay income  tax  will

certainly  be above 70%.   The effectiveness of  tax  rebates

and  tax rates reduction as a means of redistributing  wealth

or sharing wealth is limited.  It is more, I think, correctly

regarded   as   a  device  to  incentivise  those   who   are

productively contributing to the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second device the Government has used is direct

transfers.   The  examples are the CPF top-up  or  the  SC/CC

rebates  and the like.  And in these instances, there  is  an

element  of progressivity, because the quantum is  pegged  to

the  housing type and the number of rooms in an HDB  flat  is

used as an indicator of the level of wealth or socio-economic

standing  of the family or an income earner.  While this  has

its  limitations,  I understand that it is  not  perfect  but

probably  one  of the most practical proxies,  and  I  accept

that.   But we have to bear in mind therefore that  this  too

has  its limitations, as a device to redistribute income  and

wealth within Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third device has been endowments. We have set up

numerous  endowment funds, as and when our  budget  surpluses

allow  for  it.   These have been the Edusave Endowment,  the

Medical  Endowment  Fund, the ElderCare  Fund,  the  Lifelong

Learning Fund and so on and so forth.  There is a whole range

of  these endowments.  They each serve specific purposes, but

the  general principle in setting aside an endowment is  that

the income will be used to meet particular policy objectives.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, all these measures have advantages and

disadvantages and, collectively, they do serve a  purpose  in

redistributing and sharing wealth in Singapore.   But  having

said  that,  I would like to ask the Minister whether,  given

that  fewer  Singaporeans will be paying income  tax  in  the

years

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 108</b></font><br><br>

ahead,  there  is,  as  part  of the  Government's  financial

policy,  an  effort to perhaps transfer more  of  the  income

redistribution  through direct transfers as  opposed  to  tax

rebates  and  the  endowments.  I  would  like  to  get  some

clarification on that from the Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, and this is a point that Mrs Lim Hwee

Hua  alluded  to, I would like to reinforce  this  with  some

specific  proposals.  I think the Budget is a  very  imposing

document  and  it is a budget certainly at the  macro  level.

But  it  is micro in its impact on individuals and companies.

There  is a need to be able to communicate the effect of  the

Budget and the slew of Government measures that have been set

up   time   and  again  to  help  individuals  and  companies

effectively to the target audience.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have two specific requests which the Minister if he

could  consider  them,  I would be grateful.   The  first  is

whether, either as part of any Budget presentation or perhaps

as  a  separate  exercise, together with the media  or  other

communication  channels, the Government can  demonstrate  the

net   effect  of  various  transfers,  etc,  on  the  average

Singaporean earner.  For example, we could define that as a 4-room  flat  resident with a median income of about  $1,500  a

month.   But the key point here really is bringing the Budget

down  to  the  average man's level.  Many fail to  grasp  the

significance of various measures.  And I feel that this would

be one way of getting the message across, that indeed if they

look  at  the  totality of what is being  offered,  that  the

Government  is  being fair and channelling the incentives  to

targeted areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other aspect is in terms of communication on this

whole  range  of  endowments that have  been  created.   Each

Ministry   or   statutory   board   is   charged   with   the

responsibility for a particular endowment under its care  and

manages its own communication.  But I think it would be  fair

to  say that on the ground, the information is certainly  not

perfect  and many would still be quite confused or  at  least

unaware of the various schemes and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 109</b></font><br><br>

what  is  required.   Sir, the Ministry  of  Finance  has  an

overview of the entire range of endowments we have set up  in

Singapore.  I think it would be very helpful if the  Ministry

could,  in fact, come out with a communication plan.   It  is

not  just about printing brochures but a systematic means  of

getting  the  message across to agencies that are interacting

on  the ground with the average Singaporeans and companies on

the  whole  range of measures in place.  And I do  not  think

this  is a one-off exercise either because every year we have

new  developments, and in fact even between budgets  we  have

changes.   There is a need to communicate this in a  holistic

way  so  that agencies on the ground - for individuals,  this

could  be  the  CDCs  or CCCs even; on the  other  hand,  for

corporations, it could be various business groups and so on - understand the total picture and are ready to dispense advice

appropriately.  I know some of these have already been  done,

Sir.   But  I  wonder whether the Ministry of Finance  could,

through  its leadership, bring all this together as  one  key

communication  device  which  is managed  systematically  and

regularly,  so  that all Singaporeans can  benefit  from  the

Government's schemes.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sir, I support the Budget.

<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Boon Wan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Boon Wan (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank

you for allowing me to join in this debate.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year we truly cross into the new millennium. If

this  marks  our  journey  into a  new  future,  then  surely

Minister  Richard Hu has ensured that Budget 2001 befits  the

occasion.   This  is indeed a commendable Budget.   There  is

something for everyone.  It caters to both the future and the

present.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister has prepared this Budget with an eye

towards  the future.  He has reduced the corporate,  property

and  individual tax rates.  Unlike rebates, these  alter  the

tax  structure for the long term.  He has made available more

money for education to ensure that our young are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 110</b></font><br><br>

well  prepared for the future.  In an increasingly  uncertain

world, he has provided for national security.  He has ensured

that  research efforts will not be hampered for the  lack  of

funds.  This reflects the Government's thinking and vision of

a  competitive  globalised  future.   The  Minister  has  not

forgotten  the sacrifices of the people.  He remembers  their

contributions to the sterling recovery and performance of the

economy  last  year.  He has generously shared  the  economic

surplus with the people with, for example, increases in  tax,

rental  and  service and conservancy rebates.   Some  people,

like  Mr  Chiam See Tong, have described this as an "Election

Budget".   But  surely at all times, it  is  the  hope  of  a

government  to be able to announce a generous budget  that  a

country can afford.  I congratulate Minister Dr Richard Hu on

Budget 2001.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Singapore will encounter many challenges as we

transit into the new economy which is dictated by information

and  information technology.  Among these, let  me  highlight

the  issues  of  the digital and social divides.   These  are

divisive  issues for a society.  These issues are not  unique

to Singapore.  All societies moving into the new economy will

face  them.  Several of my fellow Members of Parliament  have

spoken on these issues.  Let me add my views to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new economy needs people who are information

technology  literate.   People  who  cannot  use  information

technology  will  be cut off from the many new  opportunities

that  will  become available.  They will be confined  to  the

less  meaningful and low-paying jobs which at the  same  time

will  also decrease.  People who are tuned to the new economy

will thus earn more.  The divide between the well-off and the

less well-off will widen and become more entrenched with  the

IT factor.  Who are those affected?  They are not only people

without  or with low education but also the older people  who

grew  up  in  a  world without computers  and  have  problems

learning to use it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The digital divide will widen the income gap. This is

the reality of the situation.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 111</b></font><br><br>

But what is important is to make sure that everyone shares in

the  benefits  of  the  new economy.   I  am  glad  that  the

Government  is  allocating more money for education  and  has

spared  no effort to introduce IT into our classrooms at  all

levels,   schools,   junior   colleges,   polytechnics    and

universities.   The positive outcome of this effort  will  be

seen in the years ahead.  But I would like the Government  to

do more for the rest of the population - the old, the working

people  and all the others who are not IT-literate - to  help

them  learn to use the computer.  This will open the new  and

increasing well-paying jobs and opportunities to  them.   Let

us   also  retain  jobs  that  do  not  really  need  to   be

computerised  for the others who cannot adapt to  information

technology.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter what we do, there will always be some who will

fall through the net.  These are the people who are unable to

cope  in  an  increasingly competitive new economy.   In  the

United States where the upper end earns over 400 times  those

at the lower end it is an indication we are living in a world

where the income gap will continue to widen.  The feeling  of

having  lost  out  will increase among  those  who  are  less

successful.  The sharing of the success of the nation will be

important  for  the  unity of the  country.   The  system  to

support those in need needs to be strengthened.  This  became

evident  during the recent economic crisis.  The solution  is

not  merely financial.  The issue is how to help them to  get

out  of  the  rut and on their feet again.  How can  we  help

those  who are unemployed to get a job?   What can we  do  to

help  those  who  have become structurally irrelevant  become

employable  once  again  in the new economy?   In  a  rapidly

changing  world  where  a person is  expected  to  have  many

careers  in  a lifetime, such help will become  routine.   We

need  to  devise  a more robust support system  to  help  our

people.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, social cohesion is crucial for a nation. In a new

economy,   social  pressures  arising  from  the  impact   of

information technology will stress social cohesion.  We  must

consciously  and  proactively tackle  these  pressures.   The

Government understands the urgency of the task and has  taken

steps

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 112</b></font><br><br>

in this direction.  More, however, can and needs to be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the Budget.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chng Hee Kok -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chng Hee Kok (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

in  support of the motion standing in the name of the Finance

Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all Singaporeans, I must compliment the Minister

for Finance for delivering a sterling Budget.  It is hard  to

find fault with such a Budget, except asking the Minister for

Finance to do more of everything.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps with such a large surplus to give away, I can

only  suggest  that the Government should put some  money  to

train Singaporeans from all walks of life to be IT-savvy.  If

we wish to transform the way we do things, the way we conduct

Government  business, especially making use of computers  and

the  Internet,  then we must train everyone  who  is  not  in

school.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister spoke of a major transformation in

the  delivery  of  Government  services  by  providing  these

services  online.  He said that, "By the end  of  this  year,

nearly   two-thirds  of  all  Government  services  will   be

available online in some way or other, making them accessible

24 hours a day".

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I applaud the Government's long-term plan to move

with  the  inevitable  way business is  being  conducted  and

targeting its services to be accessible 24 hours a day, there

are  a number of other issues.  Chief amongst this is how  to

make sure that the users of today, and the users of today are

not   the  school  children, they  are  the  housewives,  the

retirees  and the not-so-well-educated, can avail  themselves

of  such  services and use these online services effectively.

The  Government must embark on programmes to make "IT for the

Masses"  or  "IT  for Everyone" a competitive  advantage  for

Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides bringing all Singaporeans into the online

mainstream, we must make

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 113</b></font><br><br>

sure  online  transactions  are secure  and  effective.   Are

online services user-friendly and easy to locate?  Since  all

Government  Ministries  attempt  to  provide  their  services

online,  how  does the Government ensure that there  is  some

uniformity in the design?  The Government must set up a  body

to   ensure  security  and  measure  the  effectiveness   and

efficiency of the online services.

IT for Everyone

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are now no funds set aside to make IT education

available  to  the whole population.  Funds and  effort  have

been  concentrated on our students and rightly so.   But  the

population at large who are users of Government services must

also  not  be ignored.  The Government must not restrict  its

resources  to  just students alone if we are  to  make  IT  a

competitive  advantage  for  Singapore.   We  must  also  pay

special  attention  to  the  housewives,  the  retirees,  the

retrenched  workers and those who are not so  well  educated.

In   other  words,  we  must  bring  IT  education   to   the

heartlanders.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this to happen, the Government must intensify its

efforts  by  funding the CDCs, the CCCs and the RCs  to  help

them set up computer centres.  These centres will be able  to

offer  IT  literacy courses and bring IT to the doorsteps  of

our  residents.   This  doorstep approach  will  garner  more

support  from the housewives, the retirees, the  elderly  and

anyone  who is interested because it is in their own locality

and  within familiar settings, on home ground, so  to  speak.

Such  an approach will lower the barrier to learning and make

IT   education  easily  available  and  affordable.   To  the

sceptics, I can quote an example to illustrate that  such  an

approach can work.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, take the example of the close collaboration between

the  Fengshan CC and the Marine Parade CDC in setting up  two

Student  Care Centres fully equipped with computers and  four

computer centres attached to our preschool education centres.

These centres are

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 114</b></font><br><br>

equipped with broadband systems so as to allow for very quick

Internet  access.  Fengshan PCF kindergarten is  one  of  the

first to provide computer-aided education to all children and

not  only those whose parents can afford to pay.  Today,  all

Fengshan  pre-schoolers are taught to surf the  Internet  and

they know how to use e-mail.  The younger they are, the lower

the barrier to learning.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the real success story is the use of the

centres  to  train adults in the evenings and  the  weekends.

There  are  ongoing  computer  courses  for  the  masses   at

affordable  and  competitive  rates  for  people  within  the

constituency and of course outside.  It is available to self-help groups, such as MENDAKI, private companies sending their

staff  for  upgrading courses, and many other  organisations.

In  the  last three years alone, some 25,000 persons, and  in

the  last  two  years  more than 9,000 a year  have  attended

courses  at the IT centres in Fengshan, and these numbers  do

not  include the kindergarten children.  Also, we have opened

the  centres in the evenings in the last two years  and  some

3,000 residents actually dropped by to use the computers at a

nominal  charge.   I  can shamelessly boast  of  the  success

stories  that we hear so very often of how computer  literacy

has  helped  to improve the lives and livelihood of  so  many

computer  illiterate persons in many different and unexpected

ways.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what do Mdm Lee Ah Eng, who is in her mid-50s and

living  in Bedok North, Mdm Sahara binte Hassan, 38 years,  a

housewife  and Mr Chin Sin Chong, a retiree have  in  common?

Sir, all of them know nothing about computers, let alone  sit

in  front  of  one.   Today,  after  attending  the  computer

literacy  courses at Fengshan IT hub, they can  now  work  on

computers  with  ease that belied their  true  profession  or

training.   Mdm  Lee, the Treasurer of Fengshan  WEC,  was  a

butcher's assistant before the epidemic in pigs caused her to

lose  her  job when the Government banned the sale  of  pork.

However,  unlike her other colleagues in the same trade,  she

quickly found another job not so long

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 115</b></font><br><br>

thereafter  as  a clerical officer of a pawnshop.   Sir,  the

pawnshop owner needed someone who knows how to use a computer

to type out pawn tickets in English and Chinese.  Mdm Lee had

just  completed  the Microsoft Word and Rich Win  97  courses

offered at Fengshan IT Centre to grassroots leaders.  She  of

course clinched the job right away during the interview after

she  proved  her  proficiency on the computer,  and  this  is

despite her age and lack of experience as a clerk.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mdm Sahara is a housewife who has never touched a

typewriter,  let  alone a computer all her  life,  until  she

joined a computer course, especially designed for housewives,

and she joined the course out of curiosity.  She can now surf

the  Internet  for  new  recipes  (cooking  recipes  are  her

interest) and exchange cooking tips and culinary skills  with

friends she has met online.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is a Mr Chin who is a retiree in his 60s.

He too has no computer knowledge but after attending a course

at  Fengshan  IT  Centre,  he now  volunteers  himself  as  a

cyberguide,  as we call it, so that he can teach the  elderly

and other senior citizens how to use computers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we have proven the sceptics wrong that such an

approach cannot work and that we may be putting money in  the

wrong place.  But these are real life examples of why the use

of  IT  has  to  be  widespread and made accessible  for  the

masses,  if  we  are to see a successful use of  Government's

online services.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User-friendly online services. Sir, having trained the

people,  we must make certain that online services are  truly

user-friendly  and  effective.  I  quote  a  recent  personal

experience of how difficult the Ministry of Manpower's online

services   were.    I   went  into  the  MOM's   website   at

www.mom.gov.sg  to check whether an intended  foreign  worker

possesses a valid employment pass.  Sir, I could not  find  a

link  on this web page at all after going through several  of

the  menu items.  I finally called a toll free number  listed

on this page.  Unfortunately, the menu of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 116</b></font><br><br>

telephone services was not listed on this website.  So I  had

to  go to the menu, the sub-menus and several menu items.  At

the  end  of it all, out of frustration, I went back  to  the

main menu and got an officer on the line.  After five minutes

of  good classical music, a nice charming officer came to the

line  and  she told me that particular enquiry could  not  be

found  on this website.  And she gave me the name of  another

URL,  just to search for the bona fide of an intended foreign

worker.  Sir, I could not understand why the URL could not be

hyperlinked  to  the MOM's website in the first  place.   The

logical thing is that, if this is available at MOM, it should

be  linked  to  the  website.   MOM  should  not  claim  that

potential employers or landlords can easily go to the website

to  check on the validity of foreign worker permits when  the

information they themselves give to the public are  sometimes

skimpy and also time consuming.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, after gaining access to the second website on this

URL  given  by  the  officer, I was again  frustrated  in  my

attempts  to solicit the information I want because  my  NRIC

No.  was rejected as I did not type in the prefix "S"  before

it.   Sir,  our NRIC Nos. are unique numbers and there  is  a

computer to take care of all this.  I do not see why we  need

to  key in the prefix, whether it is "F", "P" or "S", and  if

you do not key in "S", you can never get the service.   Also,

requiring  the  foreign  worker's  identification  number  is

another  exercise  of  testing  the  limits  of  the   user's

patience.  Why must it have to be the so-called FIN  numbers,

given  by the Ministry, and not the worker's passport number,

for  example.   Sir,  perhaps, I would  like  to  invite  the

Minister  to try going online himself to test out the  system

and see for himself why much more improvements are necessary.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Inland Revenue Authority, IRAS, is encouraging

taxpayers to submit their returns online.  While it boasts of

some  successes, I am not the person who uses it, but I  have

feedback  that it could have been more simpler and easier  to

use.   For instance, taxpayers need not have to do paperwork,

or  must  have paperwork done first before they go online  to

key in all the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 117</b></font><br><br>

information  from the worksheet which they have  to  complete

beforehand.  Sir, if the system is user-friendly enough,  you

just  key  in  all  the information and the  computer  should

actually  work out the worksheet and tell you  what  is  your

tax, without having to do the worksheet beforehand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all said and done, I firmly believe that the

Government  must have some form of audit of  all  its  online

services   to   streamline  them  so  that  all   claims   of

accessibility  can be truly materialised.  If efficiency  and

effectiveness of the Government are to be upheld, a  rigorous

audit  is inevitable and mandatory to ensure that we rise  to

the  challenge  and  this is really sharpening  our  nation's

competitive edge through the use of IT.

<br><br><!-- Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Kenneth Chen Koon Lap (Hong Kah):</b> Sir, after the

Finance   Minister's  Budget  speech,  the   Prime   Minister

expressed  to a few of us in the House that he was  surprised

at  the  somewhat  muted  response  by  the  Members  present

although  the Budget, by all means, is an exceptionally  good

one,  more so against the backdrop of political and  economic

uncertainties  in  this region.  Could it  be  that  we  have

gotten so used to expecting positive budgets year after  year

that  we  take  it  for granted that a good budget  would  be

delivered at each session.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's generous budget, all Singaporeans,

whether the well-off or the not so well-off, benefited.  What

is  more significant is the much greater apportionment of the

budget being given to education, social welfare, training and

assistance  to start-up companies and local businesses.   Why

the  subdued response?  Does it mean that the population  has

grown  soft with years of good progress and prosperity?   How

does  it affect our competitiveness in the future during this

time of global uncertainty and growing regional turmoil?  Can

we  afford to be complacent?  We are fortunate that  we  have

enjoyed stability and sustained strong economic growth  at  a

time when

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 118</b></font><br><br>

some  of  our  neighbours are still fighting desperately  for

survival.  We should take this opportunity to consolidate and

strengthen  ourselves  in  order to  remain  competitive  and

innovative  and stay as one of the major economic players  in

the global arena.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in the last Parliament sitting, BG George Yeo

indicated  that  the impression that the GLCs dominated  over

Singapore businesses was erroneous.  The GLCs are responsible

for  only  12.9% of our GDP growth and the MNCs actually  are

responsible  for the major percentage, nearly 40%.   However,

that  does little to change the perception of the GLCs  being

so  dominant in the local business scene.  It may be  because

of  the  only  presence of the GLCs among all  businesses  in

Singapore that leads to this conclusion.  The fact that  GLCs

are  involved  in  almost  all  types  of  business,  be   it

manufacturing,  retail,  property, construction,  consultancy

services, transportation, communication, finance, etc,  leads

to the perception that they are in competition with all local

private businesses.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one cannot question the policy of building world-class operations that can compete in the regional arena for

the  survival  of Singapore, a nation without much  resources

and land mass.  This policy is arguably correct as one of the

most  expedient ways of building such corporations is by  the

setting  up  of GLCs because of their ability to  amass  huge

financial  as well as human resources.  The success  achieved

by  corporations, like the SIA, PSA, ST, Telecom,  NOL,  DBS,

and  many  others, that have made their mark  in  the  global

arena,  is  proof of the farsighted policy of our Government.

Very few, if any private businesses, can have the ability  or

the economic capacity to achieve what some of these companies

have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore Technologies have continuously ventured into

projects which require large economic resources and long-term

investment,  the latest being in the field of life  sciences.

JTC's   setting  up  of  wafer  fabrication  industries   and

spearheading the petrochemical industry in Jurong

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 119</b></font><br><br>

Island are among some of the shining examples.  For Singapore

to   survive   and   remain  competitive,   we   need   these

organisations  to  venture  into  new  businesses,  and   R&D

projects  can be the pioneer for others to follow.   However,

while  recognising  the GLC's role in  nation  building,  one

should  not  totally  ignore the contribution  of  the  local

entrepreneurs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy that, consistent with the policy of nurturing

local  entrepreneurs, the Government has come  up  with  many

assistance   schemes  and  incentives  to  help   the   local

businesses  to  grow.  But the Government has to  be  mindful

that  these  entrepreneurs  need  space  and  scope  and,  if

necessary, assistance from the Government to succeed.   These

businesses which are in direct competition with the GLCs  may

find  it  very  difficult to survive as the  GLCs,  with  the

strength  and  financial resources, not to mention  the  very

widespread  networking, can put them out of business  easily.

I  am  not suggesting that the GLCs should be limited in  the

scope  of their involvement or be prevented from freely going

into any type of businesses they choose.  But there should be

a certain balance to consider whether they need to spread the

business  venture so widely and freely and enter  into  areas

where  traditionally  our  medium and  small  businesses  are

trying to survive.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has always stressed that, as long as the

playing  field is level, everyone should be free to  compete.

But,  in reality, in any competition between GLCs and private

businesses, very often, the feeling of the private sector  is

that, although the field may be level, they are playing  with

nine or 10 players against 11.  There would always be a great

imbalance  in the competition.  To illustrate my point,  NTUC

Fairprice  is doing a tremendous job in operating a  business

as  a  workers'  cooperative, bringing  in  benefits  to  all

Singaporean  workers,  as  well  as  ensuring  stability   of

essential commodities.  Let us say that they suddenly  decide

to corner all retail business in the HDB heartland and put  a

supermarket in all our neighbourhood centres.  Surely our HDB

shops would never be able to survive against them because  of

their size, human as well

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 120</b></font><br><br>

as  financial resources, and eventually, all will  be  driven

out  of business.  I am sure NTUC has no intention whatsoever

of  doing  that  even  if it means that  it  can  expand  its

business and turn out a better bottomline.  Therefore, it can

be  reasonably  assumed  that any  GLC,  with  its  financial

resources and, more importantly, its networking, which  wants

to  compete  in any local businesses in Singapore,  it  would

have  no  difficulty  in overwhelming the local  competitors.

The question is:  is it desirable to jeopardise the long-term

objective  of having a strong public and private  sector  co-existing with each other as the twin engine that would  drive

the  Singapore economy?  Therefore, it would be good  if  the

GLCs  could concentrate in areas where the enhanced resources

and  expertise would maximise their potential and performance

in ways that a local private business would find difficult in

matching,  for  instance, in the international  arena  or  in

certain niche areas.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venturing into new fields and R&D projects can open new

business  opportunities for Singapore and, together with  the

input  of the local entrepreneurs, both can flourish side  by

side.  It would be a sad day if our younger generation do not

see  any  future in the private sector and their only  option

after  their  graduation is to enter the civil  service,  the

GLCs  or  the multinationals.  I am sure this is not what  is

best  for  Singapore and not what the Government's policy  is

aiming for.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I cannot help feeling that there still exists this

perception  of a great divide between the private and  public

sectors.  This is not healthy, nor is it desirable.  I  would

like  to  continue seeing all Singaporeans, be  they  in  the

public  or private sector, working together for the  good  of

the  nation.   All  Singaporeans  should  have  a  sense   of

belonging and the opportunity to excel in whatever field  and

whichever sector they feel most comfortable in.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Sin Boon Ann -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sin Boon Ann (Tampines):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you

for allowing me

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 121</b></font><br><br>

the opportunity to participate in this debate, and I rise  in

support  of  the  Budget  for financial  year  2001  and  the

financial policy that underpins it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Minister has pointed out that the Budget debate

is a time when we take stock of the economy and the direction

that we have taken.  The debate is also a time for us to take

new  bearings for Singapore.  What kind of society do we want

to  create for Singapore and what are the values that we want

to  promote?   As  we  move into the new millennium,  we  are

cognizant that Singapore is caught up in a transition as  the

economy adapts to the changes of the global economy where, as

the  Minister  has  put it, the main drivers  of  growth  are

knowledge and talent.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes are not always welcome. This is often the case

with  those  who  are not able to cope.  For the  middle-aged

workers  who are caught in the middle, economic restructuring

and realignment would mean potential job displacement and  an

uncertain  future.   For  the small and  medium  enterprises,

their  inability to cope with competition brought  on  by  an

increase in the number and presence of the bigger players  in

the industry, means declining business and a bleak outlook.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we need look no further than to consider the

present   plight   of  some  of  the   shops   in   the   HDB

neighbourhoods.  We have been assured by the  Minister  that,

in  the  new  millennium,  there is  a  place  for  everyone.

Invariably,  the  question to some, if not  many,  has  been:

what  does it mean for them?  Can we assure them that in  the

midst  of  this uncertainty brought on by the global economic

changes,  the  dawn  of the future would bring  about  better

times  for  them,  while those who have run  on  ahead  would

continue  to blaze the trail for those who are struggling  to

follow?  We are faced with the basic question that the budget

provides the opportune time for us to ask:  how can we ensure

that  the  future of Singapore would always have a place  for

every Singaporean, young and old, rich and poor?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 122</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we know that, at its most basic level,

globalisation means, to many of us, liberalisation  of  trade

and  greater  competition for businesses and resources.   Our

response is equally clear.  We must ride with the tide or  be

washed  away by the currents of change.  This is  evident  in

the way we sought to liberalise our economy to facilitate the

free  movement  of  labour  and  capital.   Our  economy   is

relatively  open  to investments.  Sir, there  are  very  few

impediments to foreigners investing in Singapore, other  than

those   relating  to  business  viability.   We  have  openly

encouraged  talented  foreigners to take  up  employment  and

residence  here  in  Singapore, and in the  hope  that  their

skills and talents will help add to the talent pool here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, globalisation is very much driven by the

economics of pragmatism.  Our policies largely ebb and  flow,

according to the tide of dollars and cents.  In other  words,

we  allow  cost  effectiveness  to  dictate  and  decide  our

policies.   It  must be.  Competition in the  global  economy

requires  us  to  ensure high profitability through  constant

shifts  in  business operations, on the basis  of  costs  and

profitability  margins.  Where foreign labour is  cheaper  to

hire  than  local  ones, we hire foreign labour.   Where  the

industries no longer yield the necessary value-add to  ensure

high  economic growth, we abandon them.  Just look around  us

today.    Textile   factories  are  almost  non-existent   in

Singapore,  and  I do not suppose there are  many  electrical

appliance  assembly operations remaining.   Similarly,  there

are not many canning factories left here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the labour front, the importation of skilled

construction labour, at a fraction of what it would have cost

to  hire  the  equivalent  of  local  workers,  has  but  all

displaced  our  own  people with similar skill  sets.   Soon,

there  will be very few Singaporeans left who are capable  of

doing  masonry  work, or carpenters who  can  undertake  form

construction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intense market competition, brought on by our

relentless pursuit of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 123</b></font><br><br>

economic  efficiency, has left a mark on our population.   It

is  not  by accident that we have acquired the dubious honour

of  being one of the most kiasu societies.  We became a kiasu

society only because our competitive spirit permeates to  all

levels of society, practically from cradle to grave.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I do not deny the benefits of an open economy

driven  by  competition.  The benefits of that ideology  are,

with the collapse of communism, without doubt.  However, what

is the cost to society?  What is the cost to Singaporeans?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At one level, there is the social cost. By allowing a

free  flow  of talent, we tend to displace Singaporeans  from

the  employment that they would otherwise have  enjoyed,  but

for   the   redundancy  made  possible  by   cheaper   labour

alternatives.  In the scheme of things, those who are middle-aged  and with limited education, are most at risk to  having

their  employment  services  terminated  prematurely.    Such

premature  termination of employment would  invariably  cause

some dislocation to their family, especially when a displaced

employee  has a wife and children to support.  Unfortunately,

it would be the children who suffer.  What this would mean is

that there would invariably be cutbacks on tuition, music and

other  enrichment  classes  and holidays,  perhaps  overseas.

This may, in turn, affect their development in every sense of

the word, and affect the future of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, when we speak of unemployment, it is not just the

employee  who is affected, but a whole chain of  people  down

the  line  as  well.   So,  when we speak  of  helping  these

employers to make adjustments to the new economy, we must  be

mindful of the urgency that is required to act on this matter

since  there are other lives involved as well.  That  is  one

possible cost.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At another level, we have the economic cost. Labour

tends  always to gravitate towards sources of high wages  and

opportunities  for  social advancement.  As  we  become  more

globalised,  we realise that the labour of our people  cannot

be

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 124</b></font><br><br>

contained   in   our   territorial  boundaries   alone.    As

opportunities exist elsewhere, our people would  be  under  a

strong temptation to seek out these opportunities there.   In

this  free  society, there is little we can do to stop  them.

What this means is that while our people get displaced at the

bottom  because  of  the  inability to  compete  with  others

elsewhere,  there are others at the top who are  prepared  to

seek  their fortunes outside of Singapore.  Their skill  sets

and  talents  are  such that they would not  have  a  problem

getting  employment in the financial centres of New  York  or

London,  or  in  the  information technology  houses  in  the

Silicon   Valley  or  teaching  positions  in   Ivy   Leagues

universities in the US.  There is, therefore, this  potential

for hollowing out of precious limited talents that we have in

Singapore,  which we will have to replace,  either  from  the

younger members of our population or from other parts of  the

world.   Indeed, as our forebears had done in the past,  they

had  migrated  from  China and India, so, too,  unless  their

roots   are   deeply  planted  in  Singapore,   our   younger

Singaporeans  may  likewise follow suit, except,  this  time,

they will be moving out of Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we hire people from outside of Singapore, in part to

fill  in  the shoes of Singaporeans who should be  taking  up

this  employment.  The net result in substitution is that  we

do  not have a steady base of locally qualified employees who

are  committed to this country.  In other words,  we  end  up

with  foreigners providing the talents for some  of  the  key

services in our economy and not just the manual labour.  Sir,

this  is  fine  as  long as we are able to  sustain  economic

growth and provide the base of political stability.  However,

if future conditions prove unstable, we cannot count on these

people to remain behind for us.  If this comes to pass,  Sir,

I think we will have a problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, Sir, we are partly to blame for this state of

affairs.   For  want of a better description,  the  basis  on

which  we  govern  our relationship tends to be  contractual,

even if the basis of the relationship is understandable.   We

contract with students to send them overseas for a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 125</b></font><br><br>

good  education in exchange for the promise of  service  when

they  graduate.   If they do not perform their  side  of  the

bargain,  we  claim damages and we shame them  publicly.   We

hire good people for the upper end of the public service.  We

try  them for a few years and, if they do not succeed or they

are  not  suitable, I believe we will tell them to  look  for

their careers elsewhere.  So relationship with our people  is

often  kept strictly to contract and are, therefore, economic

in nature.  Sir, as with any economic relationship, one tends

to  be calculating.  For the young bright Singaporean looking

at the future ahead of him and where the world is his oyster,

he will soon wise up and ask himself, "What is in it for me?"

He will obviously be doing his sums and decide what is in his

best  economic  interest.  Can we count on  him  to  put  the

national consideration before himself?  I would like to, Sir,

but I doubt it.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By defining success purely in material terms, we have

inadvertently raised one generation of young Singaporeans who

are  dedicated to the god of conspicuous consumption.  Driven

by  a  deep-seated  materialism, many of our  best  and  most

capable  will  continue to leave our  shores  to  seek  their

fortunes  elsewhere.  This will have the effect of  depleting

our talent pool even further.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is, therefore, not just a problem of workers

continually  learning  new  skills  and  working  in  a   new

environment that we have to grapple with.  It is, I submit, a

deeper  set of problems derived from globalisation, how  this

will  affect  our workers, their families, the likely  impact

that this will have on the future of Singaporeans and on  the

limited talent pool that we have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is also the issue of the political cost

that  we  are  faced with.  Sir, there is evidence  that  the

income  gap between the top income earners and those  at  the

bottom  has widened in Singapore.  That this is so is  not  a

surprise.  Globalisation has brought about greater

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 126</b></font><br><br>

competition  for people and talent across boundaries.   Where

talent  is in short supply, market forces have dictated  that

premium salaries would go to them.  On the one hand, the same

cannot  be said of unskilled labour.  An unskilled worker  in

Singapore,  working  in a low-technology  assembly  operation

here,  will find it difficult to compete with his counterpart

in China or in India.  On the other hand, a highly skilled IT

professional,  who is Singaporean, will be in demand  by  the

MNC who is prepared to pay top dollars for his services.  The

result, unfortunately, has been a widening of the income  gap

between  the  two.   Yet simple economics tells  us  that  we

cannot  artificially prop up wages for those from the working

class  in  order to narrow the gap, unless we want  to  price

ourselves out of competition.  Against the backdrop of rising

prices  and the cost of living, the growing income  disparity

will,  no  doubt, add to the growth of discontentment  within

our  society.   We will, no doubt, begin to see  the  age-old

conflict between the haves and the have-nots rearing its ugly

head again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statement by the Government, that our workers must

go  for  training and retraining in order to  increase  their

productivity  and  wages,  has  almost  become  a  motherhood

statement  in Singapore.  The deeper issue is:   how  can  we

ensure  that,  with training, our workers can be  assured  of

better  paying  jobs  and  a more  secure  future?   Can  the

inherent   discrimination  against  older   retrenched,   but

trained, workers seeking re-employment be overcome?  Has  the

Government looked into and dealt with this issue?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if we accept the foregoing arguments, then it

follows  that our financial policy should also be  skewed  to

address  these  problems  raised.  For  instance,  would  the

Government  consider the possibility of giving some  form  of

tax  rebates  to  companies which  employ  older  workers  or

retrenched   workers?   Additionally,  should   special   tax

concessions   be  considered  to  attract  highly   qualified

Singaporeans  to  return to Singapore to  contribute  to  the

growth of our country?

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 127</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In making this submission, Sir, I know that the answers

may  not  always be there readily for us.  However,  as  they

say,  the journey of a thousand miles always begins with  the

first step.  I hope the Government will take that first step.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chew Heng Ching -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chew Heng Ching (East Coast):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

rise to support the FY 2001 Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like, firstly, to commend the Minister for what

has  been  described  by  many as  the  "best  ever"  Budget.

Indeed,  whilst  providing something  for  all  Singaporeans,

businesses, SMEs, individuals and families, this  Budget  has

struck  a  fine  balance.  It sets the fiscal  tone  for  the

future   economic  development  of  Singapore,  as  well   as

addresses  some  pressing concerns in  our  current  economic

environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First and foremost, I am greatly encouraged by the

emphasis that the Minister has placed on the smaller  members

of  society.  The tax cuts for individuals, for instance, are

not   the  flat-rate  type  cuts  that  provide  the  biggest

windfalls  to  the rich, but were structured to  benefit  the

lower and middle-income taxpayers most; whilst, the corporate

tax  relief  is structured to benefit, in greater proportion,

small  businesses which have felt the heat from globalisation

and greater competition most.

I  am  particularly heartened by the fact that  non-taxpayers

also  share  in  the surplus built up by the Government  last

year.   For example, the $333 million rebates on HDB  service

and  conservancy charges, as well as savings in  rentals  and

utilities  in  addition to CPF top-ups, are not only  timely,

but  crucial  to  maintain the social fabric that  keeps  and

binds our nation together.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would also like to stress that it is equally

important that the right incentive structures are in place in

Singapore  to  enable the right environment  for  creativity,

risk   taking  and  entrepreneurship,  without   creating   a

dependency effect for the less successful members of  society

on the better-off.  The welfare methods

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 128</b></font><br><br>

that  were a hallmark of many European societies of the  past

and  the  fiscal  drain on big governments by many  state-run

programmes clearly drained resources and dis-incentivised the

able to produce more, is certainly not the route for us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, the reduction of personal and corporate taxes is

significant in that it sends the right signal to Singaporeans

and  foreigners alike who may be further encouraged  to  make

Singapore  their  home.  Ultimately, it is not  increases  in

Government spending per se that should be the support for any

economy,  rather the creation of the right long term  regimes

to  align  incentives for individuals and companies  to  take

greater risks and produce more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whilst I applaud the Minister for delivering a good

Budget,  I have a few questions to raise.  The first question

reflects  the  concerns  many  Singaporeans  have  over   the

worsening  state of the world economy today.   In  the  short

term, it does look like the flu that the US economy seems  to

be  suffering  from has already affected some of  our  global

companies,  particularly those in the  electronics  industry.

Singapore  has managed to accumulate surpluses  in  years  of

plenty,  running budget surpluses even whilst the  Government

had  embarked  on an expansionary fiscal policy to  stimulate

the  economy  in the last two financial years.  However,  now

that  we  are reducing direct tax rates, will this limit  the

ability  or  desire  of the Government to provide  more  off-budget  measures  to  stimulate the economy  in  the  future?

Should  the  flu  that  the  US  economy  has  caught  become

prolonged, spreading rapidly here, we may have to do more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, the best economists and analysts were all

caught off guard in December 2000 when the US economy started

to  cool and it was only recently that institutions like  the

G7 and IMF have started revising downwards the world economic

growth with the potential for more shocks to come.  There  is

perhaps a

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 129</b></font><br><br>

need  for Singaporeans to understand and be assured that  the

Government  stands ready should the 5-7 % GDP growth  targets

that MTI has set for this year not materialise.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, it was only 2-3 weeks ago that the Turkish

Lira was devalued, and ominously, just like Thailand in 1997,

the  consensus expectation is that there will be no contagion

effect,  even though Eastern Europe has started to  feel  the

chill  already.    A  lower tax burden, as the  Minister  has

rightly pointed out, will help businesses and individuals  to

some  degree.  However, it does not go very far  if  revenues

are  falling or jobs are lost.  Potentially, a revisit of the

global crisis in 1998 could arise, except that this time, the

US,  which has almost single-handedly consumed the world  out

from the recession then, takes the lead downwards.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask the Minister if the

Government  does stand ready to do more for  the  economy  if

indeed  the  US  and the global economy slips into  recession

this  year.   Has  the  Government  a  contingency  plan   or

supplementary budget ready?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second question that I have concerns GST. We

understand that when the GST policy was introduced some years

ago,  the  longer  term stated goal of the Government  is  to

strike a balance between direct and indirect taxes.  There is

a  concern now that with the reduction in direct personal and

corporate  taxes, the Government may increase indirect  taxes

through GST.  Could the Minister therefore elaborate on  what

the  plans  are for GST, and if and when should  Singaporeans

expect  further  increases in GST, and  will  it  be  met  by

equally  significant reductions in personal income  taxes  in

future?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third question concerns the allocation of the "share

outs" from the budget surplus.  It has been widely publicised

that  escalating  health care cost is  one  of  the  greatest

pressing  concerns  of  working adults,  and  especially  for

senior citizens

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 130</b></font><br><br>

without a stable income.  The $10 rise in Singapore Allowance

for  pensioners, for example, will not go very  far  to  help

meet many co-payment schemes by health care providers.  Would

it  therefore not be more appropriate to consider  allocating

the  CPF  top-up,  not to the Ordinary account,  but  to  the

Medisave  account and to re-balance the planned  contribution

from the surplus to the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund  and

the  Medical Endowment Fund in order to address the  pressing

need  for the aged in meeting their medical expenses  in  the

future?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, on a more specific matter, in view of the

recognition  of the need for Singaporeans to be part  of  the

KBE  and to embark on lifelong learning, would it not be more

appropriate  to  review the current cap  on  tax  relief  for

education  course  fees, currently set at  $2,500  per  year?

Sir,  I believe this level has not caught pace with the rapid

rise  in  costs  of  tertiary and professional  education  in

recent  years  and  is incongruous to the emphasis  that  the

Government  has placed to encourage Singaporeans  to  upgrade

their skills and education.  I therefore urge the Minister to

consider   revising  upwards  this  quantum,   to   encourage

Singaporeans to upgrade their skills and education  in  order

to keep pace with global economic demands.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I would like to reiterate and elaborate on

the  feelings  on the ground and on the part of  many  of  my

constituents.   Whilst  MTI  and  the  Government  have  been

optimistic   of  Singapore's  continued  growth  this   year,

following the rapid recovery in our economy in the  last  two

financial  years, there is considerable concern amongst  many

citizens  that the benefits of recovery have not  been  fully

felt   across   the  board.   Many  small  businesses,   like

retailers,  HDB shopkeepers, market stallholders,  etc,  have

not  seen  a  discernible increase in business  activity  and

whilst we have not suffered the fate of Hong Kong and the  UK

in  the  early 1990s, where many households actually suffered

from negative equity in their household mortgages, there  has

certainly been some contraction in our asset prices.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 131</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst many of these developments are symptomatic of the

underlying changes in the structure of the economy, part  and

parcel  of  market  adjustment and  globalisation,  they  all

contribute  to  the  lack of confidence,  and  perception  of

uncertainty in the times ahead.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to commend the Minister for

addressing  some of these concerns in this Budget  which  has

certainly  underlined  the commitment of  the  Government  to

bridge the gap and to give more support to the have-nots  and

the  less well-off in the form of incentives to help them  to

do  better  and, at the same time, encourage the able  to  do

more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, many of the measures that the Minister has

presented  in  this Budget will certainly go  to  help  those

segments  of our society that most require it, ie, the  lower

and  the  middle wage incomes, the small businesses  and  the

fledging  technopreneur sector. With more disposable  income,

hopefully,   it   would  stimulate  spending   and   business

activities and perhaps enhance job creation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to end by quoting a saying from the

late John F. Kennedy, "if a free society cannot help the many

who  are  poor, it cannot save the few who are  rich".   This

Budget  has  sent  the  message  to  our  citizens  that  the

Government has a heart for its people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hawazi Daipi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hawazi Daipi (Sembawang):</b> Sir, this year's Budget is

characterised  by  a strong sense of investor  confidence  in

Singapore,  which  has  been contributed,  to  a  very  large

extent,  by  the discipline and sacrifice of our workers  and

our  good  governance.   I am glad that  the  Government  has

decided  to reward our workers for their sacrifices and  help

employers  to  enhance  their  competitiveness  through  this

year's  Budget.   Perhaps, because  of  the  good  spread  of

goodies  this  year,  the  press  was  almost  unanimous   in

describing it as "a generous Budget for everyone".   I  think

they  are  right.  But I would call it a "Budget  for  Social

Cohesion"  for the focus it gives, not just to the short-term

reward for the sacrifices and in helping the lower-income

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 132</b></font><br><br>

Singaporeans through the rebates, but also in addressing  the

long-term need to help Singaporeans, particularly the  lower-skilled   workers,  enhance  their  welfare  through   skills

upgrading  as  our  economy picks up pace  in  restructuring.

With better skills, our workers will be able to enhance their

employability and earn higher wages.  Helping our workers  to

be employable is a very important welfare assistance to them,

irrespective  of their income status.  These twin  approaches

will  go  a  long  way  to addressing  the  issue  of  income

disparities which could affect our social cohesion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our workers, as reflected by the views of our union

leaders, applaud the Budget. One union leader has called it a

"pro-all  Budget" for the various rebates given away  on  the

service  and conservancy charges, utilities and HDB  rentals.

These  will benefit the lower-income workers who are  already

not  paying  income tax.  Also welcome are  the  lowering  of

personal  income tax rates by 2 to 5 percentage  points,  the

doubling of personal tax rebate to 10% and higher tax  breaks

on  CPF contributions from the self-employed.  Another  union

leader feels that all these measures show that the Government

cares.   I would add that the Government has kept faith  with

the  people's  trust in the consultative approach  among  the

workers, employers and the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These personal goodies are very important but what is

equally  significant is Dr Richard Hu's announcement  of  the

Government's plan to allocate more resources to education and

to  facilitate lifelong learning among our workers.  This, as

I  said  earlier,  is  important to help our  workers  remain

relevant in the New Economy.  We learnt that last year,  many

of  the  manufacturing investment commitments of $9.2 billion

were    in    key    knowledge-intensive   industries    like

pharmaceuticals  and high-end electronics - areas  that  will

help Singapore's future growth.  We can expect the proportion

of  jobs that require higher skills will be larger year after

year.   Even  though retrenchments fell to 11,500  last  year

compared  to 14,600 in 1999, we can expect the proportion  of

retrenchments due to structural reasons would  be  higher  in

future.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 133</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is because of this that our union leaders

applaud  the plan to beef up the Lifelong Learning  Endowment

Fund by another half a billion dollars to $1 billion.  So  is

the  allocation  of the $30 million for Manpower  Development

Assistance  Scheme, on top of the $6.3 billion  allocated  to

education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I join our workers in welcoming this Budget in its

aim  to helping our workers, especially the lower-income  and

low-skilled  who  missed out on education  in  their  younger

days,  in  making  the  transition  to  the  New  Economy  by

facilitating  the  learning  of new  skills.  By  emphasising

skills upgrading and retraining, the Government has shown its

commitment to the long-term welfare of our workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, this is a very important commitment to the

welfare  of  Singaporeans.  If we do not provide and  improve

the  facilities and resources for programmes to enhance their

employability, especially for the lower-income  workers,  the

State  will have to provide a more direct welfare scheme  for

them in the future.  Our population and workforce are greying

and   our  people  live  longer.   If  they  are  to   remain

independent, they need to be employed.  And they  can  secure

employment  only  if they can contribute to companies.   Sir,

therefore, we have to help them to gain new skills to  remain

relevant.  The social welfare scheme of the West is costly to

the  society.  In fact, many Western countries are  modifying

their  schemes.  We should not take the path that others  are

already  discarding. That is why I support strongly the  move

to  beef  up  the  newly set-up  Lifelong Learning  Endowment

Fund.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, let me conclude by making a general comment on the

corporate  tax  rate.   I  am  glad  that  the  Minister  has

announced a further cut of 1% point so that our corporate tax

rate  stands  at 24.5%.  Last year, Dr Hu cut it  by  half  a

percentage  point.   These measures, I am  sure,  could  help

companies to be more attracted to remain in Singapore or to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 134</b></font><br><br>

come to invest here.  But competition for investments and for

jobs  is  not  static.   We should watch our  competitiveness

level all the time because many countries could catch up with

us.  Already Chile, Hong Kong, Hungary and Ireland, to name a

few,  have lower corporate tax rates than our 24.5%.  At  the

same time, although many countries have higher corporate  tax

rates  than ours, their effective rates may be comparable  to

ours  as  they have their own systems of rebates.  Therefore,

Sir, looking at these in the package, we have to sharpen  our

competitiveness  edge  in  areas other  than  through  fiscal

measures only.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this in the background, I would support this Budget

which  I  would  describe as pro-workers,  pro-people  and  a

Budget for social cohesion.

<br><br><!-- Encik Ibrahim Bin Othman -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encik Ibrahim Bin Othman (Bishan-Toa Payoh)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Budget for this year can be said to be a

generous Budget.  With a budget surplus of $4.3 billion,  the

Government is able to distribute some of it to the people, to

assist those in the lower and middle income group.  With  the

personal income tax reduction, it will also reduce the burden

of  the  taxpayers to meet the rising cost  of  living.   The

budget  surplus of $4.8 billion in 1999 and $3.54 billion  in

the  year 2000  shows that we are able to manage our  economy

well.   It  also shows the effectiveness of our  measures  to

bring  about  economic  growth.   With  the  cooperation  and

efforts  made  by all parties, the Government, employers  and

workers,  our  economy has grown by 9.9% last  year.   It  is

timely  that the Government should share the success  of  our

economy with the people through rebates and tax cuts for  the

people.   In fact, we can say that every level of the  people

and  all  sectors of the economy are getting the goodies  and

incentives mentioned by the Minister for Finance.  The people

would  like  to  thank  the Minister  for  Finance  for  this

generous Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the Budget this year has been described by

our businessmen as pro-business.  The reduction of 1% to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 135</b></font><br><br>

24.5%  for  corporate tax for Year of Assessment 2002  is  to

maintain our competitiveness.  It will also reduce the burden

of  tax by the companies.  What is most interesting to me  is

the  exemption of the income tax of 75% for the first $10,000

of  income and 50% tax reduction for the next $90,000.   This

step will benefit the small and medium enterprises.  However,

businessmen are still expecting that the business cost can be

further  reduced to assist those who are facing slow economic

growth  this  year.   It is true that  businessmen  will  pay

reduced  tax to maintain their competitiveness.  But what  is

of   concern   to  them  is  the  business  cost,   such   as

transportation, payment of levies to the Government, workers'

wages  and rentals.  Therefore, the Government should  assist

by  ensuring  that  these  costs of business  will  not  rise

rapidly.   It is no point to have all the tax cuts  when  our

companies cannot make profits.  I hope the Minister will give

an  assurance that the Government will take steps to  control

business  costs.  And I hope that with these measures  taken,

we  will be able to attract more investments and  help start-up companies to expand here.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the general public, especially those who

live  in  HDB  1-  to  3-room flats  welcome  the  rebate  on

utilities and service and conservancy charges.  These rebates

will  assist them to settle their monthly bills.   I  welcome

this  measure.  But I hope we should also consider other ways

which are more effective to assist the lower income group  in

facing  rising  cost of living.  Maybe we  can  give  them  a

monthly  grant to upgrade their skills, so that they will  be

able  to  secure  a better job  in future and maintain  their

families.   I  worry  that  the  rebates  which  I  treat  as

consumption  may make them feel complacent and  may  lead  to

wastage.  If a skills upgrading grant is given, I think  this

is in a way a long- term investment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, the crux of this Budget is to prepare the

people  to meet the growth in the new era.  Singapore has  to

compete with developed countries in the world market.  In the

knowledge-based economy (KBE) era, education, training and re-training should be emphasised all the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 136</b></font><br><br>

time.   Therefore, the allocation for FY2001 of $6.3  billion

to  the  Ministry of Education is right.  This is the  second

biggest  allocation.  This is to equip our students with  the

new  economy skills.  The contribution of $500 million to the

Lifelong  Learning Endowment Fund is also for such a purpose.

We  are  urging the people to upgrade themselves with  skills

and knowledge throughout their life to meet the challenges of

the  KBE  era.  I fully support the Government's emphasis  on

education.   The upgrading of our people is the only  way  to

improve  our  economy.    Therefore, we  should  nurture  the

attitude  of lifelong learning among our people.   We  should

emphasise  among them that education is a continuing  process

from  cradle to grave.  With lifelong learning, every  person

will be able to follow the development, especially in science

and technology, and they will not be left behind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I also notice that out of $6.3 billion

allotted  for education, $1.4 billion is for the  development

estimates.   This  amount  is to  build  facilities  such  as

schools  and other institutes of education.  In view  of  the

high cost of building educational infrastructure, I think the

Fund  should be wisely spent.  What we understand now is that

many  schools  are  not  used at  night.   I  hope  that  the

Government will encourage other educational agencies  to  use

these  schools  to educate workers who do  not  have  a  high

education.   We know that many workers who are 40  years  and

above  do  not  have secondary education, up  to  'O'  level.

Therefore,  we  could use these schools  to  teach  important

subjects  like English, Mathematics and Science,  up  to  'O'

level, for these workers whom I have mentioned earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the others, they could also pursue upgrading courses

which  are  below  GCE 'O' level, ie, `N'  level.   If  these

schools  are  open  at night, the workers  who  live  in  the

housing  estates could spare some time, maybe three  times  a

week,  to  pursue such courses.  The Government  may  give  a

grant  of up to $1 billion to the Lifelong Learning Endowment

Fund,  so  that  the  people will be  able  to  attend  these

courses.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 137</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same will apply to the ITE and polytechnic buildings

which  can be used for technical upgrading courses  that  can

lift  the  educational  standards  of  our  workers  to   NTC

certificates, diploma or higher.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schools and educational institutions are run based

on  meritocracy and multi-racialism.  Students compete  among

themselves to achieve the best in education.  The process  of

multi-racial  nation  building  is  also  being  carried  out

actively among the young.  They interact comfortably  in  the

classrooms  and  other co-curricular activities  in  schools.

Although  there  are situations of grouping of  the  majority

race in a few special schools meant for specific purposes, on

the  whole,  our  schools  reflect  the  multi-racialism   of

education  in Singapore.  This process enables us to  educate

our  young  with  good values such as the concept  of  multi-racialism  to guarantee the stability of our society  in  the

future.   We  can  say that the process of integration  in  a

multi-racial society has been going on well in our schools.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In respect of integration, I hope this integration

process  will be carried out smoothly in our housing  estates

and  the  work  places or in the SAF.  We  hope  one  day  no

question will be raised regarding the issue of loyalty or the

contribution of one community towards our sovereign country.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, if we had followed the development in

Singapore, the issue of loyalty and the participation of  the

Malay  community  in  SAF has become  a  topic  for  dialogue

between  the  Senior Minister and the Malay/Muslim  community

leaders.   A few young Ministers also attended.  I feel  that

this  dialogue is very effective.  It went on with  maturity,

clarity  and honesty.  In this dialogue, the Malay  community

has been urged to immediately participate in this integration

process.   In  my view, this has already happened  where  the

majority  of  the Malay community have already been  together

with  the other communities in their daily lives, whether  in

the housing estates, in their workplaces, in schools

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 138</b></font><br><br>

and also at public places.  Therefore, the issue of the Malay

community  wanting  to  isolate  themselves  from  the  other

communities  should not arise.  What has emerged  now  is  in

respect  of  the  identity of the Malays  who  are  Islam  by

religion, especially the attire of covering the aurat,  halal

food,  payment  of  zakat,  and  performing  their  religious

obligations  like  the Haj.  The Singapore  community  should

understand that these aspects are obligations which  have  to

be  performed  by  the Malay/Muslim community.   They  should

understand   this  much  earlier  to  bring  about   a   more

understanding and cohesive community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, I support the policies of the

Finance Minister in his Budget speech, but I hope more  funds

will be given to improve or step up the cohesion of our multi-racial community.

<div align="center"><b>ANNUAL BUDGET STATEMENT</b></div>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.

<br><br><!-- Dr Ker Sin Tze -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Ker Sin Tze (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the Budget presented by the Finance Minister this  year

is  undoubtedly a widely welcomed Budget.  The main focus  of

this Budget is on the cuts or exemptions on corporate and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 139</b></font><br><br>

personal income tax and property tax.  Tax cuts and exemption

are  means in the use of fiscal policy to stimulate  economic

expansion.  In the next one or two years, we will  be  facing

economic uncertainty.  This move will positively support  our

economic  activities so that our economy will not  turn  from

substantive growth to recession.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the middle and higher income people, reduction of

personal  income tax rates is like "adding a  flower  to  the

brocade".  Their incomes are already in the middle  and  high

brackets.  Now, with this tax cut, they will have  even  more

after-tax disposable income.  To the lower income people, the

tax  cut  is  of  not much help.  Some may  even  receive  no

benefit  at  all.   The lower income people  are  faced  with

escalating  cost of living such as the rising utility  rates,

high medical cost, increasing education cost, etc.  We should

also  think of a hardship-relieving way to approach the issue

like  "sending  burning charcoal in a  snowy  weather".    Of

course,  the  $250  to  $350 utilities rebate,  exemption  or

reduction  in the payment of service and conservancy  charges

and  HDB rents is a form of help.  But this is trying to "put

out a big fire on a cart-load of firewood with a small cup of

water".   It could at most wet your throat but hardly  enough

to  quench your thirst.  Compared to the benefits enjoyed  by

the  middle and higher income people, these benefits  to  the

lower income people are just pittance.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reduction of corporate tax rate from 25.5% to 24.5%

will  attract  more  foreign investments  to  Singapore.   In

addition,  the  small companies with a profit  of  less  than

$10,000  enjoy tax relief on 75% of their chargeable  income,

and 50% of the subsequent $90,000.  This will help the start-up  companies  to have more capital for further  development.

These  are  conducive  to Singapore's  strive  to  become  an

investment,  commercial  and trading  centre,  enhancing  our

competitiveness  in attracting foreign investments.  However,

to  those small businesses which are slumped into predicament

because  of  the regional economies and economic restructure,

the  cut in corporate tax does not benefit them nor help them

to solve

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 140</b></font><br><br>

their  problems at all.   Many SMEs have no business  or  are

finding it difficult to operate their business.  Many of them

are  running  their business at a loss.  If the companies  do

not  make  any profit, income tax cut or exemption is  simply

irrelevant to them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the struggling businesses are the retailers in

the HDB estates. Because of their outdated mode of operation,

they  are  unable to attract the younger consumers. Moreover,

with the modern shopping complexes luring away the customers,

these  poor  neighbourhood  shops  have  been  keeping  their

business  going by painstaking efforts without much  success.

To  these  retailers in the HDB estates, this  year's  Budget

does  not  bring any benefit.  The benefit of  tax  reduction

does  not apply to them. There is no reduction in their rent.

For those who have bought over the shop premises, the monthly

instalment  remains a heavy burden.  There  is  no  utilities

subsidy for them.  But, fortunately, the Minister for Finance

has   already  announced  that  the  Minister  for   National

Development will introduce a series of measures to help  them

to tide over the difficult period.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a matter of fact, hardship cases are not confined to

the  retailers in HDB estates. Even the many shops in  modern

shopping complexes are having a hard time, with high rentals,

high  overhead expenses and low sales volume.   Although  the

retail sector is said to have picked up last year, many small

and  middle  retailers are moaning and groaning.  Apart  from

retailers, many other sectors are similarly affected by  poor

business.   Property sector aside,  the related sectors  such

as  the  renovation  contractors and the general  traditional

industries are also facing the problem of very poor business.

In   fact,  apart  from  electronics  and  telecommunications

sectors,  all the other sectors are not doing well.  Business

may  be  poor but the cost of doing business remains  on  the

high  side with no sign of going down.   Electricity  tariffs

are  rising all the time.  CPF contribution rates  have  been

adjusted  up  by  4%.   Petrol  prices  have  also  shot  up.

Although in this year's Budget, property tax will be  reduced

from 12% to 10% in

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 141</b></font><br><br>

July  this  year, the property tax rebate which  was  granted

earlier would be revoked.  As a result, property tax  has  in

fact  increased  from 9% to 10%.  It would appear  that  this

year's  Budget does not help to reduce the operating cost  of

those businesses which are not doing well, nor does it assist

in  solving their problem.  If we want to effectively  assist

them,  I  think  the  Minister for  Finance  should  consider

lowering  all  the  charges relating to  the  industrial  and

commercial  sectors,  for example,  property  tax  should  be

reduced to 9%, and there should be some form of restraint  on

the raising of utilities tariffs.  The Government should also

exempt  or lower the various charges levied on the small  and

middle enterprises.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Finance has used the tax-cutting

measures to stimulate our economy and to bring about economic

expansion and growth.  This is a timely measure.  However, if

the  fiscal  policies can be coordinated  with  the  monetary

policies,  the effect will surely be better.  At the  moment,

there are signs of the US economy declining.  President  Bush

has  already  announced  tax cuts and  Mr  Greenspan  of  the

Federal  Reserves Bureau has also taken steps  to  lower  the

interest rates.  Such coordination between the fiscal  policy

and the monetary policy will surely achieve better results in

supporting the US economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this year's Budget, I do not see any sign of the

monetary  policies  being deployed.  In the  next  couple  of

years,  if the regional economies do not recover and  the  US

economy heads for a decline, Singapore's situation may not be

too  optimistic.  Lowering  of interest  rates  to  encourage

investments and stimulate consumption can be very  useful  in

sustaining  the economic growth.  Although it  is  said  that

interest  rates  are  determined  by  the  commercial   banks

according  to market situation, the Minister for Finance  can

make  some adjustments to the discount rates and bank capital

reserve ratio through the Monetary Authority of Singapore, to

avail the banks of more liquidity and cause the whole

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 142</b></font><br><br>

interest  rate  structure to be adjusted  downwards,  thereby

lowering  the  cost  of  borrowing  of  the  individuals  and

corporations.   On  the one hand, it will stimulate  personal

consumption,  and  on  the  other  hand,  it  can  lower  the

operational   cost  of  businesses.   In   this   way,   both

consumption and investment can flourish, and economic  growth

can be sustained.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget can be said to be a Budget which

"adds  a flower to the brocade". The higher your income,  the

greater  tax reduction benefits you will enjoy.  I hope  that

it  would  simultaneously be a Budget  which  "sends  burning

charcoal  in a snowy weather".  Reduce or exempt  levies  and

the  various charges, lower  the cost of borrowing,  and  cut

down  business  cost  to help the suffering  businesses  pull

through these difficult times.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion standing in the

name of the Minister for Finance.

<br><br><!-- Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Assoc. Prof. Low Seow Chay (Chua Chu Kang):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir, year 2001 to 2002 budget is a generous one.  First, huge

funds  were given away in the form of year 2001 tax  rebates,

utilities, rentals and SC&CC charges rebates, CPF top-up  and

the  Government's  contributions  to  the  various  endowment

funds.   All  this  will  cost  the  Government  billions  of

dollars.   This could only be possible because  the  previous

year's  budget  had  a surplus of $4.4  billion  due  to  the

exceptionally and unexpectedly good economic growth that  led

to  $6.5  billion in additional tax revenue, as  reported  by

Parliament's  Estimates Committee.   We  have  to  thank  the

Government for its generosity in sharing the surplus and  the

fruits  of  economic success with the people.  On  the  other

hand, it is also what the people deserve for their sacrifices

and  contributions  in turning the economy  around  from  the

Asian  economic  crisis.   It has  also  established  a  good

precedence by sharing the budgetary surplus with the  people.

I  hope the Finance Minister will adopt sharing the budgetary

surplus  with  the  people as a standard feature  for  future

budgets.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 143</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the new tax scheme for personal income tax for

Year  of  Assessment 2002 offers as much as 30% tax reduction

for an annual earned income less than $35,000 and a saving of

25%  for  an annual earned income of $50,000.  For  the  high

income  earners,  they will pay 22% less.  The  huge  cut  in

personal income tax is very much more than the usual 10%  tax

rebate  given out when there was a comfortable budget surplus

in  the  past.   To do a quick calculation, a typical  family

with  an  income of $1,500 per month, living in  a  four-room

purchase flat, could save up to $730 from the goodies and the

tax  announced for Year of Assessment 2002.  If  the  minimum

$500  of  CPF top-up is taken into consideration, the  family

will  benefit  $1,230.  Sir, in a practical  way,  it  is  an

amount  good  enough for the family to buy a low-end  Pentium

III  computer.  In this case, the household does not need  to

pay  any  income tax, and $1,230 is a direct contribution  as

income  to the family.  It is indeed a very generous move  by

the  Government in looking after the people in the low-income

group.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paying low income tax would mean that the people would

have  more disposable income.  It would also help, in a small

way,  to boost the small retail and service industries  which

were  not  doing  well  in the past  few  years.   Year  2000

economic  performance was not uniform for all  sectors.   The

construction  industry  and  the  small  retail  and  service

industries  have still not picked up.  The domestic  industry

involves  quite  a  lot  of  people.   In  good  times,   the

construction industry has a share of about 10%  of  our  GDP.

One  could  easily imagine that more than 10% of  our  people

work  in  the construction industry because it is  a  labour-intensive industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this Budget, other than what has been mentioned about

the  possible  upturn of the construction  industry  and  the

reduction  of  property  tax by 2%  from  the  original  12%,

nothing great is being mentioned about how one could help  in

the  recovery  of the construction industry.   In  fact,  the

property tax reduction, as mentioned by my colleague, Dr Ker,

was  made after adjustment of the property tax rebate.   This

means that for Year of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 144</b></font><br><br>

Assessment  2002, a land owner, property owner  or  developer

will  pay  more tax in the form of property tax for  Year  of

Assessment 2002, as compared with the previous year.  I  hope

the  Finance  Minister  will look into  this  again  and  see

whether there is any error in the Budget announcement.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the construction industry has been depressed for

many years.  Some of the big construction companies might  be

facing financial troubles.  The consequence would be that  we

might  weaken  our construction industry which we  had  taken

years  to build up to the current stage.  In future,  if  the

demand  should  surge,  we might find a  similar  competitive

element, exercised in the past, which would not be there  any

more  and  the big foreign construction firms might  dominate

the market in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help the industry create the construction volume is

the  only  solution.   On  the one hand,  we  could  consider

increasing the public sector projects and, on the other hand,

we  could  remove  certain constraints that had  artificially

suppressed  the  demand.  Sir, many of  the  anti-speculation

policies  in  the  property market were  introduced  in  good

times.  In the post-Asian economic crisis, all these policies

will  go  against us and suppress demand.  We  should  either

lift  some  of these unfavourable policies or take action  to

quickly  let the property prices reflect its true  values  at

the  bottom  of  the V-shape curve and recover  subsequently.

The  demand will continue to stay low if property  prices  do

not  bottom out.  I would like to see more proactive measures

by  the  Government to help the construction industry in  its

recovery.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that there is a PSB Retail 21 10-year

plan  which  is  aimed  at  helping the  retail  industry  in

training,  upgrading and modernisation.  The retail  business

in  the  traditional HDB estates is lagging behind the modern

shopping  centres  and  is  facing strong  competition.   The

assistance  from the Government comes at the right  time.   I

hope PSB Retail 21 will help the small retail business to

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 145</b></font><br><br>

identify and overcome their weaknesses, reorganise the  small

retailers and strengthen their competitive edge to  meet  the

challenges from the modern retail business in the future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note that the Budget pays particular attention to the

restructuring of our economy.  The fund for the second 5-year

Plan  allocated  to  NSTB was doubled to $4  billion  and  an

additional $7 billion Science and Technology Plan for the R&D

activities  for  the next five years.  In the  case  of  life

sciences, another $1 billion for R&D and $1 billion  for  the

start-up fund were allocated.  The size of the funds shows  a

strong  commitment  by  the Government in  restructuring  our

economy  by  moving  upwards in the value-added  chain.   The

success  of Singapore's manufacturing sector must  depend  on

the continuous innovation of new products and development  of

capabilities at the pinnacle of science and technology.   The

success will help to place Singapore ahead of other countries

in the region of growth and high value-added areas.  It gives

Singapore  a  chance  of  success  in  certain  areas   while

competing with the products from the developed countries.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While emphasising so much on the development of new

areas,  like  life sciences, we should also not forget  other

niche  areas,  like  the micro-electronics and  environmental

engineering.    They  should  continue   to   receive   their

assistance   like  before,  to  continuously  sharpen   their

competitive   edge.    From   my   experience,   our   fellow

Singaporeans   always  shy  away  from  the   technical   and

scientific R&D activities.  Allocated with such a  large  sum

of  $12  billion  for  the next five  years  for  R&D,  I  am

concerned  that  if we did not pay sufficient  attention,  it

might  become  an  area  overwhelmingly  dominated  by  Asian

expatriates.   We should take sufficient action to  encourage

more of our young people to take part in this significant R&D

programme  which  will  have  a very  strong  impact  on  the

manufacturing sector in future.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 146</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We might have to change our people's perception in the

career  development, reward system and the social  status  of

R&D  personnel.   Generally,  people  may  have  problems  in

recognising  that  there is a career  in  R&D  in  Singapore.

There  are  no obvious scientific and technological  research

posts   in   the  public  and  private  sectors.    This   is

particularly  true  for the positions of top  scientists  and

research engineers.  The people who are employed for research

and development work either call themselves as "engineer"  or

"scientist".   And it is time that we should  generously  use

the job title of research or development engineer or research

scientist.  This will help to establish in the people's  mind

that  scientific research work is a very specific career that

one  could  pursue.   The present reward system  of  offering

scholarships  in  the university could only attract  students

from  the PRC and India.  It has almost completely failed  to

attract  Singaporeans  to  do  research  work.   If  we   see

university  research  training as the entry  point  into  the

chain of research manpower development, we must study how  we

could  attract Singapore researchers.  The aggressive science

and  technology  plan  given in this  Budget  could  only  be

considered to be a complete success if we could mobilise  and

attract more young scientists and engineers to take part  and

contribute in this programme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br>4.00 pm

<br><br><!-- Mr Thomas Thomas -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Thomas Thomas (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I

am pleased with this Budget Statement.  It has been described

as a generous Budget.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, budgets used to be described as "painless",

and  when  they  were painless budgets, we were  very  happy.

And,  most of the time, the painless Budget was painless but,

after  the  Budget, there would be off-budget measures  where

the pain comes in the form of other taxes.  But, now, in this

generous  Budget, we can still hope to listen  to  the  Prime

Minister in his National Day Rally and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 147</b></font><br><br>

hope for more generosity.  If some people describe this as  a

pre-election  Budget,  I  am  very  happy.   And  since   the

elections need not be held until August 2002, I hope  we  can

have  another pre-election budget and, then, it would be even

more  generous.   As Singaporeans, we are, of course,  always

generous  in  helping  people in  need,  and  we  also  enjoy

receiving generosity from the Government.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me state why I am quite pleased with this Budget.

Firstly,  I  think  the contributions  of  the  workers  were

recognised.   The  workers took a huge sacrifice  during  the

recession,  they  took  the pain and,  now,  when  there  are

surpluses,  I think it is right for these to be  returned  to

them.  Particularly, the tax exemptions for wage earners  and

small-time  businessmen are most welcome.   The  service  and

conservancy  charges, utility rates and  rental  rebates  are

good  gestures  to the HDB heartlanders for the  difficulties

they had to face during the last economic crisis.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think one of the brilliant pieces is the company stock

options  scheme, which rules that there must be a requirement

of  at  least 50% of the staff.  This requirement of at least

50%   of  the  staff  would  ensure  that  there  is  a  fair

distribution of gains.  With many staff, at least  more  than

50%  owning  a  stake in the company, they can only  work  to

increase  the shareholder value in the longer term, and  this

is definitely good.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we also need to look at other things. I ask the

Minister  why  we need to reduce corporate tax  by  1%.   The

argument about tax, whether Singapore would be declared a tax

haven, was raised, and also whether the Government is locking

itself  in to a lower tax rate.  In the past, there  was  the

idea  of  giving  rebates and, just in the case  of  personal

income  tax, could rebates have been a more useful tool?   As

trade  unionists,  as workers, we believe  that  it  is  very

important to make companies profitable, and we actually  took

a  lot  of cuts in the past to ensure that companies remained

profitable.   But  we  also believe that when  companies  are

making money,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 148</b></font><br><br>

when  they are highly profitable, they should not be  unhappy

to  pay  taxes.  Paying taxes is actually paying a return  to

society for giving them the environment to make profits.  And

taxes are also useful because part of these could be used  to

help the less-advantaged people in our society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other point of concern to the ground is the question

of  GST.  They say that since personal income tax is reduced,

corporate tax is reduced, can they have an assurance that GST

would  either  stay  the same or, if our surpluses  are  good

enough, it can drop a little and it would be most welcome.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that I would like to raise is this: the

Budget could do a little bit more for the old and sick.   The

pension  revisions were far too little - $10 more.  We  could

do  more for pensioners and we could do more at more frequent

intervals.  I think that we should also revisit our  thinking

although  we  have endowment funds for the aged, for  medical

care,  that  we should revisit ourselves to see how  best  we

could help the old in Singapore.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I conclude, I would just like to reply to one

hon.   Member,   who,   in  talking  about  Government-linked

companies,  linked NTUC Fairprice in the list of  Government-linked  companies.   As  a  trade  unionist,  I  think   NTUC

Fairprice is definitely not a Government-linked company.   It

is  owned by more than 200,000 individual trade union members

who  own  very  small shares - $20, $50 or  $1,000  -  and  a

number  of  trade  unions.  So it is not a  Government-linked

company.   It is just a workers' cooperative that is well-run

and  well  done.   And, if workers can run enterprises  well,

they  should be applauded and given incentives to do a better

job, and not be described as a Government-linked company.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would just like to describe this Budget as

generous.   But if only CPF had been fully restored,  then  I

would be much happier.  I think workers would be much happier

and we would have described this Budget as very generous.  So

we look forward to a very generous Budget in future.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 149</b></font><br><br>

<br><br><!-- Mr Inderjit Singh -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Inderjit Singh (Ang Mo Kio):</b> Sir, this year's Budget

is  indeed a generous one, with something for everyone.  This

time,  the Minister has given special attention in developing

the  knowledge economy.  It was indeed good to note that, for

the  first  time in a very long time, something  special  has

been done for the small and medium enterprises and start-ups.

This  will  go  a  long  way  in helping  us  to  grow  local

enterprises.   I  personally call this  a  Knowledge  Economy

Transition budget for the following reasons:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the tax concessions for start-ups and SMEs

as well as for the self-employed and entrepreneurs;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the tax incentives for software and

intellectual property operation and maintenance;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, a learning fund for everyone who wants to

upgrade himself or herself;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourthly, stock options tax reliefs for big and small

companies; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifthly, higher rebates for everyone to soften the

impact  of  a  recession or a digital divide  should  we  see

problems during this transition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, I would like to address a few key issues, which I

believe  were not adequately covered by the budget  proposals

but are important enough to get some attention if we want  to

transform  Singapore's  economy to  be  a  truly  first-world

economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the state of the economy. In my speech

during  the Budget debate in 1999, I spoke about the accuracy

of  the indices the Ministry uses to measure and predict  the

state of the economy and, hence, how policies are set for the

budget.   As I recall, in 1998, many private sector  industry

leaders  projected  declines  in  certain  sectors   of   the

Singapore economy, while the ministry projected growth in the

same  sectors.   A  year later, the results showed  that  the

private  sector's  reading of the state of  the  economy  was

right while the Government's projections were

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 150</b></font><br><br>

wrong.   This  shows  obvious gaps between  how  the  private

sector reads the economy versus how the Government reads  it.

This  time  around, I am afraid, we may be  seeing  the  same

pattern.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is my take on the state of the economy and how many

others are seeing it:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the middle of December last year, there was a

sudden  drop in demand, as if someone pulled the plug on  the

growing  economy.   Comments like "someone switched  off  the

lights  in  December" or "things fell off the  cliff  in  the

second  week of December" were quite common.  In my  opinion,

this is happening because of the expectation, of course, of a

weaker US economy this year and the loss of confidence  in  a

sustained growth in the key sectors of our economy.  While  I

heard  that  Dr  Ker talked about growth in  electronics  and

telecommunications, unfortunately, I think what we are seeing

is that sectors like electronics, semi-conductors, mobile and

wireless  communications equipment - and some of  these  that

were  high  growth  areas  -  are actually  starting  to  see

declines  right  now.  While we started hearing  of  negative

announcements by companies in terms of drops in revenues  and

profits  and lowering of forecasted growth rates  since  July

last  year, the general expectation at that time was that  it

was a period of correction and that these were mainly company-specific problems and not a general industry problem.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we have seen three quarters of such negative news,

with  companies  that did very well last year  also  sounding

cautious  about  the economic growth and outlook.   This  now

translates  to  a belief that we will be seeing  a  sustained

downturn  resulting  in  not-so-soft  a  landing  of  the  US

economy.   Coupled with the woes in Japan, confidence  levels

have dropped in many parts of the world, including Singapore.

In  my  opinion, we will, without doubt, see a  slowdown  for

now,  and  it  may  last for the next two to three  quarters.

What  is not so obvious is whether we will see recovery after

that.  And there are two possible scenarios that I would like

to share.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 151</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first scenario is that the downturn is a short one

and  the  US  economy goes for a soft landing and  confidence

comes  back, with consumers going back to purchase more.   In

my  opinion, there has been too much of pessimism  and,  like

always, consumers and companies have over-reacted due to  the

loss  of confidence.  This over-reaction is causing companies

to  drastically lower their forecasts of demand, to the point

that  they  are  now  over conservative.   These  days,  most

companies  do  not  keep  very large volumes  of  inventories

anyway,  and  they  will see a depletion of inventory  levels

which have been built up in the last two quarters due to  the

sudden drop of demand, while production levels remained  high

at that time.  With the depletion of inventories, we will see

a  quick  turn-on of production when consumer demand returns.

If  and  when this happens, we will see growth going back  to

sustainable levels and we can see a quick recovery.  There is

also  the Asia demand factor, especially the demand for goods

and  services in China and Japan, especially if Japan reforms

effectively.  And this Asian demand may, to a certain extent,

make up for the loss of US demand.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the second scenario is not so nice. We may see a

downturn  lasting two to three years, and this will occur  if

the  US goes into a recession and if they fail to get out  of

it fast and, especially, if the Japanese economy continues to

drag.  Consumer confidence would continue to be dragged  down

further  and,  if the stock markets remain depressed,  people

would become more conservative in spending.  This will result

in  a continued decline of companies' performances.  This, in

my   opinion,  would  lead  to  spiral  effects  of  loss  of

confidence,  where expectations of slowing sales and  profits

in  companies  would lead to worries about  job  cuts,  which

would  lead  to  consumers slowing down spending,  and  which

would  further  erode profits, which would  in  turn  further

weaken  consumer  confidence.  Up to the end  of  last  year,

corporations  were  holding  back making  drastic  structural

changes  to  their companies, including people  actions,  and

this was because the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 152</b></font><br><br>

expectation was that there was a quick turnaround around  the

corner,  and they wanted to be ready for a quick upturn  when

it   comes  and,  therefore,  they  did  not  do  the   major

restructuring.   Given  that the  turnaround  did  not  come,

companies  would  now  be  seriously  considering  structural

changes  in  their  organisations and this scenario  means  a

recession and tough times ahead for all of us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to which of the two scenarios will prevail, I would

say  that  we need a little more time to analyse and predict.

We  have to at least see how the first quarter goes.   It  is

only  after  the  dust has settled and the current  confusion

clears  up  due  to the "over-pessimism" that  we  have  seen

starting December can we tell which direction the economy  is

heading.   While I personally subscribe to the first scenario

of  a  quick turnaround, we really need about three  to  four

months to be a little surer.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore feel that the forecast of 5% to 7% is too

optimistic,  given  the  many  changes  that  have  happened,

starting  from the middle of December last year.   I  believe

the  indicators that the Government uses to measure the state

of  the  economy are not sensitive enough to gauge  the  true

situation  of the economy, as the private sector has  already

reacted   to   the  sudden  slowdown  while  the   Government

indicators are not ringing any alarm bells.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other issue is that, in the past two years, economic

recovery  has  been  unequal,  post  Asian  crisis.   Certain

sectors still lag behind and have not seen any recovery while

a  few did recover strongly, eg, the semi-conductors and  the

electronics  industry.  This time round, if a downturn  comes

quickly, we may risk wiping out some of these companies which

will  be  hit  by a double whammy because they would  be  hit

again before they had a chance to recover from the last fall.

More,  therefore, should have been done in  this  budget,  in

anticipation  of  a  deteriorating  economy.   We  should  be

proactive and not reactive as we have been in the past.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 153</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing I would like to talk about is the cost

of  business  and the future of the manufacturing  sector  in

Singapore.   While  this  year's  budget  was  positive   for

businesses  in  two areas, first, the lowering  of  corporate

taxes by 1% and, second, the lowering of property tax, I feel

that  the Minister could have taken the opportunity to review

and  implement changes which could further make Singapore  an

attractive   hub   and   a   centre  for   high   value-added

manufacturing activities.  My concerns are in a few areas:

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, the cost increases. In the last one year or

so,  the  cost of doing business in Singapore has  increased.

Costs have gone up in a number of areas, including Government

rates,  utilities,  JTC rentals as well as  CPF  rates.   The

reversal  of the cost-cutting measures occurred too  fast  at

the   first  sign  of  economic  recovery  last  year.    The

Government should hold off any more increases, in my  opinion

for now, and should a downturn come fast, the Government must

be   ready  to  react  equally  fast  to  address  the   cost

competitiveness  issues.   The  cost  of  doing  business  in

Singapore  will soon become a big issue again if we  are  not

vigilant  and  let  costs  go back to  the  pre-Asian  crisis

levels.  The Government should have a longer-term view of how

the  economy  should be managed, especially when it  involves

the cost of doing business in Singapore.  We got into trouble

before  and  we  can  get into trouble  again.   I  urge  the

Minister  to  convene  a committee to start  planning  for  a

possible downturn and identify proactive measures.  This will

allow us to react decisively, should a downturn hit us again.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing on the manufacturing sector is that we

all  realise  the  importance of  further  strengthening  the

manufacturing sector as well as to establish a stronger  base

of  SMEs which can transform into world-class companies.   We

have  done an excellent job in attracting new investments  in

technology   and  manufacturing  companies.   The   type   of

incentives,  like the pioneer status, investment  allowances,

grants and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 154</b></font><br><br>

subsidies,  worked  well  in the  past.   Moving  forward,  I

believe we need to devise new strategies and, therefore,  new

sets   of   incentives  that  will  further  strengthen   the

manufacturing sector as a key sector of our economy.

Some  of  the things that we can do include giving incentives

or   tax   breaks  for  companies  which  make   productivity

improvements.   If  a certain productivity  standard  can  be

developed and the Government can issue special tax incentives

for  companies  that  put  in the resources  to  become  more

productive, this will be good for all of us. With a perpetual

shortage  of manpower, we have no choice but to be among  the

most  productive in any activities that we carry  out  if  we

compare ourselves to any other countries in the world.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of our incentive schemes also require investments

to  be  made  physically  in  Singapore.   In  doing  so,  we

encourage  companies to continue to add assets and  resources

in  Singapore  even though it may make sense  to  place  such

assets in more suitable countries.  I therefore suggest  that

incentives to encourage outsourcing of activities to  outside

Singapore  so  that companies will restructure and  focus  on

keeping only high value-added activities in Singapore.  In  a

globalised  knowledge economy, we should break up  the  whole

value  and  supply  chain of activities of manufacturing  and

service  businesses  and place the components  of  the  value

chain  in countries best suited to carry out these activities

productively and efficiently.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Globalisation is also an urgent issue especially since

regionalisation is not viable when the region is in  turmoil.

The  Government  should  therefore take  the  opportunity  to

introduce  new  measures to give globalisation  a  boost,  to

encourage  companies to move out of Singapore and beyond  the

region.    It  is  about  time  we  created  more  home-grown

multinational companies which can compete effectively outside

our  shores and which can take advantage of the opportunities

immediately  available today as the whole  market  makes  its

transition to the new economy.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 155</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the whole, while we have done well with Government

assistance  and  incentive schemes, I feel that  we  need  to

restructure  the  schemes to be more market-driven  and  move

away  from  incentives  that create a subsidy  mentality.   A

subsidy driven scheme just hides weaknesses and does not give

the  opportunity  for  us  to  develop  fundamentally  strong

companies able to compete in the world arena.  It is time  we

reviewed  and  restructured  the  60-plus  incentive  schemes

existing today and to create a few effective ones.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the third area which I would like to talk about is

the  promotion of entrepreneurship in the knowledge  economy.

The  last  two years had been excellent for us in encouraging

Singaporeans to become more entrepreneurial.  Many  companies

were  set up and many of our young took the plunge to  become

entrepreneurs.  The technopreneurial excitement was, however,

short-lived for Singapore, but this, in my opinion,  was  for

the better because a long drawn period of boom based on hypes

and fundamentally weak business strategies could have damaged

our  economy  more and would have damaged the  confidence  of

would-be entrepreneurs even more.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the dot.com bust, there has been a big loss of

confidence among entrepreneurs and investors.  There are many

lessons  to be learnt from the last two years of experiences.

For  example, our budding entrepreneurs have learnt about the

need  for  proper business models, the need  to  think  of  a

global  market place and not Singapore as a market, the  need

to  avoid "me too" ventures where we just follow what someone

else is doing without understanding the true strategies,  and

the  need  for fundamental business strategies to  be  worked

out.   From my personal experience, we had many fundamentally

weak  companies that sprouted out in the last two  years  and

many  could not have lasted anyway, even if the dot.com  bust

did  not  come.   The  bust  did come  and  many  experienced

failures.  I hope that this failure will become the basis  of

a better chance of success in the future.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 156</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now over-pessimism among investors and VCs.

Many  are not willing to fund even viable companies.   Unless

something is done fast to help such companies, we will see  a

sad   situation  of  potentially  good  companies  seeing   a

premature   end.    At   the   end   of   last   year,    the

Technopreneurship 21 Private Sector Committee, of which I  am

a  member,  requested the Government to set aside  a  special

fund  which  we  called a "Lifeline Fund" to help  struggling

start-ups  that still have fundamentals but are  facing  cash

squeeze  that  hinders their progress.  Many  face  immediate

collapse  if  not  helped  soon.  I will  elaborate  on  this

"Lifeline  Fund" during the Committee of Supply  discussions.

It is, however, really urgent and we must do something before

we  destroy  the  good environment that we  have  created  in

promoting technopreneurship in the last two years.   We  need

to help some companies that are in trouble right now.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the final point I would like to touch on is the

privatisation of Government-linked companies and  this  is  a

topic that many Members have spoken about.  The reason  I  am

bringing  this  up  again is to suggest that  while  we  have

seemingly good GLCs, if we consider how they perform  in  the

local  market,  the  truth of the matter  is  that  they  may

develop weak fundamentals which would become serious setbacks

when  such  companies compete with global  companies  outside

Singapore.  We have seen many examples of how some  of  these

GLCs  have failed to compete externally.  If we look  at  the

many GLCs in Singapore, the ones that are doing well are  the

ones  that are truly privatised and hence subjected  to  true

market  discipline  like  any  private  sector  company.    I

therefore hope that the pace of privatisation will be speeded

up.   While it will take time for privatisation to take place

for  all  GLCs, in the meantime, there should also be greater

transparency   of  how  GLCs  are  managed.    Policies   and

incentives  for such companies should be market-driven.   The

Government should avoid giving undue subsidies which  I  feel

may  just hide weaknesses of such companies.  We end up doing

a disservice to the GLCs because in the long term,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 157</b></font><br><br>

they  would  face problems when competing in the real  world,

where there is true market competition when in fact the  GLCs

have been used to an "easier than market" governance approach

that we have created for them.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to end by once again expressing that we are

heading in the right direction of transforming Singapore to a

knowledge economy.  The Budget announced by the Minister  for

Finance supports the transition to the new economy.   I  hope

the  Minister will seriously consider the suggestions I  have

made earlier to further strengthen Singapore's position as we

compete with the world's best economies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this, Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Low Thia Khiang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker,

Sir,  in  his  speech, the Finance Minister  said  that  this

Budget  is  the  "best  ever" and  "most  generous".   I  was

somewhat  surprised because, by right, during  the  last  two

years,  when the region was facing the financial crisis,  and

the  people  were desperately waiting for the  Government  to

dish out more, the Government should be more generous in  its

Budget,  yet it chose not to be so.  In the past,  even  when

the Government had a lot of budget surplus, it did not appear

to  be so generous.  Why is it that the Government decides to

be so generous this year?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let us look at just how generous this Budget is.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, in the reduction of personal income tax rates,

the  Finance Minister said that "an individual with an annual

income of $35,000 would pay approximately 30% less tax and an

individual  whose  annual  income  is  $100,000  would   save

approximately  20% in income tax."  As such,  the  lower  and

middle income taxpayers will benefit most.  However, from  my

own  calculations, under the new tax structure, an individual

with a $35,000 annual income would save only $230,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 158</b></font><br><br>

while  one who earns $100,000 would save $2,230.  How can  we

say that people in  the lower-income group will benefit most?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the tax exemption on the first $7,500

chargeable income and the 10% tax rebate that came  with  the

implementation of GST would benefit the higher income  people

most.   To  the  lower-income  group,  the  rebate  and   tax

reduction  mean  nothing to them because if their  income  is

low, they pay no tax at all.  This is the true colour of  the

Government's  generosity.  You must first  be  able  to  earn

money  and the Government reduces its taxes on your  earnings

and  it is then deemed to be mercifully generous to you.  But

please  do not forget that even the lower-income people  have

to pay GST!

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Budget also introduces a so-called "benefit-sharing" package, and the most attractive part is the CPF top-up scheme. However, under this scheme, in order to be

entitled to the Government's top-up, there must first be some

money  deposited into the CPF account.  It is like  what  the

Hokkien  people say, "Money fears loneliness".  Only  if  you

have  money  can you earn money.   Then, you  can  earn  some

money from the Government and have more money. The Government

is  happy  to  spend some money and show generosity,  at  the

expense  of the people, with the hope of achieving  what  was

described by an associate professor of NTU that "The ordinary

people  are overwhelmed by an unexpected favour to the extent

of  wanting to be thankful and be whole-heartedly grateful to

the great leaders."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the people of Singapore will face three major

problems  in the next few years: first, a weaker US  economy;

secondly, with the economic reform, the older people with low

educational level will not be able to cope and may lose their

jobs  or  suffer  a  reduction in income; and,  thirdly,  the

rising cost of living.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Finance Minister said that the Government would help

those people who were affected by the economic

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 159</b></font><br><br>

reform  to pull through.  Yet, in this Budget, I do  not  see

how the Government is going to help these lower-income people

to pull through.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most worrying part is that if the regional situation

worsens,  and  if  the  US economy heads for a  hard-landing,

many  companies  will close down or retrench  their  workers.

The  people  in  the lower and middle-income  group  will  be

affected most severely. Then, how are they going to survive?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards the cost of living, in last year's Budget,

the  water-borne fees were raised substantially.  Electricity

charges were also increased considerably.  If the charges for

the  various basic services continue to be adjusted  upwards,

then  the  burden  of  the  people will  become  heavier  and

heavier.  Although this Budget provides for a Utilities  Save

scheme whereby rebates are given (and rebates can please  the

people and show that the Government is able and generous), it

is  not  a long-term solution. The rebates can be reduced  or

even revoked at any time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that what the Government should do is to ensure

that  the  cost of living will not keep on going up,  and  to

alleviate  the  burden of the people through  some  budgetary

measures.   The various rebates can only temporarily  relieve

the  pressure in the daily lives of the people.  It is unable

to  resolve the problem of the escalating cost of living  and

the heavier and heavier burden of the ordinary citizens.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, Mr Speaker, I am disappointed with this

Budget which appears to be spectacular and extremely generous

superficially, but which in substance fails to alleviate  the

burden on the people.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chay Wai Chuen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chay Wai Chuen (Tanjong Pagar):</b> Sir, I wish to speak

in support of this motion.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I have to describe the characteristic and impact of

this   Budget,  in  the  history  of  Budgets  presented   in

Singapore, I would say this is the big one.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 160</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><h4>[Mr Deputy Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>

<br>4.27 pm

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, it turned out a budget surplus of $3.54

billion, after providing for 50% of the Net Investment Income

contribution  to  the reserve without entering  the  budget's

operating revenue stream (this amount is $1.55 billion)  then

providing  for  $1.84  billion in special  transfers  to  the

various  top-ups  to CPF, Lifelong Learning  Endowment  Fund,

ElderCare  Fund,  MediShield Scheme for the  Elderly,  Senior

Pensioners Grant Scheme, etc.  This out-turn of $3.54 billion

is  arrived  at after transferring almost $2 billion  to  the

telcos  in  the  course of the year's decision to  accelerate

telecommunication sector liberalisation.  Even if we were  to

add  back  these  figures, the figure is  a  staggering  $8.9

billion.   Out of a total budget of $28 billion in 2000,  the

surplus   is   almost  one-third  of  the  total  expenditure

budgeted.  In the same breath, the economy turned in  a  9.9%

growth.   The explanation for all these phenomena is  not  as

discussed  just now, to be found in the year for the  general

election,  but  I  believe to be found in nowhere  except  in

Chinese mythology.  It is called the Year of the Dragon.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister is quick this year to give a $2 billion tax

cut  across  almost  all  sectors  in  reduced  personal  and

corporate tax.  This is naturally welcome and needed.  It  is

also necessary, I think.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not against budget surplus, but excessive budget

surplus  out-turns at one-third of the projected  expenditure

for  the year can mean unnecessary deflationary pull  on  the

private sector economy through taxes and statutory costs  and

fees.   This  $2  billion  tax break  is  almost  universally

welcome by people from all walks of life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A freer tax burden, including lower fees and statutory

costs,  can  lead to a more dynamic, entrepreneurial  economy

with lesser debt burden.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this high growth budget surplus result, many

people are asking:  where is

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 161</b></font><br><br>

the growth coming from?  They do not feel the growth in their

sector,  especially among the SMEs, the construction  sector,

which  almost absorbs half of the capital formation  and  the

financial services sector.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than 100,000 new jobs were created last year and

the total external trade hit a record with exports growing by

22% last year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three areas in the economic data profile which

I would like to express some concern for clarification by the

Minister.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is that overall productivity figures did not

show  comparable achievement, being at just over 5.2%,  which

was   lower   than   the  previous  year's  6.2%.    Sectoral

productivity in the financial services, business services and

construction services sectors declined.  Overall and sectoral

labour  productivity  figures can vary  from  year  to  year,

because  of  many data reasons, but the sectoral productivity

figures  give me cause for concern, as a large proportion  of

the economy is languishing.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these sectors are undergoing re-engineering. So

I  would  expect  some adjustment in their output  and  input

figures.   Others are already making significant  growth  and

development,  especially  in manufacturing,  wholesale/retail

trade and transport and communications.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our worst performing industrial sector continues to be

construction  where we have almost 50% of our  gross  capital

formation  -  more than $23 billion out of $46 billion.   The

construction sector, which has contributed to about  6.8%  of

our GDP at constant dollars, has been showing negative labour

productivity growth since 1995.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, both the financial services sector and the

business  services sector which contribute about $31  billion

out of a constant dollar GDP of $140 billion, ie,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 162</b></font><br><br>

about  22%  of  the  economy, are also experiencing  negative

growth in productivity.  Therefore, almost 30% of the economy

is  languishing  in declining productivity  compared  to  the

previous   year.  This  is  something  of   note   while   we

congratulate the Minister for his Budget and economic growth.

These may perhaps explain the often time gasp, "where is this

growth coming from?"

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the Minister not to let up on fiscal measures to

give  incentives  and penalties  for the errant  construction

sector  to  buck  up  and  improve the construction  sector's

productivity.   Unfortunately, we put half  of  our  domestic

capital formation in this basket.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lagging financial services and business services

sectors  also  should be given some doses of  incentives  for

responsiveness,  as  they have also been in  negative  labour

productivity  growth in these few years.  They  somehow  have

not quite recovered from the financial crisis since 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the productivity figures, however, an

important  feature  is that a significant number  of  100,000

jobs  were  created,  more than our annual  addition  to  the

working population by the natural cohort of 50,000.  It  also

shows  that  there is considerable success in  re-channelling

our workers who have been dislocated in one job to seek other

employment by training and retraining programmes.  I  believe

we  are  on  the right track with the Ministry of  Manpower's

redoubtable  Manpower  21  programme  and  the  NTUC's  Skill

Retraining effort.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area I wish to express concern is that

somehow  the  growth  of 9.9% in the economy  did  not  quite

reflect  its lustrous performance in the monetary  aggregates

of  M1 and M3, narrow money and broad money.  M1 only grew by

7%, while broad money, M3, had been declining since 1998, and

since  August 2000, M2 has actually been shrinking.  This  is

an  unusual  phenomenon,  as strong economic  growth  usually

correlates with growth in the money supply.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 163</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hazard a guess that domestic money is seeking refuge

in foreign money for better returns, either as deposits or as

foreign  equity  or  assets.  Last year, in  the  balance  of

payments figures, the Net Financial Account Deficit was $19.7

billion,  quite sizable, although reduced from  the  previous

year.   Since  1996, on the balance of payments  Capital  and

Financial  Account  Balance, there has  been  a  net  private

sector  financial  outflow of funds on the capital  accounts.

These  figures and the general perception of "where  is  this

growth coming from?", coupled with this deflationary pull  of

a  huge budget surplus, underline my concern on the state  of

the economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third area concerns deregulation in this new era

economy,  especially  in  telecommunications,  utilities  and

Government statutory boards.  Deregulation and liberalisation

are  important  for  introducing  competition  and  customer-oriented development for efficiency.  But by themselves, they

are  no  panacea.  Just like the hype about the  new  economy

where  at one time, it was even touted that the more  chaotic

and fuzzy the thinking, the better the prospect and potential

for    the   new   economy   valuation,   deregulation    and

liberalisation of the New Zealand economy, for  example,  one

of   the   world's   first  pioneer  in   government   sector

liberalisation  and  deregulation, did  not  quite  make  for

efficiency and customer satisfaction.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, consumers there are not benefitting from the

liberalisation programme.  While the Government would like to

liberalise or deregulate certain sectors or privatise certain

businesses,  it  must not do so on the sacred cow,  forsaking

convenience and customer service, and for the small  guy  and

the  people  at large.   The example of DBS and POSBank,  and

Singapore Power come to mind.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, I hope we should remember that

good  old  economic value analysis still applies, whether  in

the  old or new economy.  Capital has its price, and business

is about serving customers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are transferring billions of dollars from the revenue

stream onto all kinds of

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 164</b></font><br><br>

Funds    -    Lifelong  Learning  Endowment  Fund,    Medical

Endowment Fund, ElderCare Fund, etc.  I hope the Minister has

some mechanism to monitor whether these funds are put to good

productive use.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These tax offsets and rebates given this year will help

make  an  impact  on the overall population.  The  Government

promised  last year that significant steps will be  taken  to

uplift  our  people  by financial assistance,  by  access  to

education and learning funding for school-based or work-based

learning,  to  level  up society in the wake  of  the  income

inequality  from globalisation challenges.   I  think  it  is

delivering all this.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tax cut on property from 12% to 10% is quite across

the  board,  impacting many Singaporeans.  The  reduction  in

individual income tax by 2-5 percentage points for all  bands

will  significantly impact Singaporeans  from  all  walks  of

life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generous service and conservancy charges and rental

rebates granted for HDB dwellers are welcome goodies from the

Minister.   Many  low  income  families  and  retirees   will

appreciate this gesture from the Government towards  building

a caring society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Michael Lim Chun Leng (Cheng San):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  the  Budget  this year has been generous,  yet  crafted

carefully to propel the economy forward.  It has measures  to

help  Singapore stay competitive and has also eased the  pain

of  restructuring.  While the Budget has focused on  the  big

picture, I am glad that the Budget has also catered  for  the

needs of the individual Singaporeans.  Most importantly, I am

concerned  that  the unskilled or lowly skilled  Singaporeans

will have difficulty in finding a niche for themselves in the

new era economy.  Many of them are also sole breadwinners.  I

am  glad that we have announced increased funding for several

schemes, like investment in education and technology, CPF top-up, utility rebates, SC&CC rebates, ElderCare

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 165</b></font><br><br>

Fund and the Medical Endowment Fund.  These are some measures

that  have been put in place to help the lower income, but  I

think more needs to be done.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we push ahead to help propel the economy forward,

there will be stresses on the social fabric of society.   For

the unskilled or poorly skilled, structural unemployment will

be a major social stress on the family, and many of them find

that  even though there are opportunities for training,  they

may not have the ability to adapt to the new environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the skilled workers or even the professionals, they

face  a  different type of stress.   The increasing trend  of

families  with  both  parents working long  hours  will  also

stress  the  family unit.  It is important that  as  we  work

towards   increasing  productivity  and   restructuring   the

economy,  we  must  be  mindful of the family  unit  and  the

stresses it faces.  Having more children see psychiatrist and

increasing  divorces  are signs of strain  on  the  Singapore

family unit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down on the ground, the Community Development Councils

(CDCs)  can play a pivotal role in working with the voluntary

welfare  organisations to help prevent or relieve the  social

stresses on the Singapore family.  It can be a central agency

to   marshal   the   resources  of  the   voluntary   welfare

organisations, and also be a key point for people  to  go  to

when  they  need  help  in  this  area.   Current  CDCs  have

insufficient manpower and resources to carry out their  roles

to  their full potential.  Government should increase funding

for  CDCs, and also look at increased incentives to encourage

both  individuals  and  companies to help  provide  increased

funding for the CDCs in their personal or company capacity.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other key organisation that is important in the

heartlands  where  most  people live  in  will  be  the  town

councils.  After the Asian economic crisis, the town councils

and,  more lately, the CDCs have been looking for alternative

financial

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 166</b></font><br><br>

instruments  to  place  their funds.  With  the  lowering  of

interest  rates,  bonds have become attractive  alternatives.

In line with the Government's effort to grow the bond market,

town  councils have also been active in participating in  the

bond   market.    In  the  1998  Budget  statement,   a   10%

concessionary  rate  of tax on interest income  derived  from

qualifying  debt  securities  was  announced.   However,  the

concessionary  tax rate for bonds has not  been  extended  to

town  councils  and  the CDCs.  Both these organisations  are

organisations that work not for themselves but for the people

on  the ground and the people in the heartlands.  I think  it

is  time  that  the Ministry of Finance considered  extending

this concessionary tax rate to these organisations.

<br><br><!-- Mr Loh Meng See -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Loh Meng See (Kampong Glam):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir,

I  wish  to congratulate the Minister for Finance for  giving

out the best Budget during his tenure to date.  In many ways,

Dr  Richard  Hu's  long  years of prudence  in  steering  the

financial and fiscal policies has enabled Singapore to remain

the beacon of a stable, progressive and prosperous economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the operating expenditure side, the Government has

kept  itself  small, lean and effective.  In the  development

expenditure,  there  is  no  let-up  in  ensuring  that   our

infrastructure  and  investment in  schools  and  educational

institutions,  transportation,  housing,  hospitals,  medical

centres  and polyclinics keep up with the times and  of  high

quality for the benefit of all Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the revenue side, personal incomes and corporate

earnings   have  grown  and  therefore  tax  revenues.    The

introduction  of  COEs,  GST and new  fees  and  charges  has

enabled the Government to have good and regular income stream

to   finance   the  expenditures  required.    What   is   of

significance  is  Singapore's  ability  to  ride   over   the

difficulties of economic downturns and prepare  for  the  new

wave of economic and business challenges in the horizon.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 167</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The economic restructuring process, began in the mid-1980s, when Singapore met with its first economic recession

since  independence in 1985, taught us the  valuable  lesson.

We  learnt the lesson well and successfully overcame  quickly

the regional financial crisis 12 years later in 1997.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new knowledge economy poses tremendous challenges

for  the Government and Singaporeans at large.  But,  Sir,  I

like to make a plea for the elderly citizens in the light  of

all  these challenges.  The longevity of our people,  because

of  higher  standards of living and the increasing number  of

elderly persons, are long-term issues we cannot avoid, but to

deal  with as early as possible.  For this growing  group  of

elderly   citizens,   their   earnings   will   decline   and

expenditures  will  rise.   We are already  seeing  within  a

family  two  generations of retired persons   -   parents  in

their 80s and above, and children in their 60s who have  also

retired.  This brings a heavy burden on these families  where

medical  cost and healthcare expenditures are major concerns.

They belong to the generation of little or no CPF savings and

lower  earnings  in  their early active working  lives.   For

many of them, the homes they live in are the only assets they

own.   They  have  little cash.  Yet the  policy  appears  to

disadvantage  them for assistance.  It is not  easy  for  the

elderly  with financial needs to dispose of their homes  they

are  comfortable  with or to downgrade to  smaller  flats  or

selling   off   their   property   and   living   in   rented

accommodation.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to ask whether the Government can be a little bit

more  sympathetic  and considerate to these elderly  citizens

with financial difficulties to exclude from consideration the

HDB  flat that they own, to be able to obtain financial  help

from  the  Government  through the CDCs or  other  Government

agencies.   The difficulties lie because their children,  who

themselves  are  not doing well, have their own  families  to

support.  I know the children are encouraged and expected  to

support  and  look after their parents, but for  those  whose

parents  have  prolonged illness and need  long-term  medical

care,

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 168</b></font><br><br>

the  financial  strain  is burdensome  indeed.   Perhaps  the

Government can modify its attitude to recognise that  we  are

having  in our midst the pioneering generation of independent

Singapore  needing help.  If we lighten the burden  of  these

elderly  citizens  in their twilight years,  we  are  helping

their children at the same time.  They would be relieved from

the financial burden of taking care of their grandparents and

parents  and  concentrate on taking good care of their  young

families.

Competencies in Finance and Risk Management

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I observe the difficulties faced by individuals and

small businesses, what strikes me most is the general lack of

competency  or  even  literacy  in  the  management  of   the

financial affairs and risks in our population.  I agree  with

the  principle  of  caveat emptor,  that  the  individual  is

responsible for the consequence of his investment  decisions,

but  do  we  have the positive attitude of sharing investment

knowledge  and  experience amongst our people?   Perhaps  the

Finance  Ministry  can  take  upon  itself  to  educate   our

population  in  the  area of financial and  risk  management.

These  are  areas  of  knowledge  and  skills  essential   to

strengthening   Singapore's  position  as  a  financial   and

business  hub  where  we have an investment-savvy  population

playing  an  active role in the businesses of the region  and

the  international markets.  We can all help one  another  to

realise  better  returns  and  values  for  investment,  both

national,  corporate and individuals.  This  is  one  way  of

securing the best growth returns for the retirement nest  egg

of  our people.  I say this, Sir, because in recent years  we

have  seen that those who have made investments through their

CPF  savings  have not obtained the kind of value  that  they

have wished.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, Singaporeans like the "DIY" (Do It

Yourself)  approach  and  are not prepared  to  pay  for  the

service  of  the  experts.  Sometimes I  do  not  blame  them

because  the  so-called experts are not  truly  the  experts.

Therefore,  the move towards greater professionalism  in  the

financial

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 169</b></font><br><br>

services  sector  is a welcome one.  The Singapore  consumers

deserve better service from businesses and service providers.

In  order to break away from the traditional ineffective ways

of  rendering service, foreign talents are attracted to  play

the  useful  role of providing the much needed  expertise  in

both  the domestic and international markets.  Though I  must

add  that  the DBS Bank management did not display  the  high

standards  expected  of talented foreign  management  in  the

handling of the POSBank merger and subsequent consumer retail

business  in  POSBank, I believe we all can  learn  from  the

lessons there.

Supplementary Retirement Scheme

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supplementary Retirement Scheme allows foreigners to

enjoy  additional  benefits that they  do  not  have  on  tax

deductible  allowance for CPF contributions.   Concerns  have

been raised about the level of charges levied by SRS operator

banks  and the quality of financial advice they can offer  to

SRS  participants.   I  agree with the Government's  move  to

support  the local banks.  I hope these banks will do justice

to  the  favourable position they enjoy in  the  deposit  and

investment of SRS funds.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the Government can take one step further through

the  SRS  to  give incentives to small and medium enterprises

(SMEs)  to  encourage them to engage the services of  foreign

talent  to  help  expand their markets.   Traditionally,  the

executives  in  the MNCs have specialised and  expert  market

knowledge  and networks round the globe.  The Singapore  SMEs

can  benefit  tremendously if they can be more successful  in

achieving  good brand names for their products and  services.

In  the Internet world, having indigenous brands and managing

the integrity of our products and services will become highly

critical in the global markets.

Stock Option Scheme

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, on stock option scheme. Under the Company

Stock Option

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 170</b></font><br><br>

Scheme,  the Government has provided some waiver of  tax  for

gains  of up to $1 million over 10 years, and I believe  this

is  a  good  move.  I support the sentiment that the  Company

Stock  Option  Scheme  should benefit  the  majority  of  the

employees  so that as stakeholders, the workforce  will  bond

the  staff  together  working as a  team  for  the  long-term

interest of the company and the people working in it.   I  am

surprised  that there are still some tax experts who  quibble

as  to  why tax should be shifted from the point options  are

exercised  to  the point when stock is sold, given  the  wild

swings in the share prices.  Do these experts not know  that,

firstly,  the  employees  would  be  granted  share   options

regularly,  and secondly, precisely because of the volatility

of  share  price fluctuations the option holders should  only

exercise  their options when they want to sell their  shares.

It  is really unwise for the option holders to exercise their

shares  and continue to hold them as they would then have  to

bear  the risk which many have learnt to their despair during

the  regional  financial crisis that it is  the  most  unwise

thing  to  do.  I am glad that the Finance Minister does  not

heed this suggestion of shifting tax from the point option is

exercised  to the point when stock is sold, giving the  clear

guidance  and  message  as to how option  holders  should  be

careful in exercising the options only when they want to sell

the shares.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Mr Peh Chin Hua -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Peh Chin Hua (Jalan Besar)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Deputy

Speaker, Sir, this year the Minister for Finance, Dr  Richard

Hu,  has presented a wealth-sharing Budget and this has  made

Singaporeans think that this is a very generous Budget in  an

election year.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With global economic competition getting more and more

intense today,  many countries have plunged into economic and

political  predicament.  In certain countries, owing  to  the

quality of political leadership, these leaders are unable  to

turn  around their economic decline, resulting in substantial

currency

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 171</b></font><br><br>

depreciation,  outflow  of  capital,  withdrawal  of  foreign

investments  and  grave unemployment situation.   The  people

there  have not been able to see the light at the end of  the

tunnel  and  there are frequent riots.  The whole economy  is

paralysed.   Under  these  circumstances,  even   a   general

election  followed  by a change of government  is  unable  to

solve their national problems.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, take a look at Singapore. We are

able  to  accumulate budget surpluses year after  year.   The

people  are  well taken care of. They are well fed  and  well

clothed.   People enjoy high wages and stable jobs. Even  the

low  income group and the less fortunate people receive  very

good  care  and  concern.  People are able to  share  in  the

prosperity  of  the  country.  Our  society  is   stable  and

peaceful, and our currency strong and stable.  People live in

safety  and  prosperity.  This is due, to a great extent,  to

the  fact  that  the people of Singapore have  been  wise  in

electing  a  reliable  and  good  Government  which  has  the

people's welfare at heart.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that some Singaporeans are of the view that the

political  leaders  are overpaid in Singapore.   Fortunately,

the vast majority of Singaporeans are sober in realising that

we would rather have a good government which is paid well, of

high  quality,  efficient, and works for the benefit  of  the

people  than  to  have  a  "cheapskate"  government  to  lead

Singapore into disasters and chaos.  As long as we  are  able

to  maintain this national consciousness we will continue  to

have a peaceful and prosperous Singapore where the people are

able  to share in the wealth of the nation, year after  year.

This  is our common wish.  The Opposition Member, Mr Low Thia

Khiang,  remarked that the Budget was only seemingly generous

but  not  so substantially.  I think such a remark  can  only

come  from those who may know a lot about politics but little

about economics.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, when I visited the Silicon

Valley in the United States of America in July last year, the

US

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 172</b></font><br><br>

economy  was booming.  I was told that when a high-technology

company  wanted to engage a head of department, it had  great

difficulty in getting a suitable candidate.  Very  often,  it

had  to  offer very attractive salaries and stock  option  to

poach  from other high-technology companies for the  required

talent.   Even then, not many people were interested in  such

attractive offers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a few months later, the situation over there

underwent  some  earth-shaking changes.   Two  weeks  ago,  I

visited  the Silicon Valley again. I could vividly feel  that

the  US  economy  has slowed down.  Those  dot.com  companies

which  did not have solid foundations saw their share  prices

falling from US$100 to US$1, some even went down to 60 cents.

Even  the  strong high-tech companies also found their  share

prices  tumbling down from US$100 to between US$16 and US$26.

The consumption market was also very hard hit.  The same high-tech company, which I mentioned earlier, now receives some 60

to  70  applications for one vacancy of head  of  department.

Among  the applicants, many are Ph.D and M.Sc degree holders.

As  such, I  feel that the slowing down of the US economy  or

the possible recession will    have great impact on the world

economy, including Singapore's economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one observation which warrants our attention.

When  I  was  talking  to the entrepreneurs  in  the  Silicon

Valley, they did not think the conservative economic ideas of

the  new US administration would be able to solve the present

economic crisis faced by the United States of America.   That

being  the case, we should pay more attention to the  changes

in  the  US  economy, and monitor closely the  progress  over

there.   Perhaps,  we should consider putting   part  of  our

economic development plan on the two major economies in Asia,

namely,  flourishing China and the potentially viable  India.

In  my view, hitherto, our investments in these two countries

and  our  understanding  of  their cultural  backgrounds  are

grossly inadequate.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 173</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased with the tax reduction and rebates

announced  in  the  Budget.  These will benefit  Singaporeans

from all stations of life as well as the business community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduction in corporate tax is the general trend in the

whole globalised economy.  The biggest piece of good news  to

the business community is the reduction of corporate tax from

25.5% to 24.5%.  To maintain our  competitive edge,  it would

be absolutely necessary to carry on cutting our corporate tax

in the next few years.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the individual tax, with effect from YA 2002,

the  Government will reduce the rate of individual income tax

by  2% to 5% and the top income bracket will be reduced  from

28% to 26%.  This is a wise move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has continued to help the low income

group  by ways of rebates and reduction in rental, utilities,

and  S&C charges.  This means that when we have succeeded  in

our  economic  development,  we do  not  neglect  those  less

fortunate  and elderly people.  We also provide opportunities

for  them to be trained and retrained.  The Minister has also

put  forward  many measures to stimulate our  commercial  and

business community.  These include the employee stock  option

scheme.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1st April onwards, the gains made by this scheme

will  be tax exempt for the first $2,000.  Thereafter, a  tax

of  25%  will be levied on the other gains with a cap  of  $1

million.  This measure will stimulate the enterprises and the

enterpreneurs.   I  feel that the Government  is  still  very

conservative in this scheme.  I hope that the Government will

be   bolder   and   faster  to  approve  the   entrepreneur's

application for such a scheme so that their employees will be

able to enjoy the gains under this scheme earlier.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I support the motion.

<br><br><!-- Dr Teo Ho Pin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Teo Ho Pin (Sembawang):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker, Sir, I

rise  in  support of the motion as proposed  by  the  Finance

Minister.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 174</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's Budget is indeed a good Budget filled with

goodies  for  everyone.  It is a Budget  aimed  at  nurturing

Singaporeans and our businesses to transit into a  knowledge-based economy.  The Budget will provide a boost for Singapore

to  position  itself in the new economy.  It will  also  help

Singaporeans to prepare themselves for global competition.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a small country with limited resources, Singapore has

no  choice  but to continually carve out niches  to  position

itself  in an increasing seamless global market.  Development

of  human  capital  has  always been  our  main  focus.   The

Government  continues  to  invest heavily  in  educating  our

young, and upgrading the skills of our workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we are constantly chasing global trends, we must

not forget those who may encounter difficulty to keep pace of

the  changes.  Every effort must be made to help these fellow

Singaporeans feel at home in Singapore.  Otherwise, dichotomy

will  occur  in  our  population, thus weakening  our  social

fabric.  Thus, the key challenge facing the Government is  to

develop  a  globally competitive workforce, and at  the  same

time  continue  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  of   all

Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this year's Budget is a generous one, I am sure

the  Government can do more to help small consumers and small

businesses.   This  is  particularly  so  for  many   working

Singaporeans  who  had suffered CPF cuts over  the  last  two

years.  Small  and medium enterprises (SMEs) have  also  been

badly  affected  by  the financial crisis  and  globalisation

trends.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like to propose the following measures for

nurturing  small consumers and SMEs to transit into  the  new

economy:-

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On personal tax and GST rebate, the cut of income tax

rates  and  one-off  income tax rebate  of  10%  have  indeed

lowered  the tax burden of many workers.  A comparison  among

low,  middle  and  high-income earners shows that  low-income

earners  (those earning $35,000 per annum) will enjoy  a  tax

saving of $175

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 175</b></font><br><br>

while the middle income (those earning $50,000 per annum) and

high-income  earners (those earning $100,000  annual  income)

will  have $375 and $1,775 tax savings respectively.  As  all

income  earners  suffer a flat rate of $250 GST  rebate  cut,

this  has drastically reduced the income tax saving  of  low-income earners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, whether you are a low or high-income earner, you

still  pay the same price for a cup of coffee and a  bowl  of

noodles.   The  increasing  cost  of  living  has  put   much

financial  burden on many small consumers.  It affects  their

quality  of  life.  I hope the Finance Minister can  consider

more  innovative  ways to give out tax  rebates,  which  will

benefit low-income earners.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good example to follow is the National Wages Council

which   recommends  a  fixed  and  variable  salary  increase

mechanism to help low-income earners.  Income tax rebate  can

also  have  both a fixed sum rebate and a percentage  cut  to

motivate all our workers.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for S&C and utilities rebates, we should extend the

benefits to HDB Executive flat residents and retirees  living

in private estates.  Some Singaporeans in these groups do not

enjoy  much benefit from income tax rebates or other  relief.

For example, in Woodlands New Town, we have quite a number of

multi-tier  families  staying in jumbo HDB  Executive  flats.

These residents have made efforts to stay together as one big

family  so  as  to look after their parents.  But,  they  are

always being left with not much rebate when Government shares

its surplus.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Widow Fund, the competitive society and cost of

living  in  Singapore have made life very difficult  for  one

group  of  Singaporeans, that is, widows.  Families that  are

struck  with  disaster, such as death, or  major  illness  of

their  sole  bread-winners, usually encounter much difficulty

to  raise their families thereafter.  Their quality  of  life

deteriorates  very quickly and their children's education  is

badly affected.  A widow with two or more children to support

will face grave

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 176</b></font><br><br>

difficulty  to balance between work and family.  There  is  a

drastic  lack  of communal support facilities and  affordable

family service centers to help these families.  I would  urge

the Government to consider setting up a Widow Fund to provide

special  assistance  to these disadvantaged  families.   This

will  provide  a  level playing field for their  children  to

succeed in life.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present assistance schemes provided by the CDCs and

various  constituencies  are  inadequate  to  alleviate   the

financial  burden faced by widows.  Very often, the financial

assistance is short-term and does not alleviate the long-term

financial  burden of widows.  I would urge the Government  to

show  more  compassion to widows, and help them to live  life

more  comfortably.  My sympathy and admiration  goes  to  all

widows  who  make untiring sacrifices for their  children  to

succeed in life.  Sir, they deserve special attention.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On subsidy for pre-school education, in the past, the

Government  has  taken  a position that pre-school  education

should  be  left  to the private sector, and  thus  not  much

support  was given to pre-school operators.  However,  recent

findings  have  shown  that  pre-school  education  plays   a

critical  role  in nurturing young minds to be well  equipped

for mainstream education.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, children in mainstream education enjoy subsidized

education while those in pre-school centres pay market  rates

ranging  from $25 to about $800 per month.  This  has  placed

much  financial burden on families with two or more children.

If  the  Government  were to encourage Singaporeans  to  have

larger  families,  we  must provide  this  basic  support  of

subsidizing pre-school education.  This is in line  with  the

Government's focus on educating our young.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Eldercare and Medical Endowment Fund, the

contribution of $250 million to the Eldercare Fund  and  $100

million  to the Medical Endowment Fund is a welcomed move  in

view  of the fast ageing population.  The rising health  cost

in Singapore

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 177</b></font><br><br>

has  been  a  concern for many Singaporeans,  especially  the

elderly  and low-income earners.  Besides supporting  nursing

homes  and  medical bills of the lower-income individuals,  I

hope  the  funds  can also be used to provide free  community

ambulance  services  for the elderly and  primary  healthcare

services at the community.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October last year, the Ministry of Health implemented

a  pilot  Primary Care Partnership Scheme to contract private

clinics to serve needy elderly in the community.  This scheme

can  be expanded to provide a wider range of medical services

for the elderly.  The eligibility criteria should be reviewed

to  allow more elderly to qualify for the scheme.  The scheme

can  also  be extended to young children below the  schooling

age.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On nurturing small and medium businesses, local SMEs

play an important role in our economy.  They comprise 92%  of

the  total establishments in Singapore and employ 51% of  our

workforce.   In the knowledge-based economy, our  local  SMEs

will   continue  to  perform  a  vital  role   to   spearhead

Singapore's  globalisation efforts. But, the Government  must

be proactive to help local SMEs perform this role.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SME 21 plan is a step forward in building the

capabilities of our local SMEs.  But we need to identify  the

potential  of  SMEs  in the products and  services  industry.

More  efforts must be channelled to help SMEs that have  good

potential  to develop niches and position their products  and

services  in  the global marketplace.   More generous  grants

can be given to accelerate their globalisation efforts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback from local SMEs indicates that many of them are

facing  problems of high rental and labour cost in Singapore.

The cost of Government services and compliance cost have also

contributed  to the increased business costs.   In  order  to

position  local  SMEs in the new economy,  I  would  like  to

propose the following measures:

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 178</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Property Tax Cut

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cut in property tax and the removal of the existing

25%  property tax rebate in July 2001 will not help  much  in

reducing  business  costs.   SMEs, especially  owner-occupied

businesses,  expect a higher property tax cut to enable  them

to ride out the crisis.  Since the implementation of GST, the

tax  base of the Government has broadened.  It is about  time

that  the  Government seriously considered removing  property

tax  in  Singapore, especially for owner-occupied properties.

This would not only encourage asset ownership but also reduce

the  cost of businesses that invest in property for long-term

growth.   Our  taxation  policy  must  not  pose  unnecessary

hindrances to the growth of our local SMEs.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Reduction of National Development Expenditure

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year's budget has allocated a lower development

expenditure  for  the Ministry of National Development.   The

$500  million reduction in development expenditure will  have

an  adverse  impact  on the construction industry,  which  is

presently experiencing low workload.  The projected  slowdown

of HDB building programme will further aggravate the state of

the construction industry.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many local construction firms are HDB contractors and,

thus,  will not be able to secure enough contracts this  year

to   keep  their  workforce.   The  decrease  in  development

expenditure  will further dampen the industry,  resulting  in

more  job  losses.  There will be more intense and  unhealthy

competition   among  contractors,  leading   to   undesirable

consequences such as poor construction quality and safety.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Government is actively promoting sporting and

healthy lifestyle among Singaporeans, we should expedite  the

construction  of  park  connectors and  upgrading  of  sports

complexes.   Older design swimming pools should also  undergo

major  upgrading to keep abreast of new lifestyle aspirations

of  Singaporeans.   Sports complexes  can  be  upgraded  with

modern equipment, like

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 179</b></font><br><br>

those   of   the  California  Fitness  Centre,   to   attract

Singaporeans to keep fit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the construction industry is in need of assistance

to  get  out  of  the  crisis.  Many construction  firms  are

finding  it  difficult to survive in the present environment.

Unless  the Government steps in to assist, we may  lose  some

construction firms, including some construction  pioneers  of

Singapore.   This  will retard our efforts to  nurture  local

SMEs to be world-class companies.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the next few years will be testing years for

Singapore  as  we  transit from the old to the  new  economy.

Both  our  business community and people will be affected  in

one  way  or another in the transition.  We must continue  to

strive  to work hard together to cope with these changes.   I

believe  our concerted efforts will definitely bear  fruition

for future generations of Singaporeans.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must continue to support good governance to safeguard

our  future.   In a globalised environment, it is  even  more

crucial to have good governance to ensure that Singapore  can

thrive in the global world successfully.

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Jennifer Lee (Nominated Member):</b> Mr Deputy Speaker,

Sir,  I  join  others who have spoken already  in  expressing

appreciation  of the Minister for Finance's generous  Budget,

with  something in it for everyone - companies big and small,

and individuals across the board.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against the background of the Census Report 2000,

released last month on household income, it is good  to  note

that  we have not forgotten to specifically direct some small

measure  of assistance to those at the bottom of the economic

ladder  in the form of utilities and rental rebates,  and  in

the  structuring  of  CPF  top-ups,  such  that  lower-income

earners receive the highest payouts.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Census Report showed a widening of the income gap,

with those at the top 10% of households earning 36 times more

than those in the bottom 10%.  It has

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 180</b></font><br><br>

caused   a  significant  discussion,  as  indeed  it  should,

especially  in  the midst of concurrent recent soul-searching

about   what  it  means  to  be  Singaporean,  on  belonging,

rootedness  and values.  The Prime Minister, just  quoted  in

yesterday's  newspapers, said that  we  should  not  get  too

carried  away  in exaggerating both the width of  the  income

divide  or  its  consequences.  Certainly, at this  point  in

time, we are very far from being a society that is polarised,

with  a  group  of  very  rich who  indulge  in  ostentatious

consumption,  against  the  backdrop  of  large  numbers   of

desperately poor without even their most basic needs met.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, our short history has been one that has seen

large  numbers of Singaporeans, the majority, being  able  to

translate  their efforts and capabilities into much  improved

standards  of  living  for  themselves.   Nor  is  there  any

argument  with the Government's focus and policies to  ensure

that  we keep abreast of the challenges of globalisation,  of

its philosophy of leveraging upwards, giving its attention to

how  to  support and facilitate enterprise and talent at  the

top,  so  as  to generate benefits for the nation  at  large.

Nevertheless, I do believe that we should pause  to  look  at

the  widening  income gap and review if we are  indeed  doing

enough to ensure that we will continue to maintain our social

cohesion and build an even stronger national spirit.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addressing the income divide, there are two main

issues  that  are  cause for concern.  The  two  issues  are,

firstly,  ensuring access to education and training that  are

critical to providing all Singaporeans the opportunity to  do

better  for  themselves  and,  secondly,  providing  adequate

assistance  and  support to those who are struggling  at  the

bottom  of  the  income  ladder.  These  two  issues  are  of

particular  relevance to four groups of people:  the  elderly

poor,  women, the large group of older and unskilled workers,

and  the  present and future school children from  low-income

households.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an education system that produces sterling

examination results and

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 181</b></font><br><br>

sees   our   children  winning  accolades  at   international

mathematics and science competitions.  These are our kids  at

the top.  But does our system give enough support to the kids

at  the bottom, particularly those whose home environment may

afford  them  hardly the bare essentials?  That education  is

the   bridge   across  the  income  divide   is   clear   and

unquestionable.   Another quick look  at  the  Census  Report

shows  clearly  the  difference that just  one  member  of  a

household  having  a  higher level of educational  attainment

makes to those households' average income.  It is imperative,

therefore, that children of the lower income households  have

not  only the opportunity to be in school, but a little extra

attention,  where necessary, to make up for what support  may

be  lacking in difficult home circumstances, so that they may

have  a  good  shot at better opportunities in  life  in  the

future.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, for the large pool of older unskilled

workers,  retraining  and  upgrading  of  their  skills   are

critical  and, in this area, the Government has been devoting

significant  attention and resources.  However,  response  to

skills  upgrading programmes could be much more satisfactory,

and  work  must continue to be done to see how  this  can  be

improved.  Apart from those for whom the issue is simply that

of  poor  attitude,  what  are the  obstacles  hindering  the

participation of the others?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the elderly, we must look at both those who are

already  currently  in  their retirement  years  as  well  as

preparing  for  the aging of our population of baby  boomers.

The  IMC  on the aging population in 1999 devoted one segment

of   its  report  to  planning  for  financial  security   in

retirement.  For those already 65 years and above, it is  too

late  to be talking about financial planning, and our efforts

must  be to see how we can help those who need assistance  to

access  it.  These are the citizens in our midst who  do  not

know what help is available, do not know how or are too frail

or otherwise incapable of accessing available assistance.

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 182</b></font><br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent information on the almost 200,000

Singaporeans  who missed the opportunity of  benefiting  from

the  first tranche of CPF top-up is an illustration of  this.

23%  of them were over 65 years of age, probably without  CPF

accounts  in  the first place, unaware of the scheme  or  the

necessity  to deposit $100 in the qualifying period,  or  too

poor to spare the amount.  Our CPF top-up is the best way  to

share  some of the economic surpluses during good  years  for

the  country.   Would  the  working  majority  begrudge  some

portion  of the goodies being shared with those who  have  no

CPF  accounts, particularly if they are the older  generation

who contributed in the past, or women whose contributions are

not in the labour force?

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, could we go beyond the current structuring of

payouts  to further direct the money where it is most needed?

For  the people in the top 20%, could we implement an  opt-in

scheme   to  indicate  that  they  want  their  $500  top-up,

otherwise that money would be re-directed for disbursement to

the  bottom  20%?  The amount could mean very little  to  one

group and be significant to the other, and it would be a good

way to demonstrate concern and support across the divide.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach of looking at various ways of enhancing

Singaporeans'   financial  planning  for  their   retirement,

through  their CPF savings, assumes that people  have  enough

savings   available  to  spare  in  the  first  place.    The

Supplementary  Retirement Scheme, the details of  which  were

also recently announced, is such an example.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there is a large group of Singaporeans, the 47%

of women who are not in the labour force, ie, the homemakers,

and  who  therefore have no CPF accounts, who will presumably

have  to rely entirely on their children to provide for them,

since  they are most likely to survive their spouses.   These

women  work; only their work is unpaid labour, done at  home.

Would our economy be able to hum and grow as it has, if there

was not all that work being done every

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 183</b></font><br><br>

day  in homes all through the island to keep our workers  fed

and  rested,  and our children cared for?  These  women  will

also grow old and add to the households with retirees without

income  that form the bottom 10%.  We must find  a  means  to

register  and  reward their contribution so that,  when  they

grow old, they do not then find that, after the many years of

contribution, they are reduced to feeling that  they  survive

only on the generosity of society.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is one other group that has an important

part to play in any discussion on the income divide, and this

is  the group at the top, who are of concern for two reasons.

Firstly,  they  may be moved to give something  back  to  the

society that has enabled their development and progress,  and

contribute their skills and abilities as well as some portion

of  their  material wealth in helping the further advancement

of  the  nation  and  the  welfare of its  less  well-endowed

citizens.   And,  secondly, that they will remain  rooted  to

Singapore in the face of the

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 184</b></font><br><br>

many opportunities open to them anywhere else in the world.

<div align="center"><h4></h4></div>

<div align="center"><b>ANALYSIS OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROFILE</b></div>

<br><br><!-- Dr Jennifer Lee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Dr Jennifer Lee</b> asked the Minister for Education (a)

whether  an  analysis  has been done  of  the  socio-economic

profile,  as  measured by household income, housing  type  or

other  relevant  indicators, of students in  (i)  the  Gifted

Education Programme (GEP), (ii) the Express Stream, (iii) the

Normal   Stream,   (iv)  the  polytechnics,   and   (v)   the

universities; (b) if so, what is the profile; and (c) if not,

does  his Ministry intend to do such an analysis to determine

how  successful  or  otherwise we have been  in  helping  the

younger generation from the lower income groups break out  of

the poverty trap.

<br><br><!-- RAdm Teo Chee Hean -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>RAdm Teo Chee Hean:</b>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;59% of secondary school students live in HDB 4-room or

smaller  flats. Currently 16% of GEP students, 52% of Express

Stream  students, and 72% of Normal Stream students  live  in

HDB  4-room  or  smaller  flats. We  currently  do  not  have

complete  data on the socio-economic profile of our  students

in the tertiary institutions.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data above shows that our education system, based on

meritocracy,   provides   a  range   of   opportunities   for

educational advancement to all students  according  to  their

aptitudes  and abilities irrespective of their socio-economic

background.   While  it  is possible  to  make  opportunities

available,   equalising  opportunities  will   not   equalise

outcomes.   That  89% of students now obtain  post  secondary

education,  a  figure  that  compares  favourably  even  with

developed countries in the OECD, indicates that the education

system  does  provide opportunities for the vast majority  of

students  to secure good jobs in a modern economy  and  avoid

impoverishment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure that all children in Singapore can benefit

from  our education system, general education is almost fully

subsidised  by the Government.  Parents are only required  to

pay miscellaneous fees as a contribution towards the cost  of

materials  used  by  pupils in the  schools,  and  subsidised

school fees in secondary schools and JC/CIs.  There is also a

Financial  Assistance Scheme which pupils  from  lower-income

households can apply for.  School fees for pupils under  this

scheme  are  waived.  The scheme also offers  exemption  from

payment  of  miscellaneous fees, except for  a  portion  that

parents  have  to co-pay.  Needy students under  this  scheme

also  receive free textbooks.  Needy pupils can also  receive

additional assistance and bursaries from schemes administered

by  their  schools and community organisations  such  as  the

Community Development Councils and Family Services Centres.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, under the Edusave Pupils Fund, every 1st to

3rd  born  child between the ages of 6-16 receives an  annual

contribution  to  his/her  Edusave  account.   In  2001,  the

Government  contributed  $160  to  the  Edusave  account   of

eligible  pupils.   Pupils  can use  the  money  to  pay  for

enrichment  programmes  or  pay  for  a  portion   of   their

miscellaneous  fees.   As a special encouragement  to  pupils

from  more  modest backgrounds, Edusave merit  bursaries  are

granted  to  those in the top 25% who were not  eligible  for

Edusave scholarships.
