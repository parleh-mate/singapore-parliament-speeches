<div align="center"><b>SAFETY EQUIPMENT FOR WORKERS</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Legislation for compulsory use to minimise industrial accidents)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ho Kah Leong</b> asked the Minister for Labour

if  he  will  introduce  legislation  to  make  it

compulsory for workers to use the necessary safety

equipment in the course of employment,  so  as  to

minimise industrial accidents.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 370</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, it is not necessary to introduce

further  legislation  to make  it  compulsory  for

workers  to use the necessary safety equipment  in

the  course of their employment so as to  minimise

industrial accidents, because such a provision  is

already  contained in section 69 of the  Factories

Act which stipulates as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No person employed in a factory or in any other

place  to  which any provisions of this Act  apply

shall wilfully interfere with or misuse any means,

appliance, convenience or other thing provided  in

pursuance  of  this Act for securing  the  health,

safety  or welfare of the persons employed in  the

factory or place, and where any means or appliance

for  securing health or safety is provided for the

use  of  any such person under this Act, he  shall

use the means or appliance.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who contravenes section 69 of the Act

shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $500 or to

imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months

or  to  both such penalties. Although vested  with

the  powers of prosecution under section 69 of the

Act,  the Ministry has yet to invoke this  section

against any workers for two reasons. Firstly,  the

Factory  Inspectorate of the  Ministry  was  until

recently  understaffed, and strict enforcement  of

the Act was therefore not possible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second, and more important, reason is that

it  is  better to inculcate in the workers a sense

of  safety  consciousness  through  education  and

persuasion.  Towards this end, appeals  have  been

made   both  inside  and  outside  Parliament   to

employers   and  employees  to  observe   strictly

various safety rules and regulations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 371</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Factory Inspectorate, through its

newsletters, has been harping on the tune that  it

is  only  through  the concerted  efforts  of  the

workers, the employers and the Government that  we

can  hope  to  cut  down the  rate  of  industrial

accidents. The National Trades Union Congress, the

National   Safety   First   Council   and    other

organisations  have  also  supported  this   call.

However,  these  appeals have apparently  achieved

very  little  or  no  result,  as  the  number  of

industrial  accidents due to the  irresponsibility

of the employers and the negligence of the workers

has not shown any sign of a decrease.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently, my Ministry will commence action

to  prosecute both employers and employees if they

contravene the provisions of the Factories Act  or

any  regulations made thereunder. I would like  to

enlist  the support of every Member of this  House

when we take this stern but necessary action so as

to  protect the welfare, health and safety of  the

workers.



<br><br><!-- Mr Teong Eng Siong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Teong Eng Siong (Sembawang)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): May I ask the Minister how many Factory Inspectors

have  been recruited this year? Also, how do  they

go  about  inspecting the factories  in  order  to

understand   the   conditions   and   the   safety

arrangements therein?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I have

not  got  the figures with me, but I should  think

that  roughly a dozen new Factory Inspectors  have

been  employed  this year. Many of them  have,  in

fact,  been appointed only recently and  they  are

still  undergoing training. So their effectiveness

will  not be as expected. But, nevertheless,  they

are  making their rounds now, and when we commence

action against the employers and the employees,  I

am  quite  sure there will be some effect  on  the

rate of industrial accidents.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim (Kallang):</b> Will the

Minister  see  to it that only approved  types  of

safety equipment are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 372</b></font><br><br>



issued  and at the expense of the employers?  This

should be made compulsory.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> We do advise employers that

all  safety equipment should, as far as  possible,

be  of  the  type  recommended or  tested  by  the

Singapore  Institute of Standards  and  Industrial

Research. I think it is only reasonable  that  the

employers should provide safety equipment  to  the

workers free of charge.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> Can the Minister point

out to me which part of the Factories Act makes it

compulsory   for   employers   to   issue   safety

equipment, other than the Building Operations  and

Works  of Engineering Construction Regulations  of

1970? If the employers will not issue it, how  can

the workers use it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> Where the employers have

failed to provide the safety equipment, then  they

will be prosecuted, not the workers. But where the

employers have provided the safety equipment  but,

for  some  reason  or another,  the  workers  have

refused  to  use  it,  then the  workers  will  be

penalised.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> The Factories Act does

not say what industry or what occupation except-



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> We have 26 Questions today.

Perhaps  the  Member can submit  another  Question

later on for answer.



<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim:</b> I think it is of the

utmost importance that this question be answered.



<br><br><!-- Mr N. Govindasamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr N. Govindasamy:</b> The last question then.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ong Pang Boon:</b> I think, for a start, we will

probably begin with the building industry and also

industries  like ship-repairing where the  workers

will  be  working  under hazardous  and  dangerous

conditions.

<div align="center"><b>TRAFALGAR ESTATE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Development plans)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for

Communications  what  plans his  Ministry  has  to

develop Trafalgar Estate which formerly housed the

Trafalgar  Receiving  Station;  and  whether   the

residents, who have been living in the Estate  for

many  years,  will  be given Temporary  Occupation

Licences  to continue to live there and  to  enjoy

the  amenities  such as water and electricity  and

better roads.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Communications (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, Trafalgar Station used

to be a high frequency radio receiving station. As

such, it was sensitive to electrical interference.

Thus it was necessary to impose conditions on  the

distribution  of  electricity  supplies  when  the

Station   was  functioning.  However,  the   radio

services  operating from this Station  have  since

1st  June, 1971, been transferred to operate  from

our Yio Chu Kang Station. There is, therefore,  no

necessity  now  to  place any restriction  on  the

provision   of  amenities  such  as   the   public

utilities   and  better  roads  to   the   present

residents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my Ministry has yet no plans for the

Trafalgar site, the residents who have been living

there  for  many  years may  remain  on  Temporary

Occupation Licences until the site is required for

development.

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Education (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Govindasamy, our records show that more than 97

<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, the Ministry of Finance has

been  asked  to  provide Jurong with  a  secondary

school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, of course, only one primary school in

Jurong  and  this is not big enough to accommodate

all  the  primary  pupils  living  there.  As   an

emergency  measure to solve the demand for  school

places  in  1972, the Jurong Town  Primary  School

will   be   expanded  by  the  addition   of   six

prefabricated classrooms to be undertaken  by  the

School  Advisory Committee with funds provided  by

the Committee and the School Fund Income Account.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Kah Leong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho Kah Leong (Jurong)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): May I

ask  when  a  secondary school will  be  built  in

Jurong Town? The Minister has not replied to  this

question yet.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> We have asked the Ministry of

Finance to provide Jurong with a secondary school.

As  to when this will be completed, it will depend

very  much  upon how soon the money will  be  made

available.

<div align="center"><b>PRIVATE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(Regulations to protect students' interests)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr J. F. Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr J. F. Conceicao</b> asked the Minister for

Education  whether there are adequate  regulations

governing the conduct of private, commercially-run

educational  institutions,  to  ensure  that   the

interests of their students are fully protected.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 375</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Sir, the Education Act, 1970,

and the School Regulations, 1957, contain adequate

provisions  for regulating the conduct of  private

commercial educational institutions to ensure that

the  interests  of their students  are  protected.

These  regulations provide, inter  alia,  that  no

private   school  shall  operate   until   it   is

registered and registration is granted  only  when

the syllabuses, the qualifications of teachers and

the  rates  of  fees have been approved,  and  the

health  and safety regulations have been  complied

with.  However,  in the past, some private  school

operators   circumvented   the   regulations    by

registering  their school as a business  with  the

Registrar   of   Business  Names   and   commenced

operations without applying for registration as  a

school.  Arrangements  have  been  made  with  the

Registrar  of  Business Names not to register  any

private  school as a business until  it  has  been

registered as a school.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also true, Sir, that in the past some

unscrupulous   private   school   operators   have

exploited  unsuspecting students eager to  acquire

certain skills. A case in point was the Academy of

Technical  Studies  in Thomson Road  which  closed

down  after  a brief spell of operation  when  the

principal  absconded with the fees collected  from

the  students.  The supervisor of the  school  has

agreed  to  make  full  restitution  of  the  fees

collected and the police are still inquiring  into

the matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Ministry will in future exercise tighter

control    in    processing    applications    for

registration  of private schools  to  ensure  that

only  bona  fide  schools will be registered.  Any

private school violating the Education Act and the

Schools  Regulations will be deregistered and,  if

necessary, its sponsors will be prosecuted.

Law and National Development (a) whether it is the

policy  of  the Housing and Development  Board  to

altered.



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> Sir, it is generally the policy of

the  Housing  and  Development Board  to  evict  a

tenant  if  a member of his household is convicted

of  an  offence which, if committed by the tenant,

would  result  in the tenant's eviction.  However,

eviction  is  only  imposed if the  offence  is  a

serious   one,  e.g.,  where  the  flat  is   used

illegally as a common gaming house, a brothel or a

den  in  which opium or ganja is smoked  or  other

drugs are used or kept, or where the tenant  or  a

member  of  his household assaults an official  of

the  Board.  In  most of these cases,  the  tenant

cannot surely disclaim liability altogether. It is

therefore  not  thought desirable  to  rescind  or

alter a policy which is imposed for the protection

of the majority of tenants.

of  officials  and / or members of the  Board  but

also  of members of the public, to consider  cases

of   proposed  evictions  and  to  review  appeals

against such evictions.

<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. <b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan</b> asked the Minister for

Health,  in  view of the possible brain-damage  to

babies, if his Ministry will consider banning  the

use   of   monosodium   glutamate   in   baby-food

preparations.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Sir,

the  Member  for  Whampoa  might  have  based  his

suggestion  that  monosodium glutamate  should  be

banned from baby-food preparations on a report  by

a  Dr  J.  W.  Olney,  an Assistant  Professor  of

Psychiatry at Washington University in St.  Louis,

that infant mice injected under the skin with



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



large  amounts  of  monosodium  glutamate  or  MSG

developed brain damage.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to explain here that Dr Olney's

conclusion   was  challenged   by   Mr   Oser,   a

biochemist,  who is also a member  of  the  United

States  National Academy of Science  Committee  on

Food  Protection. Mr Oser claimed that Dr  Olney's

observations  did  not have any relevance  to  the

question  of the safety of MSG as a food seasoning

agent  largely because the MSG was injected  under

the  skin  of  mice. The critical experiments,  he

said,  should  involve feeding MSG orally  to  the

animals. Dr Olney's experiments had also been done

by  using  doses far in excess of  what  has  been

normally used.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Expert Committee jointly formed by the Food

and  Agriculture Organisation and the World Health

Organisation  on Food Additives was, however,  not

able to evaluate the evidence and come to specific

conclusions in 1970. The report, which appeared in

the  W.H.O.  Technical Report, Series No.  445  at

page 20, paragraph 3.4 is as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Glutamic acid is a normal constituent of dietary

proteins  and  also occurs freely in many  natural

foods. It is itself used as a condiment and is  an

important  constituent of other  condiments  (e.g.

soy   sauce).  The  present  state  of   knowledge

concerning  monosodium  glutamate  was   reviewed.

Although  attention  has recently  been  drawn  to

adverse acute effects from ingestion of foods high

in  free glutamate content the Committee considers

that it is unable to advise any restriction on use

at  the present time. It was considered that self-limitation of intake of foods containing glutamate

by  susceptible  individuals  would  be  possible.

Since  there is a considerable amount of  work  in

progress  the  Committee postponed evaluations  of

this compound as a food additive until the results

of the current work are available.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Expert Committee reported a year later, in

1971,  that  although the weight of evidence  does

not   support   the  contention  that   monosodium

glutamate as an additive in the diet can  lead  to

brain damage in humans, caution is desirable.  The

food  manufacturers, however, have decided to play

it  safe. In 1969, the manufacturers of baby foods

in North America imposed a voluntary ban on it and

British firms followed later.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since these countries are the main sources of

baby  foods imported into Singapore, it would  not

be  necessary to take any other action with regard

to  banning  of  this additive in  baby  foods  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, if we are to ban the use of monosodium

glutamate in baby food preparations, the  relevant

question that will arise will be how effective  it

will  be in actual practice. Can we, for instance,

control its use in food preparations at home which

may  be  given  to  children and  babies?  Another

relevant question is that if it has ill effects on

the  brain  of humans, which is questionable,  why

should  the  restriction of its use be limited  to

baby foods only, since the human brain is known to

continue  development right up to  full  maturity,

which  is at the age of 20 to 25 years? Thus,  for

the move of banning it to be logical and effective

in  practice, you must ban it completely, that is,

by  banning its importation and manufacture, which

clearly does not merit it in this case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, in order to be on the cautious side,

all  our  Maternal and Child Health  Clinics  have

been  instructed  to  warn  mothers  against   the

excessive use of monosodium glutamate as  well  as

to  actively discourage them from using it at  all

when preparing baby foods.

<div align="center"><b>(Seizure of goods of hawkers who have committed offences)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for

Health   if   he  will  consider  the   issue   of

instructions to Hawker Inspectors not to take away

the  goods,  etc., of hawkers to  whom  they  have

issued notices of offence for causing obstruction.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, the

seizure  of  goods of hawkers who  have  committed

offences  is only resorted to in cases where  they

belong   to   incorrigible  hawkers   who   choose

persistently to flout the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In normal circumstances, the Hawker Inspectorate

only issue notices to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



offenders  for  committing an  offence  under  the

hawkers' law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law provides for seizure of goods in

addition to a fine, for certain good reasons,  for

example, to prevent hawkers selling at unspecified

sites  and  prohibited areas which invariably  are

areas which have been cleared of hawkers. It would

be extremely unfair to the hawkers who had vacated

the cleared areas if the authorities were to allow

new or other hawkers to occupy the places they had

vacated. Thus, in fairness, there should  be  very

much  heavier penalties, including the seizure  of

goods, for hawkers who persistently flout the  law

by hawking in cleared and prohibited areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, unless the Hawkers Department take firm

action,  including seizure of goods, against  such

offenders, they would not be doing justice to  the

hawker community as a whole and would be guilty of

abdicating their responsibilities.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng (Bras Basah):</b> Sir, how many times

has  a hawker to be served with notices of offence

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, that has

occurred  to  me  and  I can say  that  a  general

definition of what is termed "incorrigible" cannot

be  given.  Each case is interpreted  on  its  own

merits.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Has the Minister ever issued

notices of offence.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, as the

<div align="center"><b>HAWKING ON FIVE-FOOTWAYS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for

Health if he will, consider allowing hawkers to do

business on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



five-footway  along  North  Bridge  Road   between

Rochore Road and Bras Basah Road, if they  do  not

cause obstruction to pedestrians.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, five-footways are prohibited areas for hawking since

they  are, in fact, public foot-ways and are meant

for  the safe use of pedestrians. Allowing hawking

thereon  will not only force the pedestrians  onto

the roadway, thereby endangering their safety, but

will  also  hamper  the loading and  unloading  of

goods  to and from the shops on both sides of  the

road.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, if we are to allow hawking on the

five-f  footways  along North  Bridge  Road  which

invariably   form  the  frontage  of   shops,   as

suggested by the Member for Bras Basah,  we  would

be condoning unfair competition to the shopkeepers

from  the hawkers. Not only has the shopkeeper  to

pay  rental  for his shop premises in addition  to

the  shop  licence  fees  which  puts  him  at   a

disadvantage,  but also the hawker, by  displaying

his  wares in front of the shop, has the advantage

of attracting the attention of the customers first

and  thereby  unfairly depriving the shop  of  its

business.  I am wondering whether, in  making  the

suggestion of allowing hawking along North  Bridge

Road, the Member for Bras Basah has considered the

legitimate interests of the shopkeepers there  who

are also his constituents.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am afraid it is often forgotten that as a

Government   it  is  our  duty,  when  formulating

policies  and implementing measures, to take  into

consideration  the  legitimate  interests  of  all

sections   of   the  public,  whether   they   are

pedestrians or other road users, householders  and

shopkeepers, and not only those of hawkers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the whole length of North Bridge Road

is a cleared area which is prohibited for hawking.

It  would clearly be a retrograde step if  hawkers

were  to be permitted to return to the site  which

had been cleared.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Sir, from the answer of the

Minister,  am  I correct in saying that,  firstly,

the Minister must have been



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



informed  by  the shopkeepers that their  business

has been taken away by the hawkers who are selling

on the five footways, and that this is unfair? How

many complaints has he received so far?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, if the hawkers do not cause

obstruction  to  the  pedestrians,  will  they  be

allowed to do their business on the five-footways?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, as for

the  first supplementary question, may I say  that

the matter does not need to be complained upon. It

is just common sense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the second question whether the

hawkers will be allowed to do business on the five-footways  if  they  do not cause obstruction,  the

answer  has  already been given. It is  "no",  for

various reasons which have already been given.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> I agree with the Minister that

the  answer  is  "no", but before  removing  these

hawkers  from the five-footways, will he consider,

on humanitarian grounds, providing some other site

for them before he takes action against them?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> I must say that this is not a

supplementary question arising from  the  original

question.  With regard to providing an alternative

site,  this is a long story. I believe the  policy

of  the Ministry of Health is quite clear, that we

are  providing alternative sites for  hawkers  who

have   been   registered  in  the  hawker   survey

conducted in 1968/69.

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, as stated

in my previous answer, the whole length of North

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is further not possible to permit hawkers to

sell  along  this  stretch  of  the  road  without

causing  serious obstruction to the free  flow  of

traffic and endangering the safety of pedestrians.

This   will   be   particularly  so   during   the

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is suggested, however, that if the hawkers

vacant  pitches  in prescribed  hawkers  sites  at

Liang  Seah Street, Purvis Street and Seah  Street

to   safeguard   Singapore's  external   reserves,

including  the external reserves backing  for  the

Singapore  dollar,  were  taken  even  before  the

present  crisis occurred. We have  for  some  time

followed  a  policy of diversifying  our  reserves

into assets denominated in various currencies.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since U.S, dollars are not a major component of

our  external reserves, our calculations show that

we  will  not suffer a loss and that we  shall  be

able  to  maintain the total value of our external

assets  expressed  in Singapore dollars,  or  even

show a slight profit.

<div align="center"><b>(Conversion into gold)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for

Finance (a) whether it is feasible to convert most

of  Singapore's  foreign  currency  reserves  into

gold,  since the Republic's currency is backed  by

100 per cent gold; and (b) what steps he is taking

or  will  take  to  protect the  Singapore  dollar

against any eventual loss.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, part (b) of this question has

been answered already. With regard to part (a)  of

the  question, the Member for Punggol is  probably

aware  that the official price of gold as  against

the free market price of gold has remained at U.S.

$35  per ounce for over 30 years. It was, however,

difficult in the past, and impossible now that the

United   States  has  closed  the   "window"   for

converting the U.S, dollar into gold, to buy  gold

at  this  price. Even if gold can be so  acquired,

there  is  some  disadvantage in holding  most  of

Singapore's external reserves in gold. Gold stored

in  vaults does not earn any income - and in  fact

storage   and   security   costs   are   incurred.

Nevertheless,  we do believe that we  should  hold

some  part  of  our reserves in gold.  It  is  not

correct  in  saying that the Singapore  dollar  is

backed  100 per cent by gold. Our currency backing

is  in  the  form of gold and in foreign  exchange

reserves,  and  these reserves  have  enabled  the

Currency Board to earn over SS21 million  for  the

year  ended  31st December, 1970.  As  long  as  a

policy  of  diversification  is  pursued  and   we

respond  quickly to world monetary trends,  it  is

not necessary to hold all of Singapore's assets in

gold.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, can the

Minister  of  State  for Finance  enlighten  this

House  with  more  details and  state  the  total

amount of Singapore's foreign currency reserves?



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim:</b> Sir, I think the Member is

referring to our total reserves and not just  our

currency backing in foreign assets. The total  of

our  foreign assets exceeds S$3,800 million. Just

over  40  per  cent of this is  in  the  form  of

Sterling assets, while the balance is composed of

gold  and  various other holdings denominated  in

U.S, dollars,  German marks,  Japanese  yen  and

Swiss francs, etc.

<br><br><!-- Inche Abdul Aziz Karim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23. <b>Inche Abdul Aziz Karim</b> asked the

Minister  for  Finance  if  the  Government  will

establish  a fund from which loans at  reasonable

rates  of interest can he given to civil servants

to  meet  funeral,  medical and other  legitimate

expenses.



<br><br><!-- Mr Tang See Chim -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Tang See Chim (for the Minister for Finance):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, There are already more than

10  cooperative thrift and loan societies in  the

public  service, including some run by registered

trade   unions,   which  exist   principally   to

encourage  thrift  and  grant  loans   to   civil

servants  who  are in genuine need  of  financial

assistance   in  circumstances  including   those

mentioned by the Member for Kallang. In addition,

personal advances on salaries have been given  to

civil servants in special circumstances where the

merits  of the case justify the granting of  such

advance.  For  instance, there have  been  cases,

amongst  others,  where  personal  advances  were

granted to officers to meet medical expenses  and

tuition fees for courses undertaken on their own.

These  cases should continue to be considered  on

their individual merits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not, therefore, proposed to formalise any

Government  loan scheme, as loans  under  such  a

scheme may be taken for granted and would, in due

course,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



encourage improvidence and discourage savings and

membership   of   co-operative   societies.   The

necessity of putting aside some savings  for  the

rainy  day  is  one  which should  be  especially

emphasised for civil servants.

how  many  more cases of indebtedness  are  under

were  reported  to the Public Service  Commission

for    disciplinary   action   on   account    of

indebtedness. Of these cases, 35 are still  under

investigation. The penalties imposed  in  respect

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present regulations, an officer is

liable  to  disciplinary action with  a  view  to

way.   The  ultimate  penalty  of  dismissal   is

inflicted  in  cases where, in  addition  to  the

indebtedness, the officer's work and conduct  are

not  altogether satisfactory or where the officer

is a known habitual borrower. In all other cases,

the    penalty   imposed   depends    upon    the

circumstances in which

<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



to  introduce a Bill intituled "An Act  to  amend

the  Customs Act (Chapter 133 of the 1970 Revised

Edition)".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill read the First time.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Printed copies of the Bill distributed to

Members.



<br><br>

<div align="center"><b>Second Reading</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I beg to

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, under section 17 of the Customs Act a

special  tax is levied on diesel-engine  vehicles

operating  in  the  Republic.  There  have   been

several  instances in the past  where  owners  of

diesel-engine vehicles have failed to  pay  their

taxes  promptly and have allowed  such  taxes  to

fall into arrears.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the object of the present Bill is to

empower  the  Registrar of  Vehicles  to  recover

arrears  of  the special tax payable  on  diesel-engine  vehicles by the seizure and sale of  such

vehicles. This amendment is required because,  as

the  law  now stands, only goods of a  perishable

nature  or  any animal or bird seized  under  the

provisions  of  the  Customs  Act  may  be   sold

forthwith  and the proceeds of the sale  held  to

abide the result of any claim.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the present amendment also provides

that the proceeds from the disposal of any seized

vehicle may be used to offset against any licence

fees  and  other  taxes due and owing  under  any

other  written  law  in  respect  of  the  seized

vehicle, and the balance thereof, if any, will be

refunded to the owner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment also provides that where the

vehicle   is   a  public  service  vehicle,   the

Registrar  of  Vehicles may use,  or  permit  any

other persons to use, the vehicle for the purpose

of  maintaining  an  essential  public  transport

service,  upon such terms and conditions  as  the

Registrar  may determine until such time  as  the

vehicle  can be sold. This provision is necessary

to   ensure  minimum  disruption  to  the  public

transport  system  should  any  difficulty  arise

which may result in the delay of the sale of  the

vehicle.

<br><br>3.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Employment Act stands at present, no

provisions   have   been  provided   therein   to

safeguard the rights of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



the    workers    vis-a-vis   their   retirement,

retrenchment  or  other  similar  benefits.  Such

benefits  are  usually agreed  upon  between  the

employer and the workers in collective agreements

whereby  the  employer agrees to pay gratuity  or

other  sums  of  money  to  the  workers  on  the

termination of the latter's services. However, it

has  been  discovered that in  the  event  of  an

employer's company or business being in financial

difficulties  or  is wound up or  foreclosed,  no

legal  protection is afforded to the  workers  to

recover their gratuity or other benefits provided

in the collective agreements. Such a situation is

clearly  untenable, because it is  not  right  or

just that these workers, having put in long years

of  faithful  service, are suddenly denied  their

right to the entitlement of the gratuity or other

benefits through no fault of their own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, proposed that the Employment

Act  be  amended  to  ensure  that  the  workers'

expectations    of   receiving   some    monetary

compensation  to tide over their  twilight  years

are   not   needlessly  dashed  by  circumstances

outside their control.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment to section 45 of the Act will

ensure that, in the event of the employer winding

up  his  company or business, the rights  of  the

workers  to  gratuity  and other  benefits  would

attract  priority of payment over other unsecured

debts. That is to say, when a company is wound up

or  foreclosed, the payments due to the employees

in  respect of retirement, retrenchment or  other

such  benefits  would  be payable  in  the  first

instance  before  the claims of  other  unsecured

creditors are met.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also seeks to rectify another anomaly

currently  found  in the Act. Subsection  (2)  of

section  95  of  the Act provides  for  maternity

benefit  entitlement to a female workman who  has

worked for an employer for not less than 180 days

within   the   period  of  one  year  immediately

preceding    her   confinement.   The   maternity

allowance  payable under this section is  at  the

rate of $4 a day



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



or  at  her  ordinary rate of pay  for  one  day,

whichever  is less during the benefit period.  It

would appear that this restriction on the maximum

of  $4  a day is outdated and unfair in the light

of  the  present-day wage structure and  economic

conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a survey on wages carried out by my

Ministry,  it  has  been found  that  in  several

industries  a  large  number  of  female   manual

workers are already in receipt of more than $4  a

day  as  wages. We are of the view that  where  a

female workman is paid more than $4 a day,  there

is no reason why she should not be entitled to  a

full day's pay whilst on maternity leave. It  is,

therefore, proposed to remove the maximum of $4 a

day set in the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

no provision is made for the payment of a gratuity

every  such  collective agreement or award  shall,

notwithstanding anything contained in any  written

law  or  rule  of law or collective  agreement  or

provision  that  in  the  event  of  the  employer

ceasing  to carry on business for whatever  reason

an  employee  who  ceases to be  employed  by  the

employer  by  reason of the happening  of  such  a

contingency shall be paid such sum of money as  he

would  have  been  entitled to receive  under  the

terms  of the collective agreement or award if  he

had  retired  from the service of the employer  on

the day the employer ceases to carry on business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The provisions of subsection (2) of this

section shall not apply where an employer has  set

up  a  fund  under  a scheme for  the  payment  of

pensions, gratuities,  provident  fund  or  other

superannuation benefits to his employees on  their

retirement  from  the  service  of  the   employer

whereby  under  such scheme the  benefits  of  the

employees shall be safeguarded in the event of the

bankruptcy of an employer or, if the employer is a

company,  on the winding up of the company  or  in

the  event  of the employer ceasing  to  carry  on

business for any other reason.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Any sum of money payable under subsection

(2)  of  this  section shall, for the purposes  of

subsection (1) of this section be deemed to  be  a

payment to an employee on his retirement and shall

be   included  among  the  debts  referred  to  in

paragraph (a) or (b) of that subsection.".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the amendment as now proposed is to provide

safeguards  to  employees  who  are  entitled   to

receive   retirement  benefits  under   collective

agreements or awards. As the Bill stands, such  an

employee  is not protected if his employer  ceases

to carry on business for whatever reason, since he

would  not  be  able to seek monetary compensation

for  the  number  of  years  of  faithful  service

rendered.  Such  a  situation  would  be  patently

unfair  and unjust to him. The proposed amendment,

therefore,  seeks  to  provide  that   where   the

services



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



of  an  employee are terminated on account of  his

employer ceasing to carry on business for whatever

reason, he would be entitled to receive, under the

terms of any collective agreement in force at  the

time   of   the   cessation   of   employment,   a

compensatory amount as if he had retired from  the

service  of  the employer on the day the  employer

ceases to carry on business.

Minister for Labour for having the interest of the

workers so close to heart. It can be seen from the

proposed  amendment that the retirement and  other

benefits  of the workers provided under collective

agreements  would be safeguarded  if  an  employer

were  to  cease  business.  It  is  as  a  further

safeguard  to provide such protection of  workers'

interests in the event of an employer transferring

the  whole or part of his undertaking or  property

that I beg to move,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 8 of new sub-clause (2), after

"reason,", to insert "or by reason of the employer

transferring the whole or part of his  undertaking

or property, as the case may be,".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendment to the amendment agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further amendments to the amendment made:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In line 13 of new sub-clause (2), after

"reason", to insert "or transferring the whole  or

part  of his undertaking or property, as the  case

may be,". [Mr Sia Khoon Seong].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>3.55 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Pang Boon (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Ong Pang Boon):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may recollect that my predecessor, in

moving  the Redundancy Payments Fund Bill in  this

House  on  25th January, 1968, cited the following

reasons  in  support  of the Bill.  I  quote  from

Hansard, Vol. 26, No. 16, col. 1111:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`On becoming redundant, most of the employees

will  get  a  sizable sum of money  as  redundancy

payments.   Many  of  them  are  unaccustomed   to

handling substantial sums of money at any one time

the  basic  aim of this legislation is  to  ensure

that  the  money they receive is not used unwisely

and in-judiciously, which will make them destitute

in  a  short  period  and  bring  them  and  their

families great distress.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past three years, nearly 18,000 base

workers  have  been retrenched  from  the  British

bases.  As  a result of the careful husbanding  of

their   redundancy  payments,   they   have   been

protected   from  acute  financial   distress   or

personal  hardship.  Further,  with  the   British

withdrawal nearing completion,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



the  nation  as  a  whole has not experienced  any

serious  social  upheaval or economic  dislocation

which  would have occurred if Government  had  not

acted to safeguard the interest of the workers and

their families. Yet the Act was criticised in some

quarters and accusations were hurled to the effect

that  the  redundancy payments  belonging  to  the

workers were taken away and used as revenue.  Time

has  shown that Government action in enacting  the

law  to  safeguard  redundancy payments  has  been

correct  and the sorry spectacle of workers  being

reduced  to  poverty after frittering  away  their

hard-earned money has been avoided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst previously the Redundancy Payments Fund

Act  was applied only to redundant workers, it  is

the  intention now to expand the coverage  of  the

Act.  The  proposed  amendment  will  enable   all

payments  made to the employee on the  termination

of  his services by reason of his employer ceasing

to  carry  on business for whatever reason  to  be

paid  to the Redundancy Payments Fund. This  would

enable  any payments made in respect of retirement

benefits  and other gratuities payable  under  the

terms  of a collective agreement or award  on  the

winding  up  of  the  company,  according  to  the

Employment  (Amendment) Bill  which  I  introduced

earlier,  to be paid into the Redundancy  Payments

Fund  instead of direct to the employee.  In  this

way,  the  Fund  can be used to  conserve  in  the

employee's best interest the money due to  him  on

the  termination of his services on account of his

employer ceasing to carry on business for whatever

reason  and  thus  prevent such money  from  being

unwisely dissipated.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the convention for an institution of

higher  learning to affix its common seal  to  its

degrees,  diplomas and certificates. The Singapore

Polytechnic  is no exception in this  use  of  the

common seal. However, at present section 10 of the

Singapore  Polytechnic Act requires two conditions

to  be  satisfied before the common  seal  can  be

affixed  to any instrument. Firstly, the  Chairman

or  a  member of the Board and the principal  will

have  to sign the instrument. Secondly, these same

persons  will  both  have to be  present  together

while  the  seal is being affixed.  Therefore,  in

affixing   the   common  seal  to  the   Singapore

Polytechnic  diplomas  and  certificates,  certain

obvious difficulties arise. When a small number of

diplomas  and certificates is involved, compliance

with  this formality is tolerable though  irksome.

While the expansion, as envisaged, to develop  the

site  to  the  north-west  of  Dover  Road  is  in

progress,  it  is  expected  that  the  number  of

graduates will rise steadily to well over 1,600 by

1976-77  when  the  new  campus  will  have   been

completed. Under such circumstances, the  affixing

of  the common seal to each and every diploma  and

certificate will become excessively cumbersome.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Singapore Polytechnic intends that each of

the  technician  diploma and certificate  will  in

future  continue to bear the common  seal  and  be

individually signed by the principal and the  head

of  the  school concerned. However, the Chairman's

signature will no longer be hand-signed  but  only

be printed on the diplomas and certificates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to enable the Polytechnic to

carry  out  its  intention by means  of  a  simple

amendment to exempt compliance with section 10  of

the  Singapore  Polytechnic  Act,  in  so  far  as

affixing  the  common seal of  this  institution's

diplomas  and academic certificates is  concerned.

The  Bill will not involve the Government  in  any

financial expenditure.

move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that at the last sitting of

Parliament  a  White Paper on the  Report  of  the

Electoral  Boundaries  Delineation  Committee  was

presented to Parliament as Command 21 of 1971, and

that  I  announced Government's acceptance of  all

the  recommendations in the Report. The  Committee

was   appointed  in  April  1970  to  review   the

boundaries  of  the  existing electoral  divisions

and,  I  quote,  "to  recommend  such  changes  or

adjustments thereto as may be necessary to  ensure

more    equal   representation   throughout    all

constituencies".  The  Committee  recommended   an

increase  of the electoral divisions in  Singapore

from 58 to 65, that is to say, seven more than the

present number. Also recommended were changes  and

adjustments  to 11 electoral divisions  having  an

electorate  of more than 20,000 and to six  having

less   than   12,800  electors.  Eight   electoral

divisions  adjoining these 17 electoral  divisions

were  also required to be adjusted in consequence.

Thirty-three of the present 58 electoral divisions

were unaffected by the re-delineation of electoral

boundaries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 23(1) of the Constitution of Singapore

provides  that  Parliament shall consist  of  such

number  of elected Members as the Legislature  may

by  law provide, and until other provision  is  so

made,  the  number of Members shall be  fifty-one.

Section  22  of  the Parliamentary  Elections  Act

(Chapter 50) provides that each electoral division



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



shall return one Member to serve in Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1967, the Parliamentary Membership Act of

that    year,   together   with   the    Singapore

Parliamentary  Elections  (Amendment)  Act,  1967,

provided  the statutory basis for the increase  in

membership  of Parliament from 51 to  the  present

58.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill similarly now seeks to increase the

number of elected Members of Parliament from 58 to

65 consequent on acceptance of the recommendations

of  the Electoral Boundaries Delineation Committee

in  regard to the increase of electoral divisions.

This augmentation of Parliamentary membership from

58  to  65 will come into effect as from the  next

general election. The Bill, however, provides that

on  its coming into operation, for the purposes of

the  next general election, all things may be done

under  the  Parliamentary  Elections  Act  as   if

Parliament consisted of 65 elected Members.

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this Bill is to amend the

Parliamentary  Elections  Act  with  a   view   to

enabling  the  Registration  Officer  to   compile

separately  for  each  electoral  division   fresh

registers   of   electors  from  the   information

recorded  and kept by the Commissioner of National

Registration. These electoral



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



registers  will contain the names of  all  persons

who  were  on  the  1st July,  1971,  citizens  of

Singapore,  ordinarily resident in  Singapore  and

not less than 21 years of age.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By an amendment to the principal Act, the Bill

also requires that the Registration Officer shall,

in  each year following the year 1971, complete  a

revision  of  the  registers  on  or  before  31st

December in that year, or such later date  as  the

Minister may appoint.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 3 of the Bill seeks to introduce

subsection  (4) to section 13 of the Parliamentary

Elections  Act.  This new provision  empowers  the

Registration   Officer,  before   certifying   any

register of electors, to transfer the name of  any

person  who  is no longer resident at the  address

shown   in   such  register  to  the   appropriate

register,   if   such  person  has  notified   the

Commissioner of National Registration  in  writing

of  his change of residence on or before the  last

day  of  inspection of the register  of  electors.

This  provision will enable electors, at the  next

general  election, to cast their votes at the  new

electoral  division in which they reside,  and  so

avoid the inconvenience of having to travel longer

distances   to  vote  at  their  former  electoral

divisions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a view to obtaining more exact particulars

of  each  candidate, amendments have been made  to

Form 9 (which is the nomination paper) and to Form

10 (which is the statutory declaration of a person

nominated as a candidate for election).

<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main object of the Bill is to update and

amend   the   present  Medical  Registration   Act

(Chapter  218  of the 1970 Revised Edition)  which

is,  in  fact, the Medical Registration  Ordinance

enacted  in  1907  and which was amended  and  re-enacted  in  1953. The amendment to the  Ordinance

that  was  made in 1953 was primarily to  make  it

mandatory   for  a  medical  graduate  to   obtain

experience  in  a "resident medical  capacity"  in

approved  institutions before he  could  be  fully

registered.  Thus  our  present  law  on   medical

registration can be said to be rather out of  date

and  requires to be urgently up-dated in  view  of

the major historical changes that have since taken

place  and  the  very  changed circumstances  that

exist today.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the amendments as proposed by the Bill

do  not  change the basic structure of the present

system  of registration which is embodied  in  our

present law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially the system confers on a Medical

Council, which is a body of nominated and  elected

medical practitioners, the function of advising on

persons  who  may be registered  as  well  as  the

converse  of this, which is the power to remove  a

person's   name  from  the  register  of   medical

practitioners.   By  operation  of   this   latter

function,   the   Medical  Council   exercises   a

disciplinary   jurisdiction   over   the   medical

profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major amendments that have been proposed

relate  to the conditions under which persons  may

be  registered for practice in Singapore  and  the

method of registering such persons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is the universal practice for each

country to adopt its own conditions and methods of

registration  of its professional persons,  it  is

only appropriate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



that  we  must make the necessary changes  to  our

registration  law in keeping with our  independent

status   and   national  needs.  Malaysia,   which

inherited  a similar medical registration  law  as

ourselves,  has also recently amended its  Medical

Registration Act to meet its national needs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal with the proposed amendments under

the various sub-headings as follows:



<br><br><i>(1)  On registrable qualifications:</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the law stands, persons who are entitled to

be  registered as medical practitioners fall  into

three categories, namely:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) graduates of our local medical school;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) persons registrable by the General Medical Council (G.M.C.) of the United Kingdom; and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) persons with other medical qualifications registered by order of the Minister after he has consulted the Medical Council.





<br><br>Under the second category persons who are entitled

to  be  registered are those who  possess  medical

qualifications   on   the   list   of   recognised

qualifications  adopted  by  the  General  Medical

Council  of  the  United  Kingdom.  The  Bill  now

proposes  to replace this G.M.C, list by  our  own

local  list of recognised qualifications which  we

have authority to vary from time to time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list of recognised qualifications adopted by

the  G.M.C, of the United Kingdom  are  all  from

medical schools of the Commonwealth. Thus reliance

on  the  G.M.C, list  has restricted  options  of

training  of  our medical students to Commonwealth

medical  schools. Additions and deletions  to  the

list are not determined by the Medical Council  of

Singapore  but by the General Medical  Council  of

the United Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis on which qualifications are accepted

and  rejected by the G.M.C, of the U.K, is, on the

face  of  it,  determined  by  the  standards   of

training in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



the  medical  schools. Thus a new  medical  school

which on inspection by the G.M.C, of U.K, is found

in  the  content of its course, training standards

and  examinations to be of acceptable standard  is

put on the list. Thus, for instance, an inspection

team  from the General Medical Council of the U.K.

visited  the  Faculty  of  Medicine  and  teaching

hospital  in Kuala Lumpur before its degrees  were

recognised.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two drawbacks are inherent in this arrangement,

and they are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Medical schools which do not ask to be

included in the list would obviously not  ever  be

included in the list of recognised qualifications.

Hence,  there are very conspicuous omissions  from

the   list.  For  example,  the  medical   degrees

conferred by McGill University, Montreal,  Canada,

were   at   one  time  on  the  recognised   list.

Apparently, because the University in Montreal did

not  agree to accept inspection by a team from the

General   Medical  Council  in   the   U.K.,   its

qualifications were subsequently dropped. Thus, we

get  an  anomalous position where one of the  most

prestigious  of  medical  schools  in  the   North

American  continent is no longer on  the  list  of

recognised qualifications accepted by the G.M.C. -

and thus also accepted by us - whereas smaller and

less  prestigious medical schools in Canada,  such

as  Saskatchewan, the Dalhousie University of Nova

Scotia, are on the list.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) There are no regular or periodic

inspections.  Inspections generally  are  made  on

invitation by the medical schools. Once a  medical

school  is placed on the list, it is left  on  the

list. It will remain on the list even though there

is  information that the standards have gone down,

for   it  is  usually  not  removed  except  after

inspection.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be several methods which might be

adopted  to  meet these drawbacks to  our  present

system of registration. One is not to have a  list

of recognised qualifications at all. In place of a

list  of recognised schools, registration  may  be

done by examination. Thus, without exception,  any

person applying



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



for  registration will be required to sit and pass

a  registration  examination.  This  is  a  system

adopted in the United States of America.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other countries have adopted the other extreme,

that  is, they would accept any person who  has  a

medical  qualification and who could show evidence

that  he  has been registered to practise  in  the

country  where  he had obtained the qualification.

This  system is adopted by countries which do  not

have  their  own  medical  school.  It  would  not

obviously  be  acceptable in  an  independent  and

developed  state with its own medical school  such

as ours.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, however, chosen a compromise solution

to  this problem by proposing the adoption of  our

own  list of recognised qualifications. This  list

which  we  propose  to  adopt  is  attached  as  a

Schedule to the Bill. It is, in essence, the  same

list as the G.M.C, list but with certain additions

and deletions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opportunity has been taken to add on the list

medical  schools  from  outside  the  Commonwealth

whose international reputation and prestige no one

can  gainsay. They include the medical schools  of

Columbia,  Ann Arbor, Michigan, to  cite  .a  few,

from  the United States, a German, a Dutch  and  a

French medical school from Europe. From the  Asian

region, the schools included are the University of

Philippines  in Manila and the Medical  School  of

Tokyo  University. McGill Medical School in Canada

has also been included.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In completing our local list, omissions of a

number  of  medical schools from the  G.M.C, list

have  also  been made. This has been done  in  the

face   of   reports   of  malpractices   regarding

admissions   of  poor  candidates,  tampering   of

examination results and deteriorating standards in

these schools which gave us little alternative but

to   drop   them   from  the  list   of   approved

qualifications.  These deletions  were  made  also

after   consultation  with  the   Public   Service

Commission which had made a special study of it. I

would, however, like to point out here that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



by   dropping  them  from  the  list  of  approved

qualifications  we  are not  in  any  way  casting

aspersions  on the good name which some  of  these

medical schools have acquired and their proud past

records  and  on  their  graduates  who  might  be

eminent  scientists and practitioners who  can  be

found  throughout the world. But in  view  of  the

reports referred to, we have no alternative but to

play  safe  and make a general deletion  of  these

schools from our list of recognised qualifications

in  the  interest of protecting the  present  high

standards of medical practice in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I wish to make it very clear here that

the  local list of recognised qualifications which

we  have  proposed to adopt is in no way permanent

nor  is it exhaustive, since we are in no position

at  this stage to consider the inclusion of  every

single  medical  school in  the  world.  Thus  the

amendments   also  provide  that   the   list   of

recognised   qualifications  can  be   varied   by

additions or deletions made from time to  time  by

the Minister after consulting the Medical Council.



<br><br><i>(2)   On  the registration of persons who  do  not

possess recognised qualifications:</i>







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present law, the registration of

persons    who    do   not   possess    recognised

qualifications  may  be  made  by  order  of   the

Minister after consulting the Medical Council. The

Medical  Council will advise the Minister on  each

application and the Minister may, on the basis  of

this  advice, determine the order to  be  made  in

each  case.  Under  the proposed  amendment,  this

practice will in substance remain unchanged.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, regard has been taken of a deficiency

in  the  existing  provision in that  the  Medical

Council,   in  advising  the  Minister   on   such

applications,   has  to  depend  on   the   papers

submitted  to it. The Medical Council,  therefore,

has to make their recommendations based mainly  on

paper  qualifications and hearsay  evidence.  This

can  sometimes  make  it very  difficult  for  the

Medical  Council to arrive at a decision,  because

the Medical Council cannot possibly know



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



the standards of each and every medical school  in

the world, and more particularly the competence of

an individual applicant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To overcome this defect, the amendment proposed

is  to  allow  in  those cases where  the  Medical

Council  is not able to determine on the standards

of  the  qualifications submitted by the applicant

and particularly if there are doubts regarding his

competence,  and, before it advises the  Minister,

to   subject   the  applicant  to  a  registration

examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The form of examination will be left to the

Medical  Council.  This could  be  a  full-fledged

examination  consisting of practical, written  and

oral  parts.  In some cases, however,  it  may  be

limited to an oral interview. This will allow  the

Medical   Council   to  be   more   objective   in

determining the competence of the person  applying

for registration.



<br><br><i>(3) Temporary registration:</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing law for temporary registration only

provides  for persons who are engaged in  research

and training. In actual practice, it is given only

for  medical persons engaged by the University for

research and teaching.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, other categories of persons

besides those engaged in the University who should

also  qualify  for  temporary  registration.   For

example, they may be eminent specialists  who  are

brought  out not only to train or teach, but  also

to  conduct  special work amongst patients.  There

have  been  instances where eminent surgeons  have

been  invited  to  treat special cases  which  the

local  surgeons felt could be best done  by  these

eminent surgeons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A further category of persons who may require

temporary  registration are  persons  who  are  in

Singapore  working  in the hospitals  and  medical

institutions  to obtain special experience  or  to

fulfil  their  training  requirements  for  higher

qualifications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments will now provide for the

temporary   registration   of   these   additional

categories of persons afore-mentioned.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 412</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>(4)    Conditions of registration:</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is presently stipulated in the law, certain

conditions may be imposed only in cases of persons

who  are registered by order of the Minister under

section  9 (1) (c) of the Act. It is now  proposed

to allow for conditions to be imposed also when  a

person is to be registered temporarily.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Bill, it is also proposed to provide a

general condition to apply to the registration  of

all persons. This is that the Medical Council must

be  satisfied  that the applicant for registration

is  of  "good  fame and character"  before  he  is

registered. The interpretation of this phrase  "of

good  fame and character" will, in practice,  mean

that  the  person  is certified  at  the  time  of

application to be of good character, and if he  is

registered in another country, he is still on that

register,   and  that  there  are  no  proceedings

pending   or  have  been  made  against  him   for

misconduct.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposed provision is fairly commonly

adopted  in other countries and it is to safeguard

against  the  occasional case where a person,  who

has   been  struck  off  the  list  of  registered

practitioners   in  one  country,  transfers   his

practice  to  another  country.  This,  in   fact,

occurred on at least one occasion in Singapore. In

this  case,  a  practitioner was found  guilty  of

misconduct in a state outside of Singapore and was

struck  off the register there, but was registered

in  Singapore even though it was known that he had

been struck off from the register in that country.

Nothing   could  be  done  since  there  were   no

provisions then to prevent his registration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, essential that this amendment

be accepted.



<br><br><i>(5) Membership  of  the  Medical  Council  of Singapore:</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As can be clearly seen, the Medical Council

plays  an  important role in the  registration  of

practitioners and it is the governing body on  the

conduct of the profession.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medical Council in Singapore before its

separation numbered 17, of which seven  were  from

Malaysia. After



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



separation   under   the  constitutional   changes

embodied in the Republic of Singapore Independence

Act,  1965, the Malaysian members on the Singapore

Council ceased membership. Accordingly, the  total

membership of the Medical Council in Singapore has

been  reduced  to 10. These are  made  up  of  the

following:  two  officials, two  nominees  of  the

University  Council,  and six  registered  medical

practitioners  elected by the  registered  medical

practitioners.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments proposed will make for an

increase in the membership of the Medical  Council

to  13. The proposed increase is to be made up  by

the   appointment  of  three  registered   medical

practitioners  by  the  Minister.  This   proposed

modest   increase  will  make  the  Council   more

workable and representative and, at the same time,

more  balanced.  There will be two  officials  and

three  nominees, making a total of five  appointed

members  against six elected medical practitioners

with  the  two members appointed by the University

Council holding the balance in the Council.



<br><br><i>(6)    Housemanship:</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may be aware that a medical graduate

cannot    immediately   practise    medicine    on

graduation. Under the law, he has to serve for one

year  in a "resident medical capacity", which,  di

common  parlance,  is  known  as  housemanship  or

internship.  In reality, this is an  extension  of

his  medical  training. It  is  an  apprenticeship

where  a new graduate works under supervision  and

in approved hospitals or units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housemanship became mandatory before a person

can  be  registered to practise  independently  in

1953  when the Medical Registration Ordinance  was

amended and re-enacted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the present law the new graduate must

undertake  his practical training in  one  of  two

specialities,  that is, in medicine  and  surgery,

during  the  year  of  housemanship.  Training  in

obstetrics  and  gynaecology  may  be  counted  as

either  medicine or surgery. Thus, within the  one

year  of housemanship these medical graduates will

do six



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



months in a medical or a surgical type of posting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now, however, a growing range of

specialities  in  the  medical  services.  It   is

considered that some housemen could, with benefit,

undertake  some of the training in some  of  these

special areas. The amendments proposed will  allow

for  the  postings of housemen to these other  and

never specialities which they now cannot undertake

under the present law. This will allow for greater

flexibility in the training of our housemen.



<br><br><i>(7)    Annual retention fee:</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is proposed in the amendments to introduce an

annual  retention fee for registration of  medical

practitioners.  The amount will be  determined  by

the  Minister. However, it is envisaged that  this

fee  will be a relatively nominal one and will  be

comparable  to the fees paid by other professional

persons  who are registered in Singapore.  Medical

practitioners are the only professionals who up to

date  do not pay an annual retention or practising

fee.  This  differs  from every  other  registered

professional persons in Singapore who have to  pay

an  annual  practising fee. Thus  the  architects,

lawyers and engineers pay annual fees and so  also

do  the pharmacists, dental surgeons, midwives and

nurses, including assistant nurses.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among other things, the major reason for

introducing the annual fee is that it  will  be  a

method  by which an accurate and up-to-date record

is kept of all medical practitioners. As it is, it

is almost impossible to be sure of the reliability

or  accuracy of the Register. This is because once

a  person is registered, he does not feel  obliged

to  inform  the  Registrar of any changes  of  his

address  of  practice. Any changes at present  may

come  about  by  chance or on  the  occasion  when

letters are returned undelivered to the Registrar.

This  is  an unsatisfactory state of affairs.  The

annual retention fee will change all this. It will

then  be possible to keep an up-to-date record  of

every practitioner in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that there will be some rumblings

about  the imposition of this annual fee from  the

medical profession. One criticism is that  we  are

taking  away one of the last vestiges of privilege

of medical practitioners. The annual retention fee

has recently been imposed in the United Kingdom  -

not without controversy - to meet the expenses  of

the  General Medical Council of the U.K., and more

and more countries are adopting the same system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) Sir, I wish now to turn to penalties for

misconduct.  Under the present  law,  the  Medical

Council  has  recourse  to  only  two  methods  of

dealing  with  a  practitioner when  he  is  found

guilty  of misconduct. This is either (i)  to  let

him  off,  or (ii) to remove him from the register

of  practitioners, in which case he  will  not  be

able  to  practise. It is felt that there  may  be

certain  intermediate misdemeanours where  a  less

severe  penalty  than striking  off  the  Register

could  be  imposed. As it is, the Medical  Council

sometimes  is not prepared to impose  the  maximum

penalty of removal of the practitioner's name from

the Register because the misconduct might not have

been serious enough for them to do so. Yet to take

no  action  would  also be unjustified.  For  this

reason,  the amendments proposed would  allow  for

the Medical Council to impose other penalties such

as  the  issue  of warnings or suspensions  for  a

period of not less than three months and not  more

than  one  year in those cases where  less  severe

penalties are considered appropriate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the proposed amendments in the Bill have been

referred  to  the Medical Council for their  views

and  comments.  They have agreed to  some  of  the

amendments,  disagreed with a few and  gave  their

views and comments on others. I have also received

a  delegation  from the Medical  Council  to  hear

their views on some of the amendments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments in the Bill before the House have

been  proposed after taking into account not  only

the  interest of the medical profession  but  also

that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



of the general public as well as that of our

Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate on Second Reading resumed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Sir, I am very glad

to hear the explanation of the Minister for Health

on the Medical Registration (Amendment) Bill, but

many points have been left out. Therefore, I would

like him to consider my suggestions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Schedule to the Bill lists the universities

in    both   Commonwealth   and   non-Commonwealth

countries   whose   medical   qualifications   are

recognised  but no mention has been  made  of  the

medical  qualifications of universities or medical

colleges  of India, Pakistan and Ceylon.  This  is

strange,  for  in  the past.  Singapore  has  been

graced  by many medical practitioners who are  not

only  citizens of these countries, but also  local

citizens  who  have obtained their  qualifications

from  these  countries. It seem&  rather  strange,

because     the    United    Kingdom    recognises

qualifications from, these universities, while  we

in  the Commonwealth tend to ignore a whole sector

of   the   Commonwealth  and   thereby   lose   an

opportunity  to take advantage of the brain  drain

from these countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, what would be the future of the

present students who are in the advanced stage of

their medical studies in the universities of the

three countries?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Schedule to the Bill, it appears

there are some universities.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



with  which we in Singapore are not very familiar.

I   wonder  how  these  universities  have  gained

recognition,  whereas not a single  university  of

India, Pakistan and Ceylon is in the Schedule.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I would like the Minister to reconsider the

Schedule  to  include  a few universities  of  the

countries that I have mentioned, because there are

many  parents who are worried about the future  of

their  sons and daughters who are already studying

in the universities of these countries.



<br><br>5.25 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan (Whampoa):</b> Sir, while I

welcome this Bill, I am a little bit curious about

the  criteria for determining the list of approved

universities  and  colleges  as  listed   in   the

Schedule.  I am no medical man, but 1  would  have

thought  that the medical schools of, say, Harvard

or  Stanford  or  a  number of  other  Ivy  League

colleges  in  the United States are of  sufficient

stature to be included. Although the Minister does

have  discretion  under the  Bill  to  accept  any

applicant for registration, students are guided by

the  Schedule  in  deciding upon  the  college  or

university  to go to. I hope to see some  time  in

the   future   a   more  comprehensive   list   of

universities including those I have mentioned,  as

well  as some of the more prominent ones in India,

Pakistan  and Ceylon as mentioned by my colleague,

the Member for Anson.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ch'ng Jit Koon (Tiong Bahru)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Sir, I would like to praise the Government's

effort  in  the past years to improve and  develop

our  medical services. However, we often  read  in

the  newspapers  about  the  shortage  of  medical

personnel  in  Singapore. On  the  one  hand,  the

Government  has  to meet the shortage  of  medical

personnel  and,  on  the other  hand,  it  has  to

maintain   the  high  standard  of   the   medical

profession.   I  therefore  welcome   the   timely

proposed  amendments  to the Medical  Registration

Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I would like to take this opportunity to

seek  clarification from the Minister for  Health.

We know that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



university-trained  doctors,  other   than   those

listed  in  the Schedule, have been  recruited  to

fill  the  vacancies  in  the  Government  medical

service.   Among  some  of  them   are   Singapore

citizens. I wish to enquire whether these  doctors

who  are Singapore citizens will be allowed to  be

registered for private practice, without having to

go  through  the required examination, when  their

contracts with the Government expire.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chua Sian Chin:</b> Sir, may I, first of all,

answer  the  Member for Anson on the  question  of

medical  students who are at present  studying  in

medical  schools  which are not  on  the  Schedule

which  we  have proposed. May I draw his attention

to  section  9  (1)  (c) of the  Act  where  those

graduates who do not possess qualifications on the

approved  list  can  apply for  registration,  and

their registration may be approved by order of the

Minister  after  he  has  consulted  the   Medical

Council.  We have now made provision in this  Bill

whereby  the  Medical Council,  if  they  are  not

satisfied with the standard of the applicant,  can

set  a  registration examination.  If  the  person

passes  it, he will be registered. In other words,

it  all depends on the personal competence of  the

person  who applies for registration. And  if,  as

the  Member for Anson says, they come from medical

schools of a high calibre, there is no reason  why

they  should  not be able to pass  a  registration

examination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Whampoa wants to know what are

the criteria we use to draw up the Schedule. As  I

have  explained in my speech, this is only a first

list  which we have drawn up,, because, as I  have

said,  it is not possible at this stage to include

every  medical school in the world which we  think

is   of   eminence.   We  have   just   chosen   a

representative few from the various countries from

outside  the  Commonwealth, medical schools  whose

international reputation and prestige no  one  can

gainsay.  As  you know, the question of  standards

and  reputation  can  be  subject  to  a  lot   of

controversy and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



argument one way or the other. Further, as I  have

said, we also have provisions whereby the Minister

can  add to or delete from the list after  he  has

consulted the Medical Council.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru has mentioned that we

are   now  short  of  doctors,  and  yet  we   are

restricting  the  number of  doctors  who  can  be

registered.  We are not restricting. In  fact,  we

have  widened  the  Schedule  to  include  medical

schools  from outside the Commonwealth.  Hitherto,

the  list  was  a  GMC  list which  included  only

medical schools from within the Commonwealth.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Tiong Bahru also wants to know

whether   graduate  doctors  who  have   been   in

Government  service  have to  go  through  another

examination  before  they can  be  allowed  to  do

private practice. In a hospital, if he is a  young

doctor  he is always practising under supervision,

whereas  if  he  is  practising  outside,  he   is

practising  on  his  own. So there  are  different

criteria  of  allowing a doctor to  practise.  All

along  our  criterion  of  allowing  a  doctor  to

practise  on his own is that he does not  endanger

the  lives  of  his patients. If a  person  has  a

medical qualification which is not on the approved

list,  as  1 have said, he can make an application

under  section  9 (1) (c) of the Act  whereby  the

Medical  Council can consider his application.  If

the Council have doubts about his competence, they

will set him a registration examination and, if he

passes, he will be registered.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

<div align="center"><b>DENTISTS REGISTRATION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>5.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill to amend the Dentists Registration Act

(Chapter 215 of the 1970 Revised Edition) has been

deliberately brought up at the same  time  as  the

amendments to the Medical Registration  Act  which

the  House  has already considered. The principles

underlying the proposed amendments are similar  to

those  which  were made in the amendments  to  the

Medical Registration Act. Accordingly, it will not

be  necessary for me to describe the amendments in

such great detail nor to advance again the reasons

which   were   argued  in  the   debate   on   the

corresponding    amendments   in    the    Medical

Registration (Amendment) Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal amendments to the Dentists

Registration Act fall into two parts:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) on membership of the Dental Board; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) on registrable dental degrees and the

method  of  registration of those who  do  not

possess registrable dental degrees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On membership of the Dental Board: As in the

case  of  the  Medical Council, the  Dental  Board

suffered a reduction in the number of its  members

when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



Singapore   separated  from   Malaysia.   From   a

membership totalling 11, this was reduced to  only

seven  in  1965  when the four  Malaysian  members

ceased membership on Singapore's separation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been found in practice that the

membership of seven is rather too small  a  group.

In  order to make it more workable, the amendments

proposed will increase the membership to nine.  It

is  proposed  to  bring  about  this  increase  by

increasing   the   nomination  from   the   Dental

Association  from  one  to  two  dental   surgeons

practising  in Singapore, and for the Minister  to

appoint  another  dental  officer  in  the  public

service  of Singapore. In this way the balance  of

members  between those nominated by  the  Minister

and those by the Association is preserved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be noted that the Dental Board consists

entirely of appointed or nominated persons. Unlike

the  Medical Council there are no elected  members

to  the  Board. If the composition of  the  Dental

Board  is  approved by acceptance of the  proposed

amendments, it will then consist of the following:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the Director of Medical Services;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the Dean of the Faculty of Dentistry;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) the Assistant Director of Medical Services (Dental);

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv) two dental officers in the public service appointed by the Minister;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(v) a dental surgeon nominated by the Faculty of Dentistry;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi) two dental surgeons nominated by the Singapore Dental Association;

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii) a registered dentist nominated by the Registered Dental Association.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On registrable degrees: As has been similarly

proposed  for medical registration, it is proposed

to  adopt  a  list  of recognised  dental  degrees

whereby persons in possession of such degrees  may

be  entitled to be registered as practising dental

surgeons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the existing provisions of the Dentists

Registration Act (Chapter 215



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



of  the  1970  Revised  Edition),  the  recognised

degrees  are those who hold a degree,  diploma  or

licence  in dental surgery of the King Edward  VII

College   of   Medicine  or  the   University   of

Singapore,  as well as those dental qualifications

which are recognised by the General Dental Council

of the United Kingdom.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As explained in the debate on the amendments to

the  Medical  Registration Act,  the  adoption  of

somebody  else's list of recognised qualifications

not  only has its inherent defects but is also not

in   keeping  with  our  independent  status   and

national needs. Accordingly it is proposed in  the

amendments to follow the same device as  that  for

the Medical Registration Act, which is to adopt  a

local  list of dental qualifications which can  be

recognised. The amendments also provide, as in the

case of the Medical Registration (Amendment) Bill,

that  this  list  can be varied  by  additions  or

deletions made from time to time by order  of  the

Minister after he has consulted the Dental Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially this list of registrable dental

qualifications will be the same list as  has  been

adopted  by  the  General Dental  Council  of  the

United  Kingdom. It will be noted that this  is  a

comparatively  shorter  list  than  the  list   of

recognised medical qualifications. There are  also

no  controversial issues here by way of  additions

or deletions which have to be explained, as was in

the  case  of the Medical Registration (Amendment)

Bill.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again as in the case of the amendments to the

Medical  Registration Act, it  is  essential  that

provision be made to deal with those cases where a

person may be holding dental qualifications  which

are   not   on   the   list  of  approved   dental

qualifications. In such cases it is  provided  for

the  Minister  to make an order for  the  person's

registration  after  he has consulted  the  Dental

Board.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before advising the Minister, should the Dental

Board  be unable to decide on the standard of  the

applicant,  the  Dental  Board  may  require   the

applicant to undergo and to pass an examination.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>







As   explained  in  the  debate  on  the   Medical

Registration  (Amendment) Bill, this  would  be  a

more  objective  way of assessing the  applicant's

standard  and  competence  than  from  the  papers

submitted.

<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pensions Act provides, inter alia, that an

officer may be retired in the public interest,  or

in  special circumstances, after having  completed

15  years'  service. At present,  however,  it  is

mandatory to suspend the payment of pension to  an

officer retiring under either of these two sets of

circumstances until he has attained the age of  50

years.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment seeks to remove this

mandatory   suspension   of   pension   till   the

attainment  of  the  age of 50 years.  Instead,  a

discretion  will  be conferred  on  the  President

whether  or  not  to suspend payment  of  pension.

Where  it  is decided for good reasons to  suspend

the pension, however, it shall not be for a period

longer  than that taken for the officer to  attain

the age of 45 years, if he is normally entitled to

retire at that age. If the officer is not entitled

to  retire  at the age of 45 years, the period  of

suspension of pension shall not be longer than the

time taken for him to attain the age of 50 years.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of an officer who becomes

incapacitated  -  such that  he  is  incapable  of

continuing  in  any employment during  the  period

when  his  pension  is being suspended,  then  his

pension may be restored with effect from the  date

he  is  deemed to be so incapacitated.  Similarly,

the  provision  for payment of a gratuity  to  the

dependants or legal personal representatives of an

officer who dies during the period his pension  is

being suspended is also safeguarded.

<br><br>5.49 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr Govindasamy. Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be

now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Statistical Commission of Singapore

Bill,   1971,  seeks  to  establish  the  National

Statistical Commission of Singapore which will  be

charged with the responsibilities of co-ordinating

and promoting statistical activities in the public

sector, developing statistical archives and giving

expert   advice   on  all  matters   relating   to

statistical compilation and utilisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall that a Commission of Inquiry

on   Statistical  Activities  in   Singapore   was

appointed  on  23rd  May,  1968,  to  review   and

recommend  improvements to the existing Government

machinery  for  the collection and compilation  of

statistics.  The  Commission of Inquiry  submitted

its  Report  in  July 1969 and recommended,  among

other  things,  the development of a decentralised

statistical system under



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>



which  a  research and statistics section will  be

set  up  in each of the four Ministries of Labour,

Health, Education and National Development.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of this decentralised system

will  enable the Ministries to develop  their  own

special   statistics   and   the   Department   of

Statistics   to  concentrate  more   on   national

statistics,  especially  population,  births   and

deaths,  external trade, balance of  payments  and

national  income. It is recognised, however,  that

within this decentralised statistical system there

needs  to  be a central agency to co-ordinate  and

promote   the   statistical  activities   of   the

Department   of  Statistics,  the   research   and

statistics sections, and the statistical wings  of

other  Ministries. It is also logical, and  indeed

essential, that this co-ordination and promotional

work  should  be extended to cover the statistical

activities  of the various statutory bodies.  This

central  agency  will  also  act  as  the  channel

through  which  all statistical inquiries  between

overseas  agencies  and  the  Republic   will   be

processed.  Furthermore,  the  central  agency  is

expected   to   provide  expert  advice   on   the

collection,   publication   and   utilisation   of

statistics  generated  by  all  these  statistical

wings  in  the  Government and  statutory  bodies,

especially  to those not provided with statistical

staff  and  facilities. Apart from building  up  a

central   statistical   archive-cum-library,   the

central   agency  will  be  responsible  for   co-ordinating  the in-service training of statistical

personnel  in Government and statutory  bodies  at

primary, intermediate and tertiary levels in order

to  infuse  a greater sense of professionalism  in

their work. It is therefore proposed to set up the

National Statistical Commission of Singapore which

will  be  assigned the responsibility of  carrying

out  the  aforementioned functions, as recommended

by the Statistics Commission of Inquiry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission will consider any matter referred

to it by any Government department, statutory body

or  private organisation if the matter is  related

to  its  terms of reference, and it will  consider

and report to the Minister



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



on  any  matter  within its  terms  of  reference.

Additionally,  the Commission  will,  on  its  own

initiative    or   if   directed   generally    or

specifically by the Minister, conduct such studies

and  inquiries as may be necessary in  respect  of

any   matter   related  to  the   advancement   of

statistics  and  the  statistical  system  of  the

Republic.  The  Commission  may  form  ad  hoc  or

permanent  expert committees or working groups  to

consider  specific fields of interest relating  to

statistics.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setting up of the National Statistical

Commission of Singapore will go a long way towards

raising  the level and volume of statistical  work

in  the Republic so that the necessary up-to-date,

reliable     and     comprehensive     statistical

intelligence   is   made  available   for   proper

evaluation  of  the economy and for  economic  and

social planning on a sounder basis.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Commission will consist of a Chairman, a

Deputy  Chairman, and five other members,  all  of

whom  shall be appointed by the Minister.  Members

of  the  Commission will comprise  representatives

from     Government     departments,     statutory

authorities, institutions of higher learning,  and

private and commercial organisations which have  a

vested  interest in or are professionally involved

in   the   fields  of  statistics,  research   and

associated  activities.  The  Commission  will  be

serviced by a small secretariat staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enable it to function effectively, the

Commission  will  be  given mandatory  powers  for

ensuring that Government departments and statutory

bodies  comply with its recommendations while  the

final  appellate  authority will remain  with  the

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expenses of the Commission will be met from

Government  grants and its budget will be  subject

to  the  approval of the Minister. A fund will  be

established   into  which  all   monies   of   the

Commission shall be paid.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is desirable to establish the National

Statistical Commission of Singapore



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



as  soon  as possible so that the Commission  can

commence to perform its important functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>5.58 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan:</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I rise to

welcome  the introduction of this Bill. It  marks

another  milestone  in  the  development  of  our

Republic.  We  have reached the level  where  the

need  for  quality in many areas of  organisation

and expertise is increasingly felt.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Statistical Commission will,

hopefully,   not   only  avoid   duplication   of

statistical work by various Government Ministries

and bodies but also raise standards in the use of

statistical techniques. Plans and policies can be

formulated  correctly only if the empirical  data

is  statistically  sound. I hope  the  Commission

will  also  provide  periodic barometers  of  the

health of our economy and of our society. I  look

forward  also  to the stage where the  Commission

can   utilise  the  research  manpower  resources

available at our institutions of higher  learning

for  long-range  in-depth  studies  relevant   to

policy making in our Republic.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The academic researcher in Singapore has long

been  greatly hindered by the lack of statistical

sources. The stamp of the word "Confidential"  on

our  files excludes him from access to the needed

data.   The   consequence  has  been  a   serious

misallocation  of high-calibre brain  power  for,

with limited access to needed data material,  the

academic  researcher must turn to  subjects  more

theoretical and more abstract. He is then  guided

more   by  the  standards  and  the  demands   of

international  specialisation  necessarily   very

abstract  and  remote  from  relevance   to   the

economic and social needs of Singapore. So we get

the perverse situation where policy making relies

upon   the  slender  research  resources   within

Government,   while  our  academic   brains   are

exercised in an ivory tower not entirely of their

own making.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope, therefore, that the National Statistical

Commission  will be able to channel our  research

manpower  resources to more relevant  uses.  The

researcher  can be given access to  confidential

material   with  the  understanding   that   only

aggregated data may ultimately be presented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I give my full support to

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

committed to a Committee of the whole House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House immediately resolved itself into a

Committee on the Bill. - [Mr Hon Sui Sen].

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Pensions Act was passed in

this  House and came into operation on 1st  July,

1969. Subsequently in May 1970, an Amendment  Act

was passed which removed certain restrictions  in

the principal Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of representations made by some

Members,  it  is  now  considered  equitable   to

propose further amendments to the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four principal amendments are being proposed in

the present Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is the amendment to section 6 of the

Act.  As section 6 now stands, where a Member  of

Parliament  is  for  any  period  entitled  to  a

superannuation  benefit under any provident  fund

or  pension scheme outside the Act, the period of

such contribution will only be taken into account

in  calculating  the  length  of  his  qualifying

service but not for the purpose of computing  the

quantum  of the pension payable to him under  the

Act.  It  has been argued that this provision  is

inequitable and equal



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



treatment should be accorded service in Parliament

by  all Members whatever their entitlements  under

any other scheme. It has been further argued that,

as  representatives  of the people,  much  of  the

M.P.s'  work  has  to be done outside  the  normal

office hours of their other employment during week-ends,  and  even during their holidays which  they

sacrifice  so as to be of maximum service  to  the

community  they  serve. It  has,  therefore,  been

decided  that  section  6 of  the  Act  should  be

amended  to  enable  all  Members  of  Parliament,

regardless  of their entitlement under  any  other

superannuation  scheme, to take into  account  all

their  Parliamentary service for  calculating  the

amount of their pensions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second amendment seeks to redefine the term

"salary",  so that even though the holder  of  the

post  of  Speaker  may not for any  period  be  an

elected  Member  of Parliament, his  salary  would

still  be  taken  to  earn pension  and  gratuity.

Hence, a new subsection (2) is added to section  2

of the principal Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third amendment is the inclusion of a new

subsection (3) to section 2 of the principal  Act,

which will provide for payment of full pension  or

benefit  to a Member of Parliament who voluntarily

refrains from receiving the whole or part  of  the

salary  that is due to him. As the law now stands,

a pension is calculated on the basis of the salary

actually drawn at the time of retirement.  Members

will realise that the operation of the present law

will  be  such  that  if  a Member  of  Parliament

voluntarily refrains from receiving the  whole  or

part   of   his  salary  due  to  him,   he   will

automatically  suffer a second  penalty  when  his

pension eventually comes to be calculated  at  the

time  of his retirement. The amendment, therefore,

seeks  to  ensure his entitlement to full pension.

The passing of this amendment will avoid an act of

sacrifice being automatically followed by another.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth amendment to the Act provides that

the  salary payable to a Political Secretary  from

the time he



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



becomes a Member of Parliament will be taken  into

account    when   calculating   the   amount    of

Parliamentary pension eventually payable  to  him.

This  will put the Political Secretary in the same

position  as Parliamentary Secretaries,  Ministers

of  State  and Ministers, whose salaries in  their

respective  capacities are  similarly  taken  into

account.   As   the   law  stands,   a   Political

Secretary's  pension will be  based  only  on  the

allowance   payable  to  him  as   a   Member   of

Parliament.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opportunity is also being taken to make two

minor  phraseological amendments to section 10  of

the Act for the sake of clarity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amending Bill, when passed, is to be made

retroactive from 1st July, 1969, which is the date

on  which  the principal Act came into  operation.

This  is to ensure that all benefits conferred  by

the amending Act may be enjoyed from the operative

date of the principal Act.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.

<div align="center"><b>CHIT FUNDS BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.11 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the first chit fund company was

established  in Singapore as early as  1964,  chit

funds   have  only  established  their  popularity

within the last few years. At present, in addition

to the 29 companies officially registered with the

Registrar  of  Companies as  operating  chit  fund

business, there are more than a hundred unofficial

chit fund companies in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chit fund is very similar to hwei and kutu

which  are  familiar  to the  Chinese  and  Indian

communities  respectively. In brief, a  chit  fund

operates  in the following manner. Each chit  fund

member  contributes a fixed sum  of  money  for  a

number  of  fixed periods - per week or month,  as

the  case  may be. The total contribution  to  the

chit  fund  amount per period will then be  pooled

and auctioned among members. The member who offers

the highest interest will be awarded the pool. The

amount to he received by the successful bidder  is

the total pool less:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a 5 per cent collection charge, usually

levied by the chit fund company, and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the interest offered by the successful

bidder.



<br><br>A successful bidder is precluded from making a bid

in subsequent auctions but he must continue making

his periodic payments.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rapid proliferation of chit fund

operators  who collect substantial sums  of  money

from  the public, it is now necessary to bring  in

legislation to control and regulate chit funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill before the House is based on Ceylonese

legislation with modifications to suit  our  local

conditions. The main features of the Bill are:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I.<i>Control and licensing</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Commissioner of Chit Funds will be appointed,

under  clause  3, to administer  the  law  and  to

control  the  activities  of  chit  funds.  It  is

envisaged  that the functions of the  Commissioner

will  be  taken  on by the Monetary  Authority  of

Singapore. Chit fund operators will be required to

apply  for  licences, and clause  4  of  the  Bill

provides  for  licences to  be  issued  to  public

companies only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II. <i>Security of deposits</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to safeguard the interest of chit fund

members,  chit fund companies will be required  to

have  a  minimum  paid-up capital of  $200,000,  a

proportion  of  which  will  be  required  to   be

invested in approved assets.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



Furthermore, under clause 21 of the  Bill,  it  is

required that an additional security will have  to

be  deposited with the Commissioner based  on  the

chit fund amount. As an additional safeguard,  the

total  amount of business that a chit fund company

can  transact  in relation to its paid-up  capital

will  also  be  regulated. This  is  contained  in

clause 42.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These requirements are considered necessary so

that  the  chit fund companies not only will  have

sufficient   working  funds  but  also   will   be

committed to a very large extent in ensuring  that

their business is properly and effectively run and

managed.  While  appreciating that some  companies

will  have  difficulties in  meeting  the  capital

requirements   prescribed,  the   protection   and

safeguard  which these provide cannot be disputed.

Clause  62  allows  for  an  initial  transitional

period  of some six months before compliance  with

the  Act, but if circumstances warrant, individual

extensions   will   be   considered.   Ultimately,

however,  it is our objective to see that stronger

financial units are evolved. Companies that may be

adversely  affected by these capital  requirements

would  be  well  advised either to increase  their

capital  or consider mergers and amalgamations  if

they wish to remain in business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to emphasize that due care and diligence

should  be  exercised  by  persons  managing  chit

funds,  as the money collected by them is held  in

trust for the benefit of members. This is provided

under clause 38 of the Bill, which stipulates that

chit fund companies shall be liable to members for

the contributions made by members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that with the passing of this

Act,  there  will  be  sufficient  protection   to

members participating in chit funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A summary of other provisions of the proposed

legislation   can  be  found  in  the  explanatory

statement attached to the Chit Funds Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>6.20 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hwang Soo Jin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hwang Soo Jin (Jalan Kayu):</b> Sir, as far back

as  January  1970, prompted by complaints  from  a

number  of  my  constituents,  I  urged  the  then

Minister  for  Finance in this House  to  consider

introducing   suitable  legislative  measures   to

control the activities of chit fund companies.  It

has  taken the Government almost two years to come

to  a definite decision. Whilst the careful manner

in  which  the Ministry has studied the activities

of  such  companies  is most  commendable,  it  is

regrettable that the delay has caused a number  of

our citizens, some of whom are my constituents, to

lose  financially  at  the hands  of  unscrupulous

operators.  However, I suppose it is  better  late

than never.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the details of the Bill were published,

they  have  attracted  quite  considerable  public

attention.  In  general, it  is  agreed  that  the

provisions  are  quite  adequate  to  protect  the

interests  of  the  public and  also  sufficiently

flexible to enable existing chit fund companies to

operate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the point of minimum capital requirements,

there  are,  however, two schools of thought.  The

Bill  provides that no chit fund company shall  be

granted or shall hold a licence unless its paid-up

capital is not less than $200,000. We have in  the

past   weeks  seen  in  various  newspapers  large

advertising spaces taken up by chit fund companies

giving enthusiastic support to the proposed  Bill.

On  the other hand, we have also read reports that

some companies are not particularly happy over the

fact  that the required paid-up capital should  be

more   than  $50,000  which,  I  understand,   was

originally intended. These two opposing  reactions

lead me to suspect that the $200,000 as stipulated

is   perhaps  a  little  heavy  for  the   smaller

companies  but  negligible  to  the  big  ones  in

relation  to their respective volumes in turnover.

I  think it may be more equitable to all concerned

if a graduating scale of required capital is to be

prescribed under the Bill; starting from a minimum

of, say, $100,000 to a maximum of, say,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



$1  million, depending upon the volume of business

handled  by  the company concerned. To the  larger

companies,  the  maximum  of  $1  million,  in  my

opinion,  is by no means excessive if we  are  to:

bear  in mind that some of these companies have  a

volume  of  business  running  into  millions   of

dollars.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large, the Ministry is to be

congratulated on the comprehensive nature  of  the

Bill  which, if properly enforced, should  achieve

the  objective  of safeguarding  the  interest  of

subscribers.  However, I would like  to  take  the

opportunity of inquiring from the Minister whether

the  Commissioner of Chit Funds will  be  given  a

team of inspectors to carry out surprise checks on

the  books of registered companies so as to ensure

that  all aspects of the law are complied with  at

all times.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, it seems to me a pity that the

Bill makes no provision for chit fund companies to

invest  compulsorily a percentage of the funds  in

hand   in   approved  forms  of  assets  such   as

Government securities and selected counters in the

Stock Exchange. By so providing, it would, I feel,

be  possible  to raise the level of respectability

and the economic functions of chit fund companies,

in  terms  of their ability to contribute  to  our

national  economy, to the same level  as  that  of

established institutions of national savings  such

as   banks,   insurance  companies   and   finance

companies. Whilst I agree that chit fund companies

are   rendering  excellent  services  to  traders,

hawkers, farmers and householders in need of short-term credit facilities for legitimate business  or

domestic  purposes, I cannot help  but  feel  that

they   are   also  financiers  of   gamblers   and

spendthrifts   and   that  the  excessive   credit

facilities generated by their operations,  if  not

carefully watched and controlled, are most  likely

in  the long run to contribute to the rising  cost

of living and inflationary trends in our economy.

<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy:</b> Sir, the Chit Funds Bill is

a  very  commendable and timely move in the  right

direction and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



our  citizens will be protected from  the  fly-by-night operators.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, I feel that the requirement of a

minimum paid-up capital of $200,000 for chit  fund

companies  is  too  large  a  sum,  as  has   been

mentioned  by my colleague, the Member  for  Jalan

Kayu.  This  sum deposited with no interest  is  a

terrific  burden  on the existing small  companies

which  may  have to close down and, as  a  result,

this  may affect the contributions of the existing

subscribers of these small companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, clause 12 of the Bill forbids the

merger  or  consolidation of chit fund  companies.

Therefore, I feel that clause 9 only helps the big-time operators to monopolise the business.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore suggest that the minimum capital

requirement  be reduced to a more reasonable  sum,

say  $50,000  or  capital with  reference  to  the

company's  assets, thereby allowing  the  existing

small  companies to carry on their business.  This

will   also   give  confidence  to  the   existing

subscribers of these companies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards clause 7 of the Bill, I wonder

whether   the   Minister  could  include   another

condition that only Singaporeans can apply  for  a

licence  to  operate a chit fund company,  because

these  companies  are mainly run for  Singaporeans

and should be managed by Singaporeans only.



<br><br>6.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Cheong Yuen Chee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Cheong Yuen Chee (Toa Payoh):</b> Sir, I rise to

speak  in  support  of the Chit Funds  Bill  whose

provisions  are  not only comprehensive  but  also

timely.  The  Explanatory Statement describes  the

purposes of the Bill - to license and control chit

fund   companies   for  the  protection   of   the

subscribers.  It  remains  to  be  seen,  however,

whether  the  ingenuity of any chit  fund  company

would  in  the course of time be able to  discover

and exploit any latent loophole in the Bill to its

own   advantage   and  at  the  expense   of   the

subscribers. The possibility of the perversion  of

the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



objectives of the Bill is not so farfetched as one

would  imagine when one considers the  example  of

the  Moneylenders Act which has been designed  for

the  protection  of the borrower,  but  which  has

practically   strengthened  the  stranglehold   of

moneylenders  on  their  unfortunate  victims.   I

therefore   seek   clarification  regarding   some

provisions of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 (1) of the Bill stipulates that the

minimum  capital  requirement for  any  chit  fund

company to be accorded a licence shall be not less

than  $200,000. Such a minimum limit seems  to  be

fairly  substantial  enough to  afford  a  certain

amount  of  protection to the subscribers  of  the

companies.  But  in  reality  the  protection   so

afforded is more apparent than real, depending  on

the   scale   of  operations  of  the  chit   fund

companies. A chit fund scheme with 100 subscribers

each  contributing  $l0 weekly  will  be  able  to

realise a total chit fund amount of $100,000  over

a  period of approximately two years. At five  per

cent of the chit fund value, the commission of the

company in respect of this particular scheme alone

will be $5,000. It does not require much effort to

calculate that if a chit fund company operates  40

such schemes or a smaller number of schemes with a

total  chit  fund value equivalent to $4  million,

the  commission of the company will  be  not  less

than $200,000. I am, therefore, happy to note that

clause   61(1)  (g)  of  the  Bill  empowers   the

Commissioner,  with the approval of the  Minister,

to  make regulations to prescribe the total  value

of  chit funds to be conducted at any one time  by

the chit fund companies in relation to their paid-up capital. It is obvious from the illustration  I

have  just given that the minimum sum of  $200,000

may  be  practically sufficient for the protection

of  contributors in every given instance. There is

a  need for the regulations envisaged under clause

61,  and I hope that they will come into operation

within  the shortest time possible of the  passing

of the Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 (4) of the Bill provides that no right

or  claim  under  any scheme or arrangement  which

only partakes of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



nature  of a chit fund within the meaning  of  this

Act  or  regulations made thereunder shall, without

prejudice  to the provisions of clause 20  (1),  be

enforceable by action in any court.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 20 (1) states that every scheme or

arrangement  which is not based  on  the  essential

terms  and  conditions set out in clause 24  shall,

for  the  purposes of the Bill, be deemed  only  to

partake   of  the  nature  of  a  chit  fund.   The

cumulative effect of these two provisions and other

provisions of the Bill, as I see it, is to penalise

equally  the  culpable promoter  and  the  innocent

subscriber  of a chit fund. Though there  are  four

official  languages in the Republic, it is  nowhere

provided  in  the  Bill that every  agreement  made

under clause 23 containing the terms and conditions

set  out under clause 24 should be written in  more

than one official language. I suppose that literacy

or  proficiency in only one language in our  multi-racial   republic  is  a  misfortune  and   not   a

privilege;  and that a subscriber to  a  chit  fund

whose agreement is written in the official language

he cannot comprehend, must run the risk of being so

deficient. All the same, it seems inequitable  that

the innocent subscriber, after being hoodwinked  by

a  chit  fund operator who has fraudulently omitted

some   of   the  essential  terms  and   conditions

prescribed under clause 24 in respect of  any  chit

fund  and  thereby caused it to be deemed  only  to

partake  of  the nature of a chit fund,  should  be

debarred  from having any recourse to  a  court  of

law.  Such  a  subscriber  apparently  cannot,  for

instance, apply to the court for an order directing

payment  by other subscribers under clause  40  (2)

(b), in the event of the termination of a chit fund

or  the  failure of a chit fund operator to conduct

the chit fund in accordance with the provisions  of

the   proposed  Bill.  It  would  hardly   be   any

consolation  to a subscriber for the  loss  of  his

money  invested in a chit fund that the  chit  fund

operator and his agents are subsequently prosecuted

for  the fraudulent or improper conduct of the chit

fund.  I  am sure it is not the intention  of  this

House that any chit fund promoter or subscriber  is

to be permitted to suggest



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



steps  in making not enforceable by action in court

the rights of claim of a subscriber as provided for

under  clause 24. A distinction should be  made  on

the  basis  whether a subscriber has knowingly  and

wilfully been a party to the failure of a chit fund

to  comply  with the essential terms and conditions

set  out in clause 24. The whole text of clause  24

seems  to  be  an  elimination  of  any  scope  for

fraudulent  practices by, for instance,  apparently

limiting a subscriber to one share per chit fund as

inferred  from paragraphs (b) and (1) of clause  24

(1).  There  is  apparently no restriction  on  the

number  of  chit  funds in which a  subscriber  can

simultaneously participate. It is,  of  course,  in

the  general interest of every subscriber to a chit

fund  that  he can freely invest in the chit  fund.

Nonetheless, apart from what I have earlier said in

relation to clause 24, there seems to be a distinct

need  for  a  bona fide subscriber to be  protected

from  his fellow subscribers whose financial credit

may  be suspect or who may be colluding with a chit

fund operator. Clause 30, for instance, requires  a

subscriber  to  produce  at  least  two  guarantors

before  he  can claim payment of the prize  amount.

There  is  apparently no prohibition  against  such

subscribers  mutually agreeing among themselves  to

be  guarantors for one another. Thus, by  means  of

such a mutual agreement, three subscribers can each

claim  payment  of the prize amount in  respect  of

three  chit funds even simultaneously. It is highly

probable  that  a reputable chit fund  company  may

have ruled in accordance with clause 24 (2) (d)  to

prevent   a   subscriber  from  being  a  guarantor

simultaneously.  Moreover, under clause  61(2)  (e)

the  Commissioner  may, with the  approval  of  the

Minister,  prescribe by regulations the  nature  of

security  to be given to the chit fund  company  by

the   subscriber   purchasing   a   prize   amount.

Nonetheless  it is rather alarming to me  that  the

proposed   Bill   should   provide   a   ready-made

opportunity  for  dubious  and  shady   chit   fund

operators  and  subscribers to make  hay  with  the

money  of bona fide subscribers. Rather than  leave

it  to  the discretion and good business  sense  of

chit fund



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



operators, it may be advisable to include  in  the

proposed  Bill  or the regulations  thereunder,  a

provision   requiring   guarantors   not   to   be

subscribers  who have purchased chit  fund  prizes

themselves  and who have not completed payment  of

contributions in respect thereof.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said earlier, the provisions of the

proposed Bill are as comprehensive as can be. Even

though  I  find it necessary to seek clarification

from the Minister regarding some provisions of the

Bill,  I  have no doubt that bona fide subscribers

require  the  protection that the  Bill  seeks  to

confer on them.



<br><br>6.35 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Augustine H. H. Tan -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Augustine H. H. Tan:</b> Sir, the main intent of this

Bill  is  salutary  and  I  welcome  it  for   the

protection  of the small investor. However,  I  am

wondering  whether it is not too comprehensive  in

embracing  the  so-called  hwei  or  tontine.  The

function of the tontine, usually run on a  village

level or among friends and relatives, is basically

to make consumption loans available for festivals,

wedding ceremonies or for educational purposes.  I

think the present Bill, by institutionalising  the

system,  may  penalise  the small  subscriber  who

cannot    readily   produce   the   two   required

guarantors,   or   who  may  be   precluded   from

membership   because   he  is   not   sufficiently

creditworthy. Perhaps the Minister might  want  to

consider exempting tontines with operations  below

a prescribed number of subscribers or sum of money

from the provisions of this Bill. I would not like

to  see financial options foreclosed to low income

people  if  they fail to meet modern institutional

requirements.  At  the  village  level  or   among

relatives   and  friends,  social  penalties   are

usually  enough  to  deter  tontine  operators  or

subscribers from embezzlement of funds.



<br><br>6.37 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I am pleased to hear the views

of  Members  on the Chit Funds Bill.  The  subject

matter  is one which has created a lot of interest

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



has   highlighted  the  difficulties   which   the

Ministry  of  Finance  has been  faced  with.  The

reason why it has taken some time to prepare  this

Bill  is that we were not quite sure whether  chit

fund   companies  should  be  legislated   against

altogether  or to be legislated for in the  manner

in  which  we have done so. The comments which  we

have  heard  from  Members  show  the  variety  of

opinions on the: operation of chit funds,  ranging

from  the  suggestion  that  perhaps  the  capital

requirements are not sufficient to the  suggestion

that  we  should allow tontine or hwei to  operate

because  it  is necessary for easy capital  to  be

obtained  in  the  rural  areas.  Our  problem  in

devising  the Bill was to fix a minimum sum  which

we   thought  would  safeguard  the  interest   of

subscribers to the hwei or tontine or kutu or chit

fund.  Finally, we fixed $200,000 as  the  minimum

capital  requirement. This is as much a matter  of

judgment as any other sum. We did in fact consider

$50,000  as  has  been suggested  by  one  of  the

Members. We also considered whether we should  not

legislate on the operation of chit funds  at  all.

Certain countries have decided that perhaps it  is

best  not  to  legislate at all. The  present  law

regards  the tontine as illegal and the number  of

people who have absconded with the pool from  very

naive and innocent subscribers is quite well known

to  all Members. Finally we decided on the form in

which  this Bill was to be drafted. While I cannot

claim that this is a perfect Bill, it has at least

devised  a  scheme which I think is  workable  and

which  we will be prepared to revise in the  light

of future experience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Jalan Kayu has suggested that

there should be a graduated scale from $100,000 to

$1 million, depending on the size of the chit fund

operations. In fact, there is already  some  basis

for  varying requirements. Apart from the $200,000

deposit, there are provisions for a limitation  in

the  amount  of  the operations  and  for  further

security to be given to the Commissioner. We  have

not  put in any specific sum in the Bill, but this

will be determined in the light of experience.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also suggested that we require a

team  of  inspectors and hopes that they  will  be

provided  to administer the Act. I can assure  him

that, as we have legislated for administration  of

chit  funds, it is our intention that the Monetary

Authority of Singapore, whom I have said  will  be

asked  to  administer the Act, will  be  furnished

with the necessary inspectorate to administer it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member has also pointed out that there is no

provision  for  chit  fund  companies  to   invest

compulsorily. We have suggested that part of their

deposits should be invested in local assets.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Anson also referred to the

deposit of $200,000. I have already answered  this

earlier.  He  thought the Act would help  the  big

operators  but  would  weigh heavily  against  the

small  operators  and  suggested  $50,000  as  the

minimum  deposit. He also suggested  that  perhaps

the   licences   should   be   issued   only    to

Singaporeans. In issuing licenses,  we  will  give

some weight to the character of the applicant, and

if  he  is  obviously not permanently attached  to

Singapore,  it  is  possible  to  provide  in  the

licence   that   certain  conditions   should   be

fulfilled. This is a matter which we will consider

as we go along in the administration of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has also been suggested that the agreement

between  the chit fund company and its subscribers

should be in several languages. There is no reason

why  chit  fund operators should not use different

languages in explaining the operation of the  chit

fund  to  their subscribers. I am sure that  those

with  business sense will find it useful. It would

be  advantageous to have explanations in different

languages. But even in conveyancing of  wills  and

property and so on, the English language  is  used

and perhaps it is convenient that there should  be

only  one  legal and official version of the  chit

fund agreement.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same Member has made a number of suggestions

which  I  think will be very useful,  and  I  will

certainly  consider them when  this  Bill  becomes

law.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>







<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have covered most of the points made

by Members.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Prof. Wong Lin Ken (Minister for Home Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs (Prof. Wong Lin Ken):</b> Mr Govindasamy, Sir, I beg to move, "That

the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Bill seeks to amend the Common Gaming

Houses   Act  (Chapter  96  of  the  1970  Revised

Edition) in the following ways:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To increase the penalty provided for the

offence  of  assisting  in carrying  on  a  public

lottery and all other offences relating to  public

lotteries;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To make provision to allow competent police

officers irrespective of rank to give evidence  on

documents   pertaining  to  any   public   lottery

produced before the court;



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To insert a new clause under section 13A to

provide  for  the  arrest and  search  of  persons

without a warrant when there is reasonable  ground

for



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



believing   that  they  have  on   their   persons

appliances for gaming; and



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) To repeal and re-enact section 23 giving

powers to exempt organisations from the provisions

of  this Act, to the Minister. Such powers are now

vested with the President.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Govindasamy, Sir, to begin with the amendment

to  section  4.  As the law stands at  present,  a

person found guilty of assisting in carrying on  a

public  lottery  and  all other  related  offences

shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $6,000  or

to  imprisonment  for a term not  exceeding  three

years,  or to both such fine and imprisonment.  It

is felt that this punishment is grossly inadequate

to  assist the police in their efforts t) suppress

the  operation of illegal lotteries in  Singapore,

the  commonest  forms of which are  the  so-called

"10,000  Characters Lottery" and the  "Chap-Ji-Kee

Lottery".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These lotteries are persistent in Singapore and

the  police  have found it extremely difficult  to

eradicate them. Running public lotteries  is  very

profitable.  They  are  so profitable  that  their

promoters  are  not  deterred  by  fines   imposed

presently.  Experience has shown  that  the  fines

imposed  on  offenders  have varied  substantially

from  court  to court, and in some instances  they

have  been  so  low  as to be  unrealistic.  These

variations   in  fines  have  not   in   any   way

contributed towards eradication and suppression of

these  lotteries. At present the maximum  fine  of

$6,000 is "chicken feed" to the big-time promoters

and hardly serves as a deterrent.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a well-known fact that invariably

promoters pay the fines imposed on the runners and

collectors,  and it is very rare  that  anyone  is

imprisoned  for  non-payment of a fine.  With  the

raising  of  the  minimum fine to $2,000  and  the

maximum  fine to $20,000, the promoters will  find

it  difficult to sustain payment of fines, as  the

running  of  these  lotteries  would  become  less

lucrative.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite some statistics to drive home this

point.   First,  the  statistics   on   raids   on

"Characters  Lottery". During the  years  1966  to

1970 the police



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



conducted  3,077 raids. A total of  1,399  persons

were   arrested,  of  whom  1,165   persons   were

convicted.  The  total fines for  all  these  five

years amounted to $479,315. In the last year alone

there   were   659   raids,   303   arrests,   214

convictions, with a total fine of $146,595.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite the statistics on the raids on "Chap-Ji-Kee Lottery". During the same period, that is

to say, from 1966 to 1970, there were 2,116 raids.

A total of

1,007 persons were arrested, of whom only 831 were

convicted.  The  total  fine  amounted   to   only

$391,277. The fines imposed were very low indeed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cite the fines imposed on persons who

were  convicted  of running "Characters  Lottery".

During  the  years  1966 to 1970,  the  fines  per

person ranged from only $295 to $685. For the same

period,  the  fines imposed on  people  caught  in

running "Chap-Ji-Kee Lottery" ranged from $291  to

$686.  These fines were very low indeed. The fines

imposed, as may be gathered from the statistics  I

have  cited, were negligible. More often than not,

they  were paid by the promoters. Taking the  1970

convictions   in   respect  of   the   "Characters

Lottery",  if  a minimum fine of $2,000  had  been

imposed, the fines would have totalled nearly half

a  million dollars as against the figure of  about

$147,000.  This would have adversely affected  the

profitability of running these lotteries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present the law does not provide for a

minimum fine, and the discretion to impose such  a

"minimum  fine" is left to the discretion  of  the

Magistrate who, more often than not, is left in  a

quandary.  The  fines are normally  based  on  the

value   of   documents   seized.   This   is    an

unsatisfactory method as, in some instances,  big-time  operators have got away lightly as the value

of documents seized has been negligible.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the police have managed to exercise a

certain  amount  of control over  these  types  of

offences,  the amendment would be an added  weapon

to them in their fight against this social problem

which   affects  every  level  of   our   society,

particularly the lower income



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



groups  who fritter away their earnings to bet  on

these  illegal  lotteries. The amendment  of  this

particular section will also bring it in line with

the  punishment  provided  for  book-makers  under

section  5 (3) (a) of the Betting Act (Chapter  95 of the 1970 Edition) which provides a minimum fine

of $2,000 and a maximum of $20,000.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now move on to the amendment of section

10.  With  the  amendment  of  subsection  (2)  of

section  10  of the principal Act by deleting  the

words  "not below the rank of Sergeant"  appearing

therein,  provision is sought to  allow  competent

police  officers  irrespective  of  rank  to  give

evidence  on  documents pertaining to  any  public

lottery  that are produced before the  courts.  At

present,  the  law  stipulates that  the  evidence

given by a police officer of and above the rank of

Sergeant  competent  to be a  "gaming  expert"  is

accepted.  This has resulted in the  inability  of

the   Gambling  Suppression  Branch   to   provide

sufficient  "experts" to meet  the  needs  of  the

whole  Force. The Branch is only staffed  with  an

O.C., one inspector, one detective staff sergeant,

one  detective sergeant, three detective corporals

and 14 detectives. The expert is not only required

to  give  "expert evidence" in court but  is  also

required  to examine all documents seized  by  the

Gambling  Suppression Branch  and  the  Divisional

Police.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, there are police officers in the

Gambling  Branch who would make competent  "gaming

experts" if not for their being below the rank  of

Sergeant.  The  amendment would greatly  alleviate

the   existing   difficulties  in  obtaining   the

services  of  competent  and  experienced   police

officers  in giving evidence on documents produced

before the courts.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with reference to the new section 13A, the

powers  sought  by this amendment  to  the  Common

Gaming Houses Act (Chapter 96 of the 1970 Edition)

are  similar to those accorded to the police under

section 13 of the Betting Act (Chapter 95  of  the 1970 Edition). The amendment will remedy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



the  present  defect  in the Act  which  does  not

empower a police officer to search a person who is

reasonably  suspected of being  in  possession  of

instruments  or appliances for gaming,  without  a

warrant,  although there may be very good  grounds

for  believing  that  the  delay  in  obtaining  a

warrant  may result in the escape of the offender,

or  the  disposal of the instruments or appliances

in   question.  This  amendment,  therefore,  will

greatly   strengthen  the  hand  of  the   police,

particularly  in  their efforts  to  curb  illegal

lotteries. The present legal requirement to obtain

a  search  warrant  to make a physical  search  of

anyone  reasonably  suspected  of  committing   an

offence  under  the  Act is  not  practical.  This

frustrates immediate police action and enables the

offender  to escape the law in good time before  a

warrant could be obtained.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let me proceed to the repeal and re-enactment of section 23. This re-enactment seeks

to  transfer the power from the President  to  the

Minister  to exempt organisations referred  to  in

the amendment from the provisions of the Act. This

is purely for administrative convenience.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed

<br><br><!-- Tuan Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Tuan Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Sir, I

beg  to  move, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last decade, the rapid industrialisation

in   Singapore   has   brought  economic   growth,

employment   and  affluence.  It   has,   however,

together  with urbanisation and population  growth

also  brought  problems of  pollution  of  various

kinds,   of   solid  waste  disposal,   of   human

settlement, of traffic congestion and so on  which

can   be  detrimental  to  our  environment.   Our

Government  is determined that these problems  are

contained   and  that  the  economic  development,

urbanisation and population growth will not create

an  environment which is not conducive to  healthy

living.  To do this, the Government has introduced

a  series  of  legislation to prevent and  control

pollution  of various kinds. It must be remembered

that  we occupy 225 square miles of densely built-up  populated areas with no rural hinterland to go

to.  We rank the highest in population density  in

the world. It is, therefore, vital not only in the

short  run but also in the long run that we should

waste no efforts in conserving our environment.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the Government started to monitor the air

last  year,  it  is found that the  level  of  air

pollution  has shown trends of increase.  In  some

parts  of the island the level has already reached

ambient  air  quality standards set  up  in  other

countries. Besides the general increase in ambient

air  pollution, there have been many instances  of

local  air pollution problems caused by industrial

and trade operations. This affects the comfort and

well-being  of  the people living  next  to  these

sources  of  air  pollution.  The  negligent   and

irresponsible attitude taken by the  occupiers  of

these premises has often been the cause of the air

pollution. This can be controlled.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Clean Air Bill, 1971 is yet another in the

series   of   legislation  to  ensure   that   our

environment  is healthy and pleasant to  live  in.

The   Bill  seeks  to  prevent  and  control   air

pollution. It must be remembered that air  is  one

of the essential commodities for the sustenance of

life.  We can live without food for many days  and

we  can live without water for a few days, but  we

can



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



live  without  air for only a few minutes.  It  is

thus  of  the utmost importance that  the  air  we

breathe is clean and not polluted with impurities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air pollution is the presence in the air of

concentrations  of  particulate  matters,   fumes,

smoke, and many other chemicals at levels that are

aesthetically displeasing or physically harmful to

man  and  his  environment. It  is  principally  a

problem in the highly urbanised industrial cities.

The  causes of air pollution are many. One of  the

main  causes is the incomplete burning  of  fuels,

such  as oil and wood wastes, in boilers, furnaces

and  incinerators. It is also caused by combustion

processes  in motor cars, aeroplanes  and  so  on.

Chemical  processing,  food processing  and  other

industrial  premises  like  steel  works,   cement

works,  cement  factories  and  so  on  can   emit

pollutants   of  various  kinds  and  in   various

quantities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of us have read or heard about smog in

London,   New   York,  Tokyo  and   other   highly

industrialised urban centres in the world and  the

aftermath of such occurrences. The ill effects  of

air pollution on human beings are numerous, and to

name a few, they are impairment of general health,

irritation  of  the eyes and throat,  and  chronic

bronchitis, especially in elderly people.  It  has

also  been  claimed to cause respiratory diseases.

Air  pollution also reduces visibility, spoils the

view, and denies the enjoyment of the delights and

beauty of nature. It can also cause economic  loss

through  high maintenance costs and loss  in  man-hours,  and  can also contribute to  the  physical

deterioration  of  the cities. It  has  also  been

claimed to affect vegetation and cause damages  to

crops and livestock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still at an early stage of

industrialisation   compared   to   industrialised

cities  in the developed countries. If we  are  to

learn  from  the experiences of these  cities,  we

must  make a start now to control and prevent  air

pollution. Industrialists, factory owners, and the

public   must   accept   the   collective   social

responsibility  to keep our air clean.  Negligence

now may lead to such



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450</b></font><br><br>



deterioration later that remedies become extremely

expensive to introduce. Legislation is required to

prevent this negligence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, to begin with, industrial and trade

concerns  should so conduct their operations  that

they  should  not  cause air  pollution.  Existing

industrial  and  trade  premises  may  find   some

difficulties in installing preventive and  control

measures  and  may, therefore, be  given  adequate

time  to  do this. This is only fair as when  such

premises were established there was no legislation

to insist on control measures. Their profit may be

cut  slightly, but this is a social responsibility

they  must  accept. We are at a stage of  economic

development when we can be more selective  in  the

types   of  industries  we  want  to  have.  Dirty

industries may add to the social cost of pollution

more  than  the economic benefits they can  bring.

These  types of industries will be rejected unless

they  are  prepared  to install expensive  control

measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Clean Air Bill, 1971, seeks to make

provision for the prevention and reduction of  air

pollution   arising  from  industrial   or   trade

premises  and such other premises as the  Minister

may   specify.  The  term  "industrial  or   trade

premises"  has been defined to mean premises  used

for  any  industrial or trade purposes or premises

on  which  matter is burnt in connection with  any

industrial  or  trade process,  and  includes  the

category   of   scheduled   premises.   "Scheduled

premises"  are premises which have been  specified

in  the  Schedule  to the Bill. Premises  of  this

category,  because of their type of industrial  or

trade  activities, are considered to have  a  high

potential  of  air  pollution,  and  include  such

premises  as ceramic works, chemical works,  metal

works and petroleum works.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I will highlight some of the more important

features of this Bill. The administration  of  the

Clean  Air Act will he vested in an officer to  be

styled  the Director of Air Pollution Control  who

will be assisted by other authorised officers.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of Part II of the Bill will

apply to the category called "scheduled premises".

Clause  4  provides that no person shall,  without

the  written  permission of the  Director  of  Air

Pollution  Control, occupy or use any premises  as

scheduled    premises.   In    considering    such

application, the Director may grant permission and

also specify certain conditions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 further elaborates on the requirements

and conditions that may be imposed by the Director

when  granting such permission. Scheduled premises

in  existence, prior to the coming into  operation

of  the Act, are exempted from having to apply for

such   permission  although  they  still  may   be

required  by  the  Director to  take  measures  to

control or reduce emissions of air pollutants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 prohibits the occupier of any scheduled

premises from doing certain alterations or changes

in  the  premises  or trade or industrial  process

without obtaining the permission of the Director.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provisions of Part III of the Bill will

apply  to  industrial and trade premises generally

including scheduled premises. Clause 8 imposes the

responsibility on occupiers of any  industrial  or

trade   premises  to  maintain  any   fuel-burning

equipment or any control equipment installed in or

on  the premises in an efficient condition and  to

operate the same in a proper and efficient manner.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 prohibits industrial and trade premises

from  emitting dark smoke from the chimney subject

to  certain  exceptions to be  prescribed  by  the

rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 prohibits the occupier of any

industrial  or trade premises from conducting  any

trade  or industrial process or operate any  fuel-burning  equipment or industrial plant in  such  a

manner as to emit air impurities in excess of  the

prescribed standards. The occupier is to  use  the

best  practical  means  necessary  to  prevent  or

minimise air pollution.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 empowers the Director to require the

occupier  of any such premises to take  preventive

or control measures in respect of air pollution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 empowers the Minister to extend the

provisions of this part of the Bill to such  other

class or description of premises as he may specify

by order in the Gazette.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV of the Bill deals with various

provisions;  they  are,  inter  alia,  powers   of

enforcement  of the Director and other  authorised

officers, disclosure of information, furnishing of

information, powers of entry, service  of  notices

and penalties for offences.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 15 empowers the Minister to prohibit the

use  of such combustible materials or fuel-burning

equipment  or industrial plant as may be specified

by the Minister by an Order in the Gazette.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 empowers the Minister to direct the

occupier of any industrial or trade premises  from

conducting  any  trade  or industrial  process  or

operating any fuel-burning equipment or industrial

plant  where  the emission of air impurities  from

such  premises is or is likely to be injurious  to

public health.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 17 contains provisions for any aggrieved

party  to  appeal  to  the  Minister  against  any

decision of the Director.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 21 would empower the Minister in his

discretion to exempt the occupier of any trade  or

industrial  premises  from  all  or  any  of   the

provisions of the Act.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, clause 25 empowers the Minister to make

rules  for  prescribing certain matters  that  are

necessary for the administration of this Act  and,

in particular, the prescribing of standards, tests

and types of control equipment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will note that this Bill does, not deal

with  air  pollution caused by the  exhausts  from

motor vehicles. This aspect is already being dealt

with  in other Ordinances and is best left out  of

the  scope  of this Bill. Air pollution caused  by

ships in the harbour is also dealt with in another

Ordinance.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The control of air pollution is a multi-disciplined effort, and in the implementation of

the  Act,  I  would  like to assure  you  that  a

balanced  approach  will  prevail,  taking   into

consideration not only the wider interests of the

community  but  also the narrower  interests  and

needs   of   other  sectors.  Our  goal   is   an

environment  that  will be conducive  to  healthy

living.  Failure  to control  air  pollution  now

would allow the problem to grow out of proportion

and  we  certainly would not want this to  happen

here, as is happening in many cities in developed

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Parliament, in accordance with

section  4  of the Foreshores Act (Chapter  270).

approves  the reclamation by Government of  those

portions  of the foreshores at Pulau Bukom  Besar

containing  a  total  area of  approximately  184

acres  as shown coloured green on the plan marked

"LAND OFFICE RECLAMAXTION PLAN NO. 4/71" which is

deposited in the Land Office, Singapore.'

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the Shell Eastern Petroleum (Private)

Limited  has reached agreement with the  Ministry

of Finance on the expansion of its oil refineries

in  Pulau Bukom Besar and Pulau Bukom Kechil. The

expansion project to be undertaken by the Company

will  involve  a total investment of  about  $356

million  and  necessitates  the  reclamation   of

approximately 147 acres of the foreshores on both

islands  as  shown  coloured green  on  the  plan

marked "LAND OFFICE RECLAMATION PLAN NO. 4/71", a

copy of which is displayed in the Library of this

Parliament for the information of Members.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed reclamation, which will be

undertaken  by  the  Company  as  agent  of   the

Government,  will  be carried out  in  stages  as

indicated  on  the  plan.  In  addition  to   the

expansion   of   the  existing   facilities   and

construction of storage tanks for crude oil, part

of  the  area  to be reclaimed will be  used  for

housing  a  social centre and office  facilities.

The whole reclamation is expected to be completed

by  mid-1973.  The surplus earth  from  the  site

preparation works on Pulau Bukom Besar and  Pulau

Bukom  Kechil will constitute the main supply  of

fill  for  the  proposed reclamation.  Additional

fill,  if  necessary, will be obtained  from  the

mainland. The cost of the reclamation, which will

be  met out of the total investment of about $356

million, is estimated at $40,600 per acre.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On completion of the reclamation, the reclaimed

land will be proclaimed as State land and will be

alienated  to the Company on terms and conditions

to be agreed with the Land Office.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That this Parliament, in accordance with

<hr size="2" noshade>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, Pulau Pesek, which is situated south of the

Jurong Industrial Estate, has a total area of 227

acres,  comprising 43 acres of highland  and  184

acres  of  foreshores. North of  Pulau  Pesek  is

Mobil's refinery at Jurong Industrial Estate, and

on  its  west  is Esso's refinery at  Pulau  Ayer

Chawan  and  the  Singapore  Petroleum  Company's

proposed refinery at Pulau Ayer Merlimau.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of applications for the alienation of

Pulau Pesek have been received by the Jurong Town

Corporation  from  the  oil  companies  for   the

expansion of their existing oil refineries in the

locality.  The Government has agreed in principle

to  allocate half of the island to Mobil for  the

construction  of its storage tank  with  a  total

capacity of 2.5 million barrels of oil, estimated

to cost $15 million. The other half of the island

is   reserved   for  allocation  to   other   oil

companies.  In order to enable the island  to  be

developed,  it  is proposed to  reclaim  the  184

acres of the fore-shores

as shown coloured green on the plan marked

"LAND OFFICE REXCLAMATION PLAN NO. 5/71", a  copy

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclamation will be carried out by the

Jurong   Town  Corporation,  as  agent   of   the

Government,  at an estimated cost of  $2  million

and is expected to be completed in a year's time.

The  necessary  fill for the initial  reclamation

will be obtained from the highland at Pulau Pesek

itself. At a later stage, additional fill will be

transported from the mainland.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole island, including the reclaimed

foreshores, will subsequently be alienated to the

Jurong  Town Corporation on terms and  conditions

to  be agreed with the Land Office to enable  the

Corporation  in turn to sub-lease the  island  to

Mobil and other oil companies.
