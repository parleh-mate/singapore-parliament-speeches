<div align="center"><b>TEACHING SERVICE SALARY STRUCTURE</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>RE-INTRODUCTION OF ONE PRINCIPAL ONE SESSION</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Education

whether  and  when his Ministry will commence negotiations

with  the  Singapore Teachers' Union on  claims  submitted

during  1961  relating  to  (a) anomalies  in  the  salary

structure  in  the  Teaching Service between  the

normal-trained,the  old  certificated-trained  and   the   new

certificated-trained teachers and the graduates;  and  (b)

the  re-introduction  of  the one  Principal  one  session

school system as was in practice before.



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak) (for the Minister for Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

the existing salary structure for the Education Service is

based on the scheme of service for the teaching profession

which  was  incorporated in the Scheme of Higher Services,

1953,  and  implemented with effect from  1.1.50.  In  the

course  of development of education in Singapore,  several

of  the  salary scales were modified and new salary scales

introduced   from   time   to  time   to   meet   changing

circumstances.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



The  consolidation of salaries in 1952, the  Ritsonisation

in 1953, the general revision of salaries for teachers and

other  groups of public servants undertaken in 1958,  have

all  had  their effects on the salary structure.  And  the

Ministry  of  Education  is  aware  of  certain  anomalies

therein.  So  with  a  view  to  regularising  the  salary

structure   which   might  have  become   administratively

cumbersome,  the  Ministry  of Education  has  proposed  a

revised  salary  structure for the  consideration  of  the

Salaries  Commission. It is understood that the  Teachers'

Unions   have  similarly  made  recommendations   to   the

Commission  on  the  scales  and  salary  structure.   The

Ministry  of Finance has advised the Ministry of Education

that  matters relating to salary scales should be referred

to  the Salaries Commission to be resolved by them. In the

circumstances, any negotiations on the salary structure of

the  teaching  service  must  await  the  outcome  of  the

deliberations of the Salaries Commission.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the second part of that question, the

re-introduction  of  one  Principal  for  one  session,   the

Ministry  of  Education is aware that  in  postwar  years,

there  arose the need to build more schools and  later  to

use  schools  as  two-session schools  to  cope  with  the

increase of the student population of Singapore.  At  that

time, the accent was on primary education. From about 1953

to  1959,  if  primary  schools were used  as  two-session

schools, there were two Principals. In 1960, to cope  with

the  new  policy  of providing education for  even  larger

numbers  of  children of school-going age, it was  decided

that  more  schools would be used as two-session  schools.

The move to put one Principal in charge of a school of two

sessions  was part of the effort of providing the  largest

number  of  children of school-going age with an education

on  an economic budget, coupled with the fact that it  was

considered  then that there were not enough teachers  with

the  requisite  experience  to  discharge  adequately  the

duties  and  responsibilities  of  Principals.  There  are

certain   administrative  disadvantages  in   having   one

Principal per session as questioned by the Member for Bras

Basah. Morning



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>



and afternoon schools will be separate entities, each with

its   own   Principal,  staffed  with  its  own  teachers,

accounts,   sports   equipment,  teaching   aids,   school

functions,  and  so on. But the building,  playing  field,

classrooms, furniture, storage space, school servants  and

watchmen, will have to be shared by both schools,  morning

and  afternoon.  Now this leads often to  misunderstanding

and  petty  bickering. In particular, it is difficult  for

school servants and watchmen to work under two independent

Principals.   The  annual  interchange  of   morning   and

afternoon staff will also present some difficulty  if  the

two   Principals   are  at  loggerheads.   All   in   all,

administration with two Principals will be more cumbersome

than having one overall head.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To assist the one Principal who is responsible for the

two  sessions, there are senior assistants provided at the

rate  of one senior assistant for every 15 classes, taking

both  sessions into account. The senior assistants  do  an

average of 10 hours 31 minutes of actual teaching  a  week

and  assist Principals with the administrative work on  an

average  of  8 hours 17 minutes per week, which assistance

is confined mostly to paper work and not to supervision of

the  staff, the standard and the discipline of the school.

This shows that the senior assistant is only effective  as

a  teacher  for 10 hours and 31 minutes per week  compared

with   the   average  for  teachers,  other  than   senior

assistants,  of  18 hours and 2 minutes per  week.  Senior

assistants do not receive any extra remuneration, but they

are  afforded  time  off  from teaching  duties,  and  the

administrative  experience  which  they  gain  as   senior

assistants  invariably  stands  them  in  good  stead  for

promotion purposes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of one Principal for one session has been

carefully  explored and consideration has also been  given

to  the idea of paying some form of remuneration to senior

assistants  vis-a-vis Vice-Principals.  Certain  proposals

have  been  put up for the consideration of  the  Salaries

Commission.  In  the  circumstances, and  because  of  the

proposals  put  up  to  the Salaries  Commission  in  this

connection, the decision in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



matter must await the outcome of the deliberations of  the

Salaries Commission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I understand from the

Minister  of State for Education that it is the  intention

of  the  Minister  to set up a Salaries  Commission.  This

Salaries Commission is to inquire into the salaries of all

the  civil  service.  I  am asking a  question  about  the

removal  of  the  anomalies that have existed  since  1958

until today. May I know whether the Salaries Commission is

to  inquire  into the revision of salaries,  or  into  the

removal of the anomalies in the salary structure, or both?



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, firstly, the Member

for Bras Basah, I think, made a mistake in stating that it

was   the  Minister's  intention  to  set  up  a  Salaries

Commission. It is no longer an intention. The Minister has

already  announced  last week that a  Salaries  Commission

will be set up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the question of anomalies and revision of salaries,

the  hon. Member for Bras Basah also missed the point when

he  questioned whether teachers were to be included in the

general  revision of salaries which will be dealt with  by

the Salaries Commission. As he is well aware, teachers are

also civil servants in Singapore. Therefore, they will  be

included  in the revision of salaries. Anomalies are  part

of  the  question of revision of salaries  which  will  be

considered by the Salaries Commission.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, may I know when and

how  soon this Salaries Commission will be set up? It  has

been  the practice of the Government to delay the  setting

up of a Salaries Commission and all that. It is always the

case that the setting up of a Salaries Commission takes  a

very,  very  long time. Will the Minister kindly  indicate

when this Salaries Commission can be set up?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I understood the Minister to say that it has

already been set up. Am I right?



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member

for Bras Basah is questioning when it will end.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> No. His question is when it will be set up.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> That, as you have stated, Mr Speaker,

was already answered earlier.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Lim Kim San):</b> Mr Speaker,

Sir,  a  Salaries Commission was actually set up  when  we

were  part of Malaysia. But after the separation, we  were

informed that our representative is no longer required  to

sit  on  it. Therefore, it will take us some time  to  get

members to serve on the Salaries Commission. I am sure the

Member  for  Bras Basah would not like any Tom,  Dick  and

Harry  to serve on the Commission. We want to see  justice

done and, therefore, it will take some time before we  set

up a Commission. Anyway, action is proceeding.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> So it seems the Commission has not been set

up! [Interruption] The personnel has not been named.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Will the Minister also inform us, when

this  Salaries  Commission is set up,  firstly,  will  the

views  of  the  civil service unions he sought?  Secondly,

will the Teachers' Union representative be allowed to help

the Ministry in drawing up the terms of reference?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the Member for

Bras Basah should be aware that Government always seek the

views of those who are interested. Views from the teachers

have already been submitted, if I am not mistaken, to  the

Malaysian Salaries Commission. And I can assure  him  that

we will seek further views if they are required.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> They want to

reduce their claims!



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ho See Beng:</b> Will the Government also give an

assurance  that  some of the claims of the  civil  service

unions  will be back-dated when the Commission make  their

findings?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lim Kim San -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Kim San:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have made clear my

stand on backdating a few days ago, and it has not changed

since then.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>MEDICAL FACILITIES FOR</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>AIDED SCHOOL TEACHERS</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho See Beng -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <b>Mr Ho See Beng</b> asked the Minister for Education

whether  teachers  in the aided schools are  not  provided

with  similar medical facilities as their counterparts  in

the  Government  Service, although they perform  identical

duties, and why.



<br><br><!-- Inche Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Rahim Ishak:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Singapore

Teachers' Union, the Singapore Chinese Teachers' Union and

the  Malayan  Christian  Schools Council  have  repeatedly

asked  that the same medical benefits and facilities  that

are accorded to Government teachers should be extended  to

teachers  of  aided schools. Such facilities, if  granted,

will,  of  course, apply to the other employees  of  aided

schools, such as clerks, servants, watchmen and so on. The

Unions  make much of Government's policy of equal pay  for

equal   work,  and  point  out  that  in  most  cases   of

negotiations, disputes and arbitration outside  the  civil

service,  medical  facilities and  privileges  are  always

enforced. While free medical treatment is accorded to  all

members  of  public  and  aided  school  teachers  at  all

Government hospitals and clinics, the Unions are concerned

mainly  with  the  hospitalisation  of  members  and   the

consequent  ward  charges, X-ray charges, specialist  fees

and  so on if they go to a paying ward, i.e., First  Class

or Second Class. The main difficulty in according the same

medical  privileges  and benefits  enjoyed  by  Government

teachers,  school  servants and so on of  Government-aided

schools is due to the fact that aided school teachers  and

servants   are  strictly  not  Government  servants,   but

employees of aided school management committees. As  such,

privileges and benefits, if accorded to employees of aided

schools,  may  have  to be extended  to  other  bodies  of

employees.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suggestion put by circular to the management

committees of aided schools that they should pay the  full

charges  for  medical  treatment  and  hospitalisation  at

public   rates  in  respect  of  their  staff   and   seek

reimbursement from such staff



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



at rates charged for Government service, is not acceptable

to  the management committees, and this they have informed

us.  We  are now examining alternative possibilities  like

the  introduction  of a medical benefit  insurance  scheme

operated  commercially with regard  to  the  provision  of

medical facilities. Such a scheme would probably involve a

certain  amount  of contributions either  from  the  aided

school employees or the management committees.

<div align="center"><b>APPOINTMENT OF CONSTITUTION COMMISSION</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Statement by the Minister for Law and National Development)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the cornerstones of the

policy  of the Government is a multi-racial Singapore.  We

are  a  nation  comprising peoples of  various  races  who

constitute  her  citizens,  and  our  citizens  are  equal

regardless  of differences of race, language, culture  and

religion.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst a multi-racial secular society is an ideal

espoused  by many, it is a dire necessity for our survival

in  the  midst of turmoil and the pressures of  big  power

conflict in an area where new nationalisms are seeking to

assert themselves in the place of the old European empires

in Asia. In such a setting a nation based on one race, one

language  and  one religion, when its peoples  are

multi-racial, is one doomed for destruction.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure this bias in favour of multi-racialism and the

equality  of our citizens, whether they belong to majority

or  minority  groups, a Constitution Commission  is  being

appointed   to   help   formulate   these   constitutional

safeguards.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of reference of the Commission are:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) To receive and consider representations on how the

rights of the racial, linguistic and religious minorities

can be adequately safeguarded in the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) To consider what provisions should be made to

ensure  that  no legislation, which by  its  practical

application is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



considered likely to be discriminatory against members

of  any  racial, linguistic or religious group, should

be  enacted  before adequate opportunities  have  been

given  for  representation from parties likely  to  be

aggrieved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) To consider what remedies should be provided for

any  citizen or group of citizens who claim that  he  or

they  have  been discriminated against  by  any  act  or

decision of the Government or the administration or  any

statutory board or public body constituted by  law,  and

to  recommend  the  machinery  for  the  redress  of  any

complaints.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) To consider how such provisions can be entrenched in

the Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government has given this matter careful

consideration  and has decided that this Commission  shall

consist  of legally qualified persons, who will know  what

is  feasible  and  practical of constitutional  guarantee.

They   represent   various  communities   in   the   legal

profession. They are:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chairman: The Chief Justice



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deputy Chairman: The Speaker

<div align="center"><b>CONSTITUTION (AMENDMENT) BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>2.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister (Mr Lee Kuan Yew):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

this Bill, the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, and the  one

following it, the Republic of Singapore Independence Bill,

will together



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



complete the formalities consequent upon the assumption of

independence by the State of Singapore. Mr Speaker,  Sir,

I  beg  your indulgence to refer to both Bills and to  the

documents which the two Bills together seek to amend.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Constitution of Singapore as it was on the 8th of

August this year, the day before separation, was contained

in  two  documents,  first, the  Federal  Constitution  of

Malaysia;  next,  the  State  Constitution  of  Singapore.

Together  they comprise the framework for the Legislature,

the    Executive,   the   Judiciary   and    the    Public

Administration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the document which was published on the 9th of August,

proclaiming Singapore as an independent State and  setting

up  the  agreement  between  the  Federal  and  the  State

Governments, that the Federal Government shall  relinquish

all   further  executive  and  sovereign  authority   over

Singapore and that that authority shall he vested  in  the

sovereign   Government  of  Singapore  and  the  sovereign

Legislature of Singapore, certain consequences have to  be

spelt out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first Bill, we have taken the State Constitution

as  the  basis  for  the Constitution of  Singapore.  That

remained  unchanged.  This Bill seeks  to  change  certain

terms  and seeks to amend certain of the Articles  in  the

State  Constitution,  such as the  election  of  a  Deputy

Speaker  which  has to be from an elected Member  of  this

Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to go through clauses 1

and  2.  They  are  simple and straightforward.  It  is  a

straight  change in nomenclature. Clause 3  sets  out  the

methods by which the Head of State, henceforth to be known

as the President of Singapore is to be elected, the period

of  his  term  of office, and the special  nature  of  his

office.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 4 and 5 will enable this House to appoint as

Deputy  Speaker, a person not necessarily a Member of  the

House.  We  have to mould the Constitution  in  accordance

with  our needs, and whilst it may be preferable  that  an

elected  Member of this House should occupy  the  post  of

Deputy Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



we  have found it in practice not necessarily a convenient

way of conducting the proceedings of this Chamber, and  it

is  the Government's intention that someone who is  not  a

member  of either Party should be appointed to this Chair.

The  schism between the Opposition and us is so  wide  and

almost  unbridgeable, that I think debates,  if  and  when

they are resumed with the Opposition, should be held under

conditions  which will make it manifest to all that  there

is   free  and  full  debate  within  the  rules  of   the

Constitution  and of this Chamber, without the  Opposition

fearing  any  bias  or favour on the part  of  either  the

Speaker  or the Deputy Speaker. After the passage of  this

Bill, it is our intention to seek the election of a member

of the Bar who is not connected with either of the Parties

in this House to assist you in discharging your functions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 7 revokes a clause which was introduced into the

State  Constitution of Singapore when it entered Malaysia.

Members  in  this House will know that there was  no  such

injunction of holding a by-election within three months in

our  previous  Constitution. We resisted  this  particular

condition being imposed upon the State Constitution at the

time we entered Malaysia, but our representations were not

accepted  because Malaysia insisted on uniformity  of  our

laws with the other States in the Federation and with  the

Federal Constitution itself. Since we are no longer a part

of  the Federal whole, for reasons which we find valid and

valuable  as  a result of our own experience of  elections

and  of government in Singapore, we have decided that this

limitation should no longer apply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 repeals Article 90 of the Constitution which

sets  out  the  mode  by  which the  Constitution  can  be

amended. Article 90 requires that there shall be  no  less

than  two-thirds  of the total number of  Members  thereof

supporting any amendment to the Constitution on the Second

and Third Readings.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, this and the other Article in the

Federal Constitution also requiring a two-thirds majority,

will be repealed. It is our considered opinion



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



that a two-thirds majority is not necessarily the best way

of  entrenching the Constitution. There will be  different

sections  in  the  Constitution dealing  with  matters  of

varying gravity. Some will be entrenched to a point where,

if  the  Legislature seeks to amend, a  reference  to  the

general electorate may be necessary. In others, we may  go

back to the mechanism which was used in Malaysia whereby a

two-thirds majority was required. In other sections,  such

as  the  number  of  Members in  this  Chamber,  the  less

fundamental sections of the Constitution which  order  the

delineation  of constituencies and so on, may not  require

any such special sanctity before amendment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point I would like to make is this. It is illusory to

believe  that because an amendment has to he passed  by  a

two-thirds   majority,   the   provisions   are    thereby

sacrosanct. From our experience in the short while we were

in  Malaysia,  we have found that in a situation  such  as

theirs, and indeed in a situation such as we have in  this

Chamber  where  the  Government  has  a  clear  two-thirds

majority, it is no impediment to the Government  to  alter

the  Constitution at will. In fact, in  the  case  of  the

Federal  Constitution, as Members may well know, some  250

amendments of various sorts have been introduced into  the

Constitution and incorporated into it since it  was  first

adopted in 1957.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 is a transitory provision whereby the Head of

State continues as President of Singapore from his present

function as Yang di-Pertuan Negara. Mr Speaker, Sir,  may

I, with your indulgence, run through the provisions of the

Republic of Singapore Independence Bill?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 1, title, nomenclature. Clause 2, change of

nomenclature. Clause 3 is the recital of a fact which took

place on the 9th of August this year -- that the Yang

di-Pertuan  Agong shall, as from Singapore Day, cease  to  be

the  Supreme  Head  of Singapore and his  sovereignty  and

jurisdiction   and  power  and  authority,  executive   or

otherwise,  in respect of Singapore shall be  relinquished

and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



shall vest in the Head of State of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 4 recites the fact that the executive authority of

Singapore  shall vest in the Head of State  and  shall  be

exercisable  by him or by the Cabinet or by  any  Minister

authorised by the Cabinet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 5 transfers the legislative powers of the

Parliament  of Malaysia to this House. Clause 6  sets  out

those  provisions of the Federal Constitution of  Malaysia

which  we  now incorporate as part of the Constitution  of

Singapore. Sir, in sub-clause (3) of clause 6, we have set

out the provisions which will not have effect.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Constitution of Malaysia is one

which   covers  the  relationship  between   the   Federal

Government  and some 14 State Governments. In  so  far  as

those  provisions  apply to the relationship  between  the

Centre  and  the  States, they are  expressly  to  be  now

excluded.  Part I consists of four Articles. It  sets  out

the  States,  the religion, the law of the  Federation.  I

shall  be  moving  an  amendment  to  exclude  Article  4,

together with Articles 1, 2 and 3 from the Constitution of

Singapore. The reason for that is as follows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 4 sets out that the Federal Constitution is the

supreme  law  of  the Federation; in other  words,  if  we

accept that particular Article as part of the supreme  law

of  Singapore,  then  any other law  found  in  any  other

document  is  subsidiary law, including,  of  course,  the

State   Constitution  of  Singapore.  There  are   certain

Ordinances  relating, for instance, to  citizenship  which

were  peculiar to Singapore and which, whilst we  were  in

Malaysia,  were  revoked  by way of  Modification  Orders,

Malaysia  seeking  to  unify  the,  citizenship  laws   by

extending its citizenship laws, rules and regulations into

Singapore  to the exclusion of Singapore citizenship  laws

and  rules  and regulations. Now, if this Article  stands,

then   it   will  not  be  possible  for  us   without   a

constitutional   amendment   to   revive   our   Singapore

Citizenship   Ordinance  and  the  rules  and  regulations

thereunder. So for that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



reason,  after  further consideration  consequent  on  the

First  Reading  of this Bill, we have decided  to  exclude

Article 4.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II deals with fundamental liberties. Article 5,

liberty  of  the person; Article 6, slavery  and  enforced

labour   prohibited;   Article   7,   protection   against

retrospective  criminal laws and repeated trials;  Article

8,  equality;  Article 9, prohibition  of  banishment  and

freedom  of  movement;  Article  10,  freedom  of  speech,

assembly and association; Article 11, freedom of religion;

Article   12,  rights  in  respect  of  education.   These

fundamental  liberties  will  continue  as  part  of   our

Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, you will notice in clause 1 of the

Republic  of  Singapore Independence Bill that  this  Bill

will be deemed to have come into operation as from the 9th

day  of  August, 1965, so that there will he no hiatus  in

the law.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 13 - we have specifically set out to exclude. The

reason is quite simple. This Constitution was drawn tip by

five  eminent  jurists from five of the major Commonwealth

countries  for  the old Federation of Malaya.  It  is,  in

form,   modelled   upon  a  similar   provision   in   the

Constitution of the Republic of India. Since  the  passage

of  that  section  in the Indian Constitution,  amendments

have  had  to be introduced because land reforms were  not

possible,  if  the strict tenor of the words  were  to  be

complied with. In other words, in clause 2, once we  spell

out   that   no  law  shall  provide  for  the  compulsory

acquisition   or   use   of  property   without   adequate

compensation,   we  open  the  door  for  litigation   and

ultimately for adjudication by the Court on what is or  is

not adequate compensation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year, if you will remember, Mr Speaker, Sir, we

moved  a  Bill to change the law regarding the acquisition

of  land  in  which  we  laid down  that  where  land  was

compulsorily  acquired for public purpose, no compensation

shall  be  payable  to the owner for any  appreciation  in

value  of  the  land  which  has  been  brought  about  by

development expenditure of the Government. It very often



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



happens, as it did in the case of the development  of  the

Jurong  industrial site, that when public funds have  been

expended  in  considerable amounts for the development  of

roads,  services, harbours, the adjacent land  appreciates

in value. And when it became necessary to acquire parts of

the   adjacent  land  for  the  expansion  of  the  Jurong

industrial  estate  either for  expansion  of  the  estate

itself   or  for  ancillary  services  such  as   schools,

hospitals,  and so on, we had to pay the owner  under  our

present acquisition laws the enhanced value of the land, a

value  to  which  he himself had contributed  nothing  and

which  was, in fact, created wholly by the expenditure  of

State  funds.  This Article will, therefore, be  excluded.

With  this exclusion our Land Acquisition Bill, which went

to  Select  Committee and was allowed to lapse because  of

the  doubt as to whether or not it could be said to be  in

compliance  with  Article 13, which is  the  supreme  law,

shall  he  proceed with. Whilst we were still in Malaysia,

we   had  sought  to  get  Article  13  excluded  in   its

application  to  us, but, in the nature of  things,  these

matters  either took a very long time for any decision  to

be  made or for some reason or other no decision was made.

Now the jurisdiction again reverts to this House and it is

our  intention  that the Land Acquisition  Bill  shall  be

proceeded with and Article 13 excluded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 6 sets out also the various other Articles which

are  to  be  excluded. For instance,  Articles  14  to  18

relating  to the acquisition of citizenship which  is  not

relevant   to  us,  because  they  refer  to  a  Malaysian

citizenship  which  is  no  longer  ours,  and  our  State

Constitution   already  makes  provision   for   Singapore

citizenship. Article 19A - transfer of citizenship to  and

from Singapore -- that again is no longer relevant.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 22 - citizenship by incorporation of territory - as

we  are  a  peace-loving nation, we have no  intention  of

incorporating  territories, as some other  countries  have

done. We have decided that it is more in keeping with  our

modest   and   peace-loving  attitude  to  world   affairs

generally to exclude this provision. Articles 28 and

28A -



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



application to certain citizens by operation of  law, and deprivation of citizenship - they no longer apply  because

we have our own provisions in the State Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IV, which refers to the structure of the

Federation's Supreme Head of State, Conference of  Rulers,

Executive,  Federal  Legislature,  Legislative  procedure,

Capacity as respects property, contracts and suits  -  all

those do not apply, and have therefore been excluded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V - Precedence of Rulers and Governors, Federal

guarantee  of State Constitutions, and so on  -  they  are

also not applicable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VI - Relations between the Federation and the States - is also excluded.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VII - Financial Provisions - is excluded. As you

will  see  from a Bill which has been introduced,  we  are

ourselves  introducing a separate  statute  to  order  the

procedure  by which the financial affairs of  the  country

will be conducted in this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part VIII - Elections - is again not applicable for the

elections  relate  to  Federal  elections,  and  our   own

elections are contained in the State Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part IX - Judiciary - we have taken in toto, with such

changes  mutatis mutandis to apply to the separate  status

of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part X - Articles 133 and 134 - Joint services, etc. and

Secondment  of  officers, expunged,  Article  139,  Public

Services  Commission, expunged, we have our own under  the

State  Constitution. Articles 141 to 143, Railway  Service

Commission,  General provisions relating  to  Commissions,

and  Conditions  of  service of  members  of  Commissions,

inapplicable.  Articles 146A to 148,  Branches  in  Borneo

States  and  in  Singapore of Judicial and  Legal  Service

Commission, Branches in each Borneo State and in Singapore

of  Public Services Commission - they are no longer to  be

applied  - going right on to Protection of pension  rights

and  Interpretation of Part X. You will see, Mr  Speaker,

Sir,  that  within this Bill itself we have  set  out  the

rules governing the transfer of personnel from the Federal

Government



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



back  to  the Singapore Government, and  the  Public

Service  Commission of the Singapore Government  will  now

again  reassert  its jurisdiction over the  whole  of  the

Public Service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Part XI is adopted in toto. Part XII is excluded, it

does  not  apply.  Reservation of  quotas  in  respect  of

services  permits, etc., for Malays, which  never  applied

anyway  to Singapore. "The Federal capital", "Commonwealth

reciprocity", and so on.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part XIII - Temporary and Transitional Provisions - is

not applicable. Part XIV - Saving for Rulers' sovereignty,

etc.  -  is not applicable. And all the various Schedules,

the  Third,  Fourth: Third is "Election of Yang di-Pertuan

Agong ..." and Fourth is "Oaths of office of Yang di-Pertuan

Agong".  Seventh  -  "Election  of  Senators"  and  Eighth

"Provisions  to be inserted in State Constitution".  Ninth

and   Tenth  -  "Capitation  grant,  State  road   grant",

inapplicable.  Eleventh - "Provisions of the Interpretation

and   General   Clauses  Ordinance,  1948,   applied   for

interpretation  of  the  Constitution"  and

Thirteenth - "Provisions  relating to delimitation of  constituencies",

all inapplicable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clause (4) of clause 6 sets out the transfer of the

various  powers of those parts of the Federal Constitution

which  are  applicable to Singapore to  the  corresponding

Ministers and their counterparts in Singapore - the powers

of  the  Yang  di-Pertuan Agong to  be  exercised  by  the

President;  the  powers of the Federal  Government  to  be

exercised  by the Government of Singapore; the  powers  of

the Federal Legislature to be exercised by the Legislature

of Singapore; the powers of the Prime Minister of Malaysia

to  be  exercised by the Prime Minister of Singapore.  The

powers of a Minister of Malaysia shall be exercised by the

corresponding Minister in Singapore or by such Minister as

may  be designated by the Prime Minister of Singapore. The

powers of the Judicial and Legal Service Commission  shall

be  exercised  by a Legal Service Commission  which  shall

consist of the following persons: the Chief



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



Justice, the Attorney-General, the Chairman of the Public

Service  Commission, a Judge of the  High  Court  and  two

members  of the Public Service Commission. The  powers  of

the  Police  Force  Commission shall be exercised  by  the

Public   Service  Commission.  The  powers  of  the   Lord

President of the Federal Court shall be exercised  by  the

Chief  Justice  of Singapore. The powers of the

Attorney-General  of  Malaysia shall be exercised by the

Attorney-General of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 7 sets out the position already obtaining, that

Malay,  Mandarin,  Tamil and English  shall  be  the  four

official  languages  in Singapore. The  national  language

shall  be  the  Malay language and shall be in  the  Roman

script.  The proviso sets out a guarantee that  no  person

shall  he  prohibited  or prevented  from  using  or  from

teaching or learning any other language: and nothing shall

prejudice  the  right of the Government  to  preserve  and

sustain  the  use and study of the language of  any  other

community in Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 8 invests the power of pardon on the President who

will  exercise  it in accordance with the  advice  of  the

Cabinet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 9 sets out the terms of the agreement between the

Malaysian and the Singapore Governments that all  property

which,  before Malaysia, belonged to Singapore or was  the

responsibility of Singapore will, after the 9th of August,

once  again revert to, and vest in, or devolve  upon,  and

become  the  property  of  or the  responsibility  of  the

Government of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 10 (1) deals with the status of all persons who

were officers of the Singapore Government and who, on  our

federating  with Malaysia, became servants of the  Central

Government,  and  now  revert to public  servants  of  the

Government of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, clause 10 (2) does not spell out the

position  which the Legislature of Malaysia  probably  had

sought  to  enact for us. If I could refer to the  Gazette

Extraordinary  of  the 9th of August, you  will  see,  Mr

Speaker,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



Sir, that the Federal Government, by the agreement reached

between  them  and us sought to arrange that  all  persons

who,  between Malaysia Day and Singapore Day, were engaged

by  the  Government  of Malaysia for employment  in  those

departments  which  were  departments  of  the  State   of

Singapore  before  Malaysia Day shall, on  Singapore  Day,

become  forthwith officers employed by the  Government  of

Singapore.  Now this does not coincide with our provision.

We  say  that  all  persons who between the  16th  day  of

September,  1963 - the day we became a constituent  member

of  Malaysia - and Singapore Day (9th of August this  year)

were  engaged  by  the  Government of  Malaysia  and  were

employed  in  those departments which were departments  of

the  Government  of  Singapore  before  the  16th  day  of

September,  1963,  shall on Singapore Day  become  persons

temporarily  employed by the Government of Singapore.  And

the  President may within twenty-four months of  Singapore

Day  confirm or terminate the employment of any person  or

class  of  persons  who are temporarily  employed  by  the

Government under the provisions of sub-clause (2) .



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, after the separation, we discovered

that  there had been considerable recruitment in what were

known  as the Federal Departments such as the Police,  the

Army  and  some other sections of our public service.  The

result  has  been that in the two years that  we  were  in

Malaysia  a large number of persons who are not  Singapore

citizens  and who come from the other States  of  Malaysia

have  now  become members of our own public service.  This

raises for us the question first, of principle, and second

-  even  more  important  than principle  -  the  question

whether this arrangement will be practical of application.

I  think  I would he less than honest to Members  of  this

House  and  to the public generally, particularly  in  the

absence  of the Opposition, if I did not say that we  were

very  loath  not  to  adopt in  toto  what  was  a  solemn

agreement arrived at between the Malaysian Government  and

us. It was an agreement which, in the nature



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



of  the  transaction,  was an extremely  urgent  one  and,

therefore, the main terms and conditions were agreed  upon

on  the  basis of major principle. But when we found  that

the  implementation of this would mean,  in  effect,  that

large  numbers of our own security organisation would  not

be  our own citizens, then a problem arose. We have  asked

the  Federal  Government whether they would  wish  to

re-absorb their own citizens into their services. In the case

of  the Army, I am happy to be able to tell the House that

all  those  who  are  not  Singapore  citizens  will  find

positions in the Malaysian services. However, in the  case

of  the Police, I am told by my colleague, the Minister of

Defence, that the complement for the police force  of  the

Federation is all filled up and that, therefore, they have

asked  us to deal with such recruits in our service as  we

think proper. This puts the burden on us. I would like  to

state  here what I think should be our policy with  regard

to  each  individual case. We do not start necessarily  on

the assumption that because a man is a Malaysian and not a

Singapore  citizen  he  will therefore  not  be  loyal  to

Singapore.  That is not necessarily true. In fact,  nearly

half  of our population are people who have come from  the

States of Malaya and who have shown over the course of the

years  that  they are extremely loyal to the country,  and

that  when it came to a moment of crisis, they were  loyal

to  their  first  responsibility -  that  as  citizens  of

Singapore.  However, we ourselves will have to  weigh  the

various considerations that will have to be borne in  mind

in  deciding whether a particular person is retained or is

not  retained in our public service. This applies, by  and

large,  to  those  in  the lower echelons  of  the  public

service.  I  am  told that there are  quite  a  number  of

Malaysian  citizens who have been engaged  in  our  higher

branches of the administration, in the legal service,  and

so on. And whilst this clause applies uniformly to all who

were  recruited in Malaysia, I think I can hold out a firm

assurance that we will continue the practice which we  had

before we entered Malaysia, namely,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



that  our  public service is open for competition  to  all

Singapore and Federal citizens and will continue to do so.

I  think  it is good for us and good for them and probably

good  for  both countries in the long run. But  there  are

certain  sectors where it is important that their  loyalty

should  in  no  way  be divided. As  you  well  know,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, situations may arise in which the  absolute

and unquestioned loyalty of the police can be a matter  of

crucial  importance to all of us and,  therefore,  it  may

well take as long as two years before we decide to do what

is  right  in  respect  of  the fairly  large  numbers  of

officers  who  have  been  recruited  since  the  16th  of

September, 1963. The group of persons is a limited one; it

cannot  grow  any more. We have once again  re-established

the  Police  Training School in Singapore and  no  further

recruitment   or  training  will  be  done  by   Malaysia.

Therefore,  the number of persons who will be affected  is

defined  and  their  positions will be resolved,  I  hope,

within 24 months of Singapore Day.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 11 sets out the continuance of the practice of

appeals  from  the  High Court to the  Federal  Court  and

thence  to the Privy Council. I think it would be  in  the

interest of the administration of justice if this were  to

remain so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 will automatically make it unnecessary for any

statutory  board,  whether it be  a  Government  statutory

board  or  whether it is a Council of the  University,  to

have representatives from any of the States of Malaya,  or

indeed  of  Malaysia, or of any appointee or nominee  from

any  body  or association or statutory board or Government

from  the  Malayan  States. Quite a  number  of  our  laws

provide for such representation and it is hardly necessary

for  me to say that this representation arose, first,  out

of  the fundamental premise that we were going to be  part

of  Malaysia;  and  then,  secondly,  whilst  we  were  in

Malaysia,  this  was  part of the Federal  framework  and,

therefore, representation of various States was allowed in

our  statutory bodies. For instance, a member of the  Port

of  Singapore Authority would be appointed by or nominated

by us on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



recommendation  or  on  the  submission  of  the   Federal

Government. Similarly, we have the rather absurd situation

where  the Singapore taxpayer and the Singapore Government

are  supposed  to pay for the upkeep of the University  of

Nanyang  and our representation on the Nanyang  University

Council,  together  with that of the  various  guilds  and

clans  and  other  associations which  are  interested  in

Nanyang University from the Singapore side, is outnumbered

by  somewhat like 3 to 13 or 3 to 11. There are 11  States

in Malaya and each little State nominates one member, with

the  result that we may find large sums of money to  which

we  have  committed ourselves being disposed of in  a  way

which may not accord with the interests of people who have

paid for the maintenance of this institution. But it has a

saving  proviso, that wherever it is deemed necessary  and

it  varies  from Ordinance to Ordinance, we may allow  the

representation to continue by way of Gazette notification.

I  could think of quite a number of instances where it may

be  useful.  I  do  not  think we will  have  any  serious

objection   to   the   Government   of   Malaysia   having

representation on our University of Singapore  Council.  I

do  not  think we would have any objection if they  sought

representation on the Nanyang University Council. But I do

think  that  we cannot put ourselves in the  position  now

where  our  money is to be disposed of in accordance  with

what  the  11 representatives from 11 associations  in  11

States of Malaya may decide amongst themselves. This is  a

matter which will have to he sorted out. I do not think we

object  to  all the 11 turning up provided they only  have

one  vote as against our three votes, since we are  paying

for all the development and recurrent expenditure.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I would like to add that this has been

done without any feeling of rancour or a desire to be  rid

of  people whom we do not like. It is just a neat and tidy

way  of  rectifying what needs to be rectified. Either  we

have to go through about 40 or 50 different Ordinances and

amendments will have to be made to each one, or we  do  it

by



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



an omnibus clause. This omnibus clause allows us, wherever

we  think  it  is  of value, to provide that  the  Federal

Government will still continue to have an interest in  our

institutions like the University of Singapore if they wish

to  continue. But where we feel the weighting is  somewhat

lopsided  as  in  the case of the University  of  Nanyang,

where  11 States versus Singapore one State, and Singapore

pays for the education and the upliftment of the minds  of

all  the  off-spring of the people in the 11 States,  then

the position must be set right. It may well be that, after

discussions,   there   is   no   objection   to   the   11

representatives turning up for meetings and observing  and

going  hack  to the 11 States and reporting  on  what  has

taken  place.  But  when it comes to  the  very  important

question of how monies are to be dispensed, then  we  must

have  a  fairly  decisive say as to what  happens  to  the

monies we ourselves have provided.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Article 13 is an omnibus clause setting out that all

existing  laws  shall  continue in  force  but  with  such

modifications, adaptations, qualifications and  exceptions

as  may  be  necessary to bring them into conformity  with

this Act and with the independent status of Singapore upon

separation from Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clause (2) of clause 13 sets out the various changes

in nomenclature consequent upon separation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clause (3) allows the President for a period of three

years  to  make such modifications in any written  law  as

appear  to him to be necessary or expedient in consequence

of  the  enactment of this Act and in consequence  of  the

independence of Singapore upon separation from Malaysia. I

sincerely hope that it would not take three years. This is

a  very  long time and we want a certain amount of clarity

and  finality in the law. It is our hope that by this time

next   year   the   deliberations  of  the  Constitutional

Commission on how to safeguard minority rights  will  have

concluded   and   we  ourselves  will  have   prepared   a

comprehensive  document setting out all the constitutional

provisions   applicable   to  Singapore,   so   that   the

Constitution of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



Republic  of Singapore will be neatly accumulated  in  one

bundle of documents. But even more important is the  state

of  the law generally. I am told by practitioners now that

it is quite a problem to find out which Modification Order

extends  which law from Malaya and revokes  which  law  in

Singapore.  These are some of the minor manifestations  of

empires, and are expected. We always believe that our laws

are better than those of the territory we have acquired or

incorporated.   Hence  a  considerable   number   of   our

Ordinances  were  set aside in favour  of  Ordinances  and

statutes prevailing in Malaya. Not unnaturally we  have  a

particular familiarity with our own procedures and our own

set  of  laws. In quite a number of cases, civil  servants

and  other  law officers who have to advise the Government

prefer  to  use  the instruments to which they  have  been

accustomed.  So  now a series of Modification  Orders  may

well be issued which will restore, by and large, what  was

the  position before Malaysia. But at the end of  it  all,

you  will notice, Mr Speaker, Sir, that there is  a  Bill

for  a Law Revision Commission. It is our hope that within

two  years  a  new  set of the laws of Singapore  will  be

available   not   only  to  practitioners   but   to   all

administrators, and everybody else interested  in  orderly

government  in Singapore, and everybody will  very  easily

determine  what  is the law applicable to  any  particular

subject he is interested in from a set of documents  which

will have the authority of this House.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sub-clause (4) is purely consequential. Sub-clause (5)

and  sub-clause (6) are of a consequential nature allowing

the  Prime  Minister to declare which is the corresponding

public  officer or the corresponding authority or body  to

exercise the executive powers which are contained  in  the

Federal Constitution.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now there are two amendments which I shall be moving,

Mr  Speaker, Sir, as I have mentioned. First,  to  remove

Article 4, for the reasons I have set out, that I  do  not

think it is possible for us to say that those sections  of

the  Federal  Constitution which will continue  to  be  in

force  in  Singapore  are supreme law because  that  would

imply that if



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



there is any contradiction or any conflict with either the

State  of  Singapore Constitution or any other  Ordinance,

then  our  own  Ordinance and our own State  of  Singapore

Constitution  will  have to give way,  and  it  is  not  a

situation which we desire. Ultimately what will be supreme

law  will be the Republic of Singapore Constitution  after

it has been brought up to date.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And second is an amendment to ensure ex abundante cautela

that  any  Act done by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara  or  the

State  Advocate-General before the enactment of  this  Act

shall   be   valid  notwithstanding  that  this   Act   is

retrospective as to its operation from the 9th  of  August

this year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I have set out candidly and in some

detail the reasons why we have made the various amendments

set out in the two Bills. After the enactment of these two

Bills and the various modifications have been done, it  is

possible  to put the Constitution in one simple  document.

But it will still be a cumbersome document because we have

inherited,  first,  a Federal Constitution  which  is  not

applicable  to  us  because we are not a Federation;  and,

secondly,  a  State Constitution which, in some  respects,

contains  a  number  of  provisions  to  bring   us   into

uniformity  with  the other States which  we  deem  to  be

irksome  and cumbersome. We have got rid of some of  those

items  which  we  consider unnecessary and cumbersome.  We

have  had to spell out who corresponds with the respective

executive  authority set out in the Federal  Constitution.

In  other words, what we have sought scrupulously to do is

to  state the law, the powers and the jurisdiction of  the

various  executive  authorities and  judicial  bodies  and

legislative   bodies  as  they  existed  before   Malaysia

transmuted into this new situation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of next year, we will have to decide

whether or not amendments should be made to the whole body

of  executive and legislative functions. It is  easier,  I

think, from the point of view of public confidence, in the

process of orderly government, if we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



were  first  to move into what were the  positions

occupied by the Federal executives. Whilst we were

part  of the component States of Malaysia, it  was

my impression that perhaps quite a number of these

provisions had a bias towards executive power. But

then  it  is  not a very fair assessment  to  make

because  at  that  time, as  you  will  know,  Mr

Speaker, Sir, there were moments when it looked as

if the overbearing weight of executive power might

fall  upon  our ears. Therefore, we did  not  take

kindly  to executive powers. It may well be  that,

in  the light of our experience in dealing with  a

difficult and truculent citizen, a certain  degree

of executive effectiveness may well be useful. But

my  general training as a lawyer leads me to  feel

that  a liberalisation of some of these provisions

may  well  be  in  keeping with the  spirit  of  a

tolerant  government  or a  tolerant  multi-racial

society  which  we already have in  Singapore  and

which  we  are seeking to consolidate.  I  do  not

think  it  is  possible, in the four months  since

separation,  to  come  to  any  finality  or   any

definite  conclusion on quite a  number  of  these

provisions. They are as they stand now, taken over

from Malaysia into Singapore, transferred from the

Federal  Government  to the Singapore  Government;

transferred from Federal Ministers, Heads of State

to  Singapore Ministers, their Commission  to  our

Commission, and so on. I do not think we have  any

vested    interest    in   continuing    with    a

constitutional framework which really in  extremis

means that the Head of State can, with certain key

Ministers  and Commanders-in-Chief,  proceed  with

orderly   government,  which  I  think   was   the

situation  and  contingency  for  which   it   was

intended. That is not the situation we would  like

and, therefore, we want to get away from it where,

by  a  series of judicious appointments in certain

key  echelons  of institutions of  the  State,  in

fact,  power  resides  within  a  very  small  and

compact  group  of  persons. I think  one  of  the

theories of democratic government is that power



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



should be effectively placed in the Executive  and

there  must  be  counter-balance, counter-checking

and  counter-vailing forces in the Legislature  and

in   the   Executive.  Thereby  we   ensure   that

government  is  for the majority in  the  majority

interest,   and  not  in  the  interest   of   the

continuance  of  any specific regime.  With  those

remarks,  I would hike to urge the Second  Reading

of this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read somewhere that this is not a very

tidy  way of doing things. I do not claim  it  is,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir, I have an extremely  competent

set of legal draftsmen in the Advocate-General and

his Chambers, and I can assure the House that when

due  consideration has been given to what we  seek

to  do  with these enormous executive powers which

were  available to the Federal Executive, then  we

shall put forward a comprehensive document which I

hope  will  endure.  The  main  thing  about   the

Constitution  is  that it must  work.  Never  mind

whether  it  is  the  work  of  good  judicial  or

juristic training. The Federation Constitution  in

1957 was the product of five eminent jurists.  But

the  fact  that it has had to be amended  no  less

than  250  times shows that either the people  who

had  to  work the Constitution were inadequate  to

the  demands  of  such a liberal Constitution,  or

that  the Constitution assumed a state of  orderly

society which did not prevail; and, I think, to be

kind and fair, probably certain factors caused the

necessity  for  250 amendments. I should  hate  to

believe,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  that  we  would  be

foolish enough to call five jurists to draw  up  a

perfect legal document for ourselves over which we

and  our successors may have to spend considerable

time taking division, as a two-thirds majority  is

required for each amendment, for no less than  250

times,  all in the space of about seven years.  It

is  my hope that we will he able to produce before

this  House  a document which will be workmanlike,

with  a  fair  spread of the powers  of  Executive

authority,  checks  and  balances  for  a   proper

account  of  the  use of these powers,  and,  most

important of all,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



ensure without major amendment the continuance of good and

orderly government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read  a  Second time." May I, in moving this,  remind  the

House that perforce we will have to take a division.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That the Bill be now read a Second

time."



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> The motion is now open to debate. There

being  no  debate, I take it the Prime Minister  does  not

intend to reply?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, Mr Speaker, Sir.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> As the Prime Minister has already indicated,

under the provisions of Article 90 of the Constitution  of

the  State of Singapore, this Bill as it now stands before

the  House shall not be passed by the Legislative Assembly

unless  it has been supported on Second and Third Readings

by  the  votes  of not less than two-thirds of  the  total

number  of Members thereof. It, therefore, means that  the

Bill  now before the House requires the votes of not  less

than 34 Members on its Second and Third Readings. After  I

have  put  the Question and after the Division Bells  have

been  rung for two minutes, the Clerk will call the  names

of  Members in alphabetical order and record each Member's

vote and the names of Members who abstain from voting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.08 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Sir, I have already dealt with the

contents of this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 452</b></font><br><br>



Bill   in  some  detail  when  I  moved  the  Constitution

(Amendment)  Bill, and it is not my intention to  re-cover

the  grounds. But I would just like to sum up what I  have

said, namely, that those parts of the Federal Constitution

which  were part of the Constitution of Singapore and  are

still  relevant for us in our new situation  -  first,  no

longer as a member of the Federal whole, and, second, as a

sovereign  State and Legislature on our own - have  been

adopted. The changes made are changes in nomenclature  and

the  transfer  of  powers  from the  various  bodies  that

exercise  this  authority in Malaysia to the  persons  and

bodies who will exercise this authority here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the view of my colleague, the Minister for Law, and

that  of the State Advocate-General and his Chambers  that

it  is  possible,  by  the  end of  next  year  after  the

Constitution  Commission has concluded its  deliberations,

for  us to decide to bring into one complete document  the

Constitution  which is now in four Parts - the  Federation

of   Malaysia   Constitution,  the  State   of   Singapore

Constitution, the Amendments to the Federation of Malaysia

Constitution  by this the Republic of Singapore  Act,  and

the  Amendments  to  the  Singapore  Constitution  by  the

Constitution (Amendment) Bill. In bringing these together,

of  course,  it  will  also be our intention,  as  I  have

indicated, to bring about such changes as I think will  be

possible  to  liberalise  the Constitution  and  make  the

weight  of  executive  authority less  inhibitive  to  the

Legislature and to the Judiciary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now

read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on the question of

the Constitutional procedure, again it will require a

two-thirds majority on Second Reading.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Prime Minister, the only obligation on

me  is  to  see that I have a two-thirds majority  on  the

Singapore Constitution Bill, but no such obligation is put

on  the  Assembly with regard to the Federal Constitution.

If the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 453</b></font><br><br>



House,  however, feels that it would be safer this way,  I

have no objection, but I felt that there was no obligation

on  this  House  to provide a two-thirds majority  of  any

amendment  to  a  matter outside the Constitution  of  the

State of Singapore.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Ex abundante cautela, I would urge

that  the House take a division after the Committee  stage

and on the Third Reading, the reason being as follows, Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I  think  a strict interpretation  of  the

responsibilities  as  set out in the  State  of  Singapore

Constitution  Act  refers to amendments to  the  Singapore

Constitution.  But it is open to anyone to urge  upon  the

Judiciary  that the passage of this Bill,  in  fact,  does

make  a  fundamental  alteration  to  the  nature  of  the

Singapore Constitution enactment, for it incorporates into

that  enactment all the Federal powers which were,  whilst

we  were in Malaysia, part of the Federal Constitution. So

that  there  can be no doubts about this matter,  I  would

urge that the Bill be passed by a two-thirds majority  and

that a vote be taken.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I entirely agree with Mr Prime Minister

that  this  would be the safer course, of course,  and  we

will  take it. If there is going to be any argument  about

it,  this will put it out of court completely. Perhaps the

House  will record a vote on the Second Reading. Ring  the

Division Bells.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Division Bells rung.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I will now put the Question again, "That the

<div align="center"><b>INTERPRETATION BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.30 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and National Development (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill

be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In most statutes, there is a section which sets out the

meanings which are to be attached to the particular  words

used  in  that statute. Such a section, the Interpretation

Section,  supplements  for  each  particular  statute  the

functions  performed for all statutes by an Interpretation

Ordinance  or  Act. The existing statute relating  to  the

interpretation of certain expressions used in our laws  is

the  Interpretation  and  General  Clauses  Ordinance  and

Chapter 2 of the 1955 Edition of the Laws of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Interpretation Bill now under consideration by the

House   re-enacts   the   provisions   of   the   existing

Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance  making  such

amendments as are necessitated by Singapore's status as an

Independent   Republic   together   with   certain   other

amendments considered desirable.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In general, it is the object of this Bill, like all

enactments  relating  to interpretation,  to  shorten  the

language of the statutes and to provide in our legislation

uniformity  of  expression, thus avoiding  superfluity  of

language. Within the compass of a single Act are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 457</b></font><br><br>



contained provisions pertaining to the definition of terms

and  expressions  used in all our laws, definitions  which

would  otherwise have to be specified separately  in  many

different  Acts, Rules and Regulations. For  example,  Mr

Speaker,  a  "monogamous marriage" is defined  to  mean  a

marriage  which  is recognised by the laws  of  the  place

where it is contracted as a voluntary union of one man and

one  woman  to  the  exclusion of all  others  during  the

continuance  of the marriage. Another example, "Singapore"

means  the "Republic of Singapore" and shall be deemed  to

include the island of Singapore and all islands in  places

which  on the 2nd day of June, 1959, were administered  as

part  of  Singapore  and all territorial  waters  adjacent

thereto.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in consequence of Singapore's

independent   status,   certain   definitions,   such   as

"Assembly", and the "Yang di-Pertuan Negara", which are no

longer to be used, are excluded and are substituted  by  a

new set of definitions. For example, the term "Acts", Acts

with  a  capital  "A",  is defined  because  the  laws  of

Singapore  will  no longer be known as Ordinances.  It  is

also expressly provided that in every written law prior to

the enactment of this Bill, references to the Assembly  or

the Legislative Assembly are to be construed as references

to Parliament; references to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara as

references to the President, and references to the Federal

Minister  as  references  to the appropriate  Minister  of

Singapore, and references to the State Advocate-General as

references to the Attorney-General.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II, Mr Speaker, relates to the general provisions

regarding written law and follows in general the  parallel

provisions  of  the  Interpretation  and  General  Clauses

Ordinance as the Comparative Table shows. Provision is now

made  in  clause  9  for references in Acts  to  sections,

Parts, Chapters or Schedules by numbers or letters only as

this  follows  the current drafting practice elsewhere  of

avoiding  the  repetition  of phrases  such  as  "of  this

section", or "of this Act" and so on in legislation, when



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 458</b></font><br><br>



the omission of these phrases would cause no ambiguity  in

the context.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part III, head "Subsidiary Legislation", deals with that

subject,  and it is now expressly provided that  authority

to  make subsidiary legislation ipso facto carries with it

the  power to provide penalties for contravention up to  a

maximum of $2,000 in case of a fine or one year in case of

imprisonment or both the fine and imprisonment. Similarly,

authority  to provide for reduction, waiver or  refund  of

fees or charges is to be read into any authority to impose

these charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powers and appointments form the subject of Part IV, and

a  new  provision in this part is to the effect  that  the

powers of a board, commission, committee or similar  body,

whether corporate or un-incorporate are not to be affected

by  any vacancy in membership, or by the fact that  it  is

afterwards  discovered that there was some defect  in  the

appointment or qualification of a person purporting to  be

a  member,  or again that there was any minor irregularity

in the convening of a meeting.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part V is concerned exclusively with the reprint of Acts

and  expands the existing provisions of the Interpretation

and General Clauses Ordinance. The provisions of this part

lay  the  foundation for the next Revised Edition  of  the

Laws of Singapore, for reprints often come in the vanguard

of law revision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parts VI and VII re-enact in the main the parallel

provisions  of the present Ordinance except  for  two  new

clauses.  Clause  46  provides that any  official  act  or

service  for  which  payment  is  required  need  not   be

performed until the fees are paid or the payment made for

it;  whilst  clause 47 states that the  general  power  of

reduction, remission, or refund of any prescribed  fee  or

charge  in  whole or in part is vested in the  appropriate

Minister.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, the Bill provides for the repeal of

the  Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance and  for

the   cesser   of   application  to   Singapore   of   the

Interpretation  and  General Clauses Ordinance,  1948,  of

Malaysia and the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 459</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modification of Laws (General Provisions)(Singapore) Order, 1964.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee

on the Bill. - [Mr E. W. Barker].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee; reported without

amendment; read a Third time and passed.

<div align="center"><b>NATIONAL REGISTRATION BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>4.46 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Labour (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a

Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The re-registration of the population is of vital

importance    to   independent   Singapore.    National

registration  was  first  introduced  in  1948  as   an

emergency  measure, but registration under that  scheme

was haphazardly done. The incorrect information and the

perishable nature of the identity cards issued, and the

deficiencies in the registration system have  made  the

existing   system  most  unsatisfactory.   Forgery   of

identity  cards  has been rampant and these  have  been

sold on a mass scale to illegal immigrants.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, one of the reasons for the Bill is

to  eradicate the forging of identity cards for sale to

illegal immigrants who have imposed themselves  on  our

social  services. Since Singapore is now  fighting  for

its   survival  and  endeavouring  to  build   a   more

prosperous  and just society, it is only  logical  that

the  fruits of our endeavours should benefit only those

who  are  right-fully  entitled to  them,  namely,  our

citizens. In fact, the Singapore Government drew  up  a

scheme  as far back as 1961 for the re-registration  of

the  population,  but  in anticipation  of  merger  and

Malaysia and in view of the fact



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 460</b></font><br><br>



that national registration would be a Federal subject, the

scheme was not implemented.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is another clear example of how the Federal

Government  had  deliberately neglected the  interests  of

Singapore when we were in Malaysia. For two years while we

were  in  Malaysia, nothing had been done by  the  Central

Government to implement the scheme; not even a single hint

from   their   high  officials.  In  the  meantime,   they

themselves  had  initiated and completed a re-registration

scheme  in  the  Federation and  issued  everyone  with  a

plastic identity card. They had treated Singapore  like  a

step-child  or a colony where they expected to harvest  40

per cent of our Federal revenue and did nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new identity cards that will he issued on

re-registration of the population will be laminated with

heat-resistant plastic by means of a special process. This will

ensure that the cards are forgery-proof, tamper-proof  and

water-proof. This is of the utmost importance  because  it

is essential to our survival and prosperity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two main objects of the Bill are set out in clauses 5

and 6. First, subject to certain exemptions which will  he

made  by  regulations, all lawful residents  in  Singapore

above  the  age of 12 will have to be registered.  Second,

those  who  are  in possession of existing identity  cards

issued under the provisions of the Registration of Persons

Ordinance,  1955, will also have to be re-registered.  For

the  dependants  of  foreign services personnel,  separate

administrative arrangements will have to be made with  the

respective foreign authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the re-registration exercise, it is essential to

distinguish citizens from non-citizens. It is,  therefore,

intended to issue two types of identity cards of different

colours:  one for citizens, and the other for non-citizens

who  are  permanent residents. This will tie up  with  the

Bill  providing  for  the issue of work  permits  to

non-citizens,  the Second Reading of which I will move  later.

By  a  glance  at  the  colour of the  identity  card,  an

employer  will  be  able to know whether  his  workman  is

required to carry a work permit or not.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 461</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In view of the special significance of an identity card

issued  to  a Singapore citizen, every person who  applies

for  such a card will have to provide adequate proof  that

he  is a Singapore citizen by birth or by registration. In

the  case  of  a  citizen by registration,  a  citizenship

certificate  must  be produced. In the case  of  a  person

claiming to be a citizen by birth, a birth certificate  or

other evidence to substantiate his birth in Singapore must

be produced, and the onus of proving such birth is on him.

However,  the evidence of a birth certificate without  the

name of the child or a birth certificate supported by only

a  Statutory Declaration to the effect that the person was

born  in Singapore, or an identity card which only  states

that the holder was born in Singapore will not necessarily

be  accepted  as sufficient evidence of such  birth.  This

provision is necessary, Sir, because in the past  we  have

found  many people who were not born in Singapore  at  all

but  using  other  people's unnamed birth certificates  or

those  of dead persons claiming to be citizens by  birth.

However,  we will be very tactful and considerate  in  the

implementation  of this provision, for we are  aware  that

there are still many people in Singapore who are genuinely

in possession of birth certificates without names. We will

use  every  means  to  track  down  the  forgers  and  the

impostors, and will ensure that innocent people  will  not

be unduly inconvenienced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the innocent people, the re-registration will prove

to  be  a  great  help  in establishing  their  status  as

citizens  by  birth. In the past they may have encountered

many  difficulties when they apply for passports  or  for

Housing  Board flats or other social amenities where  more

stringent proof is required to establish their citizenship

status.  But  if in the re-registration process  they  can

prove  once and for all that they are citizens  by  birth,

then  this  fact  will be written down on  their  identity

cards  which will serve as permanent documentary proof  of

their  citizenship status on all future occasions. And  in

time to come they may even afford to discard



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 462</b></font><br><br>



their nameless and worthless birth certificates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended to charge a citizen 50 cents and a

non-citizen $1 for the issue of a new identity card, and for a

replacement  identity  card a flat  rate  of  $5  will  be

charged.  However,  in  the case of  school  children  and

others  such  as persons receiving public assistance  from

the  Social Welfare Department, provision will be made  in

the regulations to exempt them from these charges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hon.  Members  will  realise  that  re-registration  will

involve  an  expenditure  of a large  sum  of  money.  The

imposition of a charge on the new identity cards which are

for  the  benefit of the people is, therefore, reasonable,

for  these  identity  cards  will  be  their  passport  to

prosperity and security and may last them for decades.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bill also provides for the compulsory notification of

change of residence within 14 days of such change. For the

convenience  of  the  public,  facilities  will  be   made

available  at  police stations, post  offices,  and  other

disseminated  centres where change  of  residence  can  be

effected.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is the problem of how to keep the address on

the identity card accurate. In many cases the addresses on

the  identity cards do not necessarily describe the places

where  the holders of the identity cards can be found.  In

the  outlying  areas, especially in kampongs and  villages

where  road names and house numbers are not to  be  found,

the  address  on  the identity card may  simply  mean  the

address   of   a  village  coffeeshop  which  the   holder

frequently visits to collect his mail or sip his coffee.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is also the question of colloquial names of

places.  Some  of  our  streets are named  after  colonial

rulers  in  the  past.  Their names are  so  difficult  to

pronounce that local people soon have to resort  to  their

own  way of naming the place where they live. A person may

come  and tell you that he is staying at such and  such  a

house number in Tai-poh. But Tai-poh may mean anywhere  in

Chinatown  around the Kreta Ayer area. In order to  secure

accurate addresses, it is our intention



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 463</b></font><br><br>



to  send  out a few teams to survey the area and to  visit

every family before re-registration in any particular area

is attempted. The family so visited will be issued with an

appointment letter showing the date when they should visit

the  Registration  Centre and the correct  description  of

their address.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-registration is understandably a massive exercise and

must  be  carried  out  smoothly and efficiently  with  as

little  inconvenience to the public as possible. The  work

of  re-registration will, therefore, be phased with school

children  and  those in Government institutions  like  the

Home  for  the  Aged, and so on. They will  be  registered

first, and the respective schools or institutions will  be

serviced  by  mobile  teams. The next phase  will  embrace

registration  of  workers  in  commercial  and  industrial

undertakings  with 20 or more persons  at  or  near  their

places  of  work. On completion of these two  phases,  the

third  phase  of re-registering the public will  begin  at

registration centres which will be set up in various parts

of the island.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the re-registration exercise does not

stop  at  just  the  issue of identity cards.  The  system

devised will ensure the compilation of more up-to-date and

reliable  population statistics, and in  due  course  will

give  each Singapore resident a number which will be  used

for   all   purposes  in  future.  This  is  an  essential

requirement to meet the goal of a welfare State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi (Kampong Kembangan)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, the Bill tabled by the Minister

for  Labour can be considered to be a Bill which  deserves

the  support  of all, as it will protect the interests  of

the  people  of  Singapore, and their livelihood  will  be

enhanced.  But I have a little doubt, and I am quite  sure

the people of Singapore are equally doubtful, and also the

Members  in this House, about the provisions of clause  12

of the Bill.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 464</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 of the Bill states that (a) birth certificates

without  names  (b) birth certificates without  names  but

supported by a statutory declaration and (c) cards  issued

under  the  Registration of Persons Ordinance, 1955,  will

not  be sufficient proof that such holders were, in  fact,

born in Singapore. Mr Speaker, Sir, this clause gives  me

grave  concern,  and I am quite sure  to  those  who  were

actually  born  in Singapore and who are in possession  of

birth  certificates  without  names,  or  those  who  have

mislaid or lost their birth certificates. At one time such

persons were informed by the authorities that there was no

need  for  them to obtain citizenship papers as they  were

born  in  Singapore. However, when this Bill becomes  law,

such  persons  will  no longer become Singapore  citizens.

Where  do they stand, Mr Speaker, Sir? Although  it  has

been  explained  by the Minister for Labour  that  in  the

implementation of the clause there will he flexibility  in

respect   of  those  who  are  in  possession   of   birth

certificates without names, Mr Speaker, I still  have  my

doubts   because  I  fear  that  such  persons   will   be

disappointed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I agree that there have been forgeries or

falsification   of  birth  certificates   without   names.

Nevertheless,  I believe there will be many  more  persons

who  were  genuinely  born in Singapore  but  whose  birth

certificates  did not state their names, and  persons  who

lost  or who cannot trace their birth certificates in  the

Registry  of  Births  and Deaths. I  myself  do  not  know

whether  the  Minister for Labour has a birth  certificate

with  his name on it. This is because our forefathers felt

that birth certificates would not be an important document

in  later years, for in their time birth certificates were

not  necessary at all. They paid very little attention  to

birth certificates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Mr Speaker, clause 12 will result in thousands of

genuine  Singapore citizens being deprived of  citizenship

because  they cannot trace their certificates, or  because

their  birth certificates do not have their names on them.

And when their citizenship is deprived, they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 465</b></font><br><br>



will   suffer  consequentially  -  deprivation  of  school

facilities, social welfare aid, and such other facilities,

while  people who were born outside Singapore but obtained

citizenship by registration could enjoy these benefits.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circumstances, Mr Speaker, I hope the Minister

for  Labour will give further consideration to clause  12,

so  that  we  will  not neglect our own  citizens  at  the

expense  of outsiders, particularly the benefit in respect

of paying school fees. As the Minister intends to charge a

citizen 50 cents and a non-citizen $1 for the issue  of  a

new identity card and $5 for a replacement, it is a burden

to  wage  earners in the low income group  who  have  many

dependants of ages above 12 and such persons must be given

free  new  identity cards. Through no fault of their  own,

they  should  not  be charged $5 for a replacement  but  a

nominal  fee.  And I suggest the issue of a  new  identity

card  should  be free of charge. Mr Speaker, this  clause

will  also  cause concern and anxiety to  many  people  in

Singapore, particularly those in the low income group, and

I  hope  the Minister will give due consideration  to  the

matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members</b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I see there are a number of Members who wish

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Debate resumed.



<br><br>5.41 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied): Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to

associate  myself with the views which were  expressed  by

the  Member for Kampong Kembangan, and I only wish to  add

one or two points to what he has said.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister, when he was speaking on the Second Reading,

said that when people register for plastic cards, it will



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 466</b></font><br><br>



cost  them  a dollar each and that if they lose them,  the

replacement cards will cost them $5 each.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> I think he said 50 cents.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Sir, 50 cents for citizens and $1 for

non-citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lingam: I am sorry, Sir, If a person is affected by a

fire,  flood or an accident, I do not think it is fair  to

charge  him  for  a  replacement card, because,  if  there

should  be  a  family consisting of about twelve  persons,

this will cost them a lot.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 (3) (b) of the Bill reads:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`a birth certificate without the name of the child, but

supported  by a statutory declaration to the  effect  that

the  birth certificate refers to the birth of the  persons

referred to in the statutory declaration'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, there are citizens of Singapore who have birth

certificates without names. But their parents, if they are

alive, can be asked to support their declarations for  the

purpose of re-registration and getting new plastic  cards.

The  question  of  persons  who  have  birth  certificates

together with statutory declarations made by their parents

should also be looked into.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Minister will look into these two points and

make  this  re-registration as easy as  possible  for  the

people of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr S. Rajoo (Farrer Park)(In Tamil): Mr Speaker, Sir,

I  wish to speak on certain matters regarding clause 13 of

this Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision is being made for registration, but certain

birth  certificates  do not bear the  names  of  children.

Names  may be omitted for certain reasons when births  are

registered.  There are some children who  seek  employment

after  graduating from schools and they  have  to  produce

birth certificates. I know of an 18-year old boy who  went

to  the Labour Exchange to get employment. He was about to

get  a  job,  but  he  was  asked  to  produce  his  birth

certificate. The certificate did not bear any name. He had

an  identity  card  issued  by  the  Government  with  his

photograph and name on it. But the Committee of  Selection

did not accept it; they just refused,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 467</b></font><br><br>



because  his name was not on his birth certificate.  The

reason for refusal was nothing else but just because the

birth certificate had no name.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the parents of a child whose name is not on the

birth certificate make a statutory declaration, and even

if  the  Government  refuses  to  accept  the  statutory

declaration, then the position in such a case is that  a

minor    citizenship   can   be   obtained.   But    if,

unfortunately,  the  parents  are  dead,  the  child  is

helpless.  I  would like to know then what will  he  the

position in such a case? Under such circumstances,  when

a  boy attains 21 years of age, he may apply for his own

citizenship.  But  he  may not get  any  opportunity  of

employment until he gets his citizenship. Therefore, his

chances of life and employment are wasted by four years.

In  another  case a boy has passed his Senior  Cambridge

examination. He applies for a Teacher-in-training  post.

He  is  rejected or asked to produce citizenship  papers

because  his birth certificate does not bear  his  name.

What happens in such a case is that when he applies  for

citizenship,  he is given a period of six  months  or  a

year to finalise his citizenship certificate. He may get

his  citizenship  a  year  later.  But  his  chances  of

admission  to the Teacher-in-training service  for  that

year is lost.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cases of adoption, the problem becomes more

complicated.  Under  the circumstances,  the  Government

should try to get the official records of the schools in

which  such children were educated, because their  names

will  be  found  there. If the name of  the  child,  the

statutory declaration and the nameless birth certificate

tally with one another, he should he given opportunities

in all fields of employment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui): Mr Speaker, Sir, I just want to touch

on clause 12.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a Chinese parent of the old school, the naming of a

child is a very serious matter. One does not go about  it

lightly. He has to consult people and books and until  he

knows whether his child is a boy or a girl, he cannot  go

about



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 468</b></font><br><br>



naming  it  in advance. Very often, he waits until  it  is

born  and  he takes quite a long time to think of  a  name

that  is  considered  suitable  and  respectable  to   the

grandparents, and all the rest of it. There are all  sorts

of  connections, even cousins and sisters; every link  has

to  be  considered. So it takes quite  a  long  time.  Not

realising  the importance of having a name recorded  on  a

birth  certificate, such a Chinese parent often  takes  no

trouble to have his child's name registered. I think after

a  certain number of years, if a name is not registered in

a  birth  certificate, you cannot have  it  done.  So  the

chance is missed. Because of this, we know that there  are

a  great  number of people in Singapore who possess  birth

certificates  without names. Clause 12  (3)  says  that  a

person  with a birth certificate without the name  of  the

child, but supported by a statutory declaration shall  not

necessarily be sufficient evidence for the purposes of

sub-clause  (1) . I would like to ask the Minister  whether  he

would consider a birth certificate without the name of the

child, plus a statutory declaration plus a passport --- either

a  Singapore  or  a Malaysian passport ---  as  sufficient

evidence for the purposes of sub-clause (1) .



<br><br>5.52 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson) (In Tamil): The Minister has

announced that 50 cents and $1 will be collected  for  the

issue  of  identity  cards. There are certain  people  who

receive public aid from the Social Welfare Department, and

I wonder whether the Government will grant an exemption to

them  from  paying these fees. They get  $46  a  month  as

public  assistance  for  the family.  If  there  are  four

members in the family, they have to pay -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. The Minister has said, I think in his

Second  Reading  speech,  that those  who  are  on  public

assistance will not be charged any sum of money for  their

identity cards. Am I right, Mr Minister?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong</b> indicated assent.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 469</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Govindaswamy (In Tamil): But there are poor people

who  may be adversely affected; they may not be well  off.

If  the Government is to collect $1 or 50 cents from them,

they may not be able to afford it. Sometimes, the card may

be  lost  and the stipulation is that they should pay  $5.

This will affect the poor people adversely. I request that

adequate changes and modifications be made.



<br><br>5.54 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sim Boon Woo (Changi): Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like

to  join my colleagues here who have made many suggestions

and criticisms on the National Registration Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 16 (3) reads as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`No woman shall be searched under this section except by

a woman.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, in order that there should be equality,

I suggest that no man shall be searched under this section

except by a man. Otherwise, Mr Speaker, it would be  very

embarrassing for a woman to search a man!



<br><br>5.55 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Ng Yeow Chong (Mountbatten): Mr Speaker, Sir, I just

want  to  be  very  brief.  Is it  the  intention  of  the

Government,  as a protective measure, to countercheck  the

registration  of citizenship by birth? Then  there  is  no

other  way  out  but  to accept the evidence  of  a  birth

certificate  with the name of the child. But surely  there

are many ways whereby we can establish whether a claim  is

genuine, such as birth certificates with names of  younger

brothers  or sisters showing the parents' names  identical

with  those of the one who does not have his name  on  his

certificate.  I  think that should  also  be  accepted  as

sufficient evidence.



<br><br>5.56 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have to thank my

colleagues  and  Back-benchers for  offering  very  useful

suggestions for the implementation of this Bill.  I  think

many Members have some doubts on clause 12 which provides



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 470</b></font><br><br>



that  a  birth  certificate  without  a  name  shall   not

necessarily be considered as sufficient evidence of birth.

I  think  here the operative word is "necessarily",  which

gives  the  officials  in  the  registration  centres  the

discretionary power to decide whether a man who produces a

birth  certificate  without a name  is  the  holder  of  a

genuine certificate belonging to him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must inform the House that this clause is mainly

devised  to  catch  impostors and  forgers.  I  think  the

officials  in the centres will do everything they  can  to

help   the   innocent  people  in  possession   of   birth

certificates without names to establish their  citizenship

status.  In  fact, in the long run, this will be  of  very

good service to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Farrer Park has cited the case of a boy

who  has  a  birth  certificate without name  and  who  is

finding  difficulty in getting a job.  Not  only  that;  I

think  he will also find difficulty when he grows  up  and

tries to get a house or a passport, because the possession

of  a  birth  certificate without a name is not conclusive

proof that the certificate belongs to him. So, in the

re-registration process, if this boy can prove with  all  the

relevant  documents, once and for all, that he was  really

born  in  Singapore, then this will save him  all  further

trouble.  Then he will not be faced with the same problems

in  future  when he applies for a job or a passport  or  a

house  or  any  other social amenities where  very  strict

rules have to be followed in regard to citizenship status.

In the long run, I think this re-registration will benefit

these   people.  In  the  re-registration   process,   the

officials  will try to help the people to locate evidence.

If  a  person has a birth certificate without a name, then

we  will  try to help him to locate his brothers,  parents

and  all  other relevant documents to prove  that  he  was

really  born  in  Singapore. This provision  is  necessary

because  of  the widespread forgery in birth certificates.

For  instance,  if  a  person in  possession  of  a  birth

certificate without his name dies, then his relative  will

be  able to sell this blank certificate to anyone; and  if

we  do  not have a provision in this law, then anyone  can

turn up with this blank certificate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 471</b></font><br><br>



and claim that he is a citizen by birth. So this law is to

discourage such illegal activities, and I think we will do

everything  to  see  that  innocent  people  will  not  he

inconvenienced.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Aljunied has said that the replacement

charge is a bit high for those people who, as a result  of

fire,  flood, or other disasters, have lost their identity

cards.  So,  this  will put a very heavy burden  on  them,

Therefore,  I  think  in  these  cases,  which  are   very

exceptional  and  could he called an act of  God,  special

consideration will have to be given.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to his suggestion that the living parents of a person

having  a  birth  certificate  without  name  can  make  a

statutory  declaration to the effect that  the  child  was

born  in Singapore, I think this is a good suggestion and,

in fact, the practice has been followed in the Citizenship

Registry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health

has   asked   whether  a  passport,   plus   a   statutory

declaration, plus a birth certificate without name, can be

considered  as  conclusive proof of a  citizen  by  birth.

Well,  I  would  say that if a person can  produce  enough

relevant  evidence like a passport and a  State  statutory

declaration  and  a birth certificate without  name,  then

this  can  be  taken  as  conclusive  proof  of  birth  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Members have said that the charge for the issue of

an  identity card to citizens at 50 cents and non-citizens

at $1 is a bit on the high side. But I must point out that

to issue this card costs the Government about 70 cents and

the  money  that we are charging them is only a negligible

amount as compared to the money that the Government has to

spend to provide these plastic cards. We have to buy  very

expensive  equipment from the United States  and  we  also

have to buy special plastics which can withstand very high

temperature.  All this costs a lot of money  and  this  50

cents  or a dollar is only a nominal charge for them.  And

also considering that this card will last them for life, I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 472</b></font><br><br>



think  the charge of 50 cents or a dollar is comparatively

cheap.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Mr Jek Yeun Thong].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill considered in Committee.



<br><br>6.13 p.m.



<div align="center"><h4>		 [Mr Speaker in the Chair]</h4></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clauses 1 to 11 inclusive ordered to stand part of the

Bill.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 -



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Lim Cheng Lock (River Valley)<b> rose ---



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Are you just going to speak on the Bill?

You cannot move an amendment, Mr Lim. If you are going to

speak  on  clause  12 with a view to finding  out  certain

things which are troubling you, you may do so.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Cheng Lock: Yes. That is what I am going to do.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed, "That clause 12 stand part of the

Bill."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lim Cheng Lock: Mr Speaker, Sir, the provision

contained  in clause 12 is going to affect many  thousands

of   bona   fide   Singapore  citizens  who   have   birth

certificates, but without names. Although the Minister has

given the House an assurance that sub-clause (3) shall not

necessarily be sufficient evidence for the purposes of

sub-clause  (1)  and  the  officers in charge  will  be  given

discretion, I am afraid this will definitely open the door

to  corruption.  I  would  like  to  seek  the  Minister's

assurance   that   he   will   consider   making   special

regulations, which I believe he is empowered to do in this

Bill,  for those citizens who were born here but who  have

no  names  on  their birth certificates, and  for  special

centres and special offices to deal with this category  of

persons.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 473</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Are there any other Members who wish to

speak on this clause?



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): At the time when

the Minister was moving the Second Reading of the Bill, he

stated  that it would not necessarily be evidence. As  was

stated  by  the Member for River Valley, this  leaves  the

door open for corruption, because a person who has a blank

certificate  and  who  is  able  to  gratify  the  officer

responsible  would be issued a plastic  identity  card  by

him,  while those who are not in a position to gratify  to

satisfy  him  would be told that, according  to  law,  the

birth   certificate  could  not  be  taken  as  conclusive

evidence. So I would suggest that the Minister for  Labour

take particular care to see that nothing would happen,  as

mentioned  by  him when moving the Second  Reading,  since

there  are many forged identity cards being sold. If  this

matter  is  not looked into very carefully, then  what  he

fears will happen.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sia Kah Hui: I think it is a very good suggestion.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Just a minute. The interpretation is not

over yet.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sia Kah Hui: I think it is a very good suggestion by

the  Member for River Valley, that a special centre should

be  opened to cater specifically for people who have birth

certificates  without names. And to further  assist  these

people, the Minister could issue a notice of some kind  to

members  of  the  public that certain types  of  documents

would  be  acceptable, and list them, something like  what

they  have  in the Immigration Department, when you  apply

for  your aged parents to come or your wife or husband  to

come   - they  have  this  printed  on  the  back  of   the

application  form.  These  documentary  proofs   must   be

produced  before the case can be considered, so that  cuts

out  possibilities of corruption. It means  that  everyone

concerned  knows that if he can produce certain documents,

then he can satisfy all the requirements and his case will

not  be  left  to the whims and fancies of  the  officials

concerned in this matter.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 474</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Chan Choy Siong (Delta) (In Mandarin): Mr

Speaker, a little while ago the Member for River Valley

suggested that a special registry should be set up to deal

with applicants who have birth certificates without names

on them; in other words, that they can go to such places

to apply for identity cards. I have another suggestion.

The suggestions by other Members are also good.



<br><br>6.15 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such special registration offices are set up, people

will be inclined to overlook the necessity to register the

names of their children on the birth certificates, because

they know that there is such a special registration office

to  suit  their  convenience. As far as I understand,  the

main  reason  why  certain people have birth  certificates

without  name  is  that their parents  did  not  pay  much

attention to such practice. Only within this decade people

tend to view birth certificates with more concern. So,  if

it  is  possible,  the  Minister may  adopt  some  of  the

provisions used in dealing with people who have concubines

to  deal  with  such a situation as I have mentioned.  For

instance,  we have a Women's Charter which provides  legal

protection for women. Now everybody can have but only  one

wife. What I mean to say is that because of past practice,

there are some people whose birth certificates are without

names. Is it possible not to re-register such people whose

birth   certificates  are  without  names  but  who   have

sufficient  documents to prove their claims? I would  like

to  say  that this is the time when everybody should  know

the  importance of birth certificates, and if the  parents

overlook  the importance of filling up the names of  their

children,  then they have themselves to blame. Because  if

we  set  up special centres to register such people,  then

they  will still be inclined to neglect the importance  of

having names on birth certificates.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Culture (Mr Fong Sip Chee): Mr Speaker, Sir, I do not wish to be

a fence sitter on the subject here, but there are pros and

cons in this



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 475</b></font><br><br>



matter.  On  the  subject of birth  certificates  without

names,  I think earlier on the Member for Upper Serangoon

and  the  Member for Delta have both dealt with it  to  a

very  considerable extent. I would like to point out that

there  is another instance where a man could come  before

any  of  the  government officers  and  produce  a  birth

certificate without his name and claim it as his own.  In

fact,   there  are  cases  like  that.  Some  unfortunate

children were lost in the war or perhaps they passed away

during  the Japanese occupation in Singapore. There  were

no  proper records kept by the authorities on births  and

deaths.  These  certificates, without the  names  of  the

children, later on found a good market, particularly with

illegal  immigrants, and some other people who considered

that  it  would  be more convenient to  buy  blank  birth

certificates at, say. $200 each from the parents  of  the

children  who  died  during the Japanese  occupation  and

treat them as their own. Therefore, clause 12 is intended

to tighten up such loopholes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to seek the Minister's clarification on one

other  matter,  that  is,  there are  persons  with  birth

certificates without names, and yet their flames appear on

the   electoral  register.  This  peculiar  situation  was

created  by  the  former Lim Yew Hock Government  back  in

1957.  I  would like to ask the Minister whether the  fact

that a person whose name appears on the electoral register

and  who  at the same time has a birth certificate without

his  name  on,  but  has no citizenship papers,  could  be

regarded as having sufficient evidence to prove that he is

a  citizen of Singapore? As I said earlier, the provisions

are  intended  to  regularise the very  peculiar  position

prevailing  now. I do urge the Minister  to  see  that  no

undue  and  unnecessary inconvenience is caused  in  cases

which they consider to be genuine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point. Mr Speaker, is that when this Bill comes

into  effect,  a  person   can  he  confronted  by   the

authorities  which  say  that the possession  of  a  birth

certificate without his name is not sufficient evidence to

prove that he is



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 476</b></font><br><br>



a  citizen of Singapore. It appears to me that there is no

provision in the Bill to cover the interim period. In such

a  situation, a person applying for his registration  card

cannot prove that he is a citizen of Singapore, whether or

not  the status quo of the legal position of these  people

is maintained or recognised by the authorities.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Sia Kah Hui: Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to seek

clarification from the Minister. If I am not  mistaken,  I

think the public generally assume that if their names  are

on  the  electoral  registers,  then  they  are  Singapore

citizens. I think probably that would be the impression of

the  public. Is it the intention of this Bill  that  those

people whose names are on the electoral registers, but who

cannot produce documentary evidence to prove that they are

either citizens by birth or citizens by registration, will

have their names removed from the electoral roll?



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Chairman:</b> Mr Minister, in reply.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,I have already said

that this clause is not designed to catch innocent people.

If  it  is so, then I am afraid quite a number of us  here

will he caught by this Bill, and found without citizenship

status. I, myself, am in possession of a certificate  with

a  different name. The peculiar custom of our people  here

is  that when a father is blessed with a child, he  cannot

know first whether it will be a boy or a girl. If it is  a

boy, he has to give him a boy's name, and if it is a girl,

he  has to give her a girl's name. After it is known  that

it  is a boy, the whole family becomes excited. So, for  a

period,  no name is given to him. Temporarily he  will  be

called  "Ali Kow" or by some other name. When the  midwife

calls, they just give his nickname. When he grows up, they

find it rather awkward for him to carry on still with  the

old nickname which describes him as a pig, a cow or a dog.

So he has to change his nickname to a proper name. Quite a

lot  of  our  citizens here, although they were  genuinely

born  in  Singapore,  are either in  possession  of  birth

certificates without names or with different names.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 477</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officials in charge of registration will have to be

very  careful in weighing the pros and cons of each  case.

Some Members have suggested that special centres should be

set  up, to deal with these certificates without names.  I

think  this is a very good suggestion. If this  is  to  be

carried  out,  I  think one centre  will  not  be  enough,

considering the large number of persons without  names  on

their birth certificates. This is a good suggestion and it

will   be  passed  on  to  the  officials  in  charge   of

registration for them to make recommendations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health has asked whether applicants of new identity cards should be asked to produce any type of document. I would say yes, because clause 19 provides power for the Minister to make regulations, and among the subjects under clause 19 (2) (c) is "the nature of information and documents to be

furnished for the purposes of registration".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say, when the re-registration campaign is

started,  a complete set of regulations will be  published

informing the people about the type of documents they have

to bring with them to the centres.



<br><br>6.30 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the remarks about the electoral rolls, some people

have  birth  certificates without names, but  their  names

appear  in  the  electoral rolls and they  have  voted  in

several elections and the Referendum. This is because  our

electoral  rolls  were  compiled in  accordance  with  the

counterfoils  of  our  existing identity  cards.  When  we

issued  identity cards in 1948, no proof was  required  to

substantiate  the  claim  that  a  person  was   born   in

Singapore. In those days there was no citizenship and  the

people  did not pay much importance to citizenship papers;

that  was when we were still under colonial rule. In those

days,  the  official just took the word of the  applicants

for  granted.  If  they  said  that  they  were  born   in

Singapore,  the officials just put down on their  identity

cards that they were born in Singapore. If they said  that

they were born in China, then the identity cards would



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 478</b></font><br><br>



show  that  they were born in China. Because of this,  our

electoral  rolls are actually not very accurate,  as  they

were  compiled  according  to the  counterfoils  of  these

identity cards. In future when we have completed  our

re-registration  campaign, if we find that some persons  with

identity cards show that they were born in Singapore,  but

if we can prove that they were not born in Singapore, then

I  am  afraid their names will have to be struck  off  the

electoral  rolls  unless they apply for citizenship  under

registration. Otherwise it would not be fair  to  put  the

person who is not a citizen on the electoral roll. I think

that is all I have got to say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 12 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

<div align="center"><b>REGULATION OF EMPLOYMENT BILL</b></div>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order for Second Reading read.



<br><br>6.36 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,

"That the Bill be now read a Second time."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, we are all aware that the influx of people from

Malaya has been on the increase. The majority of them have

come  with nothing other than their bare hands and  hungry

stomachs,  because their Ministers have not done  anything

to improve their lot in the Federation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1964, we had a net increase of some 10,000 Malayans.

In the first ten months of 1965, we saw a further increase

of  some  10,000 more. The Prime Minister of Malaysia,  in

answer  to  a  question in his own Parliament,  said  that

there were 800 families from Singapore who had applied  to

go  to  Johore to open up the jungle. This is not  a  true

statement  of  fact, Sir. The figures in our  Registry  of

Persons show that from August to November this year  6,319

Malayans   came   down  to  Singapore   as   against   423

Singaporeans going up to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 479</b></font><br><br>



the  Federation in the same period. I do not  think  these 423  Singaporeans  have  gone to Johore  to  open  up  the

jungle.  I  suspect they were managerial staff or  skilled

labourers of Singapore commercial firms on transfer to the

Federation. In November alone 2,320 Malayans came down  to

Singapore as against only 78 Singaporeans going up to  the

Federation.  Nobody in his sound mind  would  abandon  the

comfort of city life and go into the wilderness unless  he

is  driven to it. But we are not driving away any  of  our

citizens  to  the jungle. In fact, some of  the  Singapore

U.M.N.O. members have accused the Government  of  forcing

the  people  to evacuate their slums in the  kampongs  and

putting  them into flats which are the products of  modern

civilisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitherto, we have freely allowed workers from Malaya to

come to Singapore to seek employment, because, before  us,

there  was a golden avenue to economic union and a  Common

Market. But the prospects dimmed and gradually disappeared

because  of  the policy of the Government of  Malaysia  to

isolate   Singapore  and  pressurise  her  into   economic

subjugation. Since their Government is not SO friendly  to

our  people and tries to stifle our industrial growth, why

should we make our amenities available to their people? We

can no longer allow the Federation Ministers to dump their

unemployed into Singapore at the expense of our  citizens.

They  must  be made to do some work and face reality.  Nor

can   we   allow  non-citizens  without  skill  to  impose

themselves on our educational, medical, housing and  other

social facilities and amenities. These we have provided at

enormous  cost for the benefit of our workers in order  to

bridge  the  gap  between  the haves  and  the  have-nots,

thereby  building  a just and equal society.  It  is  with

considerable reluctance that the Government has decided to

introduce this Bill to provide some measure of control. If

such  a decision is not taken, the standard of living  now

enjoyed  by  our workers will be seriously  affected.  Our

economic and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 480</b></font><br><br>



social  burdens will become unmanageable, and our  attempt

to build a more just and equal society will he nullified.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the intention of the Bill is not to bar all

non-citizens  from  employment. Under  it,  all  non-citizens,

whether  they  are seeking employment or  are  already  in

employment  at  a  basic salary of not more  than  $750  a

month,  will  he  required  to obtain  work  permits.  For

practical application and administrative convenience, this

rate  of  pay is considered to be sufficient to cover  all

workers  in the unskilled and semi-skilled categories  for

the  purpose of regulating their employment. Control  will

only be exercised at the point of recruitment, because  it

is  our  intention  not  to impair the  free  movement  of

persons between Singapore and Malaya. Work permits will be

freely  issued to non-citizens who have special  training,

skills  and qualifications. In fact, we will welcome  them

because  there  are  ample  employment  opportunities  for

skilled   workers   and  professional  persons   who   can

contribute substantially to our economic development.  But

work  permits  will not be issued to incoming non-citizens

in the unskilled and semi-skilled categories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I must assure the House that the

enforcement  of  the Bill will not give  rise  to  adverse

repercussions. Non-citizens already in employment for some

considerable  time  will not be displaced.  They  will  be

issued  with  work permits so that they  may  continue  in

employment  even though they do not possess  the  required

skills.  Allow me to elaborate a little on  the  basis  on

which  work  permits will be issued. All non-citizens  who

have been in employment before the 1st of June, 1961, will

be  issued  with  work  permits  liberally,  whilst  those

employees who began employment between 1st June, 1961, and

16th   September,   1963,  will   be   given   sympathetic

consideration  if  they are married and  their  wives  are

permanent  residents  of Singapore. Those  employed  after

16th  of September, 1963, but before 9th of August,  1965,

will  also be given the same consideration if, in addition

to satisfying these two conditions, they have children who

are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 481</b></font><br><br>



permanent  residents  of Singapore. Special  consideration

will  also  he  given to non-citizens  who  are  permanent

residents  and already in employment if they are  children

of  Singapore  citizens, or whose children  are  Singapore

citizens.  It  must  be  remembered,  however,  that  each

application will be considered on its own merits and  that

while we may issue work permits to non-citizens already in

employment, we cannot promise that they may be issued with

work permits again if they fall unemployed subsequently. I

must stress that work permits will not be issued to recent

arrivals  with  no  family roots in  Singapore,  including

those  who  have been in employment since 9th  of  August,

1965, unless they possess special skills. The provision of

this  Bill can only reduce the pressure of population from

Malaysia.  With Singapore serving as a beacon for  a  high

standard  of living and an equal and just society  in  the

dark  sea of a feudal, corrupt and unjust society, I  feel

that  people will continue to gravitate towards Singapore.

There is nothing we can do about it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our next step will be to strengthen the various

licensing authorities, like the Hawkers Department and the

Registry  of  Vehicles, so that our streets  will  not  be

choked  with hawkers and pirate-taxis from the Federation.

The  main  object, of course, is not to drive  the  people

back, but to stop a future influx. These measures may,  in

the long run, have beneficial effects on the people of the

Federation, for once we make them realise that they cannot

escape  from  their  cruel reality by  taking  a  trip  to

Singapore,  they will stay put and rally  more  people  to

fight for a better life in the Federation. This will shake

the  whole  structure of the existing  social  system  and

spark off a revolutionary wind of change and, in the  end,

the  common  people who are true Malaysians in heart  will

emerge victorious.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question proposed.



<br><br>6.47 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche Mohd. Ariff Bin Suradi</b>(<i>In Malay</i>): Mr Speaker, on

the whole,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 482</b></font><br><br>



this  Bill  is good for the people of Singapore.  It  will

mean  more employment to the people of Singapore. I merely

wish  to touch a little on what has been explained by  the

Minister  just  now.  Non-citizens  who  are  already   in

employment  will  be issued with work permits.  Those  who

were  employed  before  1963  will  he  given  sympathetic

consideration. However, Mr Speaker, Sir, I fear that with

regard  to  those already in employment before  1st  June,

1961, employers will misuse the provisions of this Bill by

terminating the services of those who are non-citizens  of

Singapore  before  1st  June,  1961.  This  will  give  an

opportunity  to  employers  to retrench  workers  because,

according  to  clause 7, workers who have been  retrenched

because  of their work permits being withdrawn cannot,  or

the  unions cannot, negotiate with the employers  on  this

matter. This is in clause 7 (3) (a), (b), (c) and (d).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under clause 7 (3) (a), the union cannot represent such

category  of workers and negotiate with the employers.  No

action can be taken by such trade unions. Under sub-clause

(d),  the  matter cannot he discussed under the Industrial

Relations Ordinance. Since this Government is a pro-labour

Government and it has an Industrial Relations Ordinance, I

hope  the Minister for Labour can enlighten me further  in

respect  of  non-citizens who are  already  in  employment

before  1st  June, 1961, so that they will not become  the

victims of those employers who are anti-union.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Jek Yeun Thong, in reply.



<br><br>6.50 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, our first

responsibility is to our citizens. For those who are

non-citizens but who have been resident in Singapore for quite

some time - not after Malaysia but long before

Malaysia - then  the  scheme here will provide that they  be  issued

with work permits liberally. For those who were already in

employment  before 1st June, 1961, they will  be  eligible

for  work  permits  and  will be  allowed  to  keep  their

employment.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 483</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan has alleged that an

employer  may  try to exploit the workers by  abusing  the

provisions  in  this  Bill.  In  such  a  case,  I   think

inspectors of the Labour Ministry will have to keep an eye

on  such employers. This will clear the doubts of the hon.

Member.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the disability of the union to take up the case

for dispute of a worker who is dismissed because he is not

issued with a work permit by the Government, I think  this

restrictive provision is necessary. Because if  this  Bill

is   enforced,   there  may  be  some  cases   where   the

Commissioner  for Employment is unable to issue  a  worker

with  a work permit, and in such cases the employer, under

the  provisions  of this Bill, will have  to  dismiss  the

worker, if  we allow trade unions to take up these  cases

for   dispute,  then  there  will  be  disputes  all  over

Singapore.  This  situation will  not  contribute  to  the

stability  of  our  economy,  and  I  think  it  is   most

undesirable.  So  because of the  possibility  of  such  a

situation  arising,  we  have to  put  in  this  Bill  the

provision that trade unions cannot either take up the case

of  a  worker who is dismissed because he was  not  issued

with  a work permit, or bring it up before the Arbitration

Court under the provisions of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 484</b></font><br><br>



the industrial Relations Ordinance. This provision is

necessary to safeguard the peace in our industrial  field;

otherwise  if  the Government decides to cancel  the  work

permits  of  workers  in  several  firms,  we  will   have

widespread  strikes all over Singapore. Therefore,  if  we

are  to enforce this Bill and the measures provided in it,

it is necessary that we have to make such a provision.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question put, and agreed to.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill accordingly read a Second time and committed to a

Committee of the whole Assembly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assembly immediately resolved itself into a Committee on

the Bill. - [Mr Jek Yeun Thong].
