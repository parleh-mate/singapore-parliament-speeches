<div align="center"><b>Debate on the Address</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Third Day)</b></div>



<br><br>2.37 p.m.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Order read for resuming adjourned debate on

Question [14th December, 1965],



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the following Address in reply to the

speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara be agreed to:-



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Legislative Assembly of Singapore,

express our thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara

for the speech which he delivered on behalf of the

Government at the opening of the present Session

of this Assembly.".'. - [The Prime Minister].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 203</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> At the close of yesterday's sitting.

the Minister for Labour was holding the House.  He

now has the Floor. Mr Jek.



<br><br>2.39 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the Deputy

Prime  Minister  of  Malaysia has  suggested  that

Singapore  should go its own way  and  should  not

interfere  with the affairs of Malaysia.  This  we

will  gladly do if they would also keep  to  their

own  word.  But  what happened was that  when  our

Prime  Minister talked about political eunuchs  in

the  Federal  Cabinet  or the  Sultans  and  their

multiplicity of wives, they immediately sent us  a

protest    note   through   diplomatic    channels

complaining  that we were interfering  with  their

internal  affairs. When we announced our intention

to   resume  barter  trade  with  Indonesia,  they

stepped in and objected to the scheme, giving  the

flimsiest reasons for their objection. Is this not

a  blatant interference with our internal affairs?

They   claimed  that  resumption  of  trade   with

Indonesia,  even  though on a small  scale,  would

jeopardise the security of Malaysia. But everybody

knows  that  their  own traders  are  carrying  on

barter trade in Tawau, Pulau Ketam -



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Order. I have allowed the Minister

to  continue  in the vein that he  has  because  I

thought that it was relevant that the House should

understand  the  circumstances which  led  to  the

separation of Singapore from Malaysia  up  to  the

9th  of  August. Events subsequent  to  that  date

which  concern  the  Federation  of  Malaysia  are

matters  which should not he touched upon by  this

Assembly.  But  if they are matters subsequent  to

the  9th of August which arc relevant to Singapore

and which have been mentioned by the Ministers  in

the  Federation, then those matters may he touched

upon and no other. I hope I have made myself quite

clear to the House, because I am going to be  very

strict about this from now on.



<br><br><!-- Dr Toh Chin Chye (Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr Toh Chin Chye):</b> On

a  point  of  clarification, Mr Speaker,  Sir, I

think  the  Minister mentioned in his speech  just

now the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 204</b></font><br><br>



exchanges of diplomatic notes between Kuala Lumpur

and  Singapore. He was referring to this  exchange

and the circumstances under which this protest was

put forward. So I think it would he quite relevant

if,  in the process of explaining the events which

took  place after the 9th of August, matters which

are  relevant to the events are brought up in  the

speech. I would very much he obliged, Mr Speaker,

if   you  could  he  a  little  generous  in  your

interpretation  of what should be debated  on  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara's Speech.



<br><br><!-- Mr A. P. Rajah (Mr Speaker) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Speaker:</b> Mr Deputy Prime Minister, as I have

said  in  my  ruling. I consider that  any  events

subsequent  to the 9th of August touched  upon  by

Ministers of the Federation pertinent to Singapore

may  be  touched upon by Members in this House.  I

would  request Members of this House,  while  they

are  so  doing, to use temperate language and  not

intemperate   language,   because   if    it    is

intemperate, I shall rule it out of order, not  on

the  basis of subject matter but on the  basis  of

language.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I am

grateful for your ruling.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If their traders can have barter trade with the

Indonesians  in  Malaysian territories,  then  why

cannot  we  trade with Indonesia in Pulau  Senang,

which is 12 miles away from our main island? This,

I  think, is like the case of the Chinese  proverb

which says that high officials are allowed to  set

fire  to  a  town, but the common people  are  not

allowed  even to light a lamp in their own  house.

If  they  are  so concerned about the security  of

Malaysia  and the security of Singapore,  then  it

should   he  their  duty  to  help  Singapore   to

industrialise, because a contented people will not

so  easily  fall into the hands of the Communists.

But  instead  of doing this, they  clamp  down  on

trade  between Singapore and the Peninsula.  Every

sane  person knows that by denying access of their

markets  to our manufacturers, there can  be  only

one   consequence  -  the  slowing  down  of   our

industrialisation  programme.  This  would  create

conditions  most favourable for a Communist

take-over in Singapore.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 205</b></font><br><br>



If,  as  a  result of their foolish measures,  the

people  in  Singapore lose hope  in  a  democratic

government and turn to the Communists,  then  what

will  be  left of Malaysia's security and defence?

Everyone knows that the defence of Malaysia  rests

on the British bases in Singapore. Can Malaysia be

defended with a Communist base in Singapore?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to come to the question of

the  payroll tax which was also mentioned  by  the

Member  for  Bras  Basah. This tax  was  foolishly

imposed  by the then Federal Minister for Finance.

It  has  the ill-effect of discouraging  employers

from  employing  more labourers that  we  have  in

surplus.  When we were in Malaysia, we opposed  it

strongly in Parliament. But since this has already

been  imposed  on  us  and since  they  have  been

collecting  it for about a year, we do not  intend

to  stop  it  yet. Instead, we intend  to  use  it

solely  for the benefit of the workers. We  intend

to set aside the revenue collected under this head

to  form  a  fund for the social security  of  the

workers.  We  will set up a committee  to  put  up

recommendations  for  the  implementation  of  the

scheme.  As  what we have done in  all  our  major

labour legislation and policies, the N.T.U.C. will

be the first we would approach for their views and

suggestions on the scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion on

the debate.



<br><br><!-- Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid (Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister (Inche Buang Bin Omar Junid)</b>(<i>In Malay</i>):

Mr  Speaker, Sir, I support the Address in  reply

to the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan Negara on the

8th of December. We are now a free and independent

State  and, therefore, we have to work  harder  to

fight for the bright future of our citizens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the citizens of Singapore have shown their

determination to make Singapore a State that would

be  successful  and prosperous.  It  is  only  the

members  and  leaders of the Barisan Sosialis  who

hope that Singapore would face destruction so that

it  would be possible for them to make use of  the

opportunity for their own ends. That is why we see

there is not a single one



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 206</b></font><br><br>



of  them  present in this House. This is  a  clear

indication  that  they  are  truly  out  for   the

destruction of the interests of Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, as a State that believes in democratic

socialism, is facing all sorts of enemies. We face

threats   from   the  Communists  and   the

pro-Communists,   as   represented  by   the   Barisan

Sosialis.  We  are  also facing intimidation  from

reactionary    elements    as    represented    by

conservative  forces in U.M.N.O., the  M.C.A. and

the M.I.C. Apart from that, we are also faced with

intimidation from the remnants of the colonialists

who  carry out their evil machinations which  help

towards  the achievement of the ends of those  two

forces mentioned earlier. They hope that Singapore

would fail in its effort to survive, and they work

hard to damage the economy of the State. These are

the  people  who often shout out the  slogan  that

Singapore will not survive without the cooperation

of others, particularly Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our State has no desire to he an enemy of anyone,

particularly of our neighbour, Malaysia. In  fact,

the  desire of the Government of Singapore  is  to

maintain  co-operation with them, particularly  in

the  economic and commercial fields. But a  matter

which  must be duly considered is that if economic

co-operation is to be maintained with Malaysia, we

do   not   wish   any   Party,  particularly   the

conservative  reactionaries  of  the   Right,   to

imagine  that, without co-operation with Malaysia,

Singapore will fall. Singapore can survive on  its

own.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we have often heard U.M.N.O. leaders

in  Singapore saying that for Singapore to  be  an

industrialised  State, it  must  depend  upon  raw

materials from Malaya. What they mean to  say  is,

how is Singapore to become an industrialised State

without  raw  materials such as  tin,  rubber  and

other  raw  materials? I wish to say to them  that

for  us  to industrialise, raw materials  are  not

important. Take, for instance, Japan. It does  not

have  iron  ore  or  rubber. Nevertheless,  it  is

highly industrialised and produces motor-cars  and

other  manufactured goods for  their  people,  and

these goods are exported to the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 207</b></font><br><br>



people  of Malaysia. Malaysia, on the other  hand,

which has raw materials such as rubber and tin, is

not producing motor-cars and exporting them. It is

not   industrialising.  A  Singapore  without  raw

materials need not necessarily mean that it cannot

industrialise.  On  the  other  hand,  although  a

country  has  raw materials, it is not necessarily

an industrialised country. So all the talk that to

he  an  industrialised State, the State must  have

raw materials, is not exactly true.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore will prosper with its

industrialisation.  Daily  we  see  industrialists

from foreign countries coming here to observe what

is  going on in Jurong. Our people have been going

to  Japan  and industrialists from Japan have  all

said  that our economy is stable and they are keen

to come and build factories here.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our country will prosper. I call upon all the

citizens of Singapore to unite solidly behind  the

Government, to work hard and be realistic in their

attitude. By the will of God, we will succeed. The

Government of Singapore will defend the rights  of

the  people,  irrespective of  race,  language  or

religion. It will defend the welfare and interests

of  the  various  races  of Singapore.  All  these

things will be written in the new Constitution  of

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the Malays in Singapore need

not  fear that the P.A.P. Government will not look

after  their interests and welfare. The Government

is  grateful  for the confidence  that  they  have

placed  in  it in the last general elections.  The

fact  that  the  Malays  in  Singapore  voted  for

members  of the P.A.P. is an indication that  they

have full confidence in the P.A.P. Government.  We

will not betray their confidence placed in us.  We

will  defend and protect the interests and welfare

of  them  all.  In  the  multi-racial  society  of

Singapore, the Malays have a part to play. Let  us

all,  irrespective  of race,  work  hard  to  make

Singapore  a  prosperous and  happy  country.  The

P.A.P.  Government is working  hard  in  order  to

bring   about  a  society  which  is   happy   and

harmonious  because it is by this means  that  our

people will be able



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 208</b></font><br><br>



to  live happily and in peace. That is the  reason

why, while we were in Malaysia, we fought for such

a   society  through  the  call  for  a  Malaysian

Malaysia.  But  because of that, we  were  evicted

from  Malaysia. We must never forget the two years

that we were in Malaysia, and we believe that they

in Malaysia will not forget that too.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boycott of the Barisan Sosialis of this House

clearly  shows that they have denied their  belief

in democracy, and that all their fight in the past

has shown that they do not care for the future  of

the  country. Their absence from this House  shows

that   they  have  no  belief  and  no  confidence

whatever  in the system of democracy and they  are

working  very  hard to destroy it. The  people  of

Singapore  must be well aware of these actions  of

the Barisan Sosialis, because the Barisan Sosialis

are  working very hard to destroy this  democratic

system.  We know that they have now been  rejected

by  the  people of Singapore and so are all  their

pro-Communist supporters. They, like U.M.N.O. and

the  M.C.A., have no political capital  that  they

could  show  to  the  people  of  Singapore.   Mr

Speaker, the Barisan Sosialis is a Party known for

its skill in shouting slogans, but they are barren

in  political  ideas. The slogans  are  all  empty

ones. In the Hong Lim by-election five months ago,

the  people  of  that constituency rejected  those

slogans.  The  Barisan  Sosialis  people  are  now

rejected both by their former supporters  and  the

people  of  this State. We know of the split  that

has  taken  place within the ranks of the  Barisan

Sosialis.  They have all along been dependent  for

their  inspiration on the Communists of Indonesia.

They  are now like chickens. They are now  in  the

process  of perishing. They are looking  for  help

from  outside  in order to maintain  their  stand.

They  say that Malaysia is a neo-colonialist plot.

They  had wished earlier that Singapore would  not

have  merged with Malaysia. Now that Singapore  is

no  longer  merged with Malaysia, this still  does

not  seem  to fulfi1 their desires. They say  that

the  independence that we have achieved is phoney.

What  then are their true wishes? Merger is phoney

and  independence is phoney! What they wish is  to

destroy



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 209</b></font><br><br>



Singapore  so that it will perish. This  is  their

evil  intention towards Singapore. We must  beware

of  this all the tune and stop the evil intent  of

the Barisan Sosialis.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Kah Hui (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr Sia Kah Hui):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I rise

to  support  the  motion  of  the  Prime  Minister

expressing the thanks of this House to the Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara for delivering the speech  on  the

opening  day  of  this Session. The  whole  speech

conveys  a sense of confidence both in the present

and  in the future, and the concrete and effective

steps  to  be  taken in the solution  of  problems

which confront the country.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is now well known and in fact accepted by

all  our  fellow  member  nations  of  the  United

Nations Organisation but disputed by a few Barisan

Sosialis Members who spit in the face of their own

electors,   Singapore  is   an   independent   and

sovereign  country. So we meet  today  under  very

different circumstances from the past. We meet  as

the   First  Parliament  of  an  independent   and

sovereign Republic of Singapore. I am proud of the

fact; Honourable Members here present are proud of

the  fact; and I am sure the great majority of our

fellow-citizens of Singapore share  our  pride  in

the fact.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of the last Session, 21 guns did

not  boom  out  in salute when His Excellency  the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara arrived at this Chamber  to

deliver  his  Speech,  but eight  days  ago,  they

boomed  in  recognition of our  President.  Things

have  changed - changed dramatically. We  are  now

masters  of our own destiny. We did not seek  this

status.  We did not separate from those  we  still

feel  are members of our common Malaysian  family.

We  were separated from them. This we accept.  But

we are an adult member of the family and can - and

will  -  survive on our own. We live  in  our  own

houses  but  also in the Malaysian  compound,  not

from  any  decisions of men, but  because  of  the

compulsions  of history, geography and  sociology.

And  for our own homeland, we have full and  final

responsibility. Our problems are not easy  and  we

have not all the time in the world to solve



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 210</b></font><br><br>



them.  But  as the Prime Minister said, we  define

our problems, the better to face them, and we face

our  problems, in order to find better and quicker

solutions. We know that, though we must  take  the

initiative  and responsibility, we  need  the

co-operation of others, our new neighbours, our

Afro-Asian   friends,   our  fellow  members   of   the

Commonwealth, the new friends made  by  our  three

Ministers on their recent journey of goodwill  and

the  people of the American continent -  in  fact,

wherever friendship is. But for the first time, it

is  our  opportunity and responsibility to  strive

for  the greatest advantage for our people. We are

on  test as a people and this is the greatest test

we  have  ever faced in the success story  of  our

history. And this time it is a democratic test - a

test  of  all  of  us,  of our  capacity  to  hold

together and to work together in the spirit  of  a

more  just and equal society, more equal not  only

in  what we get from Singapore but in what we give

to  it.  I  am glad that His Excellency has  fully

brought Out this point clearly in his Speech. What

he  has  said could bear repetition here, for  our

people  must fully realise their responsibilities.

I  quote  "Our survival as a people, depends  upon

our     patience    and    resolution... upon     our

perseverance."  In  other  words,  these  are  the

qualities  needed to bring about a tolerant,  just

and equal society, multi-racial, multi-lingual and

multi-religious. We have set our sights high.  The

ideas  and aspirations may not be new, but we  are

pioneers  in seeking to build them into  the  laws

and  way  of  life  of  one  of  the  most  varied

communities  in the world today. Every  effort  of

every  citizen  must be deliberately  directed  to

achieve these ideals we have set ourselves.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we cast our eyes around us and take an

objective look at our neighbours, their trials and

tribulations, we can be certain that our policy is

right.  Our leaders have done everything  for  the

realisation  of this policy. We have  learnt  from

history.  We know that a tolerant, just and  equal

society,  multi-racial, multi-lingual  and

multi-religious, are the four pillars of wisdom on which

our nation can be built. When we all fully realise

this fact, and as a great majority already do,  we

shall



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 211</b></font><br><br>



have  peace and harmony. Without peace and harmony

in  our  country, we cannot proceed  to  the  next

stage seeking prosperity. After the experience  of

the  last couple of years, I am confident that our

people  cannot fall prey to appeals of  chauvinist

and  communal sentiments, but at the same time  we

must not belittle the craftiness and ingenuity and

self-mesrnerising of our enemies. They are in our

midst  and they are constantly and obsessively  on

the  lookout for opportunities to exploit for  the

advancement  of  their  own  power  through  their

ideology.  They are constantly on the lookout  for

opportunities  to  exploit the ignorant  and

ill-informed. I am confident, however, that no  amount

of  communal  terror  and intimidation  will  ever

bring our people to forsake the conviction that  a

tolerant,  just  and equal society,  multi-racial,

multi-lingual and multi-religious,  are  the  four

pillars  on  which our nation shall he built.  The

means  they use to gain power indicate  the  means

they will use should they gain power to perpetuate

their   power,  and  there  could  he  no  greater

contrast  with the ideals our Government  preaches

and  practises. As His Excellency has  well  said,

"This  House  has  gone through many  a  struggle,

first against Colonialism, then Communism and then

Communalism." Our people in their public  as  well

as  in  their business and private life  are  much

more experienced and discerning people. We are  no

fools.  It is because of this very fact  that  our

people  have a discriminatory mind and have  guts,

patience  and  determination  that  other  nations

accept us and respect us. I remember that when the

Deputy Prime Minister spoke at the Airport on  his

return  from  the  success of his recent  Goodwill

Mission overseas, he said that it was because  our

people  are  solidly behind our  nation's  leaders

that  other people arc prepared to be friends with

us and respect us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a peace-loving people and it cannot be

said  too often that we want to live in peace with

our  neighbours and indeed with the  rest  of  the

world. We want to prosper, and from our ideals



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 212</b></font><br><br>



and  our interests we want our neighbours also  to

prosper. Let this be proclaimed from the roof-tops

that  it may be known to our neighbours as  t  was

stated  by our Foreign Minister in his key  speech

to  the United Nations Assembly. Let us co-operate

in  all  things  for the benefit of  our  peoples,

which  is  the purpose of politics.  Let  not  our

minds  and  thoughts  be  clouded  and  shrunk  by

jealousy  and  animosity.  The  interests  of  the

peoples  must  come first. This  is  democracy.  I

sincerely  hope  that  nothing,  no  ideology,  no

people,  will stand in the way as this  Government

strides  forward to bring peace and prosperity  to

our people.



<br><br>3.13 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Inche Othman Bin Wok (Minister for Culture and Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Social Affairs (Inche Othman Bin Wok):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, at the

opening  of  the  First Session of  the  Singapore

Parliament,   exactly  four   months   after   the

promulgation  of  Singapore as an independent  and

sovereign State, the Head of State, His Excellency

the Yang di-Pertuan Negara, remarked that:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`When we last met in this Chamber, little did we

foresee that in two years we would meet here again

as  a  sovereign  Legislature  of  an  independent

nation, a separate member of the Commonwealth  and

of the United Nations.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, even in this very House, Mr Speaker,

Sir,  the  atmosphere and the scene have  changed.

The  seats in front of us, which were 90 per  cent

empty after the last general election in 1963, are

now  all  completely unoccupied.  And  since  last

Monday we have missed the sight of eight tiny  men

in  black trousers and white shirts, shuffling  in

and   out  of  this  Chamber  shouting  silly  and

sometimes  insolent  remarks  whenever  Government

Members spoke.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we are in no position to predict the

length  of  their  absence, there are  indications

that  their  boycott will go on at least  for  the

whole  of  this  Session. It is  hard  for  us  to

understand what sort of people they are  and  what

they really want. They talk of democracy, but when

they  are  given  the  opportunities  through  the

democratic  parliamentary  process  to  air  their

grievances  face to face with us, they  prefer  to

absent themselves, to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 213</b></font><br><br>



shout  morbid  and  empty  slogans  outside   this

Chamber  to  the  effect that  the  Government  is

undemocratic and dictatorial.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 9th of August, the Barisan Sosialis has

lost  much  of its ground support, not because  of

the   so-called   undemocratic   and   dictatorial

attitude of the P.A.P. Government, but because  of

their  puerile  and stupid actions and  utterances

which  are  prejudicial to the  interests  of  the

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time when we were working feverishly for the

reunification  of  Singapore  and  Malaya  in  the

establishment  of Malaysia a few years  ago,  they

worked  in  the opposite direction.  They  branded

Malaysia  as a neo-colonialist plot. They  opposed

merger  to  fight  for  an independent  Singapore.

Independence first, followed by merger at a  later

stage was their formula. And now that Singapore is

no  longer  part  of Malaysia but  has  become  an

independent and sovereign State, they say, "We  do

not  want an independent Singapore because  it  is

phoney  independence and is a plot of the  British

colonialists  and  imperialists  working  hand  in

glove with their stooges."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, nobody can gainsay that

Singapore's    independence   is    genuine,    to

substantiate  which  there  is  more  than   ample

testimony.  We  were  admitted  into  the   United

Nations  without  any hitch. No African  or  Asian

country opposed our application for membership  of

the   Afro-Asian  Conference  which  unfortunately

failed  to hold its meeting in Algiers.  In  fact,

the  United  Nations  as well  as  the  Afro-Asian

Conference  accepted us with  open  arms.  If  our

independence were phoney, as the Barisan  Sosialis

claimed,  surely  we would have been  rebuffed  by

these two bodies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is further proof of our State's legitimacy.

And  again, Mr Speaker, Sir, our mission  led  by

the  Deputy  Prime Minister was well received  and

highly  honoured  by African, European  and  Asian

countries.  The countries they visited represented

every  shade  of  ideology from  non-Communist  to

Communist   countries.  They  not  only   accepted

Singapore as an independent and sovereign



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 214</b></font><br><br>



State  but  also saw the presence of  the  British

base   in  the  correct  perspective.  They   were

convinced that the protective base here would  not

negate or detract from our independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Against this background we can clearly understand

that  at  this  sitting, Members  of  the  Barisan

Sosialis  have  absented themselves because  their

attempts  to  hoodwink the people  on  the  phoney

independence  myth  have failed  miserably.  Their

unfounded allegations that independence has loaded

Singapore with acute and chaotic economic problems

fall  on deaf ears. The people of Singapore refuse

to  listen to such silly and childish remarks  and

will  not  allow themselves to follow  a  suicidal

course like that of 1961 when the Barisan Sosialis

created  economic  paralysis by launching  strikes

which  resulted in the closure of many  factories,

unemployment among workers and transfer of capital

across the Causeway.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest, Mr Speaker, Sir, that the Barisan

Sosialis   Gentlemen  should  have   their   heads

examined; after all, they have plenty of free time

in  which  to  do this, for instead of  fulfilling

their  parliamentary obligations as the Opposition

here, they are now on a long holiday.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four months after our separation from Malaysia,

Singapore is still very much alive and is in  fact

even more viable. As revealed by my colleague  the

Minister  for Finance in his Budget Speech,  there

is every indication that Singapore will definitely

survive  and  prosper  in  the  years  ahead.  His

"painless" Budget has been viewed by the people as

an  index  of  confidence in Singapore's  economic

future.   As  an  encouraging  first  step,   some

overseas  buyers have already made bulk  purchases

of  our  locally manufactured plywood, veneer  and

textiles.  And now they are engaged  in  exploring

the possibilities of introducing a wider range  of

locally  manufactured products to the  markets  of

their respective countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trend is that more and more overseas trade

missions  will visit Singapore, not only from  the

non-Communist countries but also from the European

Communist  countries. For example, Yugoslavia  and

Russia  have  expressed their desire of  relations

with us. We encourage relations like these on the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 215</b></font><br><br>



basis  of  mutual  benefit. It is  our  hope  that

economic  relations will be the prelude  to  other

and closer relations. This can be our contribution

to international goodwill and understanding.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, it is not without reasons that

Singapore  is  the  centre of  communications  and

business  in  South-East Asia and has  within  the

last  150  years developed into the fifth  largest

port  in  the  world. This is due to  a  quirk  of

geography  -  that we are in the centre  of  world

trade routes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But some people in the neighbouring territory

refuse to accept this. To them, Singapore was  and

still  is  nothing  more than a small  fish  which

makes  a  tasty morsel. But two years of  Malaysia

made  them realise that what they mistook for  the

ikan  hilis was really the ikan lepu which,  small

though  it be, is protected by a ring of poisonous

spikes.  So  to  save  their own  skin,  they  had

perforce to spew out the ikan lepu. For during the

two  years  we  were in Malaysia,  Sir,  we  amply

demonstrated ourselves as a people not to be cowed

into submission but willing and able to fight  for

principles and inalienable rights.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We joined Malaysia in the sincere conviction that

we  could  play our part in helping  to  create  a

multi-racial,  equal  and just  society.  We  were

willing  to co-operate and offer whatever help  we

could in a common endeavour to improve the lot  of

the less privileged in the country. We offered the

services of our experts to help them to build

low-cost  housing for the lower income groups, and  so

on.  But our offers were flatly rejected. Instead,

the  Malaysian Government went around on the quiet

to  find  out how we ran our efficient  government

machinery,  how  we could build  low-cost  houses,

schools,  clinics,  hospitals  and  other   social

amenities.  Openly, they expressed their  envy  of

our  achievements  which  could  have  given  them

inspiration  to  embark on  similar  projects  but

which  were  only  regarded by them  as  posing  a

challenge to them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three days after the Singapore general elections

in 1963, U.M.N.O. members in Geylang Serai, led by

their  extremist leaders from Kuala Lumpur,  burnt

an



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 216</b></font><br><br>



effigy  of  the Prime Minister. This was  to  give

expression  to  their  frustration  because  their

candidates were rejected by the people and all had

lost  their  seats.  From  then  on,  the  vicious

propaganda  that "the P.A.P. Chinese  Government  is

suppressing the Malays" was echoed with monotonous

regularity  by  the  U.M.N.O. leaders  in   their

speeches and in the Jawi Press.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a systematic campaign. Social projects

designed to benefit the Malays were distorted.

Low-cost  flats  aimed at providing  the  Malays  with

modern  facilities were decried on the  fictitious

ground that they were not suitable for Malays  who

prefer to stay only in kampong-type houses.  Malay

families  were threatened into refusing occupation

of  these flats, described by the Utusan Melayu as

"pigeon holes".



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vicious propaganda went on, day in and day

out.  Their  aim was to impede Singapore's  social

and  economic headway. Under the influence of  the

extremists,  the Malays refused  to  move  out  of

their  dilapidated houses to make way  for  modern

flats. Urban development projects were held up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the campaign to topple the Singapore

Government, the extremists incited the Malays with

communal slogans of one race, one language and one

religion. This culminated in the two riots of July

and  September  last year. Those  two  race  riots

would  not have happened but for the determination

of  the  extremists and racialists  to  force  the

people of Singapore into accepting Malay rule.  In

fact,  the  position was neatly summarised  by  an

U.M.N.O.  Backbencher when he said at  the  Second

Session  of the Malaysian Parliament, "The trouble

with  Singapore  is that it is not  accustomed  to

Malay rule."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after our expulsion, the extremists would

not leave us alone and blatantly interfered in our

internal  affairs  by  exploiting  religious   and

language issues. Their attempts in the Jawi  Press

to  create  religious conflict in  Singapore  were

foiled before any damage could be done. Then  they

switched  over  to  language.  During  our  Second

National Language Month concluded recently,  these

Right-wing  extremists, claiming to be "the

anti-national language leaders", distributed



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 217</b></font><br><br>



literature   denouncing  Malay  as  the   national

language  and demanding that Chinese be  made  the

sole   national  language  of  the  State.   These

pamphlets   written  in  rornanised   Malay   were

purported to have originated from Chinese language

chauvinists.  But their game was exposed  and  the

pamphlets  were  traced to be the  work  of  Malay

extremists, their real intention being  to  create

communal   ill-feeling  between  the  Malays   and

Chinese    which    might   result    in    racial

conflagration.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to

echo  the Prime Minister's suggestion that a  more

rational   relationship  between   the   Malaysian

Government and the Singapore Government be  ironed

out at the conference table. As for the Malays  in

Singapore,  I would appeal to them to steer  clear

of   the  communal  blandishments  of  the   Malay

extremists.  The real interest of the Malays  lies

in  co-operating with the other communities  in  a

concerted  effort  to achieve economic  viability,

step  up the standard of living and create a  more

just  and  equal national multi-racial society  in

which  every citizen irrespective of racial origin

can make the most of the opportunities of life.



<br><br>3.32 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr R. A. Gonzales -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr R. A. Gonzales (Serangoon Gardens):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, some four months ago when we were in

Malaysia  there were people, and I mean  those  in

the minority group, who were becoming apprehensive

about  their  future in Malaysia and whether  they

would  be  swallowed up as a result  of  a  policy

being adopted by certain mad men who unfortunately

happened  to  be  our neighbours. The  policy,  if

pursued,  would have spelt disaster not  only  for

the  minority group but also for the majority, for

there  is  no  way  in  our  multi-racial  society

whereby one race can successfully dominate another

except possibly by the use of force.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no place for the communalists in this

society of ours. A sigh of relief was heard on the

9th of August and there was even a certain amount



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 218</b></font><br><br>



of  jubilation when we became independent or  when

independence   was  thrust  upon   us.   But   the

happenings    during    the    months    preceding

independence were still fresh in the minds of  the

people  and  there was still a certain  amount  of

apprehension  as  to what their lot  would  be  in

independent Singapore. Unfortunately, we happen to

have   the  same  type  of  mad  men  here.   This

apprehension,  I  am  glad to  say,  was  speedily

dispelled by the statements that the rights of the

minority  groups would be safeguarded  by  writing

them  into the Constitution. I am sure that  there

is  no  more doubt in the minds of those who doubt

the  sincerity  of the Government. Now  that  they

know  that  the  rights of our citizens  shall  be

equal,  not only in law but also in practice,  the

creation  of  a  tolerant,  multi-racial,

multi-lingual  and multi-religious society is one  which

will  take  time, and we must spare no efforts  in

making  this  a  reality in the shortest  possible

period of time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, therefore, heartening to note that those

who  exploit  the  situation by appealing  to  the

racial  and  religious sentiments  of  the  people

would  be  dealt with. It is hoped  that  after  a

period  of  time  and after we have  succeeded  in

establishing a tolerant, multi-racial society that

the  leaders  in Malaysia will accept the  change,

and  in  doing  so  pave the way  for  the  coming

together  once  again of the people  who  are,  in

fact, one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his Speech, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara also

dwelt  on the question of defence, which is by  no

means a light burden that we have to bear now that

we  are independent. No self-respecting nation can

forever  depend on another for protection  against

its  enemies or even for internal security. We are

now  faced with the necessity of raising  an  army

and  a volunteer force. This will be the acid test

of the loyalty of the people to this country. This

is  the time when the traitors show themselves up.

I  am sure that we will not have to look for loyal

citizens  who will make the sacrifice to  maintain

their freedom and self-respect.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 219</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, the question of unemployment is

another matter uppermost in our minds and of great

concern  to the Government. It has been  estimated

that the backlog of unemployment as at the end  of

1965 is around 55,000, and will increase to 95,000

persons  within a few years. As we can  no  longer

depend  entirely on the entrepot trade, dependence

on  our  industries to provide jobs for those  who

will  be  entering  the  labour  market  will   be

increasing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restrictive measures that have been

introduced  to  restrict the influx  of  unskilled

workers  into Singapore to safeguard the interests

of  our  citizens are, therefore, welcome.  It  is

heartening to note, however, that the door has not

been  entirely  closed to our  people  across  the

Causeway  who are skilled workers. I am sure  they

will  realise that these steps have been taken  to

ensure our survival and that the responsibility of

finding  jobs  for their unemployed rests  on  the

shoulders of their leaders.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On our part, Mr Speaker, we urge the Government

to look very closely at the number of jobs created

by   the  establishment  of  industries.  We   are

informed  of  the  number of workers  employed  by

firms already in production and of the level  that

will  be  reached  when these firms  achieve  full

production. Careful watch must be taken to  ensure

that  these firms achieve full production  in  the

shortest possible time and that employment becomes

a  fact and not just a promise. Here, the role  of

our  trade union leaders and workers becomes  more

important.  Not  only will they have  to  exercise

more  restraint in their demands, but they  should

also   cooperate  with  management   to   increase

production  and to ensure that their products  are

of  the  highest quality and of a price comparable

to  or  even cheaper than the price for  the  same

product produced elsewhere.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government is playing its part in encouraging

trade  missions  to visit Singapore.  The  workers

must   also   play  their  part  in  raising   the

productivity and the standards of the goods they



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 220</b></font><br><br>



produce.  The  more  we produce  for  export,  the

better  our economy, which eventually will  result

in more jobs being created - jobs for the sons and

daughters   of   the  workers  themselves.

Self-interest, at this time when we are faced with  the

grave problem of survival, does not pay and  I  am

confident  that  with  wise  leadership  and   the

industry  of  the  people,  we  shall  succeed  in

maintaining  and  even improving our  standard  of

living which we shall then be happy to share  with

our people in Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I support the motion to express

our  thanks to the Yang di-Pertuan Negara for  the

speech  which he delivered at the opening of  this

Session.



<br><br>3.42 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chan Chee Seng (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Affairs (Mr Chan Chee Seng)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker. Sir, the Barisan Sosialis have

boycotted us this time. They think that  this  act

might  create  an  impression  on  the  people  of

Singapore.  That is their intention of  boycotting

the  Parliament.  But the people  are  politically

sophisticated. They can see through the  intention

of  the Barisan Sosialis. The boycott has somewhat

increased  our  burden  because  we  now  have  to

consider  their point of view in addition  to  our

own   point   of  view.  Before  any  measure   or

legislation can be approved by this House, we have

to consider the pros and cons from every angle.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to general speculation, the reasons for

the  Barisan boycott are, firstly, that they  have

nothing  more worth while to offer to this  House;

they  cannot  make any more contributions  to  the

people  of  Singapore. Secondly, the  Chairman  of

their Party fears that their Members in this House

may  not  want to obey his instructions when  they

speak,  thus  endangering  his  prestige  and  his

leadership.  Because his position  has  thus  been

threatened,  he  has  ruled  that  these   Barisan

Members should not come to this Assembly.  I  will

not criticise the Barisan Sosialis any further.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, a few points to which I would

like  to  draw the attention of the House. Members

of the House



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 221</b></font><br><br>



are  elected  by  the voters, and they  should  be

responsible  to the people and to speak  on  their

behalf.  The boycott of Parliament by the  Barisan

Sosialis  has,  in fact, been a  betrayal  of  the

trust  of  the  people. They  are  shirking  their

responsibility, and they even go a step further by

denouncing our independence and saying that it  is

a  phoney  independence. If they do not  recognise

independent  Singapore, then I would like  to  ask

them  what  kind  of  people they  are.  Are  they

citizens of Singapore or are they citizens of  any

other country? If they do not recognise Singapore,

then Singapore can also legally denounce them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis in their Party organ has

also  denounced the worth and value of  democracy.

This  clearly goes to show that they are no longer

going  along  the way of democracy  to  carry  out

their    politics.   They   are   forsaking    the

constitutional  democratic  line.  What   is   the

conclusion expected of this sort of action? It  is

an  armed and bloody revolution. I would like  all

the   people  and  the  Barisan  Sosialis  to  pay

attention  to what I am going to say. The  Barisan

are  inspired  by  Jakarta  and  are  directed  by

Peking.  What are the views of Peking and  Jakarta

on  Singapore?  According to Peking  news,  Peking

considers the Government led by Mr Lee  Kuan  Yew

as a moderate Leftist Government. This would be an

eye-opener  to  the Barisan Sosialis.  Singapore's

Government  is recognised as a Left-wing  moderate

Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a Chinese saying that everything that

can  be  achieved in the year must be  planned  in

spring.   And  everything  pertaining   to   one's

livelihood should be planned early in one's  life.

So  this  saying  can be applied  to  our  present

situation. In other words, in the beginning of the

year, in spring, we should plan for the whole year

and  we should also plan in the early morning  for

the  whole  day. In the same way, we  should  also

have a long-term plan for the future of Singapore,

just  like  every individual should have  his  own

plan  for his life. And the policy speech outlines

the  plan for Singapore for the coming year, which

is a long-term plan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 222</b></font><br><br>



not  only for the coming year but also for a  long

time to come.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since 1959, when the P.A.P. came to power,

it  has been planning for the future and our  plan

is  many  years ahead. Our achievements have  been

beyond  expectations in many fields. And even  our

neighbouring countries have recognised this.  But,

on  the  other  hand, there are certain  countries

which  have  to incur a great deficit every  year,

millions  of dollars, because of ill-planning  and

mal-administration. I do not  really  mean  to  be

unkind to our neighbouring countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our non-aligned policy, as everybody knows, has

already  won us many friends, both from  the  West

and  also from the East. We have won many  friends

in  Afro-Asian countries. We have established good

relationships with Eastern European countries  and

also  with  Russia.  Yugoslavia  and  Russia  have

promised  to send a delegation to Singapore  early

next  year. The Republic of China in the past  two

years  did  not buy our rubber but has  now  trade

relationships with us. It has bought  some  rubber

from   us.  From  all  sides,  we  are  seeing   a

favourable response. They are keenly interested in

our  friendship. I have reason to believe that  at

the  right time, many more will come with  us  and

the Republic of China will recognise us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going ahead with our long-term plan.

Singapore is a small country with an area  of  224

square  miles.  We also have substantial  revenues

every  year.  But the expenditure  on  defence  is

quite  large. We cannot afford to have a big army.

Therefore, we have to build only a small army with

the support of a voluntary people's defence corps.

Sir,  this  will have to depend on the support  of

the  people. Our people are very conscientious and

will  certainly live up to our expectations.  When

the  Japanese invaded Malaya, they fought  bravely

against  them.  They are resolute  and  courageous

enough   to   defend  themselves  for  their   own

existence.  The 10,000 volunteers in the  people's

defence   corps   can  safely  be   said   to   be

forthcoming. The people will keenly  take  up  the

challenge  to join the army or the volunteers.  In

spite of the army or



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 223</b></font><br><br>



volunteer force that we may have, it is still  too

small  to defend our country. That is why we  need

the  protection  and  help of  our  friends.  That

explains   the  presence  of  British   bases   in

Singapore.   The  bases  in  Cuba,  however,   are

controlled by the United States of America, it  is

quite  different  from  the  British  bases  here,

because  they  are here with the  consent  of  our

Government for our own protection. This  has  been

recognised  by  the  Afro-Asian  countries   which

recognise  that  the existence  of  the  bases  in

Singapore  does  not infringe on  our  territorial

integrity  and  sovereignty. It  is  for  our  own

defence  at our own request. The Barisan  Sosialis

have  called  on  the  people  not  to  join   the

volunteers  or the army. They have also  denounced

the  existence  of  the bases. But  if  a  foreign

country tries to invade us, what will they do?  Do

they want to hand over Singapore to them? They  do

not  even  want to see Singapore exist or survive.

They call upon the people not to join the army  or

the  volunteer  force.  As everybody  knows,  this

House has allotted $10 million in this respect but

we    will   have   trebled   this   amount.   The

confrontation  by Indonesia has not caused  losses

to  us  as expected. It is only $10 million  which

was  spent  in social aid for the unemployed.  The

existence of Singapore can be safeguarded  through

Government policies and many measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I would like to stress that the people of

Singapore  will  have to be on the  alert  and  to

depend on themselves. That is the basic spirit  of

the  people of an independent country.  I  believe

that we can rely upon ourselves. We should be

self-reliant and we should be able to stand on our  own

feet  for  our survival. Then the people  who  are

inseparable from us living in Malaysia  will  also

try  to  emulate us. As I have said, planning  for

the  year  is in spring and the planning  for  the

future  of Singapore is now. So this is  the  time

for  us  to  plan  for  our  future,  and  I  hope

everybody  will  live up to the duty  expected  of

him.



<br><br>3.59 pm



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 224</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ho Cheng Choon (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for National Development (Mr Ho Cheng Choon)</b>(<i>In Mandarin</i>): Mr Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the

Yang di-Pertuan Negara has delivered the Speech on

behalf   of   the  Government  and  it   is   very

encouraging to many of us. In it we can  see  very

clearly  for ourselves that a new nation has  been

born  with all sovereignty and integrity.  It  has

already  got  all the plans for our  future.  Just

like  some  other newly independent  countries  in

Afro-Asia,  the  people of Singapore  are  now  in

control  of their own destiny and they can  decide

the  future  for themselves. But inevitably,  with

independence, we will meet with more  difficulties

and  responsibilities.  This  is  natural  and  we

recognise  this  fact. We are a small  country  in

South-East  Asia  and  our destiny  and  fate  are

closely  intertwined with the fate and destiny  of

the  other  peoples in the same region. Therefore,

in the course of nation-building, the stability of

our  country  must  necessarily  depend  upon  the

establishment  of  a  multi-racial  society   with

equality  for  all.  In  the  meantime,   in   the

international field, we must make sure that we are

not  isolated.  All  these are factors  that  will

ensure our survival.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, ever since we achieved independence,

Singapore  has  smoothly  and  without  any  haste

become  the  117th member of the  United  Nations.

This  fact is undeniable. Nobody can dispute  that

at  all. In the field of foreign affairs,  we  are

adopting a policy of non-alignment and neutrality.

That is why we have enhanced our reputation in the

international  arena and we  have  won  a  lot  of

friends  and support, both in Afro-Asian countries

and  in  Eastern European countries.  Lately,  the

Goodwill   Mission,  led  by  the   Deputy   Prime

Minister,   were  welcomed  wherever  they   went.

Everywhere they went they were well received  too.

Mr  Speaker, the anti-nationalist elements in our

midst, however, have turned round to say that  the

independence  we  have achieved is  phoney.  These

remarks  are  totally unfounded,  particularly  in

view  of the fact that we have been admitted  into

the  United Nations. This shows that we are  truly

independent and that we are



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 225</b></font><br><br>



not  just independent in name. The United  Nations

is    a    very   well   respected   international

organisation,  and  it will  not  easily  admit  a

country  as  a member if it has not achieved  true

independence.  The remark of the Barisan  Sosialis

that ours is a phoney independence is intended  to

create a wrong impression in the minds of the

Afro-Asian  countries. But their schemes and  intrigues

have  been  exposed. They have  been  broken  into

pieces and this is very encouraging to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one other thing we must note. Their

boycott of the first Session of Parliament may  be

an  indication  that they have lost confidence  in

the  system of parliamentary democracy.  This  may

mark  a  change in their policy; a departure  from

the  constitutional struggle in  Parliament  to  a

struggle by violence. That is why we must increase

our  vigilance against whatever move they may make

or are making.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, we are faced with two great forces

in  our efforts towards nation-building. The first

force, as has been said in the speech by the  Yang

di-Pertuan  Negara, is the force  of  communalism.

The second force is Communism. We can see, and  we

understand very clearly, that the communal  ultras

have been and are still shouting the slogan of one

race,  one  religion and one language.  They  have

been  doing  this  for the past two  years.  These

ultras   are  trying  to  do  all  they   can   to

indoctrinate the people of this nation with  their

ideology in order to split the people and break up

national unity. At their instigation, some of  our

people   have  done  foolish  things  in   certain

circumstances.  But  now the picture  is  entirely

changed. Although we can say that they are,  to  a

certain  extent, well contained, the people  must,

nevertheless,  be  vigilant  against   the   other

broadsides these ultras may deliver at the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now come to the open front Communist

organisations. Mr Speaker, ever since we achieved

independence,  these open-front organisations  and

elements have tried to undermine the stability and

security of our nation. They tried to make Nanyang

University



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 226</b></font><br><br>



an  issue  in  order  to  create  trouble  in  our

society. So these Left-wing trade unions  and  the

old  boys' associations, together with a few

pro-Communist  elements  in  the  university   campus,

attempted to describe the Wang Gung-Wu Report as a

Government  measure intended to anglicise  Nanyang

University. They say that this is the intention of

the  P.A.P.  Government. They do so  in  order  to

create  a  feeling of resentment among the  people

against  the Government. Mr Speaker, we  can  see

that  the  main point in Professor Wang  Gung-Wu's

Report is that Nanyang University should have  two

systems,  one system for general degrees  and  one

system  for  honours degrees.  This  is  something

which Nanyang University has never had. The second

point  in  the  Report is to try to  make  Nanyang

University a multi-lingual University so  that  it

can  be  run  on a sound basis. Some changes  have

been   made  in  the  courses  of  study.  Certain

recommendations  have been made  with  a  view  to

turning Nanyang University into a properly run and

well  managed  institution of higher  learning  to

meet   the   requirements  of  our  society.   The

graduates of the University would then be able  to

meet  the  aspirations of the people with sympathy

and  understanding. In the new situation now  that

we  are  independent,  we require  more  and  more

people  with talent to participate in the work  of

nation-building.  If after some  reforms,  Nanyang

University  is able to turn out more graduates  to

meet  the requirements of our society, then it  is

to be recommended. How can it be said that this is

a move to anglicise Nanyang University? After all,

we  have  already decided and agreed that  Nanyang

University shall remain a University with  Chinese

as  the medium of instruction. There is no dispute

over  this  point.  But some of the  pro-Communist

elements   in   Nanyang  University  resorted   to

vandalism  by writing nonsense on walls  all  over

the university campus. They even attempted to burn

down the hostel in Nanyang University. They did so

in  the name of preserving Chinese education. They

also  attempted to boycott classes  for  the  same

reason.  With  the  support of  the  pro-Communist

trade



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 227</b></font><br><br>



unions  and old boys' associations, they go  round

and  paste slogans and posters at bus shelters and

sometimes  in the buses themselves. They  want  to

create  an  impression among the people  that  the

Government is doing harm to Nanyang University  in

the  hope that they can whipp ill-feelings against

the  Government. But fortunately for us, they have

not  been  successful in their attempts.  This  is

because  the  people themselves have seen  through

the plot and intrigues and the puerile efforts  of

these  anti-national elements. The people  are  no

longer moved by them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, these anti-national elements know

that  the moment Nanyang University is put on  the

right  track they will lose a training ground  for

Communist  cadres. That is why they are doing  all

they  can to stop Nanyang University from  getting

on  to the right track. Thus, they have to pretend

to  be  the  champions of Nanyang  University  and

Chinese education so that they can do harm instead

of  good to Nanyang University. If they are really

sincere   in  their  so-called  love  for  Nanyang

University,  then they should not  write  nonsense

and  slogans on the walls of buildings of  Nanyang

University. By so doing, they are in fact  causing

the University to spend more money.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is the policy and determination

of  the  P.A.P. Government to establish  a

multi-racial  nation.  This  is a necessity,  rather  an

ideal,  We  must  of  necessity  look  after   the

interest of the minorities in our nation  so  that

they  will forever become part and parcel  of  the

entire   nation.  In  fact,  safeguards  for   the

minority   groups   will  be  written   into   the

Constitution. This is in line with our  policy  of

multi-lingualism  and  multi-racialism.  We   have

already got the support of the people. Our  policy

has,  in fact, achieved success in this field.  We

will  go  a  step  further  by  consolidating  our

strength.  This  will give us more  confidence  in

order  to  achieve even greater success. This,  of

course,  will  have  great  repercussions  on  our

neighbouring countries where feudalism is  on  the

decline. It is inevitable that



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 228</b></font><br><br>



the  emergence of a multi-racial society will come

about.   Generally   speaking,  our   neighbouring

country does not seem to like the emergence  of  a

multi-racial society. They do not wish to see  the

success  of our multi-racial policy. The  question

of  the separation of Singapore from Malaysia  was

brought  up in the Malaysian Parliament  recently.

On  this particular occasion, the racialist ultras

seemed to be rather unhappy about it. Even some of

the  Malaysian  Ministers shared similar  feelings

with  these ultras. Their performance came  as  no

surprise to us, because we knew that they did  not

like  the emergence of a multi-racial society.  In

their  minds, they had the idea of suppressing  us

or  even  destroying us. In fact,  they  harboured

this  intention. Because of our determination  and

decision  to establish a multi-racial society  and

our  concerted effort to achieve such a  goal,  we

are still able to survive. We shall strive further

for  our  future survival. We must, however,  make

certain  calculations  about  these  people.  What

effect will they have on us if one day they assume

power  across  the  Causeway? We must,  therefore,

plan   well  ahead  of  time  and  have  long-term

policies against such an eventuality.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to ensure that our multi-racial society

will succeed, we must of necessity set up a

multi-racial  army  and defence corps, because  we  must

depend  on our own strength to protect our society

and nation. We must have well-trained armed forces

to  protect our own security and survival. This is

one  of the very basic principles we must have  in

mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, in the speech of the Yang di-Pertuan

Negara  delivered in this House on behalf  of  the

Government, certain references have been  made  to

our  national development. I do not wish  to  make

any  further repetition, but I would like to bring

out  a  few highlights on this matter to  give  my

colleagues  here a better and clearer picture.  It

is  the policy of the Government to look after the

interests of the various races, and this has  been

stressed over and over again in the past few years

ever since we came to power. We want to set up



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 229</b></font><br><br>



a  multi-racial society. We want to look after the

interests of all the people, whether they live  in

the city or in the kampong. We do not care whether

they  are Chinese, Malays, Indians, Eurasians,  or

members  of  any other race. We give  equality  to

all.  We  give the same treatment to  all  people,

irrespective of the colour of their skin or creed.

This is the basic policy of the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, you can go to any kampong in

Singapore and see there that the livelihood of the

people  is  not  very far below  the  standard  of

living  enjoyed by the urban people. In  fact,  we

can   boast   that  public  amenities  and   other

facilities in our kampongs and rural areas are far

better  than some of those provided in  the  urban

areas of other South-East Asian countries. So  the

work that we have done in raising the standard  of

living of the rural people, and apart from that of

the  city people, has met with great success. This

success  has been made possible by the  Rural  and

Urban  Services  Consultative Committee.  We  have

installed  many  standpipes and we  have  provided

electricity to a great many kampongs. We have also

built roads and jetties in some of the surrounding

islands of Singapore during the period 1960-65. We

have spent some $20 million in these projects  and

we  have not wasted a single cent or effort.  This

year  the  Urban  and Rural Services  Consultative

Committee  has  spent some $4  million  on  social

amenities,  $2  million  of  which  was  spent  on

providing  electricity to some kampongs,  so  that

the  poor people in the rural areas can also enjoy

modern  facilities in our society. This  has  also

enabled  them to be free from having  to  pay  for

electricity  provided by private generators  where

the supply is restricted to certain hours only.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also provided standpipes in the rural

areas  so  that the number of people dependent  on

well water is decreasing. Less and less people are

drawing water from wells and more and more  people

are  getting their supply of water from the  taps.

In fact, it is the policy of the Government to try

to  provide every home in the rural area  with  at

least a water tap.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 230</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have built some 52 miles of roads in the

kampong areas at a very high cost. The efforts  of

the  Government are well appreciated  by  all  the

people  in the 51 constituencies, including  those

represented by the Barisan Sosialis. In  fact,  we

do  not regard the constituents represented by the

Barisan  Sosialis as outcasts. We are paying  just

as   much  attention  to  them  as  to  the  other

constituents. It is a matter for regret  that  the

Barisan  Sosialis are not here to speak on  behalf

of  the people they represent. At any rate,  as  a

responsible  Government, we will  do  all  we  can

through  the Urban and Rural Services Consultative

Committee to provide modern facilities to all  the

constituencies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can give a few examples. In 1965 in the Choa

Chu Kang constituency which was represented by the

Barisan  Sosialis, we spent some $290,000  on  the

construction of roads. In Bukit Panjang, we  spent

some   $310,000  for  the  purposes  of  providing

electricity and water. In Nee Soon, we spent about

$260,000  for similar purposes. Mr Speaker,  from

all  these figures and facts, you can see how much

attention the Government is paying to these  rural

people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can now understand the Barisan Sosialis for

boycotting  us because they are unable  to  refute

these  facts. Apart from shouting slogans in  this

House, they are also drawing $500 allowance  each.

They are actually wasting public funds.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, it is the intention and aim of the

Government in its second Five-Year Plan to provide

some 60,000 housing units, mainly in Toa Payoh. We

are    also    going   ahead   with   our    urban

reconstruction. Some people have been affected  by

the  resettlement scheme. Since 1st January, 1964,

the   Government  has  provided   new   rates   of

compensation. These new rates have made  our  work

of  resettlement  very much easier.  Those  people

affected by this scheme are in every respect given

assistance  in securing alternative accommodation.

In  our  reclamation scheme we also  provide  much

assistance to those affected so as to reduce their

hardships, or whatever their difficulties, to  the

very minimum.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 231</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government's policy is enlightened. That is

why the pro-Communist anti-nationals have not been

able   to  instigate  the  people  who  have  been

affected  by  these  schemes  to  go  against  the

Government.  So in order to look after  their  own

interests  and  their  welfare,  the  people  must

increase  their vigilance. In fact, the Government

have  learnt a great deal over the past few years,

and   they  now  realise  the  importance  of

co-operating  with the people; and in return  we  too

respect them very much. This again shows that  the

people  and the Government are now almost  one  in

the  intention  and common effort to  establish  a

better nation in which to live.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The achievements in housing of the Government

over  the past five years have been great  because

of our able leadership. Our fame has spread abroad

and  has  been recognised in Mr Lim Kim San,  the

former  Minister  for National Development,  being

awarded   the   Magsaysay  prize.   This   is   an

encouragement to us and we shall continue to  work

harder  for the interests of the people by  trying

to raise their standard of living both in the city

and in the rural areas.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are now going through the Primary Production

Department  to  give all forms  of  assistance  to

farmers.  We  have well-trained personnel  and  we

have  set  up  veterinary and  other  stations  to

assist the farmers in increasing their production.

The total production of the rural areas amounts to

some  $200  million per year. We are now  able  to

produce eggs not only for our own consumption  but

also  for export. Only recently, in September this

year, the Government held an agricultural show  to

let   the   world   and  our  people   know   what

achievements  we  have made  in  the  rural  areas

through the Ministry of National Development. Some

300,000  people visited the show. This is a  clear

indication that great care has been taken  of  the

rural   people,  particularly  those  engaged   in

farming.  We  have  also met with  recognition  in

respect of our economy.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, I support the motion.



<br><br>4.27 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. V. Lingam -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr S. V. Lingam (Aljunied)</b>(<i>In Tamil</i>): Mr

Speaker, Sir, the Yang di-Pertuan Negara's Speech

delivered at the opening of this Session is a

historical one. I consider myself privileged to

express my views on this Motion of Thanks for his

Speech.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore became independent at a rather

unexpected  moment.  Several benefits  are  to  be

derived  from  this.  Many of  our  problems  were

solved when our Goodwill Mission went to Afro-Asia

under the leadership of the Deputy Prime Minister.

The  question of bases in Singapore was  explained

by  this Mission to friendly nations of Afro-Asia.

This has met with great success.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there are many problems to be

dealt  with  in connection with our  survival.  We

need  trade as well as industrial growth.  Several

plans  have been announced to increase  our  trade

and  industry. We are now assured of our  national

survival.   Our   people  must  also   have   some

assurance,  for only then will we be able  to  get

their full co-operation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, since 1959 when the People's

Action  Party  came to power, we  have  seen  many

changes  and  even tribulations. We  have  derived

many lessons from this and our people are enjoying

a high standard of living in South-East Asia. Even

families of lower income group are today  able  to

have television sets in their homes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Members who spoke before me in this Chamber

have  praised the health service of Singapore.  Of

course, I do not disagree with them. In fact, even

our   political  enemies  are  given   first-class

medical treatment!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are one or two things that I would

like  to point out. We may recall that there  were

some regulations for controlling cattle. But I  do

not  think they have been carried out effectively,

and  I  do hope that something will be done in  my

constituency.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, primary education is entirely

free  in  Singapore. This is of tremendous benefit

to poor families.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 233</b></font><br><br>



But  sometimes children of poor families  have  to

travel  great  distances  to  their  homes.  Their

parents  have  to  incur quite heavy  expenditure.

Such  families, therefore, do not derive the  full

benefit from primary education.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I wish to say something about

the   special   services  of   the   Housing   and

Development Board in which I serve. In  the  first

Five-Year Plan, 51,000 houses have been built  and

in  the  second Five-Year Plan, some 60,000 houses

will  be  built; but I do wish to  bring  to  your

attention  some  of  the  shortcomings   of   this

department. Because housing development  has  been

progressing at such a rate, some traffic  problems

have  been created. I do hope that these problems,

which  have  arisen as a result of  multi-storeyed

fiat  construction,  will  be  solved.  More   car

parking spaces and more playing fields have to  be

constructed.  The Housing Board must  improve  its

services  to  the people with the co-operation  of

other  Ministries. For instance, the provision  of

public   telephones  has  to  be  increased.   The

Ministry  of Health could provide more and  bigger

markets  in the housing estates, because  many  of

the  present markets are rather small. It has been

announced that the new Television Studio  will  be

ready  by  about the middle of next year.  I  hope

there will be school television broadcasts. I wish

to know whether and when school broadcasts will be

introduced, and whether the Tamil programmes  will

be further improved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also wish to say something on the public notice

boards.  Many spelling and grammatical  errors  in

the Tamil language are found in these notices. The

Tamil  language has received official  status,  so

this  misspelling in the notices  is  not  a  good

thing.  I do hope that something will be  done  to

rectify it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we now turn to the boycott of this Assembly

by  the  Barisan  Sosialis?  As  Members  of  this

Assembly,    there    are    many    duties    and

responsibilities  we  have  to  discharge  to  the

people.  During  an  earlier  phase,  the  Barisan

Sosialis   felt  there  should  be  more  Assembly

sittings.  Assembly sittings appeared  urgent  and

necessary to them.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 234</b></font><br><br>



I  have  already  spoken earlier about  this.  Now

because of urgent Government business, we have met

again  in  this Assembly. But we do not  see  them

here today. They have boycotted this Session.  But

the  people did not elect them so that they should

boycott  their Legislative Assembly. Moreover,  we

now  know  there  is  a split  among  the  Barisan

Sosialis.  But  this  is entirely  their  concern.

However this may be, it is unforgivable that  they

should have failed to turn up at this Assembly. As

Members,  they are receiving $500 allowance  each;

but  if  they  had asked the Assembly to  withhold

this payment, then they would be worthy of praise.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I wish to thank the Prime Minister for

having  given  us  the  opportunity  during   this

Session not only to praise the Government, but  to

criticise where necessary.

<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak (Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State for Education (Inche A. Rahim Ishak):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, twice in the past

twenty  years  has Singapore been  separated  from

Malaya.   On  both  occasions,  they   have   been

artificial separations, and on both occasions, for

illogical  reasons  which some outside  power  had

forced on the people of both territories, with one

possible exception. In 1945, the British separated

Singapore  to retain its hold on the island  as  a

strategic  military base in the days when  Britain

could  no  longer hold on to India, Burma,  Ceylon

and  Pakistan, and her other colonial  possessions

in  the  East  were  becoming untenable.  In  1965

Singapore was



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 235</b></font><br><br>



separated  after two years of merger  because  the

Central    Malaysian   Government    found    that

politically Singapore within Malaysia was a threat

and  a  danger to her political position in  Kuala

Lumpur.   The   people   of  Malaysia,   including

Singapore, were told in August this year  that  we

had  to  he  evicted  because of  imminent  racial

strife. The official reason given was that it  was

a  choice  between separation or  repression,  and

that if Singapore remained in Malaysia and neither

course of action was taken, then there would  have

been  a blood-bath all over the country. Here,  it

might  not he altogether futile for us to dwell  a

little on the subject of separation, although  now

that we are a distinct and independent nation,  so

suddenly  thrust upon us, it would fall  upon  the

historian  to write about the second severance  of

Singapore from mainland Malaya.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, the British in their three odd centuries of

colonialism all over the world have the  knack  of

leaving  behind  problems of  their  own  creation

which,  even  after  they have  been  thrown  out,

proved in many cases to be problems which are  not

easy   of  solution.  Whether  it  is  in   India,

Pakistan,  or Palestine, or Burma, Ceylon.  Cyprus

or   Malaysia,   the  policy  of   divide-and-rule

perpetrated by British colonialism has left in its

wake   serious  political,  economic  and   social

problems  which, long after they  have  gone,  the

people of these countries are saddled with through

no  fault  of their own, except for the fact  that

they  have  the misfortune of being  subjected  to

British colonialism.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For us, it is no use crying over spilt milk,

although  we know that quite often the ex-colonial

power makes pious pretensions of desiring to solve

problems  of  their  own  making.  The  industrial

revolution in Europe leading to the acquisition of

colonies in Asia, Africa and South America  belong

to  one era in the history of the world, and  that

era  will  not repeat itself. Hence  there  is  no

question  of avoiding a second time what  colonial

powers  have  once committed. For  better  or  for

worse  we  have  to face and solve these  problems

ourselves. The



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 236</b></font><br><br>



colonial  powers in most cases have the  habit  of

leaving  behind  not  only  economic  and   social

problems  hut also political inheritors  of  their

ilk who quite often have an interest in wanting to

perpetuate  the  economic  and  social   hierarchy

bequeathed by them. Seen in this light the  events

of  the last few years in Singapore, Malaya. Sabah

and   Sarawak   are  not  at  all   difficult   to

understand.  Was it racial strife and  a  communal

blood-bath that those in Kuala Lumpur were  trying

to  avoid?  Or was it the gradual erosion  of  the

established economic and social system  which  the

powers  that-be  in Kuala Lumpur in  the  Alliance

Government were trying to halt and postpone?  Sir,

it  is  clear to the people not only in  Singapore

and  Malaysia but to all who believe in  progress,

human   dignity,   equality  and   justice,   that

Singapore  was  evicted to postpone  the  eventual

victory  of social forces inspired by the ideology

of  democratic  socialism from spreading  far  and

wide  into the towns and kampongs, from Tebrau  to

Padang Besar and Tawau to Kuching.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, recently I had occasion to ask

a  visiting  Member of Parliament from a  friendly

country,  who  had earlier visited  Kuala  Lumpur,

what  he  was  told of the reason for  Singapore's

eviction  from Malaysia. He told me that officials

in   Kuala  Lumpur  had  told  him  that   because

Singapore  was  predominantly  Chinese,  and   the

Chinese  were  dominating  the  economy   of   the

country, therefore the solution was to get rid  of

Singapore.   Sir,  I  believe   this   Member   of

Parliament  I am quoting was himself quoting  from

not  only officials but Ministers. I remember very

well  the  Tunku, in justifying his call  for  the

formation  of  Malaysia in  1961,  said  that  the

reason Sabah and Sarawak should be taken into  the

new  Federation was to balance up the  Chinese  in

Malaysia and Singapore with the indigenous  people

in  the  Borneo States whom the Tunku then thought

were also Malays. There are in Singapore about 1.3

million Chinese and almost four million in Malaya,

apart from those in Sabah and Sarawak. The problem

of  the  Chinese is, therefore, not one  which  is

peculiar to Singapore. It



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 237</b></font><br><br>



is  not  even one which those in power in Malaysia

have  to  face  alone. Indeed all over  South-East

Asia, in Indonesia, Cambodia, Thailand, and  to  a

lesser  extent in the Philippines, the governments

in  these  countries  face  the  same  problem  of

immigrant  Chinese who had settled and made  their

homes in these countries. The question is, how  is

this  problem  of the Chinese to  be  solved?  Are

there  any  lessons  we can learn  from  Thailand,

Cambodia   and  Vietnam  about  the   problem   of

integration?  Is  political, cultural  and  social

integration  possible  over  a  long   period   of

political   stability,  for   example?   Or   must

segregation be the only solution of the Chinese in

Malaysia and Singapore? Conversely, is it possible

to solve the problem of Chinese presence by racial

domination in politics? Or has the solution to  be

brought  about by a get-together of the people  of

Malay   race  in  Malaysia,  Indonesia   and   the

Philippines to outnumber and later to squeeze  out

the Chinese from these areas?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, these propositions have direct relevance to

the  Speech by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara when  he

said that "we may be two countries but we are  one

people."   Not  a  few  people  in   our   closest

neighbouring country believe that this is also the

case.  It  is hard to believe that our  neighbours

think it possible really to isolate Singapore on a

racial  basis,  because I think  they  would  have

found  the same problem reverberating within their

own territories.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have lived many years of my life in

Malaya, and in those years, I have posed to myself

and  to  others this same question. I  have  found

that  not only has this problem remained the  same

after all these years, but that I have been unable

to  get new answers to this problem of the Chinese

in this part of the world. As a matter of fact, as

the  years pass and my hair grows grey, I am  more

arid more convinced that the only solution is  for

us  of  all races to live together peacefully  and

strengthen  the  foundations of the  multi-racial,

multi-cultural and multi-religious  society.  Even

today  I am prepared to consider and rethink about

any  other  solution, if there is one  forthcoming

from  any quarter. Upon separation, when the Tunku

offered the Malays



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 238</b></font><br><br>



in  Singapore  ten  acres each in  Johore,  I  was

wondering  whether he was taking the  second  step

towards  what  he  thought was  going  to  be  the

complete   isolation  of  Singapore.  I   wondered

whether  he wanted all the Malays in Singapore  to

leave  this fair island and go back to Malaya  and

thereby encourage the four million odd Chinese  in

Malaysia and possibly millions more all over

South-East  Asia to make Singapore a Chinese city. I  do

not know what his intentions were. But it is clear

that   the  absence  of  any  response  from   the

Singapore  Malays is more than an  answer  to  the

Tunku's  call. It seems to me that even  if  there

are  unthinking Malays elsewhere in  Malaysia  who

are  thinking along the same line, then they  will

similarly  learn that the Malays in  Singapore  do

not  propose to leave our shores even if they were

offered ten times ten acres. It would indeed be  a

tragedy  for  the  Malays if  we  helped  to  make

Singapore a Chinese city. He must be a mad man  to

help  in  the creation of a second Israel in  this

world. It goes against the grain of any sane Malay

to  leave  Singapore, an island which is part  and

parcel  of  the  Malay  world,  for  purely  party

political reasons to satisfy the selfish political

ambitions of certain people. Singapore  is  to  us

our world, as much as Malaya is to those living in

that  part  of the world. You can ask a Malay  who

has, for example, settled in Bangkok to return  to

his  country of origin for these reasons. But  can

you  ask us to leave Singapore to fit in with  the

political  strategy  of the Alliance?  And  if  we

leave Singapore, where do we go?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, in terms of land and ownership of land,

Singapore Malays, and for that matter Singaporeans

of   all   races,  have  very  little   in   their

possession. But in terms of earning capacity we in

Singapore,  the  Malays  included,  earn  on   the

average  two,  three or four times more  than  the

padi  farmers  or  fishermen in Malaya  and  other

parts of Malaysia. When we were still in Malaysia,

I  had  occasion  to  look  into  the  problem  of

resettlement  in land development schemes  carried

out  in  at least two areas in Malaysia, including

the  one at Sungei Buloh. What I saw there  leaves

much to be desired. On the other hand, the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 239</b></font><br><br>



Malays  in Singapore, who have been used to modern

and  advanced  social amenities and services  made

readily  available  and accessible  to  increasing

numbers  of people in the lower income group,  are

not  at all likely to leave their homes which  are

in  many cases subsidised by the Government. I  am

pretty  certain that they will not go to the  less

habitable  and  undeveloped  areas  in  Johore  or

Pahang.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, more than this Singapore Malays

have  come to love the open society and the nature

of   equality,  freedom,  justice,  democracy  and

progress,  the five principles symbolised  in  the

stars in our flag. The Malays in Singapore are not

used  to be treated as Harijans by local Brahmins.

Sir, we in Singapore, all of us - Malays, Chinese,

Indians,  Ceylonese,  like  you,  Sir,  Eurasians,

Pakistanis  and others - have strong  and  healthy

red blood in our veins. In Singapore our inquiring

minds want to know whether there are really people

with  white blood, as a Malay idiom describes  it.

For  hundreds of years we have heard about the

so-called   blue-blooded   chieftains   who   enjoyed

privileges and comforts for doing nothing.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if you are aware of a fundamental

teaching  in  Islam which prohibits its  followers

from  cringing  or  in any way  worshipping  human

beings whatever the colour of their blood. Muslims

are not supposed to sembah to anyone except Allah.

The term to describe prayer in Islam, Mr Speaker,

is  Sembah  Yang. In its fuller form it is  Sembah

Yang  Maha Kuasa dan Maha Esa. Muslims only sembah

to God and to no one else, and we believe in this.

We  are an independent and sovereign State in  the

comity   of   nations.  A  hundred   and   sixteen

independent   and  sovereign  States   and   their

governments  have  accepted  us  into  the  United

Nations Organisation. More than a billion  of  the

world  are with us in the international family  of

independent and sovereign nations. Yet there are a

few  miserable characters in the Barisan  Sosialis

who  say that our independence is phoney. They  do

not  recognise  Singapore's  independence.  In   a

statement in reply to a challenge to them  to  ask

for a public



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 240</b></font><br><br>



inquiry  regarding  Lim Chin  Siong,  the  Barisan

Sosialis asked for air radio and T.V. time on  our

mass  medium. What is the true position? The  true

position  is  that  on  two  occasions  when   the

Chairman  of  the Barisan Sosialis, Dr  Lee  Siew

Choh, was invited to take part in T.V. forums,  he

refused  to attend them. He was running away  from

the  open argument. I am told that they want radio

and  T.V. time to themselves so that they can make

speeches  without  having  to  take  part   in   a

discussion. Sir, they can have this; they can have

what  they  ask, but on condition that they  first

win  a  general  election in Singapore.  Then,  as

members of the Government, they can appear on T.V.

and  radio to explain Government policy and  other

related matters. The people in Singapore look upon

them  as being no more than political opportunists

who  have  time  and again lost out  in  free  and

democratic  elections,  open  arguments,  in   the

Referendum  and even in international forums.  You

remember,  Mr  Speaker, Sir, that  Dr  Lee  Siew

Choh, Woodhull, Dr Lim Hock Siew and others  went

to  the  United Nations to fight against  Malaysia

and the Referendum. In the December, 1965 issue of

the Plebeian Express, the Barisan Sosialis alleged

that    the    Afro-Asian   People's    Solidarity

Organisation had snubbed the P.A.P., the governing

Party  in  Singapore, it seems. It is a fact  that

the  Permanent Secretariat of the A.A.P.S.O. works

on the principle of unanimity, among other things,

on the question of membership.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Permanent Secretariat, besides members

from the U.A.R. and other non-Communist Asian  and

African  countries, are also to be  found  members

from Peking, the Japanese Communist Party and  the

Indonesian Communist Party, the leaders  of  whom,

Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  are today running  for  their

lives looking for hide-outs. It is, therefore, not

at  all surprising that opposition by any or  some

of   these   Communist  representatives   on   the

Permanent   Secretariat  of  the  A.A.P.S.O. can

prevent  unanimity, and this is what has  happened

in  the  case  of not only Singapore's membership,

but  the  membership of other applicants as  well.

Membership of the A.A.P.S.O.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 241</b></font><br><br>



is  on  an unofficial basis, unlike the Afro-Asian

Conference  where  Heads of  State  and  Heads  of

Government attend. Membership of the A.A.P.S.O. is

limited to organisations which may or may  not  be

in  the  governments of Afro-Asian countries.  For

example,  Japan  is represented on  the  Permanent

Secretariat  of the A.A.P.S.O. by members  of  the

Japanese  Communist Party, but not by  Members  of

the Government.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Editor of the Barisan Sosialis is talking

through  his hat when he talks about the governing

Party in Singapore being snubbed by non-government

pro-Communist members of the Permanent Secretariat

of  the  A.A.P.S.O. What matters is  the  official

recognition by Governments in Asia and Africa  and

in the world at large as represented in the United

Nations Organisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the light of these hard facts the boycott of

the  Barisan  Sosialis of this  Chamber  does  not

constitute  even a ripple in the ocean of  support

and  expressed friendship and understanding  shown

to  Singapore by accredited Governments and Asians

of  the world. Dr Lee Siew Choh and his gang  are

not  going to make any difference to our  position

as an independent and sovereign State.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I am inclined to think that not only Lim

Chin  Siong  should be examined by  psychiatrists,

but  there  are many more in the Barisan  Sosialis

who  would  appear  to  be  in  greater  need   of

psychiatric treatment.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the field of education, the planned programme

of expansion in Primary and Secondary Schools, the

Teachers'  Training College and other institutions

of   high   learning,  speaks   for   itself.   If

Singapore's  independence is phoney,  if  all  our

development plans, including those in the field of

education, are phoney and of no consequence,  then

leaders in the Barisan Sosialis, married and  with

children, like Dr Lee Siew Choh, should  withdraw

all their children in our schools in Singapore and

send  them for higher learning to Peking, if  they

want  to.  In  Indonesia, there  is  an  institute

called  the Lenin Institute in Sourabaya, and  Dr

Lee  Siew  Choh can send his grown-up children  or

even the younger



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 242</b></font><br><br>



ones  to that Institute. But, of course, I believe

that  the  professors and lecturers in  the  Lenin

Institute are also running for their lives.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barisan Sosialis, Mr Speaker, Sir, have lost

hope  in the democratic processes, and it is  only

when  politicians have given up all hope  of  ever

winning in an election, in a referendum and in  an

open  argument,  that they turn to more  desperate

ways;   and,   when   they   do,   some   of   the

manifestations take the form of boycott of elected

Legislatures like ours for no logical and rational

reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I was reading a short letter in the Straits

Times  the  other  day from a writer  in  Petaling

Jaya, which happens to be part of the constituency

of  the  Member for Bungsar - but that has nothing

to  do  with the letter. But the writer has  asked

whether  or  not Barisan Sosialis Members  of  the

Singapore  Parliament should  also  boycott  their

$500  a month allowance. I think, Sir, before this

Parliamentary Session is over, it would be good if

you could make a ruling on this matter.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the question of Singapore's

independence, we were travelling in some parts  of

Africa,  Europe - Eastern Europe -  and  Asia,  Mr

Speaker,  Sir, and what struck me most  about  the

reception  given to us was that it  was  not  only

warm  everywhere we went but that the people  were

interested to know why Singapore left Malaysia. In

not  a  few cases, leaders of governments, leaders

of the Opposition, some of whom are pro-Communists

like Dr Lee Siew Choh and others here, shook  our

hands  warmly and congratulated us on having  left

Malaysia.  Words like "liberation" were mentioned,

as  the Minister for Health has just said. But one

other  thing which sometimes gladdened our  hearts

was  that  some of them said, "You have done  very

well  by  having  left the-Kuala  Lumpur  type  of

politicians," and all the rest of it which went to

describe people who go cringing about before

blue-blooded chieftains.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, this allegation of our independence being

phoney,  I  do not know what measure  the  Barisan

Sosialis   leaders   use   when   they   talk   of

independence.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 243</b></font><br><br>



Whether  a  country which has a  foreign  military

base,  when  it achieves independence  is  phoney;

whether countries like the Philippines, which  has

a  relatively  large American  military  base,  is

phoney;  whether Ceylon, which upon attainment  of

independence   in  1947  also  had   a   base   in

Trincomalee  was  phoney in its  independence;  or

whether Thailand with its S.E.A.T.O. base is  also

phoney. Incidentally, Cuba under Fidel Castro  has

a large American base ---



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Russian!



<br><br><!-- Inche A. Rahim Ishak -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Inche A. Rahim Ishak:</b> Yes, the missiles had to be

withdrawn,  being a threat to the  late  President

Kennedy. I ask whether that country's independence

is also phoney.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, it is very difficult to explain, but what I

know as a member of the Goodwill Mission to Africa

and   other  parts  of  the  world,  is  that  Mr

Rajaratnam,  our  Foreign Minister,  explained  to

accredited  and  sober leaders of the  world  that

Singapore has a military base. They all know about

it. There are very few leaders in the world who do

not  know  that  there  is  a  military  base   in

Singapore.  But we explained to them very  clearly

and  forthrightly that there is nothing wrong with

having  a  base  in Singapore, and that  there  is

nothing wrong in having an air base - and a  naval

base   at  that  -  within  the  confines  of   an

independent and sovereign nation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, not one government leader in any of the

countries  we  visited questioned the  independent

and  sovereign status we have in Singapore  today.

So   who  are  those  characters  in  the  Barisan

Sosialis  to question us? What do they want?  Must

Singapore  fall  into the hands of the  Communists

and  then only become independent? Then only  will

Singapore's independence not be phoney?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also searched my mind on this question of

the  allegation of the Barisan Sosialis and  their

other   pro-Communist  friends  about  Singapore's

phoney  independence, but it is very difficult  to

understand them. One can almost see the  glint  of

insanity in their eyes when they talk along  these

lines,  because  I  am  sure  you  yourself,   Mr

Speaker, Sir,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 244</b></font><br><br>



have  asked this question and not found the answer

as  to  why  they say Singapore's independence  is

phoney.  We  can go on considering this  question,

probably  only  to arrive at one  conclusion,  and

that  is,  that  the Barisan Sosialis  are  phoney

socialists.  One is sometimes tempted to  describe

them as Communists or pro-Communists, but even the

Communists we met in Russia were not phoney.  They

were  genuine Communists. But here we have Members

of Parliament who earn $500 a month as

allowance - not 500 Indonesian rupiahs, but 500 real Singapore

dollars,  Straits dollars - and yet  they  boycott

everything except what they pocket.



<br><br>5.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Yong Nyuk Lin (Minister for Health) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Health (Mr Yong Nyuk Lin):</b> Mr

Speaker,  Sir, I rise to speak in support  of  the

motion  standing in the name of the Prime Minister

expressing  our  thanks  to  the  Yang  di-Pertuan

Negara for his Speech on the 8th of December.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As this is the first sitting of Parliament after

Singapore's independence four months  ago,  it  is

worthwhile recalling that Singapore is unique, not

only  in  the  manner as expressed  by  our  Prime

Minister,  that independence was achieved  without

bloodshed, and with a large foreign military  base

still  intact,  but that in recorded  history,  no

country has ever proclaimed its independence three

times like Singapore! It shows how much the people

of Singapore love independence, but they also love

peace  -  not  violence or  bloodshed  - even

more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first declaration of independence was made on

the  31st  of  August,  1963,  as  agreed  by  the

signatories  to the Malaysia Agreement  signed  in

London.  Singapore, which had, by majority consent

through a referendum accepted merger and Malaysia,

was  not  to  be  deterred  in  its  objective  of

independence  by  31st August, 1963,  despite  the

ferocity of Indonesian confrontation, whilst other

signatories  to the London Agreement dithered  and

dallied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second occasion was on the 16th of September,

1963, when Malaysia



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 245</b></font><br><br>



"officially"  came  into  being.  Whilst   we   in

Singapore  accepted, in good faith, the conception

of  a multi-racial Malaysia to be realised through

a  Malaysian Malaysia, yet during the two years in

Malaysia, we suffered the traumatic experience  of

two  heart-rending racial riots, and  thus  we  in

Singapore  came  to  the rude awakening  that  the

authorities  in  Kuala Lumpur  were  not  thinking

along the same wavelength as us.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated in the Appendix to His Excellency's

Speech,  the separation of Singapore from Malaysia

did  not  affect our health services in  any  way,

because  we  had autonomy in health  matters  when

Singapore  was  in  Malaysia.  But  it  should  be

recorded that when Singapore was part of Malaysia,

attendance  at international conferences  required

Singapore's  representatives to  be  part  of  the

Malaysian delegation, which is correct.  Yet,  for

the   18th   World  Health  Organisation  Assembly

Meeting  held in Geneva in May this year, although

the  official  Malaysian delegation  consisted  of

four  delegates, yet Singapore was not  officially

invited by the then Central Government to  send  a

delegate.  Being  then  an  Opposition  Member  of

Parliament in the Malaysian Parliament,  I  tabled

an  Oral Question to enquire why this was so;  and

believe  it or not, Sir, the official reply  given

was that "it was due to an oversight"! There could

only   be   two  explanations:  one,   the   gross

inefficiency    of    the    Central    Government

authorities, or, two, the then Central  Government

already   had   the  pathological  attitude   that

Singapore, although then in Malaysia, was still  a

"foreign"    country.   Either   explanation    is

revealing, and sad!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it was that on 9th of August, 1965,

Singapore  had  independence  thrust  on   it   by

Malaysia. This should not be regarded as our third

try  at independence; rather that the dynamism and

the  virility of Singapore and its people  refused

to   be  browbeaten,  bullied  or  cowed  by   the

unreasonable   bludgeoning   from   the    Centre.

Singapore could not be swallowed and digested, and

had  to  stay out! Singapore therefore now  stands

proudly  as  an independent country,  amongst  the

family of nations.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 246</b></font><br><br>



Though  we  may  be  the youngest  of  independent

countries, No. 22 in the Commonwealth and No.  117

in  the  United  Nations, we  do  not  necessarily

remain in that order of position where quality  of

performance or desire and ability to live in peace

and  harmony amongst the troubled nations  of  the

world are concerned.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore stands at one of the most important

cross-roads  of the world, and its  citizens  come

from various racial stocks, which comprise many of

the world's peoples. With its multi-racial,

multi-lingual,    multi-cultural   and   multi-religious

composition,  we  are a little United  Nations  in

being.  Every effort should therefore be  made  to

make  Singapore a tolerant society as it had been,

to  give  and take, and also to be united  as  one

people and to prosper.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should, however, be on our guard against those

who  have  evil thoughts and designs  of  wrecking

this   peace   and  harmony,  namely,   the

pro-Communists,   the   pro-Communalists   and

pro-Confrontationists.   Every   loyal   citizen    of

Singapore  must decide to play a part in  exposing

such  elements  in  order  to  help  preserve  our

country and to make it more united and stronger so

that  we  may be better able to overcome our  many

political  and economic problems. Let  it  not  be

said that we, of this generation, were tested  and

found  wanting. Let it be recorded that Singapore,

on   attainment   of   its  sudden   independence,

weathered  the  raging storms and  surged  forward

into greater prosperity and happiness because  all

its peoples rallied together and, with courage and

fortitude,   successfully  overcame  its   present

political and economic difficulties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, Sir, I would like to deal with certain

points  raised by the Hon. Member for  Punggol  on

the  White  Paper  for Family Planning  which  was

tabled  in this House in September last.  Although

he  expressed certain doubts and fears because  of

religious  convictions, I am glad that he  started

off  by  stating, and I quote - "I would  be  very

happy, therefore, to support the Government  in  a

campaign  to  educate the people  towards  a  more

responsible  attitude  to  parenthood."  That   is

exactly



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 247</b></font><br><br>



what  the  White Paper on Family Planning attempts

to  do, that is, to increase welfare and happiness

for   all   in  Singapore,  and  only  responsible

parenthood can do that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Punggol, however, disagrees with

the  view  that smaller families of two  or  three

children  are  necessarily  happier  than   larger

families. He is entitled to his opinion  and  even

to  practise what he preaches by raising  a  large

family  if he is so inclined. Paragraph 1.5,  Sir,

of the White Paper goes as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Family Planning does not prevent those who

desire  large  families from having  them,  if  so

inclined,  provided that the mother's health  [not

in  this  case  the father's health, the  mother's

health]  permits  such frequent child-bearing  and

[here  the  husband  comes in] the  family

bread-winner  is  in  the  position to  earn  enough  to

provide  his children and family with a reasonable

standard  of living in basic necessities of  life,

ability  to  see  them through  school  and  other

things which make a comfortable and happy home'.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But further down the paragraph is this very

important  sentence  which points  out  that  many

parents  are ignorant of family planning and  this

is   where   it  is  the  responsibility   of   an

enlightened Government to dispel such ignorance by

educating  and informing such parents  that  there

are  available  a  number of  methods  for  family

planning  and there are seven methods.  Now  these

seven methods. The parents will be told that  some

are   100  per  cent  effective  through  surgical

ligation, where certain things are cut, but  there

are  other methods which are nearly 100  per  cent

effective which are reversible, that is to say, if

you  practise  this,  it is nearly  100  per  cent

effective, but if you do not wish to have it,  you

just  stop  it,  then  you  are  back  again  into

trouble, shall we say.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now these nearly 100 per cent effective family

planning     methods    are    the    Intrauterine

Contraceptive Devices or the Contraceptive  Pills.

There  is what is called the "menu card" of  seven

methods for persons to choose from, and they  will

be  told  method  one, method two,  method  three,

method four and so on down the line until a method

which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 248</b></font><br><br>



only  gives 25 per cent protection. Well,  if  the

mother chooses that 25 per cent protection and she

comes within the other 75 per cent which does  not

prove effective, well, she has asked for it - like

the T.V. film called "You Asked For It"! So it  is

for  the married mother in these circumstances  to

decide which method she prefers -the 100 per  cent

effective  method, the 90 per  cent,  the  70  per

cent, the 50 per cent or the 25 per cent effective

method.  There  is no question of compulsion,  but

one  of choice and what her conscience prompts her

to  decide. The very first paragraph of the  White

Paper goes as follows:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`It is the intention of the Singapore Government,

under  its  Second 5-Year Development Plan

(1966-70),  to bring the message to every married  woman

[not  every woman, but every married woman, it  is

being very carefully worded] (within the fertility

range)  [that is, between the ages of 15  and

44-there are mothers who at 55 still give birth,  but

that is a rare exception. We are concentrating  on

those  who  will  give  birth  more  readily.]  in

Singapore   that   Family  Planning   brings   her

immeasurable  benefits. And, at her request,  [not

at  the  Government's request, but at the  woman's

request;  she  wants  something  done,  she  wants

knowledge, she wants a helping hand] to advise her

on  the  best available methods of Family Planning

which will be simple, inexpensive and safe.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there can be no victimisation of the poor nor

moral  blackmail of mothers in receipt  of  social

welfare  assistance that unless  they  consent  to

family  planning, they may not get any assistance.

The White Paper on Family Planning is intended  to

extend  help  to such poor destitute mothers  from

falling  into greater tragedy and the disaster  of

bearing  yet  more children when  she  is  already

incapable of earning a livelihood to feed not only

herself and whatever children she already has from

her unemployed husband.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such social welfare cases there will be no

charge for services rendered, but for others there

will  be a nominal charge for such family planning

services. For example, we intend to charge only  a

nominal  $10.00 for an intrauterine  contraceptive

device   insertion   which   is   only   a    very

insignificant percentage



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 249</b></font><br><br>



of  what is now being charged by  certain

private practitioners for such a service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, I have no hesitation in assuring the Member

for  Punggol  that  no doctor, nurse,  midwife  or

staff  will be ordered to do anything which  would

run counter to any of their religious scruples  or

prejudices,  if  any, under the Government  Family

Planning  programme; but, on  the  other  hand,  I

would expect such members of staff to declare  why

they  wish to be exempted from such work, and,  on

their part, do not stand in the way of others  who

may desire and wish such family planning advice or

help.  In  other  words, if you think  you  cannot

practise this method, please keep off, but do  not

stop others who are queuing up for such service.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Sir, I completely disagree with the

fears  held  by the Member for Punggol  that  this

family planning campaign will result, I quote, "in

grave  danger of lowering the whole moral tone  of

our  people." He is a brave man who dares to  cast

moral   judgment  on  another.  Besides,   certain

morals,  like fashions, are one of relativity  and

would  appear to change with the times. I  see  no

danger  of  moral laxity in Singapore as envisaged

by the imaginative mind of the Member for Punggol,

but I am quite certain and emphatic that our White

Paper  on Family Planning will prove a great  boon

to  our  married women folk, because they will  be

liberated  from the burden of bearing and  raising

an  unnecessarily large number of children and, as

a  consequence,  to increase human  happiness  for

all.



<br><br>6.01 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr S. Rajaratnam (Minister for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr S. Rajaratnam):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it is a little bit

difficult  to  conduct debates in this  Parliament

because of the situation where you do not have  an

Opposition!  For  a  good  debate  there  must  be

stimulus  and  response.  We  have  not  got   the

stimulus because the Barisan Sosialis, for reasons

best  known  to themselves, have decided  to  stay

away  from  the  Assembly  -  but  I  have  enough

imagination to visualise them



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 250</b></font><br><br>



in  front  of me to provide the necessary stimulus

especially  on  the  question of  foreign  policy,

which is a matter dear to their hearts. So I would

first  like  to state that when we  come  to  talk

about  the foreign policy of a country, there  are

two  senses in which we can do so. We can identify

its foreign policy by the statements of principles

and  objectives  propounded by the  leaders  of  a

country.  These are generally very reassuring  and

infused with high moral purposes, but these do not

necessarily constitute the foreign policy  of  the

country involved.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is another sense in which we can talk

of  a  foreign policy, in that we can abstract  it

from the concrete decisions and actions taken by a

country  on  specific international  issues.  From

these  we can abstract what the country's  foreign

policy  is.  In other words, there  is  a  foreign

policy  of  words, of principles, and there  is  a

foreign  policy of deeds. For practical  purposes,

the  foreign  policy of deeds is a  more  reliable

guide  to  the  intentions of a country  than  its

declared  and invariably reassuring principles.  I

am  not  saying that the enunciated foreign policy

principles  of  a country are irrelevant  or  that

they  do  not  have  any bearing  on  its  foreign

policy.  They can and very often do.  They  denote

what  a  country would like to do, though  in  the

world  of  hard realities it may be forced  to  do

things  which  do  not quite  harmonise  with  its

proclaimed principles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore necessary for Singapore, which is

venturing  for the first time into the  jungle  of

international  politics, to bear  in  mind  always

these two kinds of foreign policy. We should be on

the  look-out  for possible discrepancies  between

deeds  and  words  in  the  foreign  policy  of  a

country.  Only then can we devise our own  foreign

policy  which is sound and realistic. For example,

we  should  not  be lulled into a false  sense  of

security just because a country professes  undying

friendship  and  high regard for us  or  proclaims

peace  and goodwill to all men. We should  satisfy

ourselves  first  that these proclamations  accord

with what it does.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 251</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the fact that a country does not like

us as a matter of principle (maybe because they do

not  approve of the system of government we  have,

or because they do not approve some of the actions

that  we  have  chosen  to do),  this  should  not

preclude normal relations between us and them.  So

long  as  they do not translate their  theoretical

disapproval  of us into deeds, we are prepared  to

enter  into  relations with them.  Of  course,  it

would  be better if they say friendly things about

us  even  as they enter into peaceful and workable

relations  with  us. But if that cannot  be  done,

then we would be satisfied with a friendly foreign

policy  of deeds. So in shaping our foreign policy

we  should  have a clear idea of which category  a

country comes under, for upon this will depend the

measure  of  friendship  and  closeness  with  it.

While,  generally speaking, we are sincere in  our

wish  to be friendly with all countries which want

to  be  friends  with us, in  the  hard  world  of

international  realities there  are  bound  to  he

degrees  of  friendship between  countries.  Those

closest  to  us will naturally he those  countries

whose foreign policy principles and deeds coincide

with   our   national  interests  and  our   basic

aspirations.  We  may  from  time  to  time   have

disagreements with them on specific issues, hut so

long  as the fundamentals of their foreign  policy

and  the  deeds with which they hack them coincide

with  our basic national interests and objectives,

they  will continue to remain our closest  friends

and   allies.   We  should  not  allow   temporary

irritations and minor disagreements between us and

them  to cause us to abandon them as our permanent

and secure friends.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second category of countries are those which

may  have to be unfriendly with us in theory  (for

ideological  reasons or because of the  exigencies

of  domestic  politics) while developing  friendly

and  normal relations with us in practice. So long

as  the  practice  is  friendly,  we  are  equally

prepared  to  be friendly with them,  though  this

friendliness  will  have to be  qualified  by  the

realisation  that  the  friendliness  is  not   as

complete  as  we  would  like  it  to  be.  In   a

relationship of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 252</b></font><br><br>



this  kind  - the second category  -  there  is

always  the  hope  that  the  friendly  relations,

however  tentative and however cautious, could  in

course  of time and with good sense on both sides,

mature  into  friendship of  the  first  category.

These   things  can  happen  and  do   happen   in

international relations. For example, during World

War  II, the Americans and Russians were the  best

of  friends, so much so that they combined  forces

to  bring  to heel Germany and Japan -  by  mutual

agreement  then  their No. 1  enemies.  But  since

World  War  II,  Germany  and  Japan  have  become

America's  No.  1  friends - more  so  than  their

wartime ally, the Soviet Union. So the friends  of

today  or  the enemies of today need  not  be  the

enemies of tomorrow.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in international politics, it is not

wise to formulate foreign policies on the basis of

permanent  enemies, especially  in  the  twentieth

century  world  of  convulsive changes  and  rapid

shifts  in the balance of political forces  within

countries. Singapore's foreign policy, based on  a

realistic  appraisal of the position we occupy  in

South-East  Asia, will therefore not be postulated

on  the  basis of permanent enemies. Ours will  be

the  more positive approach of cultivating as many

permanent friends as we are capable of.  We  shall

therefore  strive to convert this second  category

of  friendship in so far as we can into the  first

category  of  friendship,  of  permanent  friends.

There will he no fixed and inflexible attitudes in

regard to these countries. We shall not take  wild

and  angry postures if from time to time in  their

foreign  policy of words they say something  which

is  not  pleasing to us, so long as their  foreign

policy  of  deeds remains correct and  reassuring.

Here  patience  backed with some understanding  of

why  they  have to say the things that  they  say,

might  pay  dividends and it could  prevent  their

drifting into the third category of nations.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third category of nations are the nations

whose  foreign policy of words are as hostile  and

dangerous  to  our  national  interests  as  their

foreign  policy of deeds. Fortunately for  us,  no

country  has  so  far officially  elected  to  put

itself in this category vis-a-vis an independent



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 253</b></font><br><br>



Singapore.  True, there are elements in Singapore,

like the Barisan Sosialis, who are exhorting other

countries to place themselves in this category

vis-a-vis Singapore. Under the hilarious leadership of

Dr  Lee  Siew  Choh,  for  example,  the  Barisan

Sosialis  are trying to convince certain countries

that  Singapore's  independence  is  phoney,  that

Singapore is a tool of Anglo-American imperialism.

Of course, the Barisan Sosialis leaders think that

in  doing this they are acting like good Marxists.

My  view  - and this may also be the view  of  the

countries  to which their appeals are  made  -  is

that  the  Barisan Sosialis brand of  Marxism  has

more  in  common  with  the  lunacy  of  the  Marx

brothers  than with the thoughts of the author  of

the  Communist  Manifesto.  The  Barisan  Sosialis

leaders  -  if  you will permit this  euphemism

- would  be  well  advised to  re-read  the  opening

sentence of the Communist Manifesto which goes  "A

septre   is  haunting  Europe...".   A  septre   is

certainly haunting the Barisan Sosialis  and  also

their  friends  who  not  so  long  ago  fled   to

Indonesia  to help do in the people of  Singapore.

These  comrades  absconded  to  Indonesia  on  the

pretext that they wanted to liberate Singapore, to

free  it  from the fetters of British  colonialism

and  Malayan  feudalism. But all we know  is  that

they sent terrorists from Indonesia who killed and

maimed  not British colonial soldiers but a number

of innocent and decent Singaporeans, including two

women bank employees. They make no distinction  of

the sexes in these matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither these self-exiled comrades-on-the-run

nor  their  less  adventurous  cheer  leaders  who

elected  to stay in Singapore contributed anything

towards the emergence of an independent Singapore.

Even  as  terrorists from Indonesia  slipped  into

Singapore with bombs and hand grenades, Singapore,

despite  the  scheming  and obstruction  by

anti-national   elements,   found  itself   independent

without  bloodshed, without turmoil,  and  without

any  damage to the social and economic life of the

people.  The  so-called revolutionary  methods  of

struggle  advocated  by  the  Communists  and  the

Barisan Sosialis, it is clear to the people,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 254</b></font><br><br>



achieved   nothing.   Revolutionary   methods   of

struggle,  as interpreted and practised  by  local

Communists  and apprentice Communists,  have  been

barren  of results in Malaya, in Malaysia  and  in

Singapore.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independence has come to Singapore not because of

the  so-called revolutionary struggles or  methods

of  struggle of the local Communists, but in spite

of them. The Barisan Sosialis therefore now try to

cover up their bitter failures by pretending  that

Singapore's  independence is phoney. In  order  to

sustain this fantasy of phoney independence,  they

are  compelled to create other and new  fantasies.

For example, in their Party journal, The Plebeian,

they  claim  that  Singapore's  independence   and

sovereignty has been acknowledged only  by

Anglo-American imperialists and their stooges. In  fact,

some  116  countries  represented  in  the  United

Nations voted for the admission of Singapore  into

the  world  body.  There has,  in  addition,  been

formal  recognition by individual  countries.  The

recent  Goodwill Mission, led by the Deputy  Prime

Minister,  was  officially received by  Afro-Asian

and   Communist   countries  it   visited.   These

countries  would  not have officially  received  a

country whose independence they doubted.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Barisan Sosialis leaders evade the truth

about  the reality of Singapore's independence  by

pronouncing  the  United Nations  a  tool  of  the

American  imperialists  and the  countries  which

received  us  as  stooges  of  the  Anglo-American

imperialists.  In  other words,  the  116  nations

which  voted  for the admission of Singapore  are,

according  to the Barisan Sosialis, the  tools  of

the  Americans. That goes, I presume, for Albania,

too,  because  it too voted for the  admission  of

Singapore into the United Nations. If the  Barisan

Sosialis   thesis  is  correct,   then   President

Kenyatta,  President Nyerere,  President  Nkrumah,

President Nasser and many other Heads of State who

extended personal messages recognising Singapore's

independence  must be Anglo-American  imperialist

stooges.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This kind of political lunacy is carried to

astonishing lengths when the Barisan



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 255</b></font><br><br>



Sosialis move an amended foreign policy motion for

the consideration of this House demanding that  we

adopt  a  foreign policy "friendly  to  Afro-Asian

countries".  This is illogical.  They  argue  that

Singapore's  independence is phoney.  On  the  one

hand, the Barisan Sosialis leaders are busy asking

the  Afro-Asian countries to have  nothing  to  do

with  Singapore  because  they  claim  Singapore's

independence  is phoney. On the other  hand,  they

move  an  amended motion demanding that we  should

establish   friendly  relations  with   Afro-Asian

countries,  which the Afro-Asian countries  cannot

do  if  they  believe the Barisan Sosialis  thesis

that Singapore's independence is phoney.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All this, I humbly submit, Mr Speaker, is

incontrovertible  evidence of  a  fairly  advanced

state  of  political  lunacy  within  the  Barisan

Sosialis  fold. The Barisan Sosialis may not  know

it.  In fact, I am convinced they do not. But  the

countries  to which they are making these  frantic

appeals to adopt a hostile foreign policy of words

as  well as of deeds must surely be aware of this.

In   listening  to  pronouncements  of  the  local

Communists,  such countries should be  aware  that

they are listening to people who are inept because

of a chronic inability to distinguish between fact

and  fantasy, to political leaders and a political

movement which has been discredited in the eyes of

our  people. It may well be that there is a  clear

grasp in certain Afro-Asian countries that a Party

like the Barisan Sosialis is an expendable coterie

of ineffectual clowns to play around with for lack

of  something  better. It may be convenient,  from

the  point  of view of these countries, to  humour

them  into  believing that they are advancing  the

cause  of  socialist revolution. If that  is  all,

then  we are content, because we for our part  can

deal effectively with the Barisan Sosialis and the

local  Communists. In fact, we can well afford  to

allow  the Barisan Sosialis to play at revolution.

Should they or their Communist mentors exceed  the

hounds set by the law and the Constitution, we are

equally  capable of checking them there  too.  For

example,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 256</b></font><br><br>



it  is  all right with us and the country  if  the

Barisan   Sosialis   choose   to   conduct   their

revolutionary  struggle by the simple  process  of

absenting themselves from this Chamber. They  have

not  broken the law or the Constitution  by  doing

this.  And at the end of the month, they  will  be

paid  their $500, and for so long as the  law  and

the Constitution prescribe they should be paid. If

knowing the law and the Constitution in regard  to

the   remuneration  of  Assemblymen,  the  Barisan

Sosialis  representatives return to do their  duty

by their electors, then they would still be acting

constitutionally and no harm will befall them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But insofar as our foreign policy is concerned,

what is important is that the local Communists and

the  Barisan  Sosialis should not  be  treated  by

outside countries as their special responsibility,

when  in fact it is a domestic problem for  us  to

solve.   We  do  not  care  if  foreign  countries

sympathise  with the Barisan Sosialis  or  anybody

else  or  even  wish the local Communists  were  a

little  more intelligent than they have been.  But

what we ask in the conduct of foreign relations is

that  these private sympathies and regrets  should

not  be  allowed to obtrude into the relations  of

foreign  countries with us. The fate and  fortunes

of  the  local Communists should not be  made  an

active   concern  in  the  relationships   foreign

countries establish with us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally, the fate and fortunes of anti-Communists

or  racialists  should  not  be  made  the  active

concern  of  countries which  seek  to  establish

relations  with us. In a democratic  country  like

ours,  there  have  been and  will  be  contending

political Parties striving for power on the  basis

of   different  ideologies  consistent  with   our

Constitution. It is natural for outside  countries

to feel sympathy for this or that Party or even to

pray  for  the victory of a particular Party.  But

friendly  relations between us and other countries

become  difficult  and even  impossible  when  the

sympathy  of an interested observer is transformed

into active interference in our national affairs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the Barisan Sosialis may prattle about

phoney  independence,  this  Government  and   our

people accept the reality



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 257</b></font><br><br>



of  our independence, and our foreign policy  will

be  directed  towards  the  safeguarding  of  this

independence. It does not matter if some countries

do not believe in the reality of our independence.

It  is  sufficient for the purposes of our foreign

policy  that we believe in the genuineness of  our

independence,  that the overwhelming  majority  of

the   people   of   Singapore   believe   in   our

independence,  and that the vast majority  of  the

nations of the world accept our independence. This

being   so,  genuine  respect  for  our  political

integrity  and independence must be  an  essential

element  in  relationships between us and  foreign

countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary task of our foreign policy will

always  be  to  safeguard  our  independence  from

external  threats.  We shall try  to  do  this  by

establishing   friendly   relations    with    all

countries, particularly those nearest to us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way of establishing friendly

international relations is to support any measure,

whether  on a regional basis or through  concerted

international action via the United Nations, which

will enhance prospects for peace in this region by

reducing tensions and fears. Because Singapore  is

regarded by the world and by our neighbours  as  a

strategic  key in this area, we shall ensure  that

our  foreign policy and our defence policy do  not

increase  tensions and fears among our neighbours.

We  are well aware that South-East Asia is in fact

a  battle-ground of great power politics and  that

Singapore   could,  as  a  pawn  of   some   other

countries, decide the outcome of the military game

the big powers are playing in this region.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we are aware of this, our foreign policy

and  our defence policy must ensure that we do not

become, or even appear to become, the pawn of  any

outside  power.  If this were to happen,  then  we

would  be  that  much nearer to  a  real  military

conflict in this area. Therefore, the contribution

that  Singapore can make towards peace  in

South-East  Asia  is  not  to side  with  this  or  that

contending power bloc, or become the pawn  of  any

one  of  them. So long as Singapore does not  fall

into  the hands of any one contending power  bloc,

we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 258</b></font><br><br>



are  ensuring  that  they are  not  panicked  into

taking desperate and dangerous counter measures.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the reason, Sir, why immediately on

independence we declared ourselves non-aligned. It

was not, as some people believed, simply a case of

Singapore following a current Afro-Asian fad!  For

an  independent Singapore, which is also important

strategically, to have aligned itself with this or

that  power  bloc  was  to  have  invited  counter

reaction  from  its rivals. It  would  have  meant

Singapore,  an independent Singapore, being  drawn

willy-nilly  into the big power conflicts  already

raging in South-East Asia, and thus enlarging  the

arena of active conflict. More important, it would

have  also  meant  jeopardising our  recently  won

independence.  Alignment with  one  of  the  power

blocs  means aligning oneself completely with  its

major military and foreign policy objectives.  And

when  a small country like Singapore aligns itself

with  a  big power, there is no doubt  as  to  who

keeps in step with whose policies. In other words,

Singapore's  foreign policy,  if  it  is  aligned,

becomes a copy reproduction of the foreign  policy

of its more powerful partner. Maybe to keep up the

illusion  of  independence, the  major  power  may

permit  or tolerate disagreements in minor matters

of  foreign policy, but in fundamental matters, we

would have to stand smartly to attention when  the

roll call is made on any issue.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a country has put itself in a position of

having  to  follow the foreign policy  of  another

country, there must eventually be loss of  freedom

of  action  in regard to basic domestic  policies.

If, as it is generally accepted, foreign policy is

promotion  and  protection of  national  interests

through appropriate



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 259</b></font><br><br>



international actions, a policy of alignment  with

a  big  power means promotion not of our  national

interests but those of the big power. That is  why

we  are  loath to join in any international

anti-Communist  crusade, because we  are  non-Communist

Socialists at home; because we believe -
