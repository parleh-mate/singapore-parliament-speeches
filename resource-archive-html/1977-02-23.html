Housing  and  Development Board  within  the  housing

estate itself. Equipment

for  the polyclinic is estimated at $371,000. Running

costs  would amount to about $1.4 million  per  annum

(about  $1  million  of which  will  go  to  pay  for

salaries of staff.)

recreational facilities are planned for the residents

expected to be ready by early 1978.

<div align="center"><b>WIDENING OF THOMSON ROAD</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong</b> asked the

Minister  for National Development and Communications

when   the  stretch  of  Thomson  Road  between   its

junctions with Balestier Road and Moulmein Road  will

be  widened and whether the plans to widen  the  road

include  (i) provision of a pedestrian crossing  with

controlled lighting;

(ii)  provision  of  a special lane  at  the  Thomson

Road/Balestier Road junction to allow  cars  to  turn

right  from Thomson Road into Balestier Road  at  all

times  and  not just between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. as  at

present; and (iii) special provision to allow cars of

residents  in Novena Estate to turn right from  Jalan

Novena  into  Thomson Road and  to  turn  right  from

Thomson Road into Jalan Novena more easily and safely

than at present.



<br><br><!-- Dr Tan Eng Liang -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Tan Eng Liang (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

works  to  widen the stretch of Thomson Road (between

Balestier  Road  and Moulmein Road) are  expected  to

commence in July 1977.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No pedestrian crossing with controlled lighting will

be  provided. This is because there are  already  too

many  traffic signals along this stretch  of  Thomson

Road,  Instead, a pedestrian overhead bridge will  be

constructed  in  front  of  the  Novena   Church   in

conjunction  with the road widening  scheme  to  ease

traffic flow and for the safety of the pedestrians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cars will be allowed to turn right from Thomson Road

into  Balestier Road at all times after the road  has

been widened.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An extra lane will be provided for right-turning

vehicles  from  Thomson Road to Jalan  Novena  Barat.

However,  for  traffic  and  safety  reasons,  right-turning will be prohibited from Jalan Novena Barat to

Thomson Road.

<div align="center"><b>ADDITIONAL BUS SERVICE TO BEDOK NEW TOWN</b></div>

<div align="center"><b>(NEIGHBOURHOOD I)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. <b>Haji Sha'ari Bin Tadin</b> asked the Minister for

National  Development and Communications if  he  will

consider asking the Singapore Bus Service to  provide

additional   bus   services   to   Bedok   New   Town

(Neighbourhood  I)  as  the  present   services   are

inadequate.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ong Teng Cheong (Senior Minister of State for Communications) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Communications (Mr Ong Teng Cheong) (for the Minister for National Development and Communications):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

Bedok New Town is presently served throughout the day

by  three SBS services. They are Service 3 to Geylang

and  Chinatown,  Service 12 to East  Coast  Road  and

beyond,   and  Service  220  which  runs  along   the

industrial  area  in Bedok Plain to the  nearby  Chai

Chee  Terminal. At Chai Chee Terminal, there  are  15

other  services operating to major destination areas.

During  peak  periods, there are two additional  Blue

Arrow  Services, i.e. Service 302 to Shenton Way  and

Service  307  to Orchard Road. More buses  have  been

added on to these services during the last few months

as the number of residents in the area increases.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The long-term plan is for all new towns, including

Bedok  New Town, to be served by a system of internal

and  external  bus  services.  Within  each  town,  a

comprehensive network of internal services will bring

residents from the various neighbourhoods to the town

centre  terminal  where  external  services  to   the

Central  Business  District, major industrial  zones,

and other towns will originate. Where demand is high,

express  services will be introduced. Such  a  system

will  make  best  use  of the limited  resources  and

restricted road space and reduce operating costs. The

alternative of linking each part of the town directly

with  various  destinations is an  expensive  way  of

providing good service.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service 220, which was introduced on the 1 5th March

last year and is now enjoying good patronage, is  the

forerunner of internal services for Bedok  New  Town.

It  will be strengthened with additional buses as and

when  necessary.  More  internal  services  will   be

introduced  to  serve  other neighbourhoods  as  they

become occupied.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SBS is working closely with the HDB on the

design of the Bedok Town Centre Terminal for the safe

and convenient transfer by commuters between internal

and external services. The terminal is expected to be

completed in 18 months' time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pending the introduction of the new bus system and

completion of the Town Centre Terminal, the SBS  will

look  into the possibility of extending more  of  its

services to Neighbourhood I of the Bedok New Town  as

an interim measure.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 381</b></font><br><br>

<div align="center"><b>RESERVED SITE IN FRONT OF BLOCK 30, MARINE PARADE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong</b> asked the Minister for Law and

the  Environment  whether the site reserved  for  the

construction of schools in front of Block 30,  Marine

Parade,   which   is  fast  becoming   an   obnoxious

wasteland,  could be levelled for use as a  temporary

football or open field if the construction of schools

is not scheduled to commence within a year.



<br><br><!-- Mr E. W. Barker (Minister for Law and the Environment) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Law and the Environment (Mr E. W. Barker):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the planned construction of

schools  on  this reclaimed site is not  expected  to

commence within a year. Action is in hand to  convert

the site into a temporary playground for children  in

the  neighbourhood. Earthworks and tree planting  are

expected to commence in about three months'  time  as

soon  as  tenders  are  called  for  and  funds   are

available.  This will ensure that the site  does  not

become waste land.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 382</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the Parks and Recreation Department will

ensure  that the vegetation is under control and  the

Ministry   of   the  Environment  will  continue   to

occasionally  spray  oil  on  the  site  to   prevent

mosquito breeding.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ahmad Haleem -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ahmad Haleem (Telok Blangah):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir,

can the Minister for Law and the Environment tell  me

if  the same facility can be extended to other school

sites in Singapore?



<br><br><!-- Mr Barker -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Barker:</b> That depends on the other school sites.

Sir.  Without  proper investigation, I  am  afraid  I

would  not be able to give a concrete answer  to  the

Member  for  Telok Blangah. In this particular  case,

however,  there  had  been negotiations  between  the

Ministry  of  Education and other offices  to  decide

whether  or  not to proceed with the construction  of

schools.  Meanwhile, as the hon.  Member  for  Marine

Parade  has suggested, it is a good idea to turn  the

site into a playground. On the facts of this case, we

can assist. But whether or not we can assist in other

cases depends on the circumstances. However we try to

be of assistance, wherever possible.

<div align="center"><b>APPLICATIONS FOR CITIZENSHIP</b></div>



<div align="center"><b>(Particulars)</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Goh Chok Tong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. <b>Mr Goh Chok Tong</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs  and  Education  how  many  applications  for

Singapore citizenship were under consideration as  at

1st February, 1977,

outstanding  for more than three years,  and  whether

steps  are being taken to expedite the processing  of

those applications.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chua Sian Chin (Minister for Home Affairs and Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Home Affairs and Education (Mr Chua Sian Chin):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the number of

applications   for   Singapore   citizenship    under

consideration as



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 383</b></font><br><br>



as 1st February, 1977 was 25,110.  Of this number, some 15,000  or 60% have been outstanding for three  years

or  more.  However,  some 6,800 of these  outstanding

applications  are, in fact, repeat applications  from

persons  who have applied again after their  previous

applications had been rejected. Nonetheless, they add

to the backlog.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of applications received and the number

of  applications  dealt with during  the  last  three

years are as follows:



<pre>

       Applications    Applications

Year     Received       Dealt With        Difference



1974      7,897           4,248             3,649

1975      7,144           8,400             1,256

1976      7,706          11,552             3,846



</pre>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These figures show that in 1974 there was an addition

to  the  backlog of 3,649 applications.  However,  in

1975  there  was  a net reduction of the  backlog  by

1,256 applications. Last year the backlog was reduced

by a further 3,846 applications.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since March 1975 a committee has been meeting weekly

to  assess applications before submitting them to  me

for  a decision. This has speeded up the process.  In

addition,  my  officials are currently reviewing  the

powers of the Registrar of Citizens with the view  to

delegating to him more powers to approve applications

which  are straight-forward and satisfy clearly  laid

down criteria. However, I must explain that there  is

a  limit  to which the processing can be speeded  up.

This is because many of those whose applications have

been rejected re-apply almost immediately. This means

that  the  faster they are rejected the  faster  they

rejoin the so-called backlog.

<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Home

Affairs and Education whether he is aware that pupils

in  some schools were unable to get certain textbooks

from  their  school bookshops or other bookshops  and

what  steps  his  Ministry will take to  ensure  that

textbooks are readily available either at



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 384</b></font><br><br>



the  school  bookshops or other bookstores  to  avoid

unnecessary  inconvenience to parents  of  having  to

hunt for books.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Chai Chong Yii) (for the Minister for Home Affairs and Education):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, we are aware that at the

beginning of this school year, some pupils of  a  few

schools  had problems in obtaining certain textbooks.

This  was due mainly to uneven distribution  made  by

publishing  firms. The problems were resolved  within

two weeks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following steps are being taken to prevent its

recurrence:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Principals will be asked to prescribe the

textbooks required in June of each year.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Relevant publishers will be notified by August,

so  that sufficient copies could be printed and  made

available.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. At the end of the school year, pupils will be

issued with booklists. The booklists will include the

<div align="center"><b>COMMUNITY CENTRE AND SWIMMING POOL AT SURIN AVENUE</b></div>



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. <b>Mr Ng Kah Ting</b> asked the Minister for Finance

whether  he  is  aware that the piece of  State  land

situated at Surin Avenue is earmarked for a community

centre and a swimming pool, and if his Ministry  will

provide  the  necessary funds to build  the  swimming

pool  for  the  benefit of not only the thousands  of

school  children in the immediate vicinity  but  also

for  the thousands of residents in the constituencies

of  Punggol. Paya Lebar, Braddell Heights,  Serangoon

Gardens. Jalan Kayu, Tampines and Upper Serangoon who

do not have a swimming pool.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen (Minister for Finance) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Finance (Mr Hon Sui Sen):</b> Mr

Speaker, Sir, I understand that a piece of State land

bounded by Surin and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 385</b></font><br><br>



Aroozoo  Avenues is earmarked for a community  centre

and a swimming pool.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the provision of funds to build a swimming

pool  there,  I  recall that the Member  for  Punggol

raised a similar question in 1973. I must answer  his

question   in   the  same  manner.  Funds   for   the

construction of the swimming pool must come from  the

approved  yearly Budget allocation to  the  Singapore

Sports   Council   (SSC),  or  from   donations   and

contributions. The swimming pool must, therefore, vie

for  priority within the Budget allocation  with  all

other  projects  under the SSC Master  Plan  for  the

development of sports facilities. I believe that  the

SSC Master Plan for 1976-1982 provided originally for

three  swimming pools in the North Zone, two of which

are to be sited in the Surin Avenue area. However.  I

believe  also that the Singapore Sports  Council  has

decided  to defer the construction of swimming  pools

in  that  area  until after the Ang Mo  Kio  Swimming

Complex  is completed in 1979 when the position  will

be reviewed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Member for Punggol is impatient for the

development  of a swimming pool in the area,  perhaps

he  may  wish  to start a Fund for this purpose.  The

Government  will  help  by giving  tax  exemption  to

donations to the Fund.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting (Punggol):</b> Sir, would not the

Minister  for Finance agree with my observation  that

since  1973  this  matter has been  raised  and  will

continue  to  be  raised until the  Finance  Ministry

acknowledges that here is a case in point that merits

consideration.  Secondly,  would  the  Minister   for

Finance  ascertain from the Singapore Sports  Council

as  to  the reasons why this plan to build a swimming

pool  to cater for the thousands of residents in  the

few  constituencies  that I have mentioned  has  been

shelved?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Sir,I have explained the procedure

by   which   the   Ministry  of   Finance   considers

applications for allocation of funds. If the Ministry

or the body concerned does not consider it worthwhile

to apply because



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 386</b></font><br><br>



of  other  priorities, then it is extremely  unlikely

that  the  Ministry  of Finance will  substitute  its

judgment for that of the Ministry or body concerned.



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Sir, the hon. Minister has missed

the second part of my question.



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> Would the Member please repeat the

question?



<br><br><!-- Mr Ng Kah Ting -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ng Kah Ting:</b> Would the hon. Minister ascertain

from  the Singapore Sports Council as to the  reasons

why the plan to build a swimming pool in the areas so

mentioned has been shelved?



<br><br><!-- Mr Hon Sui Sen -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Hon Sui Sen:</b> I thought the answer was included in

my  answer that we do not, in fact, try to  find  out

why  money  has  not been applied for  to  build  any

particular project. So it is perhaps more appropriate

for the Member to direct his enquiry to the Singapore

Sports  Council  as to why the priorities  have  been

allocated  in  the manner that other  swimming  pools

have first call on any monies, allocated.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`That the following Address in reply to the Speech of

the President be agreed to



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore,

express  our thanks to the President for  the  Speech

which he delivered on behalf of the Government at the

opening  of the First Session of this Parliament.".'. - [Dr Chiang Hai Ding].



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question again proposed.



<br><br>2.51 pm.



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong (Minister for Culture and Science and Technology) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister for Culture and Science and Technology (Mr Jek Yeun Thong):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the percentage

of  educational-informational programme is very high.

In  fact, it is the highest among the highest in this

region.  Of  the programmes produced locally,  nearly

58%  are  in the educational-informational  category.

These   include  news,  documentaries,   forums   and

magazine



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 387</b></font><br><br>



programmes.  Only  17% of our local  productions  are

musical-variety shows.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, far from cancelling out the work of the

Ministry  of  Education, our  TV  service  does  lend

support  to the efforts of the Education Ministry  in

promoting,   for  example,  music  appreciation   and

cultural activity amongst our young people. The music

and   dance  presentations  included  in  its   Youth

Festivals have always been recorded and telecast.  We

have  currently,  a monthly Students'  Concert  which

features   items   contributed  by   schools.   Music

appreciation  programmes such as  "Great  Composers".

"Who's  afraid of Opera" and "Classical masterpieces"

have also been, and will continue to be, telecast.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need not be worried that TV commercials will have

undue  influence on viewers as the Member for  Potong

Pasir  has  feared. All advertisements are  carefully

scrutinised  before they are accepted  for  telecast.

They  are  accepted  for  telecast  if  they  do  not

contravene the provisions of the Station's  Programme

and  Copy  Codes. These provisions are more stringent

than   those   of  other  media.  There   have   been

advertisements  which  have  not  been  accepted  for

telecast   although  they  have   been   passed   for

exhibition  in  the  cinemas and publication  in  the

press. Last year, a total of 199 advertisements  were

rejected   for   showing   on   TV.   They   included

advertisements which made unwarranted or  superlative

claims, featured unkempt longhaired males or females

indecently clad.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acceptance of advertisements for telecast does not

mean   the   Station's  or  the   Government's   full

endorsement of the manner of presentation or  of  the

product   advertised.  For  example,  acceptance   of

commercials promoting jeans does not mean  Government

endorsement or otherwise of that apparel. We are only

concerned  with  selling air-time.  So  long  as  the

product being advertised is not objectionable and  is

presented  in  good taste, we see no  reason  why  it

should  be  rejected.  There  are,  of  course,  many

gullible consumers who can be



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 388</b></font><br><br>



hooked  on  anything  with or without  advertisement.

They  can  only be educated either by  CASE,  by  the

documentaries  and  talks on  TV,  or  by  their  own

mistakes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earning of revenue from the selling of air-time

for advertisements is not the dominant pre-occupation

of  RTS.  If revenue was the prime factor,  we  would

have allowed - as is done elsewhere advertisements to

be  associated  with our news and  advertisements  in

informational and educational programmes. But this is

not the case.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Sembawang complained that too many

imported  programmes are being telecast and that  80%

of  the  artistes in the musical variety  shows  come

from abroad The truth is that imported programmes are

cheaper  to  acquire  and  are  more  popular,   more

exciting  and entertaining. Besides, we do  not  have

the  capacity to produce all the programmes  locally.

It  is  not true to say that 80% of the artistes  are

from  overseas,  He may have an eye  for  the  Taiwan

singers, but if he sees beyond them he will find that

they  comprise  no  more than  a  third  of  all  the

performers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A greater output of local dramas or serials hinges

upon   the   availability   of   scriptwriters    and

performers.  Apart  from writing for  TV  and  Radio,

there  are  insufficient opportunities and  scope  to

induce  more  people  to take  up  scriptwriting  and

performance   on   a  full-time  basis.   A   related

consideration  is  the need for a greater  number  of

staff such as set designers, carpenters, staging crew

and wardrobe personnel.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am happy to note that the Member for Whampoa finds

the branch libraries useful, and indeed they are.  We

will continue to build these branch libraries in  new

housing  estates  and areas where  the  size  of  the

population  justifies  the building  of  such  branch

libraries. There are already two branch libraries  in

Queenstown  and  Toa Payoh. The next  branch  library

will  be  opened  in Katong in 1978. Plans  are  also

being prepared for new branch libraries at Telok



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 389</b></font><br><br>



Blangah  in 1979, in Geylang East in 1981, in  Jurong

in 1983 and in Ang Mo Kio in 1985.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming to the Ministry of Science and Technology,

the Member for Geylang East has touched on the matter

of  solar energy. The Ministry has been keeping under

constant study and review developments in the use  of

alternative energy sources besides fuel oil. Research

into these areas is being encouraged. Studies on  the

use  of  solar  energy have been  undertaken  by  the

Mechanical   and   Engineering  Department   of   the

University  of  Singapore and research  is  still  in

progress.  There  has  been  some  progress  in   the

development  of methods for the conversion  of  solar

energy  into  electrical energy by solar  engines  in

countries  like Israel, Italy and the  USA.  Although

the  technical feasibility of such methods to produce

electrical   energy  on  a  small  scale   has   been

demonstrated, such methods have not yet  reached  the

stage  of  being  economically viable.  Further,  the

amount  of  electricity generated  by  known  methods

would  not be sufficient to meet the needs of  blocks

of   HDB   flats.   Unless  there  is   a   technical

breakthrough resulting in drastic cost reduction,  it

is  unlikely  that  any  scheme  for  the  supply  of

electricity through the use of solar energy would  be

available  in  the  near future.  The  Ministry  will

continue  to monitor developments in this  field  and

encourage  research in the conversion and utilisation

of solar energy.



<br><br><!-- Mr Fong Sip Chee (Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour (Mr Fong Sip Chee):</b> Sir, may I just seek clarification from the

hon.   Minister,  as  my  name  was  mentioned  again

yesterday.  In  what  category  would  the   Minister

classify  a programme which I am going to quote  now?

On Sunday night, there was a programme on TV where  a

young  couple was asked to come up to the microphone.

The compere asked him whether he was married, and  he

said he was "How many children have you got?" "I have

two." "What about having more?" He said, "No, stop at

two, Two is enough" The compere then said, "Yes, stop

at  two  Two  is  enough. Use your  hands."  In  what

category would the Minister classify this programme?



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 390</b></font><br><br>



This  programme  was telecast live  into  the  living

rooms  of all the homes in Singapore. Would  not  the

Minister care to comment on this?



<br><br><!-- Mr Jek Yeun Thong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Jek Yeun Thong:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I think the

programme which the Member mentioned is the  "Guthrie

Hour".  It  was  telecast live. I did not  watch  the

programme  myself, but I think the compere  mentioned

something like "use your hands campaign." Well,  that

is a variety show.



<br><br>3.02 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii (Senior Minister of State for Education) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Education (Mr Chai Chong Yii):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, several Members have

commented on the activities and plans of the Ministry

of  Education.  I shall try to answer those  policies

and actions which appear to be misunderstood. I shall

also  outline  the  decision-making and  consultative

processes  in the Ministry of Education to show  that

despite contrary views expressed by some Members  the

Ministry  does  not  rush into  changes  and  ad  hoc

policies.



<br><br><i>Moral and Social Values and Attitudes</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question has been asked as to what is meant by

"Asian values". This term is only a convenient way of

referring  to  the  variety of norms,  practices  and

beliefs  inherent  in  the cultures,  traditions  and

customs  of  Asia.  It  is  intended  only  in   this

geographical  sense. Since the vast majority  of  our

population  are of Chinese, Malay and  Indian  ethnic

origin  and we are in a geographically Asian context,

it  is  essential to our survival as  a  nation  that

values and attitudes based on the Chinese. Malay  and

Indian  cultures, traditions and customs are promoted

and  encouraged But this does not mean  that  Western

values and attitudes have no place in our society and

school   curriculum.  It  is  only  the  values   and

attitudes  of  the  West that are pernicious  to  our

society that we are against.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the teaching of these desirable values and

attitudes in our schools, while this is done  through

the  subject  Education  for Living  at  the  primary

level,  at  the  secondary level, there  is  no  such

single subject but three



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 391</b></font><br><br>



separate  subjects of Civics, Geography and  History.

However,  the  teaching and acquisition of  desirable

values and attitudes is not by formal lessons in  the

classroom alone but also by precept and example.  Not

only  teachers  but parents, family and  friends  all

have a part to play in this,



<br><br><i>Language Policy</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Criticism has been directed at the announcement made

by   the   Ministry  of  Education  on  22nd  January

regarding first and second language requirements  for

admission   to  Junior  Colleges  and  Pre-University

classes  from 1979. This is no new and ad hoc  policy

but  a  continuation and development of the bilingual

policy  advocated  17  years  ago  in  1959.  It   is

important for those graduating from universities  who

will  be holding key positions of leadership  in  our

society  to be effectively bilingual in their  mother

tongue   and   English.  The  language   requirements

announced  on  22nd January are principally  for  the

purpose of raising the level of the first language of

those  entering the universities. Employers  in  both

the public and private sectors have complained of the

declining  standards in language  of  our  university

graduates. The universities, on the other hand, blame

this  on the standard of the students coming to  them

from the schools.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need to raise the level of the first language is

shown  by  the results in English as a first language

in  the  GCE `O' level examinations. In 1973, 35%  of

those  who sat for the examination passed in  English

as  the first language. 37% in 1974 and 44% in  1975.

While  the intention of the announcement is to  raise

the  level  of the first language, we have to  ensure

that  this  is not done at the expense of the  second

language. Therefore, minimum standards have also been

specified  for the second language for  admission  to

Junior Colleges and Pre-University classes from 1979.

But  these  minimum standards are not  high  Grade  8

which  has  been  specified for 1979 is  really  just

below pass level, while Grade 7 which



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 392</b></font><br><br>



has  been  specified for 1980 and 1981 is  still  not

even  a pass at `O' level, that is, equivalent  to  a

pass at Sec. II or Ill level. These grades should  be

attainable  by most pupils as is shown  by  the  fact

that  the proportion of pupils who sat for and passed

the  GCE  `O' levels in Chinese as a second language,

for  example, was 60% in 1973, 57% in 1974,  59%  in

1975 and 69% in 1976.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the language requirements are not

intended as a bar to those who are well qualified for

and able to benefit fully from a university training.

Consideration  may  be  given  to  exceptional  cases

depending  on the merits of each. A general exception

to  those who score not more than an aggregate of  15

points  has  already  been announced.  They  will  be

allowed provisional admission to Junior Colleges  and

Pre-University classes even if they fail to meet  the

language requirements.



<br><br><i>Kindergartens</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A request was made that the Ministry of Education

takes  over  all  kindergartens in order  to  control

standard and quality. I wish to inform the House that

there is provision for kindergartens to be registered

with  the  Ministry  and satisfy certain  conditions.

Standard  and  quality of teaching are  some  of  the

conditions. I would also like to inform hon.  Members

that   a   committee  has  been  set  up   comprising

representatives  of the Ministry of  Social  Affairs,

the People's Association and officials of my Ministry

to  look  into the improvements that can be  made  in

kindergarten education.



<br><br><i>Village Schools</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that most rural aided schools are small

but  not  all  of  them are sub-standard.  It  is  my

Ministry's   policy  to  encourage   the   Management

Committees  of  these aided schools to rebuild  where

there is a need. My Ministry is offering them capital

aid   up   to  50%  of  the  total  approved  capital

expenditure. A number of village schools have already

been rebuilt or extended through this scheme.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 393</b></font><br><br>



<br><br><i>Adult Education</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adult education programme is managed mainly by the

Adult  Education Board. It runs language  courses  in

our  four  official languages as  well  as  in  other

languages  such  as  Japanese,  German,  French   and

Arabic.  In 1976, a total of 10,000 students attended

these courses. In the field of general education, the

Board conducts courses leading to the GCE `O' and `A'

levels.  There were over 20,000 students enrolled  in

these  courses  in  1976.  Students  in  the  Board's

commercial   education  courses  are   prepared   for

external  examinations and examinations conducted  by

the  Board.  A total of over 9,800 students  attended

these  courses in 1976, of whom 2,000 were  full-time

day  students. The Board also conducted a variety  of

vocational  and  technical education  courses  for  a

total of over 7,200 students in 1976. There were also

further  education  courses in  Interior  Decoration,

Home  Furnishing and so forth for which the enrolment

in 1976 was over 4,700.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board is expected to continue with these types

of  programmes. In particular, more emphasis will  be

given to commercial education. The Board will also be

organising  and  conducting the  extension  education

programme for the primary school Basic Course  pupils

who enter the Junior Trainee Scheme.



<br><br><i>Evaluation and Assessment of the Education System</i>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comments were made on the Basic Course and its

introduction  projected  as  an  indictment  of  past

policies  and  actions of the Ministry of  Education.

This  was  put forward as reasons for commissions  of

inquiry  to be set up and for reviews to be  made  of

past policies and actions. I do not think there is  a

need for such a Commission. The Basic Course has been

introduced as a continuation and development  of  the

programme  launched  some 17 years  ago  to  provide

universal  primary education. The initial efforts  in

this  programme  were  towards  providing  places  in

primary  schools for all those eligible for admission

..  Not only has this been achieved but the success

of the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 394</b></font><br><br>



population  control programme has been so  successful

that there has been a reduction in the primary school

enrolment  of  about  13% from  363,000  in  1966  to

316,000  10  years  later in 1976.  The  Ministry  is

therefore now in a position to allow retention to  be

practised at all levels in the primary school  system

and  also provide an avenue for channelling into  the

Basic Course those pupils who are unable to cope with

the more academically-inclined Standard Course.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was as a result of a continuous review and

monitoring of the education system. There is  in  the

Ministry   of  Education,  a  Ministerial   Committee

chaired  by the Minister and comprising the  Minister

of    State,   Parliamentary   Secretary,   Permanent

Secretary,  Director of Education, heads of  branches

and  other  senior  officials of the  Ministry.  This

committee   meets  monthly  and  reviews  the   major

policies and activities of the Ministry. In addition.

there  is a Planning and Review Committee chaired  by

the  Permanent Secretary and comprising the  Director

of  Education  and  other  senior  officials  of  the

Ministry  which directs research into and  collection

of  data  on various aspects of the education system.

makes  recommendations  and reviews  plans  and  work

programmes.  The Planning and Review Branch, set  up

some  six  months ago, researches into  and  collects

data  on the education system and monitors it closely

through  sources  both within the  Ministry  and  the

schools and from outside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, special committees may be set up

with  the  best  expertise available  from  different

sources  to review particular aspects of the  system.

For  example, in the recent review of the  secondary

school technical education programme, a committee was

set  up chaired by a professional engineer in private

industry who also has been and is a member of various

public   bodies.  The  committee  members   comprised

another  industrialist  in  the  private  sector  and

representatives  of  the  University  of   Singapore,

Polytechnic and the Ministry of Education.  Based  on

the  recommendations of this committee, changes  were

made to the secondary school



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 395</b></font><br><br>



technical education curriculum in Secondary 1 classes

this  year. Other such committees can be and will  be

set up where necessary.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various channels have been set up for consultation

and  communication. Since early last year, a team  of

senior  Ministry officials have been visiting schools

to   find   out  their  problems  and  have  informal

discussions  with the principals and senior  teaching

staff.   In  addition,  a  series  of  seminars   and

workshops for principals and teachers have  been  and

continue  to  be  held  where  policies,  plans   and

problems   are  discussed  and  recommendations   put

forward. These recommendations are, in turn,  studied

by  the  Ministry  officials. The Ministry  officials

themselves also have regular residential seminars  to

discuss  basic  issues of concern  to  the  education

system.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is consultation with bodies outside the

Ministry and the schools too. For instance, the  NTUC

and   the   teachers'  unions  as  well  as  employer

organisations  have  been consulted  from  the  early

stages in the formulation of the Basic Course and the

Junior Trainee Scheme and continue to be consulted on

this. The teachers' unions were also consulted before

the  changes  to  the  Secondary  1  curriculum  were

affected this year. Members who are concerned  as  to

whether civil servants read Hansard and whether their

comments  are  taken seriously may be  interested  to

know  that  the  Planning and Review  Branch  of  the

Ministry  of  Education has compiled a  list  of  the

comments  made by Members pertaining to the education

system  since 1972. These are being studied  so  that

appropriate remedial, where necessary, action may  be

taken.



<br><br>3.19 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

hon.  Senior  Minister of State  for  Education  made

mention  of Chinese and Malay languages, but  he  did

not  mention about the Tamil language. I want to know

why  he  did not make mention of the Tamil  language.

The Junior Colleges will introduce



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 396</b></font><br><br>



second  language  as  an entrance  requirement.  Will

Tamil be included? If there is no mention of it, then

the Tamil language will lose its status in Singapore.

The  Senior  Minister has talked  about  multi-racial

society  and  multicultural society, but  he  is  not

carrying out what he has stated.



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I mentioned

Indian  culture. I did not use the word  `Tamil'.  As

for second language, of course, Tamil is one of them.



<br><br><!-- Mr Sia Khoon Seong -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Sia Khoon Seong (Moulmein):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, on a

point  of  clarification. The Minister of  State  has

just elaborated on the many specialised committees. I

want  to  find, out whether, as a result of  so  many

committees,   each  working  under   its   terms   of

reference, there is not the danger that some  of  the

decisions  made would have a very narrow  perspective

and  not in relation to the overall policy direction?

Is  this not a weakness if the decisions are  ad  hoc

decisions  in  the  sense that they  only  deal  with

certain aspects of policy and not the overall policy?

The   decisions   of   these  committees   may   have

ramifications  which may affect  the  overall  policy

direction  of  the  Ministry of  Education.  Is  this

system  not a weakness in itself? Is there not  a  co

ordinating body to over-view all the decisions before

any  of these committees are allowed to go ahead with

whatever terms of reference they have been entrusted?

Is this not the cause of all the problems?



<br><br><!-- Mr Chai Chong Yii -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Chai Chong Yii:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the answer is

no. There is no such danger. These committees set  up

as  and  when necessary are working committees.  They

make  recommendations  to  the  Planning  and  Review

Committee.  These  recommendations,  in   turn,   are

studied  and  if  found acceptable, are  put  to  the

Ministerial Committee for a final decision. There are

therefore two layers of coordinating committees.



<br><br>3.23 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence (Dr Goh Keng Swee):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, one subject raised in the Defence

Policy statement excited more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 397</b></font><br><br>



attention,  both  inside this House and  outside  it,

than  other matters. This is the proposal  to  enlist

women  into full-time national service. Most MPs  who

spoke  on  the subject supported the idea,  including

the  Member for Serangoon Gardens and the Member  for

Delta.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Delta argued quite logically that

since  men and women are equal, this equality  should

extend  to  their obligation to defend  the  country.

When  the  time comes to enlist them, women  will  be

trained and posted to non-combatant duties, as is the

practice in other countries.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of MPs, however, queried the need to enlist

women  into the army. Their reservations are  however

based  on  a  misunderstanding, which I now  wish  to

clear up.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan argues that it is

not  necessary  now  to extend  national  service  to

women. I agree with him. There are now enough 18-year

old men to replace those going ROD. But, as explained

in  the  Addendum  to  the President's  Address,  the

numbers  available in future years will  get  smaller

and  smaller and that in ten years' time, the  number

will be about 30% less than what it is now.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Addendum states that this has consequences which

are  being examined in MINDEF, Obviously, there is  a

need  to  review manpower establishment in the  army,

but  however much we trim down the establishment, it

is  unlikely that this could achieve a 30% saving  in

manpower.  Therefore, if we want  to  maintain  force

levels  at present strength, it will be necessary  to

recruit women to fill up non-combatant posts, as  is

being  done  in  other armies. This is  a  matter  of

simple  arithmetic  and I do not  think  that  it  is

necessary  to have a public forum, as the Member  has

suggested, to prove that two plus two equals four.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal to extend NSF to women has excited a

lot  of comment because it seems novel. There are two

points  of clarification I want to make on this.  The

first is that women soldiers are not really a novelty

in Singapore,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 398</b></font><br><br>



as  Members are well aware. But few people know  that

we  have  no  less than 2,544 women soldiers  in  the

regular service. In fact, we have more women soldiers

today  in the regular service than there are soldiers

in the two battalions during the colonial times These

women  are  in  vocations such  as  typists, clerks.

telephonists, electronic  technicians, drivers  and

storekeepers.   My   second   observation   is   that

enlistment  of NSF women is not something which  will

take  place  immediately. The  manpower  shortage  is

prospective rather than immediate.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Kembangan has made a plea on

behalf  of  women and expressed the hope  that  since

they  are  a  special asset to the  nation, and  the

greatest  asset  is their feminity, national  service

for  women  should  be such as not  to  destroy  this

feminity. I give the Member full assurance  that  the

Singapore  Armed  Forces will not perpetrate  such  a

heinous deed as destroying the feminity of our women.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Telok Blangah makes the point that

those who are not selected one year after the call-up

age of 18 should be granted deferment. This, in fact,

is  the  general practice at present. There could  be

special  circumstances;  for  example,  a  registrant

needed  time to recover from illness or he  is  doing

secondary or tertiary education at the age of 18.  In

such instances they will be called even after the age

of  19. Should any of them encounter difficulty  over

employment,  they  could get a certificate  from  the

Central Manpower Base to the effect that they are not

liable for full-time national service. Older MPs  are

aware of this procedure,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a problem which affects Malay MPs more than

the  others because of the specific circumstances  of

past recruitment policy in the SAF.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, recruitment into the SAF had to take

into  account  the ethnic distribution  of  soldiers,

both  national servicemen and regulars.  This  is  an

accepted  practice in multi-racial societies  because

military  service is a matter of importance  and  the

ethnic



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 399</b></font><br><br>



distribution  of soldiers is obviously an  important,

yet  delicate, subject. When national service  began,

there was a large preponderance of Malay soldiers  in

the  army  because the regulars of the two battalions

we  inherited  from  the British were  preponderantly

Malays. The non-Malays, especially the Chinese,  were

simply not interested then in joining the army.  This

was especially true of the regular NCO ranks. Because

of  this, the intake of Malays into national  service

was  limited for some years. This did not present any

problem  to the army because total numbers  available

were  in  any event much more than could be  absorbed

into the army.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, over the years, we had increasing numbers of

non-Malays entering the regular service as  NCOs  and

the  ethnic  balance  of  this  important  group   of

military  personnel  has  moved  nearer  towards  the

proportion  in the general population.  So,  as  from

this  year,  increasing numbers of Malay  youths  are

being enlisted into the army and this will be evident

at  the decentralised National Day parades this year.

The  problem  which the Member for Kampong  Kembangan

raised is, therefore, a passing one.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Serangoon Gardens has made a number

of  observations on defence policy, and I would  like

to  comment on them in detail. The hon. Member  seems

to be in favour of total involvement of all citizens,

men  and women, in the defence of our Republic. While

I respect the sentiment which inspires such a view, I

am  doubtful  as  to its wisdom.  One  of  the  prime

objectives  of  building up a  defence  force  is  to

create a climate of confidence which would enable the

ordinary   business  of  life  to   go   on   without

impediment.  If  we  were  to  adopt  the  policy  he

recommends,  that is total involvement of  every  man

and  woman in defence of the country, this  may  well

create   anxiety,   and  even  introduce   a   crisis

atmosphere where none exists now. I think this  is  a

wrong thing to do when there is no military threat to

our security discernible on the horizon.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 400</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards deferment on medical or financial

grounds,  the  principle has been  well  established.

Applications for exemption on financial  grounds  are

considered  by  an advisory board which  consists  of

prominent citizens from industry, the civil  service,

the  universities and the professions. Exemptions are

granted  only in serious cases in which  hardship  is

more  than  temporary. Exemptions on medical  grounds

are  granted  only if the person is  certified  by  a

medical  board  (consisting of three doctors)  to  be

permanently  unfit  for  national  service.  However,

those  with HSC/4 qualifications are still called  up

for  full-time  national service  even  if  they  are

medically unfit and are posted to sedentary  civilian

occupations instead of undergoing military  training.

This  is  to ensure that the medically unfit  do  not

have  an  advantage  over  the  fit  in  respect   of

university  education.  Many are  posted  to  outside

Ministries,  for  instance,  in  the  Inland  Revenue

Department  where  they are good at calculating  what

taxpayers  have to pay. They work, of  course,  under

supervision of experienced staff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Member for Serangoon Gardens has raised

the  question on the future role of volunteers in the

People's  Defence  Force (PDF). He  asked  whether  a

volunteer  force  could not be  detailed  to  certain

security  duty so as to release the regular army  and

reservists for other roles.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The PDF has a long and interesting history and close

connections  with  Members  of  Parliament  during  a

period.  In  fact,  at one time,  all  MPs  who  were

physically  fit were members of the PDF, and  a  good

many  were commissioned as officers. Sad to  say,  of

these, only two remain, namely, the Member for  Pasir

Panjang  and the Member for Kampong Chai Chee.  These

two are now officers in the 101st Battalion, PDF, and

have  reached  the rank of Captain.  Since  the  last

elections,  the  number of MPs in the  battalion  has

increased by 50% from two to three, with the election

of the Member for Serangoon Gardens.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say a few words about the history of

this battalion, 101 PDF, as the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 401</b></font><br><br>



soldiers  call it, how it came about,  and  what  its

future  is  likely to be. The 101 PDF can  trace  its

ancestry  to  the  former Singapore  Volunteer  Corps

which  was  started by the British in the year  1854.

During  confrontation, some volunteers were mobilised

for full-time service and the unit was re-titled 10th

Battalion, Territorial Army. Members would  recollect

that we were then part of Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After August 1965, the battalion was re-titled 10th

PDF  and the number has now been changed to 101  PDF.

This  is  to  distinguish it  from  the  PDF  reserve

battalions   consisting  of  certain  categories   of

national  servicemen  after  their  ROD,  and   these

battalions start with lower serial numbers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;101 PDF is really a composite unit of volunteer

elements   consisting   of  the   original   infantry

battalion, the volunteer engineers, formerly 106 PDF.

the  S Battery of the Volunteer Artillery and the PDF

Women. This amalgamation took place in May 1974. This

was  necessary because each of these different groups

had  been  dwindling  in numbers through  the  years,

mainly because no significant role could be found for

the volunteers.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After amalgamation in 1974, it was still not certain

whether  the battalion would survive or would  die  a

natural death through continuing attrition of members

leaving  the  battalion. Many in MINDEF thought  that

the battalion would die, but in fact it refused to do

so.  No  one understood what the reason for this  was

although  there was some speculation. One  school  of

thought,  for  instance, believed that the  continued

survival  of the battalion was due to the  fact  that

the   officers'   mess   had   the   most   sumptuous

airconditioned bar in the SAF. I do not believe  this

theory because I think, by and large, ours is  not  a

boozing army. Another theory was that the annual  in-camp  training  was  well  attended  because  members

wanted  to escape from their wives. This may  or  may

not be true. I have no evidence one way or the other.

So  to  find  out what the facts were, when  101  PDF

carried out its annual in-camp training from 17th May

to 29th May.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 402</b></font><br><br>



1976,  at  Pulau  Tekong Camp I, I  decided  to  send

MINDEF's research team to this Camp to find out  what

was happening.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They reported an interesting situation. Morale

appeared  to  be  very  high. One  soldier  told  the

research staff:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`We can quit any time we want and our presence here

today  is  art  indication of our  interest  and  our

happiness.'



<br><br>The report goes on to note:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`A look at the barrack lines reveals the presence

`of   clothes   of  all  colours  and  hues   blowing

triumphantly  on  the  clothes  lines  (outside   the

barracks( in the afternoon sea breeze coming from the

South China Sea Inside and outside the barracks,  men

appeared  in  various  types of  clothes, regulation

training  uniforms, regulation PT  kits,  unregulated

shorts  and  T-shirts of all sizes and colours,  some

even  bearing the slogan "Cancel last order", whilst

some  soldiers were jogging around in beautiful track

suits. An air of freedom and satisfaction appeared to

be the prevailing mood:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military performance was not too bad and the

trainfire  result  not  entirely  discreditable,  67%

passing  the test. Discipline seemed to be excellent,

there  being  only one disciplinary case,  a  private

soldier   being  reprimanded  for  arguing   with   a

volunteer  officer. There seemed to be a  camaraderie

among  members of the battalion which  is  not  often

found in other army units.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report stated that most officers and men agreed

that  the  quality of food had improved considerably.

However, they felt that the quantity of food  served

was insufficient to satisfy the improved appetite  of

men  under  rigorous physical training. However,  the

private  soldiers complained about  having  to  serve

food to officers during meal time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research team listed out some of the grievances

of  members of the battalion. In general,  they  felt

that  they were being neglected, which was of  course

quite true. They felt that promotion prospects in the

battalion   were  virtually  absent.   One   corporal

complained  that he served between 1947 and  1956  in

the  volunteer  corps  and had reached  the  rank  of

sergeant. When he rejoined in 1969, his old rank  was

not  given him, There was a widespread complaint that

employers were not sympathetic in granting them leave

to attend in-camp training. All the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 403</b></font><br><br>



volunteers wanted to know what the future was. As one

soldier puts it:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Because of the peculiar type of treatment we

volunteers get, some people think we must be  Out  of

our  minds  to volunteer, but nevertheless  we  still

volunteer.'



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One soldier identified in the MINDEF report as No.

2175148/J, Pte Lau Teik Soon, asked the research team

to   get   answers  to  two  questions  from   higher

authorities:

(a) For what priorities do volunteers exist as far as

MINDEF  is concerned? (b) What are the prospects  for

volunteers?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions posed by Pte. Lau Teik Soon have been

exercising the minds of MINDEF General Staff and  PDF

HQ.  Since Pte. Lau has transformed himself into  the

Member  for  Serangoon  Gardens,  it  has  also  been

exercising  my mind. I therefore want to examine  the

problems in detail and to suggest some solutions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The root of the problem is that the hardcore, i.e.,

those who refuse to die, is not sufficient in numbers

to  form  a  full-strength  infantry  battalion.  The

hardcore consists of 41 officers and 133 other ranks,

as  against  some  800, all told, needed  to  form  a

battalion.  Before  any solution is  possible,  there

must   be   some  credible  means  of  getting   more

volunteers. Previous recruitment exercises  met  with

disappointing results. In 1972, against a  target  of

300,  there were only 35 suitable applicants of which

only  19 were subsequently enlisted. The exercise  in

1974 fared no better. Until some means could be found

to get better results, 101 PDF will, I fear, continue

to  limp along. This is where hon. Members can  help,

especially  the younger MPs and the new ones.  Unless

they  show an example by coming forward to  join  101

PDF,  they  can hardly expect the general  public  to

respond  with  enthusiasm. If  there  are  sufficient

numbers of MPs volunteering to join the battalion,  I

will  arrange  for  a suitable officer  cadet  course

which  could  be undertaken after working  hours  and

during weekends for these MPs as well as for existing

members of the battalion who are of officer material.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 404</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following this, the MPs concerned could help in the

recruitment  drive.  Nearly all  constituencies  have

youth groups, some of whose members could be suitable

material  for  this battalion. If Members  find  this

idea  attractive, I suggest that they  could  form  a

committee  under the leadership of the three  Members

of the House who are members of 101 PDF, and work out

plans on how to progress the scheme.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PDF HQ is thinking of raising, in three phases, four

Rifle  Companies of the battalion, a support company,

as  well as an HQ Company. We have sufficient regular

officers  and  NCOs  to assist  in  the  buildup  and

training   of  the  battalion;  training  areas   and

training courses could be made available. The problem

is  to get enough men who are as keen, dependable and

durable as the hardcore which refused to give up. And

I  hope  that the young, fit and new MPs will respond

to this challenge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. Members:</b> Hear, hear!



<br><br>3.44 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, it gives me

great  pleasure  to welcome 11 new  Members  to  this

House.  It has been my duty to have followed  closely

what  they have said in the proceedings of  the  last

few  days. I may not always have been here physically

but  with the aid of modern electronics, I can assure

Members that I do with considerable ease follow  what

takes  place, not only when they speak but when  they

laugh,  not  very  often, when they jeer, even  less

often,  when they interject, rarely at all. It  is  a

livelier session than it has been.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I ought to begin by saying that they ought

to take themselves seriously because we, on this side

as  Members  of the Government, take them  seriously.

Upon   us  is  the  burden  of  finding  a  successor

Government worthy of its responsibilities. It is  not

an  easy job. First, let me explain the shock for new

Members.  They have been at the hustings.  They  made

different kinds of speeches. They come here, they are

bound by Standing Orders and rules of debate which we

have inherited, copied, modified, and I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 405</b></font><br><br>



believe  modified  insufficiently for  our  purposes;

copied  from  the British, Westminster  pattern,  but

modified  inadequately. We have got to find  our  own

style.  We  have got to be bold enough to experiment.

We  do not say in approval "Hear. Hear" because  that

is  not  what Singaporeans say. They are not supposed

to  clap in the British House of Commons. Maybe  ,the

Australians;  the New Zealanders, they do  not  clap.

But  I have been in the Lok Sabha, which is the Lower

House  in  India.  At  any one time  there  are  1 5

speakers on their feet, literally. The Speaker points

to  one  person, and he is the one that goes  on  the

official  record. But 14 others are going merrily  on

at the same time. In 1971, my colleague, the Minister

for Law, was with me in my journey to India, when  we

met  the retired Speaker, who had become Governor  of

the  State  in  which Jaipur is,  Rajasthan.  He  was

writing a book about his experiences, the humour  and

the humourous times he had. His successor was another

Sikh, turbaned gentleman, more robust physically.  (I

do  not  know if he could have been as robust as  the

elderly  gentleman  he succeeded).  I  asked  him  in

Delhi,  December  1971, whether  things  were  better

then. He said, "Yes, only 12 people speak at the same

time." Maybe the state of emergency in India has made

it  possible for the Lok Sabha to have one speaker at

one time. We must have some order.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me explain the problems that we face, by

first  reading an excerpt from a book  written  by  a

British  left-wing  Minister  who  started  the  free

health  service scheme in Britain, Aneurin Bevan.  He

is  dead. I had the privilege of knowing him  and  he

gave me this book. It was published in 1952, entitled

"In  Place  of  Fear". On page 6,  he  described  his

experience and the dangers of a Britisher or Welshman

in his case, going into Parliament:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`His (the MP's( first impression is that he is in a

church the stained glass windows, the rows of statues

of  great  statesmen of the past, the echoing  halls,

the   soft-footed   attendants  and   the   whispered

conversation, contrast depressingly with the  crowded

`meetings and the clang and clash of hot opinions  he

has  just left behind in his ejection campaign.  Here

he  is, a tribune of the people, coming to make  his

voice  heard in the seats of power, instead, it seems

he is expected to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 406.</b></font><br><br>



worship;  and the most conservative of all  religions

-- ancestor worship.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing he should bear in mind is that these

were not his ancestors [namely, the working class. He

is  talking  now as a Welsh miner or a descendant  of

one.]  His  forebears had no part in the  past, the

accumulated  dust  of  which  now  muffles  his   own

footfalls.  His  forefathers were  tending  sheep  or

ploughing  the  land, or serving the statesmen  whose

names  he  sees written on the walls around  him,  or

whose  portraits  look  down upon  him  in  the  long

corridors,  It  is not the past of  his  people  that

extends  in colourful pageantry before his eyes  They

were  shut Out from all this: were forbidden to  take

part   in  the  dramatic  scenes  depicted  in  these

frescoes.  In him his people are there for the  first

time, and the history he will make will not merely be

an  episode in the story he is now reading, [that is,

him]. It must be wholly different:

as  different  as is the social Status which  he  now

brings with him.'



<br><br>The  epilogue I read at Fullerton Square when Mr  Roy

Jenkins gave up his seat, left the British Parliament

to  become President of the EEC Commission,  when  he

said  that  debates and parliamentary  triumphs  were

meaningless, that changes in government do not  bring

about  fundamental  changes of  economic  and  social

policies   that  have  set  in,  that   a   successor

government  inherits  all the mistakes  and  all  the

policies of its predecessor and takes a long time  to

unwind  itself, untangle itself, from what has  been.

But Aneurin Bevan writing this before 1952 was not to

know the epilogue. He urges his young Labour MPs:



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`to preserve the keen edge of his critical judgment

he  will  find  that  he must adopt  an  attitude  of

scepticism   amounting  almost   to   cynicism,   for

Parliamentary procedure neglects nothing which  might

soften the acerbities of class feelings. In one sense

the House of Commons is the most unrepresentative  of

representative   assemblies.  It  is   an   elaborate

conspiracy to prevent the real clash of opinion which

exists  outside  from  finding  an  appropriate  echo

within  its  walls.  It  is a social  shock  absorber

placed  between privilege and the pressure of popular

discontent,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new Member's first experience of this is when he

learns  that  passionate  feelings  must  never  find

expression  in  forthright speech. His  first  speech

teaches  him that [That is your duty. Mr  Speaker,  l

Having   come   straight  from   contact   with   his

constituents, he is full of their grievances and  his

own  resentment, and naturally, he does his  best  to

shock his listeners into some realisation of it



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He delivers himself therefore with great force and,

he     hopes    and    fears,    with    considerable

provocativeness. When his opponent arises to reply he

expects  to hear an equally strong and uncompromising

answer His



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 407</b></font><br><br>



opponent   does  nothing  of  the  sort   in   strict

conformity    with   Parliamentary   tradition, he

congratulates  the new Member upon a most  successful

maiden speech and expresses the urbane hope that  the

House will have frequent opportunities of hearing him

in  the future The Members present endorse this quite

insincere  sentiment with murmurs of  approval.  With

that, his opponent pays no more attention to him, but

goes  on  to  deliver the speech he had  intended  to

make.  After  remaining in the seat a little  longer,

the  new Member crawls out of the House with feelings

of deep relief at having got it over, mingled with  a

paralysing sense of frustration, The stone he thought

he had thrown turned out to be a sponge.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not have bothered to describe this typical

experience of a working man speaking in the House  of

Commons for the first time were it not characteristic

of  the  whole  atmosphere The classic  Parliamentary

style  of  speech is understatement  It  is  a  style

unsuited  to  the  representative of  working  people

because it slurs and mutes the deep antagonism  which

exist in society



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we have not, fortunately, inherited the British

Empire.  We  have inherited a very small fragment  of

it. We have not the deep class antagonism, but if  we

do not bring out these differences of opinion, and if

we  had not done so successfully since 1965 when  the

Barisan Sosialis MPs walked out of this Chamber, I do

not believe that in February, 1968, in September 1972

and  again  in  December 1976,  we  could  have  been

returned unanimously and completely. So, when in  his

youthful zest and enthusiasm, the Member for Kim Seng

and   that   is  also  a  convention  which   British

newspapers have dropped because nobody knows who  the

Member  for Kim Seng is they know Dr Ong Leong  Boon,

they  know  him and they will get to know him  better

and  better  as the years go by. This is a  marathon,

not a hundred yards spurt. With every passjng speech,

with every passing act, the character, the style, the

strength, the weaknesses are etched in the  minds  of

the  public. You can do a PR job, as has been written

in  American  books after the making  of  presidents,

where  you  have  a vast electorate  of  200  million

people  with over 120 million potential voters,  with

the  help of radio and TV, and you suddenly find with

a  whole host of ghost writers and advisers, that the

man  becomes  scholarly, learned, solicitous  in  his

speech. Catch him at a press conference and a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 408</b></font><br><br>



question and answer session, where the ghosts  cannot

whisper to him, and the man is betrayed.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when Dr Ong Leong Boon, the Member for Kim Seng,

invited  public debate and public discussion,  forums

on  television, I say. "Choose your partners and pick

your  opponents." And I think he even tried. Not very

many,  but  he and a few others, have praised  me  in

their  speeches,  praised Dr Toh, never  attacked  Dr

Goh. The Chinese saying goes: ruan de qi ying de pa -

Bully the soft, keep clear of the tough. Because  you

can be hurt and he does not want to be hurt. But life

consists of both the soft and the hard.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many issues have been raised. It is the aftermath of

an  election  campaign. I heard my  own  Minister  of

State  yesterday.  He  was  in  good  form.  He   had

recovered. I was proud of him. It is the old Ya'acob,

whose  voice nearly fully restored despite  nearly  a

fatal  loss to the oratorical powers that we have  in

this  House. He may not impress the Gallery up  there

because the Malay speaking audience is not there. But

if  you go down to Geylang Serai, you will need  Haji

Ya'acob because he has a style panache they call it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I wish to remind Members is this:

that  we  take them seriously, and over ~  period  of

time  we  begin to take some MPs more seriously  than

others, because they have done their homework. It  is

a  question of getting to know them, familiarity over

a long stretch of time. It has its advantages and its

disadvantages. I take the Member for Katong seriously

when he speaks. He has done his homework. He tries to

present  it  logically,  forcefully,  humourously.  I

think  Joe  Conceicao has now gone through  simulated

fire.  He  has  won  an  election.  He  was  returned

unopposed in 1968. They were so scared of him in 1972

that  he was again returned unopposed. But this  time

they  were  foolhardy  enough  to  take  him  on.   I

congratulate him.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there are a few others like him. It would be

invidious but I think I ought to



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 409</b></font><br><br>



mention  Dr  Chiang  Hai Ding,  the  Member  for  Ulu

Pandan,  and  my own former Political  Secretary.  Dr

Augustine  Tan. "Former" I think he knows the  reason

why, and I do. When he is in form, he is first class.

Yes, he  is.  But  I am a hard task-master.  I  want

somebody to be in top form, in top gear all the  time

because  nothing  less  will suffice.  Because  if  I

believe  that  the  engine  is  working  on   all   8

cylinders, and when I press it it is working on 3,  I

am in deep trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is really so simple, yet it has been

solved  only a few times in a few countries and  only

over  certain periods of time a one-man one-vote,  to

produce  a  group of men who can provide a continuity

in  good government, change of policies, flexibility,

to  reflect  the changing moods of an electorate.  In

other  words, you need a wide spread, a wide  variety

representing all types, reflective and representative

of  the population. And that is why we are here.  But

from amongst us, most of us, or perhaps I can say all

of  us, speak more than one language or you would not

be  here. You may not speak the second language  well

but  you understand what is being said. You know what

your  constituents  want. You know  what  it  is  all

about. Therefore, I am a little disappointed to  find

people who have gone through this process questioning

the wisdom of demanding minimum pass standards in the

second  language.  This  is Singapore.  This  is  not

representative.  It is Mr Sia, Member  for  Moulmein,

The  Member  for Bedok wants a commission of  inquiry

into schools. And there are quite a few others.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I explain briefly and simply for the new

Members. Language, culture, and religion in a  multi-racial,  multi-lingual, multi-religious  and  multi-ethnic  society, with one-man one-vote, can  lead  to

great  tragedy. As it has, in the case of  India  and

Pakistan  a  division  of  the  country.  And  again.

between East and West Pakistan, both Muslim, but  one

Bengali-speaking  and  the  other  Urdu-speaking.  In

India  itself, as it breaks up into various  language

provinces, or states. And in Canada, after nearly 200

years of British



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 410</b></font><br><br>



conquest  of  Quebec, the Quebecois  are  talking  of

separate independence.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Played one-man one-vote, it is very significant. Not

one  single Chinese educated Member of this House has

questioned the wisdom of that move. It is the English

educated  and  the Malay educated. I think  it  is  a

great  tribute. I take it as, a great tribute  to  my

colleagues  and myself. And this, is not a  joke.  At

every election, the same issue crops up - the killing

of  Chinese language, culture, civilisation. We  have

heard  it before. Maybe Mr Tan Soo Khoon, the  Member

for  Alexandra,  now 27, would not  have  known  that

there  were  riots! 30,000 to 50,000  Chinese  middle

school  students camped in Chinese High  School.  The

place  was  surrounded by riot police. Mr  Tan  would

have  been four years old then. I think it  is  worth

recounting  that. Oompah! Merdeka! Oompah!  Merdeka!,

they  chanted,  and they formed a  circle  round  the

policemen  and danced round them. I was  their  legal

adviser. I was legal adviser to the Singapore Chinese

Middle School Students Union - zhong xue lien (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;).

A  boy  got  scalded with a cauldron of  boiling  hot

water. They were afraid - the comrades were afraid of

what  would  happen  if  the parents  discovered  it,

because the parents would then descend on the  campus

and  pull  all their children home. The  boy  was  in

great  pain. They were wanting me to find  a  way  to

smuggle a doctor in. But, unlike Mr G. Raman who very

unwisely   misconstrued  the  constitution   of   the

University  of Singapore Students' Union,  I  assumed

that the Special Branch then under the control of the

British, would have a very shrewd idea of what  would

transpire  between the students and me. I  gave  them

very  correct advice. I said the right  thing  to  do

would  be  to ask the police for permission to  bring

the  boy  to  hospital, failing which to  ask  for  a

doctor  to go in, but not to smuggle one in. And  the

best thing to do was to do it quickly before the  boy

dies.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that we are beginning to become one

people,  very  slowly, very gradually.  Let  us  not

forget that those of us who read the Chinese papers - (I do not know how many



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 411</b></font><br><br>



do with the English educated. But if I do not, then I

am not fit to be here. I cannot be here)

-  that  till  today the Chinese Chamber of  Commerce

votes along clan lines, weighted representation.  The

Hokkiens  have  the  vote, and they  count  how  many

Hokkiens   and  say.  "All  right,  you   have   that

representative on the committee." The  Teochews,  the

Cantonese,  the Hainanese, the Shanghainese  and  the

Hakkas - they are not one Chinese, they are different

Chinese. And gradually the lingua franca, as  we  got

the  feedback from the army, was not Nanyang  Putong

Hua (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) but xin jia po fu jien hua ( ).



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The education policy was a politically red hot

potato. It was dynamite

<br><br>4.38 p.m.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, before the

brief  adjournment, in  case Members  required  some

sustenance for what they fear may, be coming.  I  was

mentioning that the Ministry of Education was not the

most popular of portfolios. And I would like to pay a

tribute,  if  I may, to my former Cabinet  colleague,

the  Member  for Geylang West, Mr Yong Nyuk  Lin.  He

took  on the job where angels fear to tread. He moved

in.  I  often wondered whether he knew how many  land

mines there were.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A great deal of play has been made of the number of

Ministers  of  Education in the  last.  17  years.  I

think,  after a while, a debating point, if  repeated

and   not  rebutted  becomes  part  of  the  accepted

mythology.  I  think  I  must rebut  it,  break  this

debating point and consign it to the rubbish heap.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Yong held this office from June 1959 to October

1963, four years and four months. Then Mr  Ong  Pang

Boon  took over because it was a political hot potato

and  I  needed someone with a fair, but  not  a  low,

melting  point.  And Mr Ong took it on  from  October

1963  till  September 1970 - seven years  he  was  in

charge.  It was still a "hot potato" Then  he,  after

seven years, got stale in education. I had Mr Lim Kim

San  take over from September 1970 to September 1972,

two  years. Four years, seven years, two years.  Then

Dr  Lee Chiaw Meng took over from September 1972 till

June  1975, nearly three years. So up till June  1975

there  were  only four Ministers of Education  in  16

years. And not only that. There was continuity in the

Permanent Secretaries. From 1959 to 1963 there was  a

series   of   changes:   Lee  Siow   Mong,   Hoffman,

Ambiavagar. S.C. Thong. Mr Yong Nyuk Lin went through

four  Permanent Secretaries. They probably found  the

going  too  tough. Then Kwan Sai Kheong, and  William

Cheng now in Labour. William Cheng was in the Special

Branch before he moved



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 413</b></font><br><br>



in  with  Mr  Ong to Education in October 1963.  They

stayed  on  right up till 1972. No change  in  nearly

nine full years. No change in Permanent Secretary  of

the Ministry.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me remind Members of the changes that took

place.  In  1959  the PAP came in -  multilingualism.

four  official languages. And for Mr P.  Govindaswamy

we  keep a translator, special for him, in Tamil. The

Member  for Anson is costing the House more than  any

other Member of this House. He can speak English. But

he  exercises  his  right to speak  in  Tamil  and  I

respect the right, as we must. It is written  in  the

Constitution. Malay is the national language and four

official languages. We were going into Malaysia.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind Members, if I may, of the percentages

of  Primary  1 registration figures for the  English,

Chinese. Malay and Tamil streams. I will not give the

total  numbers.  This will probably be  published  in

tomorrow's  papers. For 1960, the figures  were:  for

all  races,  51% in the English stream;  39%  in  the

Chinese  stream; 8% Malay stream; 0.23% Tamil stream.

Then  came merger and Malaysia. Remember 1963? Famous

day that was. The Malay stream jumped up. It had been

going  down  from 8.6% to 7.8%, it went  up  in  1962

8.41%;  1964  8.84%; 1965, in Malaysia,  8.94%.  Then

came  separation and independence. In 1966 the  Malay

stream registered a decline from 8.94% to 6.76% - one-quarter  immediately. The Chinese  stream  went  down

from  39% in 1960, to 29% in 1963. Then it went  down

to  27% in 1964. After Separation (1965), in 1966  it

was  32%, up 5%. But, in terms of Chinese alone, that

would  be a jump from 37.6% in 1964 to 44.9% in 1966.

This  is sufficient of the past - 10 years, 11 really

-  for  me to talk about it without arousing passions

outside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year, before registration of students, the

Chinese  press mounts a campaign, and  we  let  them.

There  are  two ways of doing this, by  edict  or  by

voluntary choice. And had we done the stupid thing by

edict and said, "You will learn two languages and you

will learn English as one of the two", I think



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 414</b></font><br><br>



Singapore would have gone a different way.  We  would

be  speaking Chinese in this Chamber. And I think  my

Mandarin would be fairly fluent by now, instead of my

Hokkien becoming more fluent than my Mandarin because

I have to make speeches in Hokkien outside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me read the figures from 1966 after independence

to  1976  -  10  years. English -  from  60%  of  the

students,  it has gone up in this year's entrance  in

Primary I to 86%. From 60% to 86%. Chinese went  down

from   a  high  of  33%  in  1967, two  years  after

separation,  to 13.75% this year. Malay in  1966  was

6.76%,  this year it is 0.19% that is for  the  small

islands  -  Pulau Tekong, Pulau Ubin,  -  where  they

cannot  get  English  schools. Tamil  since  1975,  I

regret  to inform the Member for Anson, is 0.0%.  But

never  fear,  they are learning Tamil in the  English

schools.



<br><br><!-- Mr P. Govindaswamy -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr P. Govindaswamy (Anson):</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, the

Tamil  students  are not allowed to register  in  the

schools.  So  how can we get the Tamil  students?  We

must allow them to register. But we do not allow them

to be registered. It says, "Only Malay or Chinese".



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Mr Speaker, Sir, I have a lot of

time  for  the Member for Anson. Of course, we  allow

them to register in any school where there is a Tamil

teacher.  We  cannot have Tamil teachers where  there

are no Tamil students, and we cannot have three Tamil

students  with one Tamil teacher. So we have  got  to

group  the  Tamil  students in the best  schools  for

Tamil.  I  assure him that it is our  intention  that

whoever  becomes  a Tamil orator in this  House  will

always find a following outside.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when they say, "seven Ministers", it is not true.

What  happened was, in June 1975. Dr Lee  Chiaw  Meng

having   had  three  years,  moved  over  to  Nanyang

University.  I asked Dr Toh Chin Chye to  take  over.

But  I  wanted Mr Chai Chong Yii to run it  under  Dr

Toh's  supervision.  Dr Toh said,  "Either  I  am  in

charge or I am not." In which case I said, "Right.  I

will  be  in charge." So after 14 days I took charge.

16th June, 1975



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 415</b></font><br><br>



make  an  announcement to say that I was  in  charge.

Then  I  went into it. I had this advantage over  all

the other Ministers. I had the feedback from the army

because  I  am  on a special committee  called  Delco

which monitors what is happening. I am also aware  of

what is happening in Labour for jobs. But never mind.

just   Defco  alone  was  enough.  We  had   national

servicemen. We had instructors ready: in English  for

those who spoke English, Mandarin for those who spoke

Chinese,  Malay for those who spoke Malay, and  Tamil

for  those  who  spoke Tamil. They  failed  in  large

numbers.  We  did not know why. I used  to  go  round

National  Day dinners where national servicemen  were

invited.  I spoke to them in Mandarin and in  English

-blank.  I  spoke to them in Hokkien - Ah  ha,  their

faces  lit up. Sometimes even in Hokkien they do  not

light  up.  <i>yi  si  buay hiau  kong  a-m'ng  wei</i> ()

- big trouble. So we  grouped  Hokkien

platoons  with  Hokkien instructors, and  immediately

the  marksmanship went up from 30% to 95%,  equal  to

all  the  others. So the instruction  was  wrong.  Of

course, automatic promotion was wrong. I do not  know

who  made  that point. I think it was the Member  for

Katong.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Mr Ng Kah Ting.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Congratulations. But remember

that  Mr  Yong  Nyuk  Lin  was  having  the  4-2-3-3,

remember  the  3-3-4-2  issue  -three  years   junior

middle,  three  years  senior middle.  He  wanted  to

change  it  and make it equal to the English  stream,

four  years  secondary. "O" levels, two  years  post-secondary,      "A"      levels.      Oompah!Merdeka!

Oompah!Merdeka!, Strikes - <i>ba ke</i>() <i>ba  kao</i>(),

which    means    boycott   lessons,   and    boycott

examinations.  I think we have to publish  all  these

with  pictures  complete.  It  should  be  compulsory

reading  for  all  new  MPs. I  think  it  should  be

compulsory  reading for all University undergraduates

and  all  teachers because suddenly even  I  had  not

realised  that  in 1954 the Member for Alexandra  was

four years old! But we could not change. Mr Yong Nyuk

Lin's problem was that we had promised a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 416</b></font><br><br>



place in school for every child. So it was a logistic

problem.  We  doubled the schools by  a  morning  and

afternoon  session,  doubled  the  intake,  recruited

teachers  by  the droves. Of course, the standard  of

English  went down. We had lecturers in the Teachers'

Training College who spoke English learnt in  Madras.

The students had difficulty in understanding what the

teacher  was  saying.  He  could  not  speak  Queen's

English,  but  better some English than  no  English.

Better  "Yes, man" than <i>"Buay hiau lah"</i>().  That

is big trouble. We solved the logistics problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the political problem in 1963 which Mr Ong

Pang  Boon, as Minister, took over. We had gone  into

Malaysia.  Education was a separate  State-autonomous

subject, and we knew there were going to be problems.

Just  think what would have happened if we were still

in   Malaysia?  I  ask  Members  to  sit   back   and

contemplate.  I  would not go further.  Many  Members

have been on parliamentary delegations. But how would

the  State-autonomous  authority  on  Education  have

fitted  in  with the overall policy from the  Federal

capital?  How about the employment problem with  jobs

in government, jobs in the private sector?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think this education policy was a resounding

success  in  political  terms.  This  move  was  long

overdue  but we were so preoccupied with the problems

of  survival. As Dr Goh told me happily once, I think

it  was  not  very long after independence  when  our

battalion came back from Sabah and they had no  camps

to  move into. Half the battalion were supposed to be

our  battalion. Dr Goh said to me. "You know, you are

like  a British Prime Minister being protected  by  a

regiment  that is half Italian. And we  do  not  know

what  will happen." We survived that. But gently does

it  and firmly. I am proud to say we made it. We made

it.  We  have  got  a Singapore Army  which  includes

Singapore  English speaking. Chinese speaking.  Malay

speaking  and a few Tamil speaking. But they  do  not

have  to win votes, so they speak English in the  SAF

They all can, as the Member for Anson can.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 417</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was during this period that I went into it and

decided no. I had the advantage of the feedback  from

both Labour and the army. I went into it and sat down

for  months and sent, with the Chairman of the Public

Service Commission, a team of officers to implement a

new  policy  made  possible only because  our  family

planning policy had worked.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Members go back to the 1959 projections, we would

be  having 70,000 to 75,000 babies born a year  today

because the rate of increase was 4% per annum.  Today

it  is  just over 1%. Last year, the Dragon Year,  it

went  up.  I  expect this year to show a commensurate

decline,  to make up for last year's excess.  I  know

that it is not popular with seven Catholic MPs.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really remarkable. I only knew when Members

took the oath. So I did a count. There are 1 5 out of

69  who were sworn in on the Bible. 15 out of  69  is

21.75%   of   the   population  of  this   House.   I

congratulate the Christians. The missionaries  did  a

good  job  in  producing  leader-men.  But  in  total

population the Christians are only about 9%.  21%  in

this  House representing 9% outside. I think the next

time  we interview candidates we are going to have  a

closer look. Ah! but that is not the whole story.  We

have  got  seven  Catholics, and they  are  all  good

Catholics.  I know the Papal bull - when I  say  "the

Papal  bull", I am not saying that in jest.  I  think

that is the technical term, is it not?



<br><br><!-- Dr Goh Keng Swee -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dr Goh Keng Swee:</b> Bull.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Whatever it is, the

Pope    issues    his   interpretation,    and    the

interpretation  is that you can only  do  it  by  the

rhythm method. Well. I wish all Catholics have a good

sense of rhythm. Seven Catholics make up 10% of  this

House, more  than  10%.  69 Members  and  seven  are

Catholics and they are less than 4% of the population

So the next time we have got to have another question

``what   denomination?"  before  we  find   ourselves

outvoted   on   a   free   vote   on   abortion   and

sterilisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me come back to the realities. There was no

other way than bilingualism. By



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 418</b></font><br><br>



edict,  one-man one-vote means the Chinese  language.

This  is a Chinese-speaking Singapore with the Malays

and the Indians.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a great admiration for the three new MPs - the Member for Kallang (Mr Dhanabalan), the Member

for  Kolam  Ayer (Encik Sidek Saniff) and the  Member

for  Kampong Kembangan (Encik Mansor Sukaimi). I have

approved  that  they be given Mandarin teachers.  But

let me tell them what a French, but English-speaking,

brain  surgeon in Canada has written. He  wrote  this

because  he  was  studying the problem  of  Canadians

learning French at the same time as English. It is an

article  of only 12 pages, and I commend  it  to  the

Member  for  Katong.  He is an  avid  reader  and  an

educated man. My definition of an educated man  is  a

man who never stops learning and wants to learn. I am

not interested in whether a man has a PH.D or not, or

an  MA, for that matter, or a diploma. Mao never  had

one;  neither  had Khrushchev; nor Stalin.  But  this

brain  surgeon. Dr Wilder, writing in a volume called

"Brain".  Volume  88 (1965) pages  787  to  798  (12

pages)  Dr  Wilder Penfield, a Canadian neurosurgeon.

discovered,   watching   his   children   and   doing

experiments  on other children that in a right-handed

child  the left temporal lobe of the brain cortex  is

often  used to learn the mother tongue and the  right

temporal  lobe  the  other  languages.  Learning   of

languages by a child must be done before the  age  of

12  years  when  the cortex is still  uncommitted  to

other matters.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every diplomat who has his children educated in

various parts of the world, will confirm this - and I

confirm it from my own experience - that when you get

a child to learn a language he picks it up naturally.

A  language is heard and spoken by a child  from  the

mother, long before he learns to read and write. They

are  two different functions. You hear and you speak.

At  a later stage you see the symbol, you read it and

you reproduce it, you write - two separate functions.

I  learnt some Chinese as a child. But if you do  not

persist  in the language, as diplomats will tell  you

about  their children - when they get posted out  too

early, the children lose it and lose it forever.  But

if the language is learnt till



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 419</b></font><br><br>



about  the  late teens, 18 or 16, it  is  there  for

life, for keeps. I learnt it the hard way.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister for Culture has the rare and doubtful

distinction  of  writing,  ghost-writing, my   first

Chinese  speech.  I  stood out at  what  is  now  the

People's Theatre. It was an open field - qun zhung da

hui (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)20,000 people turned up and I debated

whether I should read it in Cantonese or in Mandarin.

Quite  a  problem.  My opponent challenged  me  to  a

debate either in Mandarin, Hakka, Cantonese, Hokkien.

Name  it,  he  is ready. He is now a very  successful

textile  merchant. You never really learn  until  you

know that you have got to use it. From that day on, I

have  never  ceased to learn. That is  more  than  20

years.  And  I had been learning before  that.  After

that.  I learnt with a passion, which could not  have

been there but for this traumatic experience - 20,000

people  to  hear  my kindergarten Mandarin.  Quite  a

shock.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference between my children and me is that

when  I  switch to Mandarin I am like  an  old  valve

radio  -  you know, the old valve radio  or  TV?  The

difference between a transistor TV and a valve TV? An

old  valve TV, once you switch on, takes two to three

minutes to warm up. Then you get the sound. Then  you

get  into  the  mood. Then you switch  on  to  a  new

circuit,  from AC to DC from 220 volts to 110  volts.

But  with my children, you switch on, you just  press

the button it is on, instant. And if they stop at 12.

it  is  compulsory. You cannot get into  a  secondary

school  unless you pass your second language. And  if

they  stop, and they do, they are bright, they  score

one's. The present system is simple: you get under 20

points  for  the five best subjects  and  you  go  to

Junior College. Am I right?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> But it does not include

language.  So  what  do  they  do?  They   score   in

mathematics,    additional   mathematics,    physics,

chemistry, one  other. Does not need  swotting.  You

know, they are bright lads. English, just a pass does

not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 420</b></font><br><br>



matter. 6, 7 or 8; Chinese fail. Well, all right, it

does  not  matter, it is not included. We have  given

them three years' notice. They are now in Sec 2,  now

swot.  And  I  bet you, in six years'  time  we  will

produce  `A' level graduates who will go  up  to  the

simultaneous   interpreters'  room  and   outdo   the

simultaneous interpreters. Because I am  quite  sure.

The   simultaneous  interpreters,  after  this   long

interval since our last meeting, they are like  valve

radios,  whereas we are now going to produce students

with `transistors'. And they are bright, they will do

it.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain how sharp they are. Maybe it is good,

maybe  it  is  not so good. But this is  the  younger

generation Singaporean. The best scholarship you  can

get  is  the President's scholarship. If  you  are  a

President's scholar, you are really good. And you  do

not  apply for it. After the examination results  are

known  for  the  `A' levels, the P.S.C, invites  the

school  principals to recommend those who they  think

should  be considered. They are considered  not  only

for their `A' level results, their `O' level results,

their  ECA  and all the other activities,  leadership

qualities.  No bonds, nothing. They do  not  have  to

take  it.  They  still get a few  hundred  dollars  a

month, a  year. Then comes the SAF scholars.  MINDEF

has  spent  billions of dollars in  training  and  in

hardware.  And the people who have to run MINDEF  and

make the decisions were never trained as soldiers.  I

think  the  highest rank Dr Goh reached was  that  of

Lance  Corporal? Private? A Private in the  Singapore

Volunteers. And the professional side, 1 and  2  SIR,

they were recruited in 1955/56, and again in 1958/59,

to  be  ceremonial guards for the Istana and to  help

the  police  when  the crowds got out  of  control  - internal security exercise. In other words, there was

not  the  officer cadre that can run  and  spend  the

billions.  And so men have had to be taken  out,  put

through a crash course so that they know what is cost-effectiveness in terms of weapons, training  manuals.

So the SAF scholar is critical.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year there are some 15,000 to 20,000 men in

the  reserves, and they are in the reserves right  up

to 40 years. So you start



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 421</b></font><br><br>



from  18 to 40, that is 22 years. Multiply that by  a

factor  of  10,000, and not 15,000, you have  220,000

men.  Multiply that by 20,000, you get  440,000.  Who

are they being led by? They are bright men, you know.

They  are  top  executives. If  they  know  that  the

general  only  barely got two `O' levels,  I  do  not

think  it  is good for morale. Our generals  will  be

some  of  the most able and some of the most resolute

of  men  with a very high melting point, not wax  but

titanium.  It is in a crisis, when the crunch  comes,

that  you  make decisions which can cost hundreds  of

thousands  of  lives, because we are a  very  compact

place.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But let me tell you how attractive it is. If you are

a  2nd  Lieutenant, you get paid as a 2nd Lieutenant.

You  can  choose any university to go to and you  are

paid all expenses. Do you know what the students have

done? They are brought back every summer vacation for

training, but they say, "That is no good.  We  would

like to go holidaying round the continent and see the

world."  So  they  choose  to  take  a  Colombo  Plan

Scholarship  to Australia. They only  do  two  months

training. January and February, as a recruit and then

in  March  they  are  off. When  they  come  back  as

engineers  they are graduates, and they get  paid  as

graduate  engineers. We have cut that  off  now.  Not

only have we made it that they go the following year,

and  not  that they pass `A' level last year and  are

going  this February or March. They are going  in  15

months'  time. They will complete the officer cadet's

course, then go, and come back and serve. Immediately

they  moved back and said, "Right, we will  take  the

SAF."  They compete for the SAF scholarship.  I  have

not  the slightest doubt that if we carry this on  to

the  next  stage, at the `A' levels - that  you  will

have, for entrance to the university, a good pass  in

the second language - they will pass.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell you the reasons why. Now and for a very

long time anybody who has any pretensions or any hope

of becoming a leader has got to know a minimum of two

languages I had before me the circulation figures  of

the  English and Chinese newspapers. I can rattle  it

off from memory. I



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 422</b></font><br><br>



will  produce the exact figures later. 160,000  for

the Straits Times, Nanyang, Sin Chew, Sin Min and Min

Pao, 280,000. Assuming that the English educated have

less  readers per copy - I mean each copy is read  by

less  people  - it means that if you  want  to  be  a

Minister and you do not read the Chinese papers, you

do  not  know what the ground is thinking and  saying

and  you are in trouble. Let me say that one  of  the

duties of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister

for  Foreign Affairs was - not now, because  I  think

the  Minister  (Mr  Rajaratnam) has  now  made  other

arrangements  more systematically - to  read  to  the

Minister all the politically sensitive items  in  the

Chinese  newspapers.  So Mr Rajaratnam  was  educated

into  the  Chinese mind. Now, of course it  has  been

institutionalised. So the Parliamentary Secretary has

got to be found other duties.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I have a further reason why it must be so. Let

me tell the Member for Moulmein, and I say, do not be

afraid of the argument. I am glad that he raised  it.

Because he gives me the opportunity to expound  this.

A lot of thinking went into this. Way back in 1965 we

found  ourselves suddenly independent.  If  you  lose

that Chinese education and you go completely English-educated,  you  will  lose  that  drive, that  self-confidence. That is what is wrong. The danger is,  if

you  are  Chinese educated and only Chinese educated,

you  are  monolingual, then your source of literature

will  be communist. That is big trouble. But  if  you

are  bilingual, you have binocular vision, then  you

see the world in 3-D. And I will confirm that,



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to China last year, May. Many members of the

party  spoke  Chinese, were Chinese.  There  was  no

problem  of  language. We understood what  was  being

said  and  what  was being written. There  is  a  new

diction. Completely different, Of course, the  Member

for  Katong  is  right: no culture, no  civilisation,

stands  still.  Or it dies, or it is  mummified.  The

difference  between the Chinese in Peking  or  Canton

and  the Chinese in Singapore is so great as to  make

it  a  difference  of kind And when  the  Chinese  in

Singapore is trilingual and he knows of



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 423</b></font><br><br>



another different world, a vast world reaching out to

Mars  and  beyond, he listens to all this exposition,

understands  it, but he says to himself, "Well,  that

is  one  way  of doing it." But in Singapore  we  had

better do it the simpler way. For us, the easier  way

is  just plug it into the grid. We stand other risks,

of course, because the grid is already there. You tap

Western  science, Western technology, trade with  the

West. But when they have a depression, recession  and

unemployment, we get the rigor. We cannot avoid that.

Whether  America is in recession or  Europe  has  got

five  or  six  million unemployed, it makes  not  the

slightest difference to China. Self-reliance.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Zi li geng sheng </i>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). Is that it? You see, you

have  got  to use the phrase everyday to  recall  it.

Therefore, a critical decision was made. And  I  say,

decision  is  right and must be pursued vigorously  - that if we become a monolingual society, deculturised

from our roots, we are in deep trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will explain to the Member for Moulmein why we are

already  in trouble, In the old days, in the bad  old

days, we  had  very  good  workmanship.  Whether  as

carpenters or as skilled technicians, they  were  the

jobs  done by the hard-working, industrious, skilled

Chinese-educated,  They were  the  best  fitters  and

technicians - United Engineers, Keppel Shipyard.  The

Cantonese  are  the best. But now they  have  learned

English.  Like the Member for Ang Mo  Kio,  he  is  a

Polytechnic  graduate. Why should he  be  doing  work

which should be done by an English educated boy  less

competent  than he is? So, he is a land surveyor.  He

has  gone  on  to management. Yes, and  why  not?  He

speaks  English now, also plus Chinese. But  I  think

that  if he did not start speaking Chinese, he  would

not  have learnt his English. I know very few English

educated  who  can speak Chinese as well  as  he  can

speak  English,  I know of some who have  tried  very

hard.  They have to. You take a Malay and  an  Indian

and cut him off from the past - what have you got  to

give him? If you take him to America and you say.  "I

am an American." I do not



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 424</b></font><br><br>



know how many saw this Alistair Cook series: "Are you

a  Communist? No. I have never been a member  of  the

Communist party. Everyday I swear that I will  defend

America, be loyal to America, I put my right hand  on

my  heart." Well, that is a total, complete different

value  system.  Have  we got a total  complete  value

system  to  replace the Confucian system, to  replace

Malay  culture and values and Islam? P.  Govindaswamy

with 3,000 years of his Tamil scripts, is he going to

give  that up? I say, "Very big trouble." But if  P.

Govindaswamy's  son  decides to emigrate  to  Canada,

which  he  can as a doctor, well, that is  different.

Then   you  plug  in  into  a  whole  North  American

civilisation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not know what is going to happen. The end

product  has got to be partly the decisions we  make,

but  also mainly what the interaction will be between

English  and  a  whole world of literature,  science,

technology, arts, culture, music, the mass media  and

the lot, and the basic values of your own self. It is

critical.  They took the African, put  him  in  slave

ships  and  brought him to America.  After  ten,  God

knows  how many generations, this man wanted to  know

whence he came from. He wrote about <i>Roots</i>. Joe, have

you read it?



<br><br><!-- Mr Conceicao -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Conceicao:</b> Yes.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> You have. They have made a good

TV series of it - an American negro with considerable

White  parentage spent years to trace  his  ancestors

back  in  Sierra  Leone or some place  nearby  called

Kinta or something, and wrote what he called faction,

not  fiction, but faction based on facts  but  in  a

fictional way, because he cannot completely establish

all  that happened. Tremendous impact on both  whites

and blacks.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, of course, all the professionals, English-educated, want their children to be professionals.

And  they are very worried when their children cannot

make it, Because they have to learn two languages. It

is  easier  to  make  it if they have  to  learn  one

language.  Then  you score A's.  You  have  to  learn

Chinese. It is such a difficult language. And



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 425</b></font><br><br>



the  Chinese  examiners are so strict,  bred  in  the

imperial examination classical system, that to  score

a  5 in Chinese is five times more difficult than  to

score  a  5 in Malay. And, of course, all the  bright

young  sparks decide after a while, "Really, my  mind

is not suited for Chinese, I want to learn Malay as a

second  language." Yes, it is much  easier.  You  can

read this. There is no problem at all. It is the same

romanised  script. And you know, after  a  while,  it

says  for taxi,<i> teksi </i>(t-e-k-s-i). Well, that is  all

right. We will just learn that. Taxi in Chinese, what

is it? <i>de shi</i>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), that is Singapore, you know,

onomatopoeic  transliteration.  But   that   is   not

correct. There are no taxis in China. But I will  put

my  bottom  dollar on the fact that  when  China  has

taxis, it will not be called <i>de shi</i>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). The

Japanese  are  prepared,  because  they  have  always

borrowed.  They  have  borrowed their  language  from

China,  they have borrowed their technology from  the

West  - to their great advantage. But a culture which

goes back 4,000 years is too proud to borrow. So  the

Japanese says for the atom bomb atomo bombo. But  the

Chinese translate it, give it their own name - <i>he  zi

wu qi</i>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) <i>yuan zi dan</i>( ) - nuclear weapon,

atomic  bomb. You translate the meaning. You call  an

aeroplane, an aeroplane? No. <i>Fei ji</i>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), flying

machine.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has its advantages. It has got its dangers.

Because   if  the  boy  is  monolingual,   then   the

literature  that he has will be more  and  more  only

from  China.  And whether you read the most  innocent

book  on  the  beauty of Kwei Lin and its stalagmites

and   stalactites,  in  between  you  will  get   the

"Thoughts". Yes. It is part of the new evolving value

system.  But  it is a risk we must take. For  another

reason,  that  those who are at a  disadvantage, who

live  in  a  completely dialect-speaking  village  or

home, who are not particularly fast in learning, when

they  go to school they are learning two foreign,  or

two  new languages, neither of which is their  mother

tongue, Mandarin and English. When Mr Jek Yeun  Thong

speaks Mandarin, I do not have to know that Mr Jek is

Cantonese. I can hear it in the Mandarin.  So  I  can

from   Mr  Lai  Tha  Chai  -  what  they  call  qiang

diao(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 426</b></font><br><br>



accent. Yes, you never get rid of it. It is there for

life,   like   the  "Rr"  in  Tamil,  I  cannot   say

"Vanakkam."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Vanakkam



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Some people are endowed with

these things. I can assure the Member for Anson I did

try. Because for a few years we were in Malaysia, for

two years, when we did our psephological analysis. In

case  the  press gets me wrong, it is psephology  and

not  psychology. I have a dictionary here. It is  the

science of how people vote. Just in case they dispute

my  definition,  I  have brought the  Shorter  Oxford

Dictionary and it is in the addenda. It is not in the

body  of  the dictionary itself. It is a new science.

Psephology  -  the  study  of  trends  in  voting  or

elections,  From Greek psephos (pebble) because  when

the  Greek  voted he threw a pebble. And,  you  know,

when  you  want to win votes, the Queen's English  is

not going to help you.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a second shock in my life when in 1961 we had

the  Hong Lim by-election. Mr Jek Yeun Thong was  our

candidate. We trampled Hong Lim for eight  weeks  and

canvassed every house, every cubicle, every corner of

every  staircase where there was a human being -  six

to  eight times. And we had lost two Hokkien speakers

-  orators.  One  was Lim Chin Siong.  He  went  with

Barisan.  And then we were fighting the man we  built

up  as  our  Hokkien orator, Mr Ong Eng Guan.  Now  a

generation has grown up not knowing him.  But  he  is

very  good. We taught him how to be an orator. I hear

that  we have got somebody amongst our 11 new Members

who  is prepared to teach how to speak Hokkien. Well,

I look forward to seeing the panache and style.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Dale Carnegie!



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Dale Carnegie? Let me tell you

that  I then learnt Hokkien because we decided if  we

build another Hokkien speaker and they do this to us,

we  are in big trouble. So I learnt Hokkien. And  let

me   assure  the  three  Members  who  are   learning

Mandarin: learn Mandarin because no soldier,  no  NSF

will say, "No, I cannot



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 427</b></font><br><br>



speak  Mandarin." You know, their name  tags  are  in

different colours so we know what language he speaks.

Blue for English, pink for Mandarin, red for Hokkien.

It  is  a lucky colour. We give them red, they  said.

"No, no. I want pink. I am an educated Mandarin."  So

you  have  now  to examine them because  nobody  will

concede  that he cannot speak Mandarin. And it  is  a

good base from which to learn Hokkien, if need be.  I

will  bear  witness  to that. Because  you  know  the

classical. Hokkien is the southern variation  as  the

Chinese  went south and got mixed up with  a  lot  of

other  people who were there and they got  a  lot  of

native  Hokkien words not to be found in the  Chinese

character  system. Many of them. My mind is cluttered

up with them.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, I also read in this article by the

brain  surgeon that the mind is not like  a  cupboard

and  therefore you fill up the space.  The  more  the

input and the earlier it is, the bigger the capacity.

I  thought  to myself, what a great shame I  did  not

know  that.  If I had listened to my grandmother  and

slotted all these languages, how much easier it would

have been.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me now meet what I consider is the basic

problem. I think Haji Ya'acob bin Mohamed posed  that

question  yesterday. What are we? Is it growth, more

growth,  more  materialism? Just what are  we  doing?

What  do we try to be? Does man live by bread  alone?

Well,  we  are trying to make a nation,  a  people  - tolerant, considerate, compassionate but rugged or we

will  not survive. Because it was never the intention

of   the  British  that  Singapore  should  ever   be

independent. Let me assure all hon Members that  each

time  I  swear the oath of allegiance to the Republic

of Singapore, my mind goes back to the 9th of August.

1  965. I did not want it. We had independence thrust

upon us. And the expectation was that in two to three

years  we  would be so down on our knees and crawling

that  we  would  have to go back  on  any  terms.  No

autonomy  in  Education, Labour, and  all  the  other

subjects.  Different terms. Maybe if they were  kind,

like



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 428</b></font><br><br>



Penang  and  Malacca. But we resolved  to  make  this

work. Never forget that. It was the will, not just of

a  few  men. That was necessary. But the will was  in

the  people. Otherwise it would not have worked. They

went  through  the biggest education  Singapore  ever

got. It was from September 1963 to August 9, 1965. We

learnt what life was about. It also caused two  riots

-  June  1964, late September 1964. During the second

one  I  was away in Brussels as the guest speaker  at

the  centenary  of the Socialist International.  Then

they wanted me to explain how bad communism was - the

Communists  were  winning in  Southeast  Asia  except

Singapore. But, alas, the world has changed. Now  the

Socialist  International has got new activists.  They

will not invite me to address them, What is the point

of  addressing  them anyway? They want  to  dress  me

down. They have no use for us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Kampong Chai Chee (Mr Fong Sip Chee)

raised a critical question. And I take him seriously.

He says, "We cancel each other out." No. He is wrong.

There  is  a  big  difference  between  culture   and

civilisation. First, I quote from the Shorter  Oxford

Dictionary and then quote the Chinese for it. I  have

got  the  Chinese definition. "Civilisation" that  is

the  broader  term,  the  modern  term.  Civilisation

-civilised  condition or state. And to "civilise"  is

to  bring out of a state of barbarism; to instruct in

the  arts  of  life; to enlighten and to  refine;  to

become  civilised. Now "Culture" -"the  training  and

refinement   of  mind, tastes,  and   manners;   the

condition  of  being thus trained  and  refined;  the

intellectual  side of civilisation." The intellectual

side  of civilisation, not the technological side.  I

now read from Webster's English Dictionary translated

into     Chinese.     First,    the     non-communist

interpretation,  then  the communist  interpretation.

Because I think Joe's point is a very important one - that  nothing is static. We are not the  same  as  we

were,  30,  40  years  ago;  nor  any  other  people.

Civilisation  - <i>Kai hua huo kai hua zhi  zhuang  tai;

wen  ming</i> () Culture - <i>xin zhi shang  yu

dao  de  shang you jiao yu er de zhi kai ming yu  pin

ge</i>;



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 429</b></font><br><br>



<i>de yu zhi yu zhi lie guo</i> (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;).

Let me read from the New Chinese/ English

Dictionary,  which  the ISD has proscribed.  But,  of

course.  I have taken it out of the ISD library.  The

Chinese  civilisation is one of  the  oldest  in  the

world.  Then it says <i>Kai hua, jiao hua, wen ming  shi

jie</i>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). Culture - <i>jiao yang,

siu yang, de (&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) yu, zai pei, yang zhi, yang

yu pei yang</i>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). Of course, if

we  want  just the old values, then we will be  stuck

with <i>zi Ii geng sheng</i>(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;). Then we start

learning  from  the steam engine. If  we  start  from

Stephenson  and the steam engine, by golly,  it  will

take a long time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Japanese and the Manchu Chinese reactions to the

impact  of  the  West on their ancient  civilisations

were completely different, The Chinese Manchu dynasty

made the Chinese civilisation pay a very heavy price.

They  thought they could shut off the West.  But  the

Japanese said, "We'd better get these black ships and

their  cannons quickly." Learn. They found out.  They

gave their daughters in exchange for gunners on board

ships  that  came,  for a sample of  the  guns.  They

learned fast. You know the Boxer Rebellion. Why is it

called  the  Boxer Rebellion? It is  still  practised

today.  The  other  day  I was  reading  through  the

Vigilante  Corps magazine. Some instructors  say  nei

gong(), where you control your inside and  your

muscles are so stiff that a car can go over you. Yes.

a  car  with the weight spread. When they sacked  the

foreign  embassies  in  Peking.  1898, the  European

powers and the Japanese then sent in an expeditionary

force and they thought <i>nei gong</i>(), bullet will

not  go through. But they died like flies. They  were

pulverised.  They  were made to pay indemnities.  And

they  never  rose  until after  the  war.  They  went

through a whole period of turmoil. All right, so they

have with their millions of bare hands paid for the R

and  D  (Research and Development) with the help,  of

course,  of  a  few scientists and technologists  who

were trained, and helped in the atomic bomb and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 430</b></font><br><br>



hydrogen bomb research, in America, and they exploded

the  first bomb in 1964. Well, they have medium-range

rockets. Inter-continental missiles, now coming  into

use  but  with liquid fuel which is highly  dangerous

still.   That   is  what  the  intelligence   reports

published in military magazines in NATO tell us.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be right, it may be wrong. I do not think we

want  to  do  that. We want to try, very  simply,  to

allow  each  individual ethnic, cultural, linguistic,

religious group to keep what it can of its  past  and

to  acquire  what is necessary to make  Singapore  an

industrialised society, or we will never get off  the

ground. If we go back to a farming community with the

changkol or the spade, and to fishing. I do not think

we  can support a population of 30,000 on three meals

a  day. This is worth a research. Joe, suggest it  to

some  of your wiseacres at the University. Say, do  a

model,  simulate  a computer model -  so  much  land,

input  so  much  fertiliser, so many  man-hours  with

changkol  and  women and children, How many  tons  of

tapioca can it produce and vegetables and chicken and

goats?  You  know what happened to the goats  in  the

southern  islands? Way back in 1959 we put  goats  in

southern islands, Since it is barren, send goats. The

theory  was  that  the  goats will  roam  around  the

islands, feed off all kinds of wild leaves, multiply.

and the islanders will have a better diet. We paid to

learn the hard way. I think that was the first lesson

in  economics  for me as well as for the  Member  for

Kampong  Ubi.  That is not the way  to  develop.  Far

better  we have a petrol refinery than goats,  hoping

they  will multiply. Because what happened  was  that

man's  hunger  was  greater than  goats'  ability  to

multiply.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to touch on a few other items before I

complete  my,  I  hope, induction  into  both   mass

politics  and  parliamentary  politics  for  the  new

Members, The way we conduct ourselves in this Chamber

and outside as MPs, as Parliamentary Secretaries,  as

Ministers,  will  decide whether in 1981,  beginning,

middle, end, depending on when we think we will  get

the maximum votes, the elections are fought from now,

not in 1981.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 431</b></font><br><br>



We did not fight the elections in December, the 23rd.

We  fought  it as from September 1972. We  made  sure

that  no MP, no Parliamentary Secretary, no Minister,

misbehaved or abused his power. Because if you do, it

is a very tight and swift compact society, it spreads

like wild fire. Dr Ong, the Member for Kim Seng,  his

generation  does not go to coffee-shops. But  let  me

tell  him that he would be surprised to know what  is

being  discussed and debated with very great  candour

and  vehemence and the very frank language with which

it  is  discussed, of the weaknesses and  follies  of

MPs,  Ministers and others. And when the CP mounts  a

smear  campaign  I  have  seen  sane  rational   men,

Ministers,  suddenly  turn pale  because  the  Branch

Secretary  came and said "By God, the  whole  kampong

has  switched allegiance. Rumour has it  that  you've

got four wives." The Minister collects a whole bundle

of  pamphlets,  brings his biography  and  personally

distributes it to counter the smear. It took  us  the

best  part  of  13 years from 1 952, before  we  even

founded the party, to

1965,  to  establish ourselves as people who  can  be

trusted and relied upon regardless of smears. That is

why  we  could allow a deliberate smear  campaign  of

corruption  during the campaign and took action  only

after.  We ran the risk that if we took action during

the  campaign, they would say "Unfair". But after the

campaign  -  you utter all these falsehoods,  knowing

that  there  was no other way in which to  shake  the

confidence  the  people have in the Government, than

alleging  corruption, well, matters have  got  to  be

resolved.  We  have to make changes in  the  election

laws. Because if a man is bankrupt it is no use suing

him. K.C. Lee, how much does he owe you?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Khoon Choy (Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr Lee Khoon Choy):</b> $36,000.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> $36,000. The man returns two

weeks  before election. Everybody knew that  election

was  coming. He returned one month before, dissolves

his party, joins the Workers' Party and starts off on

a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 432</b></font><br><br>



campaign.  The story is not over yet.  Wait  for  the

next instalment. There is something quite interesting

coming.  Why  did  he  do it? From  now  onwards,  no

bankrupt  will be allowed to take part in an election

campaign. We will change it because the chap says: "I

am  bankrupt,  so  what? You sue me."  He  owes  K.C.

$36,000; I now sue him. He owes me $136,000. How much

more bankrupt can he be? These are elementary rules.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, let me just clear a few of the points which

nobody  else  will be clearing because  they  overlap

Ministries.    Mr   Dhanabalan   said    "legislative

overkill."  That  is  a  fair comment.  What  is  the

choice?  Your  choice is to educate  them.  Education

begins  in  the home before the child  even  goes  to

school. You know what has happened to those who  went

to  school and never learnt? "Yes man; no, man.  Buay

hiau.()". The Member now knows what  that  means.

So  we start off in the schools, but meanwhile people

are  being  killed on the roads. This is a choice  we

have  to  make.  Wait  until  we  have  an  educated,

courteous,  considerate generation or start  now  and

say "stop the killing". Maybe it is wrong. But let us

see whether it will work.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have talked about fringe car parks for years.

It  is not an innovation by Singapore. But nobody had

the  restlessness, audacity or courage, depending  on

whether  you like us or you do not like us.  We  said

that  we cannot allow this as the place will jam  up.

With  every  high-rise, just think of the  number  of

floors - and each floor of a high-rise building,  you

multiply  that by 10 cars. My God, what will  happen?

So  we had to do it. We did the fringe car parks. The

Singaporean then did his calculation. He  is  a  very

sharp character, He said, "No. My car in the sun  for

the  whole day paying, paint rotting? I'll  take  the

bus ride from my house." So the fringe car parks were

not  used.  All  right. We had asked,  I  had  asked,

because  the  Cabinet committee  sat  down  with  the

experts.  "What happens if the fringe car  parks  are

not used when we have gone to all this trouble?" They

said,  "Sir,  in that case, we, have got  $7  million

worth  of  tarmac!" So we have $7  million  worth  of

tarmac which we will put to other uses. But if we had

not done that, and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 433</b></font><br><br>



people  wanted  to  commute, we would  have  been  in

bigger trouble. But it worked, with adjustments, with

modifications.  So  it is easy  to  say  "legislative

overkill".  But I ask the Member: is he  prepared  to

wait  until  we can get the children to  be  literate

first  and  then to bring home the message  to  their

parents.  Because without language you  cannot  learn

anything.  If you are deaf and dumb, then  you  start

making  signals  to each other, there  are  very  few

things you can communicate by signals of hand.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language is the tool to all human thought, human

knowledge.  And it is because we made the mistake  of

allowing   them  to  be  promoted  -  because   their

mathematics  was  good so they had  the  intelligence

that  they  ignored language - that I now see  it  in

letters that I receive, in Cabinet papers, from first-class  Administrative Officers. And automatically  my

ball-point comes up and I correct, and I say  to  the

Cabinet  Secretary: "Please show officer who  drafted

this." I become the school master. It is sad, but  it

is  true.  If you say, "Look, you will not  get  into

Junior College without distinction in your first  and

second   languages."  I  tell  you  they   will   get

distinctions in their first and second languages. But

if you say best of five subjects, they will say. "All

right.   Which  are  the  ones  that  I  can   score?

Mathematics.    Additional   Mathematics,    Physics,

Chemistry and ECA", depending on whether you are  the

vigorous type, like the "rat-catcher". But I think it

is  a  fair point made by Mr Fong Sip Chee,  Mr  Ivan

Baptist and Encik Sidek Saniff.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big Sweep and Toto, it is a problem we face. They

face  it in Moscow. They have got the sweepstake.  If

you  do  not run the Big Sweep and Toto, the chap-ji-kee  man who has always swindled the people of  their

money is still there. It is the history of Singapore.

The  Chinese  who travelled overseas are the  biggest

gamblers you can find in the world. Because to  leave

China  was to gamble. In Manchu China if you returned

you  were  beheaded.  Because you  were  bringing  in

dangerous  foreign  ideas.  So  to  leave  China  for

Nanyang was a gamble.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 434</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I discovered once doing a case that the Chinese

gambled in New Zealand. There was a New Zealand case,

whether that came under the New Zealand gaming  laws.

Very  interesting. Everywhere they went they gambled.

Which would you have? An honest Government Toto or  a

dishonest chap-ji-kee? I spent years getting chap-ji-kee  operators  off.  Ten years,  and  they  paid  me

handsomely. And I decided it was wrong. That  is  why

we  are changing the laws of evidence and the laws of

procedure.   Because  I  knew   it   was   absolutely

nonsensical. Transferring British ideas of  evidence,

justice - a man goes to court and swears, "Yes, I did

see  him  stab the other man.<i>" `M si gua ay tai  chi.

mai  ch'ap</i>(In Hokkien: not my business.  Don't

bother.) You have had it. Even in Mandarin,  back  in

ancient   China.   So   we   have   to   make   these

modifications.  I say, yes, there is a contradiction.

And  I say, if you stop it they will go and sell  you

the Malaysian sweepstakes. We have got Channels 5 and

8.  You stop the advertisement of cigarette lighters,

there are Channels 3 and 10. The reception may not be

so  good. You block a film in Singapore, you  have  a

thriving  film  industry in Johore. So  what  is  the

answer? The answer really is to implant in the child,

very  early, values which will last a life-time.  You

are  not  going to sell me cigarette smoking, however

hard  you  try. I hope I have succeeded in implanting

it  in  three persons I was responsible for  bringing

out  into this world. Touch wood, none of them smoke.

Because  they saw their father smoke, making campaign

speeches, trying to keep himself with a packet of  10

in  his  pocket. In 1957 we fought the  City  Council

general  elections. At the end of it, at  the  VMH  I

could not tell the crowd <i>Kam sia kok wei</i> (). I

lost  my  voice. That December I said, "No.  That  is

off."



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no other way. We are an open, exposed

society.  You want to stop the tourists?  It  is  1.5

million.  You want your hotels empty? You  want  your

shops  to  look  you up? There will be more  tourists

coming  to  Singapore than there are Singaporeans  in

another 10 years or less than 10 years. There  is  no

other way than to implant the values in.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 435</b></font><br><br>



Let  us  not kid ourselves. No society is static.  It

either  adjusts, adapts, learns how to protect itself

or it is debased, corrupted and brought down. You can

have  no  society -mummified, unless it is  isolated,

like the Red Indians were, like the Polynesians were.

And  then  the  white men came and  brought  measles,

chicken  pox,  VD, flu and they die like  flies.  And

that  is the way they got rid of a lot of them.  They

gave  them chicken pox, and the Red Indians died  and

there  are  less Red Indians in the world. There  are

very few aborigines left in Australia. Or you face up

to  it.  And  you  face up to it by implanting  basic

values.  That  is why however different  the  various

religions, this  Government is in favour  of  a  man

believing  in something than believing in nothing.  I

would  rather have a Muslim, a devout Hindu,  than  a

permissive atheist. And it is because of the problems

of atheism in the West that they are in trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately the Chinese never believed in heaven and

hell  for  rational  behaviour.  It  is  <i>dao  de  dao

yi</i>(), that to be a civilised society, as I have

read just now, "Man must behave" says Confucius, long

before  Mao, "in a certain way in order that  orderly

civilised living is possible." Not that you  will  go

to  hell  if you do bad, or you will go to heaven  if

you  do  good.  But if you do not do that,  civilised

living is not possible for anybody. In the West  they

say  "God  will punish you. Thou shall  not  -".  The

Bible  says  so. So when they got to the  moon,  they

said, "Well, this is all not true. It cannot be true.

In  fact, there is only one life. And if you miss the

enjoyment now, you get old, never enjoyed,  you  have

missed it. So let's enjoy now." As the British  Prime

Minister  said, the most hateful slogan he  has  ever

heard was:

"What   do   we   want?"  And   the   crowd   chants.

"Everything". Just like so-and-so says "amen."  "What

do  we  want? Everything! When do we want  it?  Now!"

Why? Because otherwise you may be dead tomorrow:  you

would  have missed the chance. So let us  have  a  go

quickly  before  we  get  old  and  we  cannot  enjoy

ourselves. Very sad.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 436</b></font><br><br>



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain values which have preserved us.

This is much the oldest civilisation in the world,  a

bit of what you call <i>chui niu, bu da hao</i> ()

.  It  is  one  of  the great civilisations,  an  old

civilisation,    Civilisations   existed    in    the

Mesopotamian  valley, in Mohenjo Daro,  and  lots  of

other  places.  But it is the only one  which  had  a

continuous  history and survived, more or  less  with

definite links to the past. It is different from what

you  see of Greece and the people now in Greece.  The

first principle of any civilisation is orderly living

and  the rearing of the young. Maternity is a  matter

of  fact,  provable fact. Paternity is  a  matter  of

opinion.  You can have blood tests and so  on.  Maybe

they  can  find a test to establish it.  Yes,  it  is

yours.  Nobody else's. How do you know it is  not  my

brother's? And so the Jews accept this fact. And  the

Jews say, "Never mind what the father was. But is the

mother  a Jewess? If she is a Jewess, then the  child

is  a Jew." So Sammy Davis is a Jew. That is where he

has  got  his talent from. First, you see  his  nose.

Then  you hear his voice. He got it from his  African

line, a tremendous big voice. He had the best of both

worlds.  I  think that is critical. I am not  saying,

"No, let us be celibate." I am not even asking let us

all  be  faithful  to  our  wives,  let  us  have  no

divorces. I do not ask that. All I ask is, please  do

not  misbehave yourself. Anybody who has a  paternity

suit  against  him is out and there  will  be  a  by-election.  That  is all I say. Let us  have  none  of

this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mass media of the West believes that we ought to

be  like  them. Why? Because we are human beings  and

they are civilised. They are advanced and, therefore,

we  must be like them. We are not like them.  We  are

not civilised. But you see, here is my authority.  It

is the oldest civilisation in the world. It goes back

5,000  years.  But actually they go  back, provable,

4,000  years. The 5th thousand is mythology. Whatever

it  is, that is because, you say, "Look, you touch my

wife,  I  kill  you." Then there is a pool  in  which

everybody  can forage. It may be hypocritical.  Maybe

it  is  bad.  But  it preserved the civilisation  for

5,000 years and it had nothing to do with God, heaven

and hell. And I say, you lose



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 437</b></font><br><br>



that, we lose all. You tell me what we have got, she

mo  lui  gen ma? <i>Fei lui fei ma</i> ().  Neither

donkey  nor horse. You do not know who is the father.

That is a very unhappy state of affairs. I am glad P.

Govindaswamy shakes his head. Make sure that your son

is  as devout as you are. I beg your pardon. I think,

Mr  Speaker, we must change our style because I  read

from Aneurin Bevan it does not become us - we do  not

speak  that way. We do not think that way. I use  the

language,   but  the  inside,  my  value  system   is

different. I understand the Englishman. He knows deep

in  his heart that he is superior to the Welshman and

the  Scotsman.  That  is why  the  Welshman  and  the

Scotsman  now,  particularly the  Scotsman  with  the

North  Sea  oil, says, "O.K. I want to be independent

on  my  own."  Deep  here, I am a Chinaman.  Yes, an

uprooted  Chinaman, transformed into  a  Singaporean.

Because when I went to China I discovered that I  was

not  a  Chinaman. Yes. Mr Lee Khoon Choy will  be  my

witness.  I  brought my young daughter  with  me  for

political reasons.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr J. B. Jeyaretnam, one of the so-called opposition

leaders, questioned, "Who paid for her fare?"  during

the elections. I did. She did not travel at Singapore

Government expense.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was for definite specific political reasons, one

of  them  being to test how a Chinese-educated  girl,

but   bilingual,  would  react  to  this   situation.

Completely   Chinese  educated,  from   three   years

kindergarten. Nanyang Nu Zhong you zhi yuan I am glad

to say that we will relax our regulations about young

people  visiting  China. I think  we  were  wrong  Of

course if we let them all go, it grows and grows, all

the  chaps  who  join  the  Equatorial  Society,  the

Chinese  Musical Association, Kang Le or whatever  it

is,  and  that  is a, different story. But  in  small

groups,  there is no better education  for  a  proper

appreciation of Singapore. You come back and kiss the

soil!



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have the rare distinction. You know. I

often meet great statesmen, my



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 438</b></font><br><br>



privilege, who told me wondrous tales before  I  went

to  China. Of course, a lot of it was true, It  is  a

marvellous society compared to what it was. But  when

we  were little boys we used to do that sort of thing

(indicating). <i>"Ai cho peng yu ma?"</i> ()  - "Want  to  be friends?" Choose which one? <i>"Ch'ia  seh

sin   chia  poh."</i>()  -  "This   is

Singapore."  Any time, every time, you can  damn  the

Prime  Minister and so long as it is not a lie and  a

criminal lie, nothing happens to you. You can  say  a

lot of things. You can write books about him, damning

him. So long as it is not a libel, go ahead.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell you, I have the rare distinction of having

two  Ministerial  colleagues  who  have  brothers  in

China.  I have a perception and I think they  have  a

perception  (they have been there) of China  and  the

great sacrifices they are making to turn China into a

modern  industrial state by the end of this  century.

To  anybody who wants to go, I say I will give him  a

first-class  trip by SIA with all  the  best  of  in-flight  service. Entry point Hong Kong, if you  like,

take  the train: or Tokyo, and take another aircraft.

SIA  does not yet go to Peking, but one day  we  will

when  we  establish relations. And  I  am  absolutely

certain  that,  this can be done, given  appreciation

that   we  share  a  common  destiny.  Without   that

appreciation, of course, we are in trouble.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Mr Speaker, Sir, may I pose the real basic

problem facing Singapore, and indeed the world -  the

answer to communism and its spread. Here in Southeast

Asia,  it  is  by  insurgency, subversion,  input  of

ideology, infusion of weapons and insurgency.  If  we

just  take Singapore alone, we would have solved  the

problem,  But  we know that it has not  been  solved,

because it is not just Singapore, They say "Malaya" - Malayan Communist Party

- including Singapore. <i>Bao kuo xinjiapo zai nei</i>().



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the answer? The answer of the West - this

was  the  answer of Europe and America of the  Dulles

era  - was that if you are not anti-communist, it  is

immoral. And

Dulles said the Indians were non-aligned and



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 439</b></font><br><br>



so  they  were  immoral. How do  they  prevent  their

people  from going communist? Their counter  ideology

was then anti-communism. And in America a witch-hunt.

the  McCarthy  era. If you are a communist,  you  are

out. So if you want to be a naturalised American, you

swear  that  you  have never been  a  member  of  the

communist  party at all, ever in your  life.  But  in

Britain  - and they used to tell me with great  pride

and  I listened to them and I almost believed them  - they  said,  "All  you have got to do  really  is  to

develop. Then you would be like us, where we can have

communists running around and they cannot  cause  any

trouble. You see, they have got no followers  because

we  give  the  good life to the people. So  they  are

treated as cranks, idiots, half-wits." Those were the

1940s  when I was a student. Then came the  1950s

when I was a politician and a member of the Singapore

Government All -Party Delegation. The government then

was a very weak one, not independent, and used to  go

to London every year to negotiate a new constitution.

And  I  met my old friends. They said. "Yes, that  is

the   way."   Morgan  Phillips,  now  dead,   general

secretary  of the British Labour Party, said,  "Don't

worry  at  all.  The Communists are cranks.  Look  at

them,  at  every election they lose." The  TUC  said,

"Ah, no  problem at all. Just a few  cranks."  Their

counter  was materialism. "I give you the good  life"

which means "With one-man one-vote I seduce you  away

from  the  ideology by the good soft  life."  Did  it

work?  I  do  not think it has worked, The Communists

have  now  got into powerful positions in the  unions

because they work harder, To be a communist, you must

have very active glands. If you want a good life, you

go  into  the city and make money like Slater Walker.

Or  you  do  it the honest hard way - be a doctor  on

National  Health,  or a dentist on  National  Health.

This  is  also a good way. Or if you have really  got

active  glands, you think the, society is wrong,  you

are  deprived, you never went through a  good  school

that  taught  you  to speak English like  an  English

gentleman, but you spoke English like a working class

person  whose home was poor, then with active  glands

you work like a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 440</b></font><br><br>



beaver,   because   your  glands  are   pouring   out

adrenalin.  So  now  they  are  in  charge  of   very

powerful, critical unions, and they are setting  the

pace. They are calling the shots.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened here in the `40s, `50s and `60s? I

think we have very happy memories of the Middle  Road

unions  - <i>ge ye? eh? fan xing? ge ye, hen huo puo  de</i>

(). Every day they ate

there  and they slept there. They showed the  workers

how  hard working they were. They denigrated me. They

said  I had an air-conditioned office and I slept  in

an  air-conditioned room. I was a bourgeois. So  were

all  my friends, bourgeois men, They thought we  were

chicken.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We learnt how they operated. It is the same modus

operandi.  They  are active. They  are  working  with

social democrats or democratic socialists. The social

democrat likes his glass of beer, likes to have  fun.

so  he  leaves the meeting early. When all the  chaps

have  left,  they take the vote at 2 o'clock  in  the

morning and carry the union.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in the PAP, we used to squat till 3 or 4 o'clock

am, and in this Parliament. For those who were  then

not  here,  we  used to have marathon  sessions  that

began at 2 o'clock p.m. and ended up the next morning

at  7  o'clock. On one memorable occasion, the failed

candidate   for   Rochore  made  a  7 1/2-hour   speech.

Marvellous.  He  had ghost writers there,  scribbling

away. As he finished a whole sheaf, more sheaves came

in.  7 1/2  hours - to intimidate us. They made  a  very

grave  error of judgement. He gambled, and  he  is  a

great  gambler,  and  he lost.  We  learnt  how  they

operated.  We knew how the magician worked.  We  were

not  in  the audience. We were actually at  the  back

stage,  watching the magician and, in  fact,  helping

him  from  time to time. He said, "You hold this  hat

for me." So we held the hat and looked inside and saw

a  hole:  it had a false bottom from where he  pulled

the  rabbit.  So  we said. "Ah, so  that's  it.  Very

clever."  <i>hen cong ming. Ji qiao xiang  dang  Ii  hai</i>

{) - very clever. The

tricks are quite skilful, So when it came to our turn

and they wanted to operate on us, we



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 441</b></font><br><br>



said,  "Ah, yes." We were not there when they  pulled

the  trigger.  We were somewhere else. And  what  was

more  important, we never gave hostages  to  fortune.

Keep your hands clean, Gentlemen. If we allow you  to

put  your  hand in anybody's till, then  we  are  all

dead, politically. That is the first lesson.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why it was with great sorrow that we had to

prosecute Mr Wee Toon Boon. I had no choice.  He  was

my  friend. He was my comrade, going back to 1957  in

the  City Council elections. He fought the communists

with  us. But as Singapore developed, and with  rapid

development, people got rich quickly. His CCC  member

was  a  contractor, building the people all sorts  of

buildings. He lent him Mercedes cars. You start  off,

first, by lending the man, "Any time you like to  use

my  car,  it is there. Why sit in a Ford? You  are  a

Minister."  But Ministers use cars only  on  official

functions  from the pool. He said, "Use my Mercedes."

It  started  off  that  way. Then  your  appetite  is

whetted.  Then  step by step you  are  seduced  until

finally,  why not ...? Once you have given a  hostage

to  fortune,  it  is finished. So please,  Gentlemen,

learn  this.  There are many more  lessons  which,  I

hope,  I will have the pleasure of imparting in time,

by  which I mean, in time before you are put  to  the

test. That is really the crunch.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some other debating points. The Member for

Nee  Soon  said, we rush through Bills in the  House,

and  so on. We have had an impeccable record. In  the

Third  Parliament  from 12.10.72 to  24.11.76,  there

were  only five Certificates of Urgency. It is a good

debating point, that we rushed through the House, all

three  Readings, without adequate time for study  and

debate. A common occurrence? Five times in 4 1/2  years,

and  every  one  of  them was very urgent,  technical

ones. Do better next time.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somebody else wanted the Parliamentary Pensions Act

to be amended because, quite rightly, we all feel

very sad. I think the Member for Nee Soon also said,

".., the Parliamentary Pensions Act (should be

amended) to see whether our late MP is due for any

entitlement under this Act." We all feel and, I feel,

I have lost a good friend. But



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 442</b></font><br><br>



we  cannot.  We can pass it, but it would  be  wrong.

Because the next step is that the civil servant  will

say,  "Me  too."  What is your answer?  What  is  our

answer?   Yes,  for  me,  69  heroes  of   Singapore,

defenders  of  freedom, but not for you, the  60,000

civil  servants, plus the statutory boards,  100,000-plus  people? We have to pay all the widows? The  law

says,  and  we  follow the law, that if  a  man  dies

before he has retired, although he has qualified  for

a  pension,  his dependants get one full  year's  pay

without  paying estate duty or income  tax.  That  we

shall do. And the rest is up to you and me. And I  am

glad  to  say that quite a few have written  to  give

more  than I have suggested. I am quite prepared  for

some  shocks. Some may write in and say. "Please  can

I,  in view of the harsh circumstances I am in,  give

less  than what you have suggested?". Well,  that  is

our  responsibility. We discharge it. And in  1980/81

we can face the people.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two other matters - PUB bills, PUB tax surcharge.

The    Minister   for   National   Development    and

Communications  is  Chairman of  the  PUB  and  quite

rightly  passes the buck to the Minister for Finance.

He  is right. I Interruption! Yes, all right. That is

fair. Mr Lim Kim San, his shoulders are broad enough.

He  will take anything. He does not run from a scrap.

I say yes, an adjustment will have to be made. We all

know  that  this was a campaign issue,  and  probably

cost  us some votes. All right, the price of  oil  is

going   up,   and  adjustments  have  to   be   made.

Electricity bills will have to go up because the cost

of  oil  has gone up. We will adjust it so  that  all

those who live right up to the point-block flats will

be  out of the tax range. We are working it out. That

is for electricity.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for water, it is a different problem. In the case

of water, it is not money that we want. We want to

inculcate thrift in the use of water. It becomes a

habit. We get a drought that lasts like the one in

1963 when we went to elections - it lasted six to

seven months - and we were in deep trouble. Then 80%

of Singapore were living in houses without the water-closet. And we were having to switch off the water

mains without causing trouble. But now if you switch

off the



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 443</b></font><br><br>



water  mains,  and  we  are all on  the  water-closet

system,  I  ask  you, "What will you  do?"  We  tried

industrial  water when Mr Ngeow Pack Hua, the  Member

for  Boon Lay went canvassing, there were complaints.

Why?  Metal parts rust and corrode because industrial

water  has  a  high content of salt.  <i>dui  bu  dui</i>(Is it not right?)



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know the Singaporean. He is a hardworking,

industrious, rugged individual, Or we would not  have

made the grade. But let us also recognise that he  is

champion  grumbler.  That is  why  you  see  all  the

University  sociologists go round the  Housing  Board

flats  asking.  "Do you like the government?  Do  you

like  to  live  here?" Of course, they pour  out  all

their  woes and all their grouses. Sure win  for  the

opposition.  Well, the Barisan Sosialis contested  in

five constituencies. They had all their candidates in

five  constituencies like Toa Payoh to test,  because

they  know  that  is  the new  Singapore.  The  attap

kampong  will  be  over.  No  place  to  hide   guns,

grenades.   And   every  block  will  have   national

servicemen, police, army, vigilante corps  and  Block

committees, loyal to the people of Singapore.  Never

mind whether they vote opposition or vote PAP.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But once the price of water is not graded in blocks,

and people start using water lavishly then when there

is  a  drought, Gentlemen, you tell me how do you  go

and  get  a  bucket  of water - Affluent  water  (not

"effluent" spelt with an `e' but "affluent"  with  an

`a')  -  there is a ban. We speak Singapore  English.

When  we  water our gardens, we do not  use  effluent

water  but affluent water. When I read this,  I  say,

"God  bless my soul". Only in Singapore,  see!  If  I

were  a newspaper man, I could write quite an article

about Singapore: what an affluent society, even their

water,  in  times of drought! The flowers and  shrubs

are  kept  alive with affluent water! This  and  many

other things.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want the income tax reliefs to be increased. Why

not? But let me tell you the impact. The argument  is

sound:  yes, it was fixed 30 years ago. Yes, I  think

the Member



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 444</b></font><br><br>



for  Thomson made the point. <i>shi bu shi</i>? (Isn't

it?)



<br><br><!-- Mr Ang Nam Piau -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr Ang Nam Piau (Thomson):</b> <i>Shi</i> (Yes).



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Quite right. The cost of living

30  years  ago,  <i>er shi, san shi nien  qien</i>  ( -

twenty, thirty years ago). I  have  got  the

figures which show how much the base will shrink  by.

You have got to cut for everybody. So the chap at the

top  immediately gets the benefit, and  all  the  way

down.  And  I  think the broader the  base  the  more

people pay income tax, the less they are in favour of

things  for  free.  I  am anticipating  Minister  for

Finance's speech on the 4th of March. I have just had

to  read  it.  41% of revenue is going to  come  from

income  tax.  You want to cut it down to  35%?  Fine.

Where  do  we find the 6%? Any suggestions?  And  you

know  that  is the most unfair tax. Why do they  look

for   MPs, those  people  wanting  hawker  licences?

Because you can make $3,000 a month if you are a good

kuay  teow  man  and no income tax. Is  it  not?  Car

parks, nobody pays income tax. So we have got to look

around and see, "Ah, he has got a Mercedes Benz and a

house." Then we catch him. But he is clever. He  puts

it in his cousin's name, and so on, so that we do not

get him. You want to impose an unfair tax on the wage

earner  who cannot dodge the tax? But the Singaporean

is  a champion tax dodger. He is a champion grumbler.

He  is  a champion tax dodger. Hawking is one.  There

are  many others. I hate to say this, but I think the

medical  profession is a very lucrative one,  present

Members  excepting. Mr Speaker, Sir, everybody  knows

that  when you go and see a private doctor,  he  will

give  you  a  jab for anything between  $5  and  $10.

depending on whether he adds vitamins or no vitamins,

and you do not get a receipt for it. Boh su yiau, lah

(  - no need, la). So you are taxing the  honest

and making the dishonest wealthier.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The real tax policy for us as a developing country

is  a tax on expenditure. Yes, value added, which  is

the way the European Community does it. Their biggest

tax comes from value added tax. The more you spend,



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 445</b></font><br><br>



the  more  money you have, the better  the  life  you

lead,  the  more  you can afford  to  pay  for  other

people's children's education, good health. But here,

the  higher the income tax, by cutting the  base  you

put  the burden on a small group, the more unjust  it

becomes.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Member for Thomson is a wage earner. I

sympathise  with him, So am I, cannot  dodge  it.  He

cannot.  But  if I am a contractor I can  build  your

house. We are friends, so I will build your house.  I

will  charge you one-tenth the price, or maybe  free.

You  sell  me the fridge cheap, and maybe furnish  my

house for me, since you make furniture, So Income Tax

has  a  transaction in which no money was passed.  We

know  that. I practised the law for 10 years  and  my

job  - I am sorry to say - involved getting dishonest

people to avoid paying their taxes. And often (I  say

this  without  wanting  to be immodest)  successfully

because the Government lawyer, on a fixed salary,  is

not  as  good as the private lawyer with a very  high

incentive.  If  a man has got to pay half  a  million

dollars  in tax, he is prepared to give me  at  least

10% if I get him off. If I take less than 10%, I am a

fool,  am  I  not? Can the Government  also  pay  its

lawyers  10%  on  the  1/2-million  dollars?   So   the

Government is always landed with the less sharp legal

mind.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is not that we pass too many Bills. It

is  that  there are no good draftsmen, and it worries

me  because laws have to be passed. I do not want  to

be  my own lawyer, but when I flip through it, I know

that  certain  basic  draftsmanship  laws  are  being

breached. But who is to do it? Nobody who has four As

in the HSC takes law. There is engineering, medicine,

you  name it. But law, what for? You are playing with

words.  So  we  know  from the point  of  entry,  the

University  Entrance, just what the level of  ability

is. And at. 18-plus, if that is your level, you might

work  hard and improve. But it is very unlikely  that

you will have that sharp razor edge. So that is a big

problem.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will sort out all the other problems. But one

major  and  decisive problem is how  do  we  produce,

before  the  crunch comes, a group of  men  who  will

survive the crunch.



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 446</b></font><br><br>



The  last  time,  in  1959, very fortunately, if  my

memory  is right, we won 43 out of 51 seats. In  1961

when  the crunch came and they thought the other side

was  winning,  it  became  26-25.  It  was  quite  an

experience, and  of  course the British  were  quite

worried too. So they said, "Look, keep the communists

out at all costs. Have an alliance with - never mind,

whether  they are corrupt or not - the Labour  Front.

Socialists, whatever it was. Have an  alliance  with

them."  If  we had, we would have died. Finally, one

died  -  Ahmad Ibrahim. Another good man. He died  in

1962. It became 25-25.  If  Singapore  wants excitement,  that  is  real

excitement.  That is real drama and a  real  test  of

nerves. And we had to bring in a sick Member here  to

vote at all odd hours of the day and night. From mid-1962, when Ahmad Ibrahim died, till September 1  963,

over  one year, it was a test of nerves. So  we  knew

what  the  melting  point  was, at  what  degree  of

temperature. It was a process of elimination.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the Gentlemen of that generation, there are

only  ten left in this House. Of the 1955 generation.

when  I was sitting in the Opposition debating  with,

first,  Mr David Marshall, and then Mr Lim Yew  Hock,

there   were  four  of  us  -  three  PAP   and   one

Independent. Ahmad Ibrahim is dead. Goh Chew Chua  is

dead.  Lim  Chin Siong is in Britain, I  hope  living

comfortably  and  happily. He  also  made  the  wrong

choice, but at least he was courageous enough to say,

"Well, I call it quits." And I respect him. I am  the

sole survivor of the 1955 generation.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are nine others from 1959. Harrowing days they

were! Let me read their names. I go back to 1955.  Mr

Chan  Chee Seng (Jalan Besar) 1959. Mr Chor Yeok  Eng

(Bukit Timah) 1959. He will bear witness that Barisan

went  to look for him in the middle of the night.  He

lived in Bukit Timah in a lonely place, and they were

going  to fix him. If he crossed over, then it  would

become  25-26. If I had to go to battle and I had  to

choose  one  other,  I will pick him.[Applause.]  Goh

Keng  Swee,  Lee  Khoon  Choy,  Ong  Pang  Boon,   S.

Rajaratnam, Toh Chin Chye, Haji Ya'acob and Yong Nyuk

Lin. I am not a



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 447</b></font><br><br>



Muslim.  I  do  not know where Haji Ya'acob  got  his

strength  from, maybe from Islam. But if I  am  in  a

tight  corner  I  think I would  like  to  have  Haji

Ya'acob  around because together we had gone  through

some  very tough times. [Applause] The real test  was

when there were race clashes and the police were  not

in  our  hands from 1963 to 1965. It was so easy  for

the  Malays just to flip over and fix Ya'acob. He was

offered a vast sum of money. Berapa ban yak?



<br><br><!-- Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed (Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Minister of State, Prime Minister's Office (Haji Ya'acob Bin Mohamed):</b> Ten years' salary and

allowances.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Ten years' salary and allowances

just  to  switch over. You can buy, you can fix,  you

can threaten, you can do all kinds of things. We have

gone through all that.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I give you the 1963 generation that went to the

elections with us, not knowing whether we were  going

to  get  hammered or not. The communists were running

around.  Rahim Ishak, E. W. Barker, Fong Sip Chee,  P.

Govindaswamy - may I pause here? Congratulations!  He

made  Mr  David Marshall lose his deposit  in  Anson.

[Applause.]  When  the  communists  backed  Mr  David

Marshall in the by-election in 1962, Mr Marshall won.

When  the communists fielded their own candidate,  Mr

Marshall lost his deposit. You beat Barisan, We  want

to  make sure that we have got men like him. Ho Cheng

Choon,  Ho  See  Beng, Jek Yeun  Thong,  who  was  my

Political  Secretary in 1959. I am glad that  I  lost

only my Parliamentary Secretary, and not my Political

Secretary.  My Parliamentary Secretary, whom  Mr  Jek

had  guaranteed  had  given  up  communism, suddenly

walked  over to the other side. I woke up one morning

to  find he was anti-Malaysia, anti-Merger. You know.

this  was  a  very deep conspiracy. Jek  (I  give  no

secrets away) was the leader of the cell under  which

Chan  Sun  Wing, my former Parliamentary  Secretary.

was.  But  Jek did not know that his former  superior

turned up and told Chan Sun Wing to switch. So  Jek's

order was countermanded. Chan Sun Wing



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 448</b></font><br><br>



thought  that  the other side was going  to  win,  so

better  take the other side's orders. God bless  Chan

Sun  Wing.  I hope, if he is alive somewhere  in  the

Rhio  Islands or in Indonesia or some place, that  he

is  living peacefully and happily because if he comes

back  the  police  would  like  to  ask  him  a   few

questions.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1963 - Lim Kim San. Ng Kah Ting (Punggol), my

congratulations. We did not expect to win. The Member

was  then 23, a very young man. He probably also  did

not  expect to win, but fought and won. Ng Yeow Chong

- I am sorry to say, Mr Speaker, Sir, he has not been

able  yet  to  attend  our  Sittings  because  he  is

receiving  treatment in hospital for his eye.  Othman

Wok  and  Rahmat Kenap. I pause there and say  -  <i>Ta'

nampak  songkok awak</i>. It is hidden by the microphone.

Yes, he has not got a Ph.D. He has not even got a BA.

I  go further here. Ada School Certificate? Ada Sijil

"O" level?



<br><br><!-- Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Haji Rahmat Bin Kenap (Geylang Serai):</b> <i>Ta`ada</i>.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> <i>Ta'ada</i>. But I tell you what he

has  got:  courage, loyalty and steadfastness  in  a

crisis. After the riots in Geylang Serai, it was like

that,  each time I went down to face the mob. It  was

easier for me but tougher for him because he was then

treated  as  a traitor, kafir. In fact, in  the  last

elections he was nearly called a kafir. For those who

are  not  familiar with this word or phrase, that  is

the worst thing you can call a Muslim - an infidel He

is  a  good  Haji.  This time he survived  the  smear

because he had learned, without a School Certificate,

what is required of an MP.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sia Kah Hui, Teong Eng Siong - 1963 generation: 24

out  of 69 - just one over one-third. If we can  pass

to  you, the other two-thirds, an idea of what it was

like,  then  maybe we will be all  right.  I  am  not

saying  that you (the two-thirds) are not all  right.

All I am saying is that: you would not know until the

guns  open  fire. You can put soldiers through,  what

they  call, the fireworks -where they know that  they

are  firing blanks and thunder flashes, and there  is

so much smoke and so on. But when an army goes in



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 449</b></font><br><br>



like  the  American army landing in North  Africa  in

1943 for the first time, they got really slaughtered.

It was only after that first shock that they got over

the  combat  shock,  and  became  warriors.  You  can

simulate it but it is not the same. When he knows  it

is  a  real live bullet, because it goes zing and  is

meant  for  him, that is the time when you know  -you

look at his pants and you know whether he is a man or

he is not.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we have the 1966 generation - the by-elections

when  Barisan Sosialis walked out. Ho Kah Leong,  Lim

Guan  Hoo.  He went to fight Bukit Merah,  which  was

first won by Barisan. Well, he won. But we shall miss

him.  I hope he can recover but the chances are  very

slender,  and  his  wife  and  family  are  facing  a

tremendous  ordeal. Mr Tang See Chim,  Dr  Yeoh  Ghim

Seng.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the 1967 generation. Mr Ang Nam Piau, Mr P.

Selvadurai. I think the 1967 generation is not  quite

the  same, because then they knew they were  winners.

In  1966, maybe we could still have lost But in  1963

when  we  fought we knew that we could not only  lose

our pants, but we could lose our lives. And those who

were  at  the counting centres at Bukit Timah, where

they  lost -Mr K.C. Lee for Bukit Panjang and Mr Chor

Yeok Eng for Bukit Timah - if we had lost and Barisan

had  won.  I  think they would have come out  of  the

counting  centre  pretty bashed up. Oompah!  Merdeka!

Oompah! Merdeka! and the crowds were there They  have

the technique, and I admire this.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, in 1957 when I was at the Vatican, St.

Peter's, the first time the Pope was being televised,

as  he came out from the aisle, my God. I watched it.

Having  watched the communists. I know  some  of  the

modus  operandi  of this, the mass reaction.  As  the

Pope  came down carried on this palanquin, the  crowd

lifted  their arms and said, "Viva il Papa,  Viva  il

Papa." I said. "Boy, this is strange." I hope this is

not  blasphemy.  I  have got seven  Catholic  Members

here.  I  am  on their side. I said. "Where  are  the

cheer leaders?" I looked around and there, up on  the

walls,  the  pillars, were choir boys.  As  the  Pope

passed the choir boys said, "Viva il



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 450.</b></font><br><br>



Papa, Viva il Papa" and the nuns below said "Viva il

Papa"  and the crowd went "Viva il Papa". Two thousand

years of sound, tried and tested techniques, and,  of

course, we know a lot more.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see when one opposition leader went to

Fullerton  Square and said, "We want to be heard".  I

said  it  is kindergarten stuff. If we had wanted  to

intimidate  the opposition we would have  carried  on

with our Party conference on 12th December. Let us be

frank, we called off our Party conference slated  for

December the 12th. 13th was Nomination day. We  said,

"No.  We  would  intimidate the opposition.  That  is

bad."  We  could  have packed that meeting.  We  were

going to win, We had the organisation. We could  have

scared  the opposition. They did not have to  believe

me. We knew that the Western press wanted them to win

and  would say, "Well, the PAP demonstrated. They had

a  huge  crowd  of 50,000 and intimidated  them."  We

said, "No, cancel it." We won. We won because we gave

no hostages to fortune. We governed fairly, honestly,

and justly.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, one last word of advice, if you like to call

it, or just plain fact. If you want to be popular, do

not   try   to  be  popular  all  the  time.  Popular

government  does not mean that you do popular  things

all the time. We do not want to be unpopular or to do

unpopular  things. But when they are necessary, they

will be done. Popular representative government means

that within each five-year period, your policies have

demonstrably worked and won popular support  That  is

what it means And if we flinch from the unpopular, we

are  in  deep trouble. Of course, the Area  Licensing

Scheme  was  unpopular.  Of course, car  taxes  were

unpopular.  But. Gentlemen, which would you  have?  A

jammed-up Singapore with car owners exasperated, bus

passengers  exasperated,  or  20,000  to  30,000  car

owners  having to lay up their cars and  hundreds  of

thousands  going through in buses or in shared  cars?

We  made  that decision, and it was right. Of course.

if we had an election period, like the New Zealanders

and the Australians have, for three years instead  of

five years, that is more



<br><br><font size="1"><b>Column: 451</b></font><br><br>



difficult. But Sir Robert Menzies, in spite of three-year  periods, won and stayed in office for 12 years.

But  he  knew that popular representative  government

means  that sometimes even when 51% (he once told  me

up  till  55%)  are  against you,  if  it  is  right,

proceed. When it works out all right, they will swing

back.  But if you flinch, then that 55% becomes  65%,

and you are out.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave you with a final rider. This is psephology.

All of you are pressing to do popular things and, of

course, it is right - more and better homes, more  and

better  amenities. But let me pose you  this  problem

and  you think it out. I am not going to give you the

answer.  I  am not going to tell anybody the  answer.

Take  two similar constituencies, both Housing  Board

estates. One is Marine Parade and the other is  Buona

Vista.  I  have got the figures here.  Both  are  new

constituencies. Marine Parade has no one-room  flats.

Buona Vista - I think Dr Ang Kok Peng can tell  us  - has  got  1,300  one-room flats. (I am speaking  from

memory.  My  papers are in a jumble but I  will  find

them.)  The Member for Buona Vista won 80.65% of  the

votes. The Member for Marine Parade, with the mostest

five-room  flats,  with the mostest four-room  flats.

with   no  one-room  flats,  got  76%.  Right?   Now.

Gentlemen, you are to succeed us. At least I hope you

do,  otherwise you should not be here.  Tell  me  the

answer.   Both   were   new  MPs.   Both   were   new

constituencies.  Is it because Dr Ang  Kok  Peng  was

better known after being in Crawford?



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Next to Queenstown.



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> No, next to Ulu Pandan. Part of

Ulu  Pandan. Is it because the Member for Ulu  Pandan

looked after it better than the Member for Joo Chiat?

Both  faced candidates who were unknown. Can somebody

solve  it?  The team who can sit down and solve  that

riddle  has got one of the qualifications to  succeed

us Only one of the qualifications - solve it. I think

I  know, and I will tell only a few people. I do  not

wrong.  They  write  all  kinds  of  spurious   silly

articles or books. They get MA's and Ph.D's for them.

I  read  them  and I know them to be wrong.  I  laugh

away.  But  I  never tell them why  they  are  wrong.

Because I am an Asian. I am not a Westerner. This  is

an  Asian  situation, and do not be clever. Why  show

them  how clever we are. Be modest. Just keep  quiet.

If  they  want to be wrong headed, wish them luck.  I

must  apologise, Mr Speaker, Sir, because  my  papers

must have got stuck. But I promise to get the figures

published. The facts are there. I am publishing known

facts.  `How  many five-room point-blocks?  How  many

four-room  blocks?  How many one-room, two-room  and

three-room  blocks? And on all counts, and  at  every

stage,  the  Member for Marine Parade had the  better

constituency.  By the seaside, you  get  sea  breeze.

What'  more can you ask for? Higher income. Those  of

you who do not get from the Minister for Finance your

swimming pool or your sports stadium, take heart.  Do

not  worry.  That is not the magic. The  magic  is  a

combination of factors which go more than just beyond

income and creature comforts and a good home.  But  I

will  lay my bottom dollar - I am not a betting  man,

as  a rule. I never buy the Toto. I never buy the Big

Sweep.



<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. Member:</b> Why?



<br><br><!-- Mr Lee Kuan Yew (The Prime Minister) -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Prime Minister:</b> Because the first lesson I

learnt in mathematics was the law of chances.  If  we

each  buy one ticket, one in 10 gets a chance to  win

$10.  But  if we each buy, one ticket and the  winner

gets  $7.  I  say,  "No. Count me out."  Because  the

Government takes 30% as tax. Why should I buy? It  is

silly.  But there are silly people. So we  cater  for

them.  But I will bet one bottom dollar that  in  the

next  elections  in  1980/81, the Member  for  Marine

Parade,  given  six to eight per cent growth  between

now  and  1980/81, will improve his margin. Not  only

because he will get a playing field after the  school

is  built, but because he would have learnt  part  of

the  formula.  And, Gentlemen, when Western  educated

academics  want  to  visit your  constituencies,  say

"Please by all means".

But  if you ask my opinion, my advice to you is, let

them  find  out  the  old formula,  which  they  will

discover  long after we have gone on to new formulae.

That away, you will live long, happily in office, and

in  retirement, with a government ticking  to  ensure

that  you  enjoy your pension. And the way  to  enjoy

your  pension is to ensure good, stable,  fair, just

government  which commands the trust and  respect  of

the  people. No more, no less. Singaporeans have been

accustomed to high standards of effective government.

They deserve nothing but the best. And it is our

duty to ensure that they continue to receive the

best. Thank you, Mr Speaker, Sir. [Applause]
